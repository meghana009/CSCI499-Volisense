monrovia falling in line with the international monetary fund s rigid supervision and monitoring program can be a blessing and a curse running out of options and racing against time in the run up to a protest dubbed save the state planned for friday june 7 president george manneh weah s government gave his first major policy address wednesday to declare his administration s embrace of an imf program tailor made for liberia analysis by rodney d sieh weah said such a program will help us to take the needed steps to stabilize our economy restore confidence in our currency and offer technical assistance to continue social services the president said wednesday the imf supervision is coming just a few years after liberia graduated from the hipc program debt forgiveness and restructuring program that was supposed to have improved governance achieved macroeconomic stability and reduced poverty the imf supervision also coming after liberia announced the end of governance economic and management assistance program gemap an international governance program headed the international contact group on liberia the gemap was also supposed to improve governance and fight corruption by ring fencing liberia s revenue the gemap declared its purpose to ensure that all liberian revenues will be available for the benefit of all liberian people to ensure that the liberian government will have the appropriate fiscal instruments to capture the revenue required for the development of the country and to strengthen liberian institutions so that they can take responsibility for reversing decades of deficiencies in economic and financial management the ntgl and its partners have concluded that immediate remedial action is needed liberia history is replete with imf world and other international interventions but the nation was ranked third poorest by forbes magazine and ranked near the bottom of the undp human development index hipc wiped nearly 4 8 billion in debt and arrest arrears in 2010 when hipc was declared a success but the former administration left a debt stock 1 billion or more combined with massive printing of liberian dollars and declining foreign reserve liberia has witnessed an ever escalating interest rates and deteriorating exchange rate between us dollars and liberia which stands at 1 to 190 ld imf embrace a departure from earlier stance president weah acknowledged that an imf program requires greater discipline across government budgets we will be introducing salary caps for government workers and asking our legislators to share the burden as well we will review performance and revenues from our state owned enterprises ensuring that leakages or inefficiencies do not undercut the ability of government to support its people in the early days after taking office when the administration found itself chasing questionable loans from little known and questionable firms like eton financial private limited and the conflict of interest ridden ebomaf the president and his aides took critics to task for raising red flags that such loan ventures were not in line with the imf and the world bank a few weeks ago ambassador christine elder the united states ambassador accredited to liberia brought the debate to the spotlight once more urging the weah administration to remain open to recommendations of the imf in order to pave the way for economic productivity and prosperity for liberia ambassador elder made the remarks at the 243rd independence day celebration the time is now to reverse corruption and its corrosive and contagious effects the time is now to strengthen an economy that provides opportunities in more sectors and where open and transparent competition rules the day i applaud you mr president for opening discussions with the international monetary fund regarding measures that could restore confidence in the economy and set the stage for growth ahead i hope that you the liberian government and the liberian people remain open to what the imf recommends so that liberia can lay the groundwork for future economic productivity and prosperity on wednesday the president finally obliged declaring that his administration will shortly be laying out a series of policy measures he says are intended to stabilize the economy in the short term and position it for growth in the medium to long term we are working with stakeholders on measures that are intended to bring down prices we are working to attract new investments in agriculture and we are working to improve our business climate to reduce the costs and hurdles of doing business in liberia we are privileged to have the support of the united nations the african union and ecowas as well as our other international partners who have invested in our future and who continue to offer the assistance and advice we need to improve our country we wish to assure our international development partners that we are committed to upholding the norms of good governance eyeing ghana rwanda senegal trail pointing to other african countries including ghana rwanda and senegal that have benefited from imf programs president weah appeared hopeful that liberia is capable of following suit former auditor general john morlu said wednesday that the process can be grueling and painful once a country is put under the program it could take decades to graduate ghana finally graduated in march 2019 after nearly twenty years while people in international circles do not want to admit because of the suffering and near instabilities of many african countries in the 1980s the imf program looks and walks like a structure adjustment program that can help countries but a greater short term pains the imf giving the tone of its last report is likely to push deep cuts in government spending tighter controls over governance of public corporations reduce corruption ensure strong financial sector which are all aimed are improve governance and macroeconomic stability unlike ghana and other countries who have survived imf rigid monitoring liberia is heavily dependent on the public sector with a strong and enduring patronage system analysts wondered how the government will reduce the wage bill without much suffering will be the greatest challenge to the government president nana akufo addo who ran on a campaign pledge to take ghana beyond aid when he ran two years ago has reduced budget deficits under his watch narrowed inflation lowered debt levels stabilized and economic growth is accelerating estimated at 5 6 percent for last year and 7 6 percent for 2019 bloomberg news quoted the ghanaian president in march as saying it s about a fundamental and basic matter all of us as ghanaians have to bear in mind and that is discipline in the management of our public finances you don t spend money that you don t have that is always the road to chaos today paul kagame s rwanda is winning praise for structural economic reforms but it too went through the program in the 1960s and 1970s rwanda s prudent financial policies coupled with generous external aid and relatively favorable terms of trade resulted in sustained growth in per capita income and low inflation rates however when world coffee prices fell sharply in the 1980s growth became erratic compared to an annual gdp growth rate of 6 5 from 1973 to 1980 growth slowed to an average of 2 9 a year from 1980 through 1985 and was stagnant from 1986 to 1990 the crisis peaked in 1990 when the first measures of an imf structural adjustment program were carried out while the program was not fully implemented before the war key measures such as two large devaluations and the removal of official prices were enacted the consequences on salaries and purchasing power were rapid and dramatic this crisis particularly affected the educated elite most of whom were employed in civil service or state owned enterprises during the 5 years of civil war that culminated in the 1994 genocide gdp declined in 3 out of 5 years posting a rapid decline at more than 40 in 1994 the year of the genocide the 9 increase in real gdp for 1995 the first postwar year signaled the resurgence of economic activity this year according to the imf rwanda s prudent management of its debt is registering notable progress in sustaining high and inclusive growth the imf says careful management of rwanda s debt is mainly attributed to the fact that the government has made to choose to keep a low risk of debt distress status as an anchor to its fiscal policy this has been achieved through a process of careful prioritization and selection of projects preliminary results of the debt sustainability analysis show that the risk of rwanda s debt remains low with a present value of debt to gdp reaching 32 9 against a threshold of 50 the share of concessional loans in the total debt stock stood at 63 as of end 2018 compared to a level of 57 4 as of end 2017 thanks to the country s debt strategy to maximize concessional borrowing in favor of commercial borrowing rwanda s economy has grown by 8 6 in 2018 driven by robust activities in all sectors of the economy at the same time inflation remained well below central bank s targeted inflation range of 2 8 reflecting ample food supplies and low inflationary pressures until the imf came in senegal was in the midst of a major economic crisis with the devaluation of the cfa franc the imf the world bank and other multilateral and creditors stepped in with support through structural and sectoral adjustment programs aimed at facilitating growth and development by reducing the role of government in the economy improving public sector management enhancing incentives for the private sector and reducing poverty in january 1994 senegal undertook a radical economic reform program at the behest of the international donor community beginning with a 50 devaluation of senegal s currency the cfa franc which was linked at a fixed rate to the french franc government price controls and subsidies have been steadily dismantled as another economic reform the currency devaluation had severe social consequences because most essential goods were imported overnight the price of goods such as milk rice fertilizer and machinery doubled as a result senegal suffered a large exodus with many of the most educated people and those who could afford it choosing to leave the country after an economic contraction of 2 1 in 1993 senegal made an important turnaround thanks to the reform program with a growth in gdp averaging over 5 annually during 1995 2004 annual inflation had been pushed down to the low single digits in january the imf delegation to dakar reported that senegal s macroeconomic situation was stable real gdp growth in 2017 was 7 2 percent and is projected to remain robust at 6 2 percent in 2018 while inflation remains low the fiscal deficit is projected to reach 3 5 percent of gdp in 2018 and the 2019 budget is in line with the waemu fiscal deficit convergence criterion of 3 percent of gdp in liberia the contrast to the three countries president weah pointed to wednesday remains glaring in the president s own words the economic challenge we face today has to do with the structure of our economy we have lost significant revenue from the fall in the prices of iron ore and rubber and several of our rubber farmers have lost their income and ability to spend in the economy liberia is no longer receiving the emergency aid that came in the years after war and large grants from our multilateral partners have also dried up the amount of remittances we receive from abroad in us dollars has also declined the president noted that the prevailing realities are complicating the nation s macroeconomic situation the sudden drop in us dollar inflows puts pressure on the economy and devalues the liberian dollar moving prices upward the macroeconomic policies we have today are policies tailored to the time that we had free inflows of united states dollars we are now changing these policies to reflect the economic realities of our time factors determine imf program s success morlu added honestly there is nothing imf is going to ask liberia to do that liberia should be doing on its own manage your debt don t spend more than you have and if you borrow ensure that you have the short medium and long term capacity to repay do not print money just to pay bills when your productive capacity is low to support the printing don t use your foreign reserve to give loans to business or pay salaries do not take donor money when it is for you and the obvious do not steal from the government by taking small bribes to give away 18 billion worth of natural resources to foreign interests pretty common sense things we do in our own lives or we should do in our own lives as this report went to press the us dollar exchange rate were hitting nearly 192 5 on average in most areas across the country while president weah acknowledged that he is aware of the difficulties and hardships that the rising exchange rate is causing liberians and the effect it is having on prices of all goods and commodities in the market many liberians are growing weary as the clock toward june 7th as ghana rwanda and senegal has seen the rigidness of the imf straight jacket program remains a challenge stephen r weissman a former us congressman who once served on the house of representatives subcommittee on africa said some years back that while structural adjustment in ghana and senegal have helped create an improved framework for economic growth the program is a fragile trend one that could be disrupted by bad weather adverse terms of trade and the vagaries of international assistance weissman argued the current version of adjustment however has produced little enduring poverty alleviation a weak performance on equity issues together with rising political expectations has generated threats to the sustainability of structural adjustment and overall political stability alternatively adjustment policies can be modified to fully incorporate equity and sustainability objectives in this respect it is critical for the poor to obtain more effective representation in decision making on adjustment through indigenous nongovernment organizations on paper and in his address wednesday president weah appeared ready to play by the rules of the international stakeholders our actions will involve reform of our large wage bill rationalizing government spending to put more resources to critical sectors like health education and agriculture improving the way government makes payments to government entities and vendors who supply the government with goods and services and some actions on domestic arrears that the government owes local vendors as a stimulus to the economy on the monetary front the president said his administration is taking actions to instill greater confidence in the central bank of liberia and the banking sector at large the integrity and independence of the central bank will be assured and protected under my administration and this resolve will be critical in the years ahead engulfed in sea of international concerns more importantly the president pledge that his administration will no longer borrow money from the central bank in this regard i wish to announce that the government of liberia under my leadership will no longer borrow from the central bank of liberia for its short term liquidity needs but the president provided no further guidance as to how it intends to manage its short term liquidity issues for monetary policy to work the president averred liberians must develop confidence in the banking sector and announced plans that his government would introduce measures to restore confidence in the local currency today most of the liberian dollars in our economy is outside the banking sector we are shortly going to announce new policy initiatives that should increase the confidence of liberians in the liberian dollar these polices will provide strong incentives for liberians to keep their money in the bank and for commercial banks to invest more in the liberian dollar economy new policies aside the weah led government remains engulfed under a sea of international concerns regarding the misdirection of millions of dollars in donor funding with key stakeholders demanding that those funds be put back into their coffers the aftermath and lingering effect of the missing billions saga and the us 25 million mop up money remain a daunting challenge for an administration finally looking to make amends for earlier missteps but how soon it recovers and how speedily those in the president s circle move to ease the burden brought on by a doze of bad governance and administrative lapses could prove decisive as president weah embraces a structural adjustment program that could take years to bear fruits a program that comes with severe short term pains

dividend has been declared for the year ended 31 march 2019 chairman s statement performance the company s net asset value nav total return for the year ended 31 march 2019 was 0 8 this was another disappointing result and compares with the benchmark ftse all share index s total return for the year of 6 4 the discount of the share price to the underlying net asset value also widened further during the year from 9 5 to 10 9 contributing to the share price total return being 1 8 this was the third year in succession that the company has underperformed its benchmark and that has further impacted longer term performance the five year total return on net assets is now 13 8 compared with the benchmark return of 34 5 the ten year nav return at 200 8 is still ahead of the benchmark return of 186 8 although the return based on the share price is slightly below at 183 4 notwithstanding the benchmark comparative this is not an insubstantial return the shortfall in the year s return relative to the ftse all share index was once again due in part to issues affecting certain individual holdings but the greater effect derived from the portfolio s exposure to uk domestic stocks in a year when the market s performance has come from stocks with international exposure your portfolio manager mark barnett provides further detail on the performance of the portfolio during the year and sets out his strategy and outlook for the coming year in his report on pages 8 to 11 your board is concerned about the performance of the portfolio and continues to constructively challenge the portfolio manager on his strategy having considered the responses to this challenge your board continues to support mark s consistent investment approach which we believe will in due course provide strong returns to shareholders as the latent value of the portfolio is realised whilst we have seen a fall in the nav of the company dividend income received has held up well this has enabled the company to raise dividends paid by 4 3 which is more than the rate of inflation without having to dip into reserves and the company is now recognised as a dividend hero by the aic through having increased ordinary dividends each year for the last 20 years more details on the dividend are set out below discount and share buybacks the board monitors the price at which the company s shares trade relative to their underlying net asset value during the period under review the company s shares have continued to trade at a discount level that is wider than its historical range the board consulted extensively with the manager and the company s corporate broker about this we remain of the view that the discount is principally a product of the company s relative performance against the wider market however given that share buy backs at a discount enhance net asset value per share for remaining holders we instituted a share buy back programme during the year to signal the board s concern and realise the discount on the shares bought back we continue to monitor the discount level closely and remain of the belief that performance will drive demand for the shares and narrow the discount in due time dividend for the year ended 31 march 2019 three interim dividends of 3 25p each were paid to shareholders in september and december 2018 and march 2019 the board has declared a fourth interim dividend of 4 75p per share for the year to be paid on 28 june 2019 to shareholders on the register on 7 june 2019 this gives a total dividend for the year of 14 50p per share representing an increase of 4 3 on the previous year excluding special dividends paid and a decrease of 1 4 if special dividends are included in view of a decline in special dividends received the board decided not to declare a special dividend this year 2018 0 80p per share notwithstanding the disappointing nav annual performance this extends again the company s record of year on year ordinary dividend

invaluable to the company the board unanimously recommends that shareholders support her election at the forthcoming agm a biographical summary is included on page 19 annual general meeting agm information on all resolutions to be put to a shareholder vote at the agm can be found in the directors report on pages 31 and 32 and this year this includes notes on particular strengths that each director brings to the board in accordance with the 2018 uk corporate governance code most of the resolutions are the same as last year but an additional item this year is that shareholders are again being provided with an advisory vote on the dividend policy this was last provided in 2017 when it was overwhelmingly supported by shareholders the only change is clarification with respect to special dividends the directors have carefully considered all the resolutions proposed in the notice of the agm as set out on pages 60 to 63 and in their opinion consider them all to be in the interests of shareholders as a whole the directors therefore recommend that shareholders vote in favour of each resolution i look forward to meeting with shareholders at the company s agm this year which will be held at invesco s west end office 43 45 portman square london w1h 6ly at 11 00am on 16 july 2019 the directors and the portfolio manager mark barnett will be available at the meeting to answer shareholders questions richard laing chairman 29 may 2019 strategic report for the year ended 31 march 2019 portfolio manager s report market review the uk equity market provided a mid single digit rise in the twelve months to 31 march 2019 a figure that masks periods of significant underlying volatility the uk equity market rallied strongly in the second quarter of 2018 but having peaked in may the ftse all share index sold off sharply in the second half of 2018 the principal causes of this change were the outlook for us interest rates heightened fears of a global economic slowdown and the escalation of us sino trade tensions against a backdrop of declining global equity markets the uk equity market fell to an eighteen month low in december 2018 however a shift in the stance on interest rate policy from the us federal reserve and a cooling of the previously negative trade rhetoric between the us and china laid the foundations for a strong equity market rally during the first quarter of 2019 this resulted in a positive uk equity market return for the period under review domestically the question of the uk s exit from the european union continued to dominate the agenda the extended political uncertainty saw the value of sterling fall materially through the year reaching a twenty month low of us 1 23 in december as a vote of no confidence against theresa may was called over the terms of the negotiated eu withdrawal agreement against this challenging backdrop the bank of england s boe monetary policy committee voted to increase the uk s base interest rate by 0 25 at its august 2018 meeting but kept rates on hold for the rest of the period as the political impasse continued in february 2019 the boe cut its uk growth forecast from 1 7 to 1 2 for the year despite this economic data proved remarkably robust in 2018 we saw a return to real wage growth whilst the number of people in work increased by 350 000 more than three times the increase in the size of the working age population portfolio review the company s net asset value including reinvested dividends delivered a return of 0 8 over the year under review compared with one of 6 4 total return by the ftse all share index the portfolio s principal themes see table below have remained broadly consistent over the past year the tilt towards uk domestic value opportunities has been emphasised as persistent negativity towards domestic sectors has created further investment opportunities meanwhile exposure to more internationally orientated growth stocks has been modestly reduced exposure to the tobacco sector remains prominent whilst a significant portion of the portfolio is invested in non correlated financials which offer diversified income generation potential outside of these core themes the balance of the portfolio is invested in a number of diverse stock specific opportunities key portfolio themes major positions include uk domestic value international growth opportunities tobacco non correlated financials legal general bp british american tobacco hiscox next royal dutch shell imperial brands burford capital derwent london novartis altria aj bell tesco roche provident financial newriver reit homeserve randall quilter aviva bae systems beazley bca marketplace easyjet lancashire bt g4s plus500 british land btg amigo drax 34 3 28 4 11 2 22 9 3 2 is invested in other stock specific opportunities source invesco as at 31 march 2019 total weight in the portfolio for each theme includes stocks not listed above the portfolio s exposure to uk domestic value opportunities provided a positive contribution to absolute performance over the period as stock selection proved crucial across a range of sectors contributors included the portfolio s holding in drax which outperformed the sector over the year its share price traded well for the majority of 2018 supported by rising wholesale power prices and performance improvements in the production of biomass electricity and rose sharply in october on news of a deal with iberdrola to buy the spanish energy firm s uk power generation plants full year results released in the first quarter of 2019 confirmed the completion of a 50 million share buyback programme and a 15 increase in the full year dividend other notable contributors included next which defied the well publicised crises facing many high street retailers to deliver full year results in line with expectations the 15 rise in online sales offset more challenging declines in in store retail sales emphasising that the company s multi channel offering allows it to see the growth of online shopping as an opportunity not a threat meanwhile the 4 5 increase in the annual dividend reaffirmed the company s focus on shareholder returns holdings in tesco legal general and bca marketplace further supported returns despite these contributions sterling weakness and prolonged political uncertainty saw the internationally orientated companies of the ftse all share index outperform domestically orientated companies stock selection within the theme of international growth further contributed to the portfolio s relative underperformance over the year the portfolio s zero weighting in the metals mining sector provided a negative contribution to relative returns as rio tinto and bhp billiton performed strongly mining companies have historically paid dividends from current earnings which are highly correlated to commodity prices given the consequential volatility underpinning earnings within the sector alternative areas of the market are considered to be better suited to the objectives of the portfolio elsewhere internationally orientated leisure companies faced some challenging trading conditions during the period the portfolio s positions in thomas cook and easyjet suffered as a result of rising oil prices an unusually hot summer across northern europe and the brexit impasse which impacted demand within the sector however the portfolio has a significant weighting in the oil gas sector namely in bp and royal dutch shell which performed well over the period bp provided the portfolio s second strongest contribution to absolute return releasing better than expected results for 2018 in february the sector s outlook depends on the ability of these companies to cover their cash flow and dividends unlike other commodity sectors this is reliant on capital discipline within the sector rather than price strength in the underlying commodity in absolute terms the portfolio s performance was supported by a number of international health care stocks as roche novartis btg and astrazeneca provided strong positive contributions roche and novartis traded strongly over the period whilst the share price of btg rose sharply in november as the company accepted an offer from us biopharmaceutical firm boston scientific the decision to sell the astrazeneca position mid way through 2018 after strong performance proved untimely and coupled with the non inclusion of glaxosmithkline in the portfolio affected returns relative to the index other notable contributors included homeserve the emergency home repairs and services provider released strong full year results in may 2018 which included a 25 increase in the company s dividend following a year of record profit growth the company s share price continued to trade positively supported by a positive trading update in july 2018 analyst upgrades and an acquisition the portfolio maintains a prominent exposure to tobacco with holdings in altria british american tobacco bat and imperial brands investments in the sector have delivered exceptional returns for shareholders over the long term however performance in 2018 was broadly weak as the market continued to weigh concerns around regulation and the outlook for next generation technologies when the united states food drug administration fda announced plans to pursue a ban on the sale of menthol products in november 2018 bat was the most notably impacted of all the uk listed tobacco majors due to its revenue exposure to menthol sales however the prospect of a total menthol ban remains doubtful given the requirement to evidence additional harm versus non menthol products furthermore the real impact of a ban remains uncertain as consumers may move to non menthol tobacco alternatives meanwhile the tobacco majors are at the forefront of new technologies with the resources to drive successful innovation in the sector in 2019 the sector has received some relief buoyed by the surprise resignation of the head of the fda and the release of strong full year results from bat which included meaningful growth in the dividend a further important area of investment within the portfolio is non correlated financials this theme remains significant and achieves the twin objectives of diversification of risk and income a number of investments within this theme provided very significant contributions to performance over the year the stand out return was provided by aj bell which successfully completed its initial public offering ipo in december listing for the first time on the london stock exchange i was extremely supportive of the ipo which saw significant gains realised for the portfolio the holding continued to trade well throughout the first quarter of 2019 providing further positive returns for the portfolio other notable contributors included litigation finance company burford capital which continued to support portfolio returns after posting very strong half and full year results for 2018 in december the company s share price was further supported by confirmation that it has secured an additional us 1 6 billion in new litigation investments whilst full year results released in march included a 14 increase in the full year dividend a consecutive year of double digit growth marwyn value investors lancashire and hiscox also provided a positive contribution to returns meanwhile the portfolio s significant underweight position in mainstream banks was a positive decision as the sector underperformed the overall market whilst overall stock selection within non correlated financials supported performance over the year some holdings provided negative returns a recently initiated position in the financial trading platform plus500 proved volatile the company has met with challenges in clearly explaining to the market the short term revenue volatility that can arise in trading of contracts for difference derivative instruments meanwhile amigo performed poorly following its ipo last summer as the market became concerned about increased regulatory scrutiny of guarantor lending provident financial also traded down over the period a result of the slower than expected pace of profit recovery under the new management team the portfolio s performance was also impacted by isolated stock challenges during the year detractors included scifluor an unlisted drug discovery company that uses fluorine chemistry to develop new therapeutics the value of this holding was written down ahead of the firm s next fundraising round to reflect potential delays in the phase ii trial of scifluor s leading candidate however the most notable detractor was motif bio a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company motif bio develops new antibiotics a sector supported by rising global resistance levels to existing antibiotics and global population growth motif bio s leading antibiotic iclaprim had been widely expected to receive approval from the fda in the first quarter of 2019 approval in this key market is a crucial step in monetising the company s research which in turn has the potential to unlock significant value in the company however in february the fda declined to authorise iclaprim citing the need for further investigation of the potential side effects this outcome surprised the market given the success of phase iii clinical trials that were designed following consultation with the fda and prompted a very sharp fall in motif bio s share price the company is meeting with the fda with results of this discussion expected in june 2019 whilst there is a reasonable prospect for a favourable outcome on balance risks associated with this binary outcome remain and the portfolio s position has been reduced pending greater clarity in terms of portfolio activity during the period new investments were made in burford capital randall quilter royal bank of scotland urban exposure aquis exchange cranswick draper esprit whitbread and amigo the portfolio s investments in astrazeneca relx and macau property opportunities were sold outlook patience is an essential characteristic of successful long term investing however over the past twelve months this quality has been severely tested as the uk stock market s sentiment has remained firmly rooted in momentum style investing supporting an ever increasing disparity between valuation and fundamentals this trend has been exacerbated by exogenous economic and political factors primarily the sustainability of global economic growth and the protracted brexit negotiations as a result of these persistent uncertainties the market has focused on supporting premium valuations for growth or highly disruptive companies which has not suited the core investment themes of this portfolio the valuation support for the uk stock market is strong in an historical context a dividend yield of 4 4 for the current year is four times higher than the 10 year gilt yield however valuations remain polarised between a basket of multi national companies which command high valuations and a basket of uk domestic equities which are valued significantly lower given this wide valuation disparity the portfolio has retained a large exposure to sterling revenues which are undervalued due to the persistent caution towards the uk economy as evidenced by the weakness of the exchange rate the performance of the uk economy continues to confound most forecasts by recording steady growth over the course of 2019 the overall level of growth is expected to remain solid supported by improvements in household cash flow and rising employment which will benefit consumption activity and economic growth given that the outlook for the economy appears to be more resilient than currently implied by the currency or valuations of domestic sectors it is anticipated that a level of clarity in domestic politics will see this material differential start to close the portfolio has also maintained exposure to a number of global industries namely oil and tobacco which despite yielding significantly higher than average dividends remain attractively valued in a market that seeks out new disruptive business models within the context of perceived sunset industries in many respects the stock market s current sentiment towards these industries resembles behaviour that was seen during the last tech bubble it would appear that the market is happy to discount a future decline in the cash flow from these businesses that is much more rapid than appears likely the portfolio s positioning has evolved over the past year to take advantage of the best risk adjusted opportunities at the most interesting valuations the portfolio continues to offer a sustainable flow of diversified dividend income with strong cashflow cover and good growth it is frustrating that the capital and income growth potential of the portfolio is not currently reflected in capital values however it remains crucial that in such times of extreme momentum and somewhat irrational market pricing the portfolio remains rooted in the fundamental investment process which has worked over many stock market cycles mark barnett portfolio manager 29 may 2019 business review perpetual income and growth investment trust plc is an investment company and its investment objective

company of ifml manages the company s investments and acts as company secretary under delegated authority from ifml references to the manager in this annual financial report should consequently be considered to include both entities the manager provides company secretarial marketing and general administration services including accounting and manages the portfolio in accordance with the board s strategy mark barnett is the portfolio manager responsible for the day to day management of the portfolio his associate martin walker deputises in the event of mr barnett s absence in addition to the management and administrative functions of the manager the company has contractual arrangements with link asset services to act as registrar and the bank of new york mellon international limited bnymil as depositary and custodian investment objective the company s investment objective is to provide shareholders with capital growth and real growth in dividends over the medium to longer term from a portfolio of securities listed mainly in the uk equity market investment policy the company invests mainly in uk equities and equity related securities of uk listed companies the manager seeks to identify and invest mainly in companies that offer a combination of good capital growth prospects with the ability to increase dividends over time market exposure may also be gained through the limited use of derivatives the purpose of which would be to achieve changes to the portfolio s economic exposure however the company will not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes the manager manages the portfolio to reflect its convictions and best ideas the manager does not set out to manage the risk characteristics of the portfolio relative to the ftse all share index benchmark index and the investment process may result in potentially very significant over or underweight positions in individual sectors versus the benchmark index if a security is not considered to be a good investment then the company will not own it irrespective of its weight in the benchmark index the manager controls the stock specific risk of individual securities by ensuring that the portfolio is always appropriately diversified in depth and continual analysis of the fundamentals of investee companies allows the manager to assess the financial risks associated with any particular security the directors believe that the use of borrowings can enhance returns to shareholders and the company will use borrowings in pursuing its investment objective the company may hedge exposure to changes in foreign currency rates in respect of its overseas investments at the manager s discretion investment limits the board has prescribed investment limits forming part of the investment policy the most significant of which follow not more than 12 of gross assets in any single investment not more than 15 of gross assets in other listed investment companies not more than 20 of gross assets in non uk listed securities not more than 10 of gross assets in fixed interest securities not more than 4 of gross assets in unquoted securities derivatives including warrants may be used for investment purposes to increase the company s market exposure by up to 5 of gross assets derivatives may also be used to hedge the portfolio s market exposure and borrowings may be used to raise exposure to securities up to a maximum of 25 of net assets where it is considered appropriate each limit is measured at the time of investment or borrowing borrowing borrowing policy is under the control of the board the board has set a maximum borrowing limit of 25 of total net assets measured at the time new borrowings are drawn the use of borrowing for investment is not an expression of confidence in the performance of the overall uk stock market but rather an endorsement of the potential for the securities selected for the portfolio the company currently has three sources for borrowing being 60 million par value of fixed rate 15 year senior secured notes notes with an interest rate of 4 37 and two facilities provided by the bank of new york mellon being a 60 million uncommitted revolving credit facility and an 80 million uncommitted overdraft facility both the board and the manager are content that these arrangements offer a sufficiently flexible means of gearing further details are contained in notes 11 and 12 on page 52 performance the board reviews performance by reference to key performance indicators kpis the five main kpis are as follows asset performance on a total return basis the company s one three five and ten year record for its nav and share price compared to the benchmark index is shown on page 2 for the year to 31 march 2019 the company s nav underperformed the benchmark index by 7 2 in reviewing the performance of the assets of the company the board monitors the nav performance in relation to the ftse all share index however the manager s aim is to achieve absolute return through a genuinely active investment management approach it is not the investment management team s philosophy to regard the ftse all share index as a benchmark for portfolio construction for the company this approach can therefore result in a portfolio that is from time to time substantially different from the ftse all share index peer group performance there were 23 investment trusts in the uk equity income sector at 31 march 2019 this sector however is quite diverse in its investment policies and structures the board monitors the performance of the company in relation to both this sector as a whole and to those companies within it which the board consider to be its peer group as at 31 march 2019 of those companies ranked within the uk equity income sector the company was ranked 20th over one year and 23rd over three and five years by nav performance source jp morgan cazenove dividends and dividend policy the company s dividend policy is that the directors shall seek to provide shareholders with real growth in ordinary dividends over the medium to longer term in the event of there being a material amount of income that is non recurring or special in nature additional special dividends may be declared at the discretion of the directors the directors aim to distribute by way of dividend substantially all of the company s net income after expenses and taxation whilst also retaining a prudent level of reserves dividends are paid on a regular quarterly basis in september december march and june in respect of each accounting year the timing of these regular quarterly payments means that shareholders do not have an opportunity to vote on a final dividend recognising the importance of shareholder engagement and although not required by any regulation shareholders were given an opportunity to vote on this policy at the 2017 agm the opportunity to vote for the policy is being provided again this year and an advisory resolution is included in the notice of meeting on page 60 the board has declared ordinary dividends of 14 50p per share in respect of the year under review compared with 13 90p per share in respect of the prior year an increase of 4 3 as noted in the chairman s statement in light of a decline in special dividends received no special dividend has been declared for the year 2018 0 80p the retail price index increased 2 4 in the year the individual dividends declared for the year are shown on the next page on page 2 and in note 8 to the financial statements the manager aims to maximise total return from the portfolio the manager subscribes to the benefits of strong earnings growth and the importance of dividends to total return however whilst income is an important consideration dividend yields do not constrain investment decisions discount the board monitors the discount at which the company s ordinary shares trade and how this compares to other investment trusts in the peer group during the year the shares traded in the discount range of 8 3 to 13 8 and ended the year at a 10 9 discount this is shown in the adjacent graph which plots the discount over the year as at 31 march 2019 the weighted average discount of the 23 investment trusts in the uk equity income sector was 3 5 2018 3 4 source jpmorgan cazenove the board and the manager closely monitor movements in the company s share price and dealings in the company s shares in order to address any significant imbalance in the market the board asks shareholders to approve resolutions each year which allow for the repurchase of ordinary shares for cancellation or to be held as treasury shares and also their issuance this may also assist in the management of the discount during the year to 31 march 2019 1 020 000 shares were bought back at an average price of 347 7p since the year end 965 000 shares have been bought back at an average price of 329 0p no shares were issued the shares bought back are being held in treasury the board intends to sell the shares held as treasury shares in due course on terms that are in the best interests of shareholders as a whole ongoing charges the expenses of managing the company are reviewed by the board at every meeting the board aims to minimise the ongoing charges figure which provides a guide to the effect on performance of all annual operating costs of the company the ongoing charges figure for the year was 0 72 2018 0 70 results and dividends on 31 march 2019 the share price and the net asset value debt at market value per ordinary share were 323 5p and 363 2p respectively the respective comparable figures at 31 march 2018 were 344 0p and 380 1p for the year ended 31 march 2019 three interim dividends of 3 25p each per share were paid on 28 september 2018 28 december 2018 and 29 march 2019 respectively a fourth interim dividend of 4 75p per share has been declared for payment on 28 june 2019 to shareholders on the register on 7 june giving total interim dividends for the year of 14 50p 2018 13 90p financial position and borrowings the company s balance sheet on page 44 shows the assets and liabilities at the year end details of the 60 million senior secured notes are shown in note 12 and details of the company s overdraft and revolving credit facilities are shown in note 11 outlook including the future of the company the main trends and factors likely to affect the future development performance and position of the company s business can be found in the portfolio manager s report in this strategic report further details of the principal risks affecting the company are set out under principal risks and uncertainties below principal risks and uncertainties the board carries out a regular review of the risk environment in which the company operates and has carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the company the following sets out a description of those risks and how they are being managed or mitigated economic risk economic risk arises from uncertainty about the future prices of the company s investments the majority of the company s investments are listed on regulated stock exchanges and will be subject to market fluctuations both upward and downward arising from external factors including general economic conditions and government policies such factors are outside the control of the board and the manager and may give rise to high levels of volatility in the prices of the investments held investment risk there can be no guarantee that the company will meet its investment objectives as set out in the investment policy on page 12 the manager s style may result in the portfolio being significantly overweight or underweight positions in individual stocks or sectors compared to the company s benchmark index consequently the company s performance may deviate significantly possibly for extended periods from that of the benchmark in a similar way the manager manages other portfolios which as a consequence of the high conviction style of investment management may include many of the same stocks as the company this could significantly increase the liquidity and price risk of certain stocks under certain scenarios and market conditions the board has established guidelines through which amongst other things it seeks to ensure that the portfolio of investments is appropriately diversified to mitigate poor performance of individual investments the board also challenges the manager on strategy and monitors performance on behalf of shareholders financial risk the financial risks faced by the company include market price risk including currency risk interest rate risk and other price risk liquidity risk and credit risk which includes counterparty and custodial risk details of these risks and how they are managed are disclosed in note 16 to the financial statements on pages 54 to 57 gearing risk whilst the use of borrowings by the company should enhance total shareholder return when the return on the company s underlying securities is rising and exceeds the cost of borrowing it will have the opposite effect when the underlying return is falling whilst the portfolio manager has discretion on when and how he should use borrowings to gear returns the board reviews regularly the level of gearing and the extent of available borrowings share discount risk the company s shares may trade at a wide discount to their underlying net asset value the board and the manager maintain an active dialogue on the market rating of the company s shares and the board has taken the powers which it seeks to renew each year for both share repurchase and issuance which can help in its management operational risk the board regularly reviews the system of financial and non financial internal controls operated by the company the manager and other external service providers these include controls designed to safeguard the company s assets and to ensure that proper accounting records are maintained details of how the board monitors the services provided by the manager and other suppliers are explained further in the internal controls and risk management section in the audit committee report on pages 23 and 24 the depositary also monitors the company s stock cash borrowings and investment restrictions throughout the year and issues an annual report to the directors regulatory risk the company is subject to various laws and regulations by virtue of its status as a public limited company registered under section 833 of the companies act 2006 its status as an investment trust and its listing on the official list of the uk listing authority loss of investment trust status for tax purposes could lead to the company being subject to tax on the realised capital profits on the sale of its investments a serious breach of other regulatory rules could lead to suspension from the official list a fine or qualified audit report other control failures either by the manager or any other of the company s service providers could result in operational or reputational problems erroneous disclosures or loss of assets through fraud as well as breaches of regulations the manager reviews compliance with tax and other financial regulatory requirements on a daily basis and reports to the board on a regular basis on all regulatory aspects other risks the risk that the portfolio manager mark barnett may become incapacitated or otherwise be unavailable is mitigated by support available from his designated deputy for this portfolio martin walker and the wider invesco uk equities team viability statement the directors view of the company s viability has not changed since last year the company as an investment trust is a collective investment vehicle designed and managed for the long term the company s investment objective is to provide shareholders with capital growth and real growth in dividends over the medium to longer term the directors take a long term view in their stewardship of the company as does the portfolio manager in his management of the portfolio the company is required by its articles to have a continuation vote every five years the next instance being in 2021 the directors have had no indication that shareholders will not vote again for the continuation of the company at that time the company typically holds shares for at least five years and this period is substantially less than the outstanding term of the company s notes which will require repayment in 2029 consequently the directors consider that the appropriate term for the purpose of this viability statement is five years in their assessment of the company s viability the directors considered the principal risks to which it is exposed as set out on pages 14 and 15 together with mitigating factors their assessment also considered the following the company s investment objective and strategy the investment capabilities of the portfolio manager the business model of the company which has effectively been stress tested over the years through various difficult market cycles the current outlook for the uk economy and equity markets demand for the company s shares and the discount at which they trade the company s borrowing structure the liquidity of the portfolio and the company s future income and annual operating costs consideration of the borrowing structure included the amount the nav could fall without triggering the repayment of the notes and or the bank overdraft and credit facility and the amount of debt cover which at the year end was more than seven times the aggregate of these liabilities the directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the five year period of assessment board responsibilities as set out in the directors report on pages 25 and 26 the directors have a statutory duty to promote the success of the company whilst also having regard to certain broader matters including the need to engage with employees suppliers customers and others and to have regard to their interests s172 companies act 2006 however the company has no employees and no customers in the traditional sense in accordance with the company s nature as an investment trust the board s principal concern has been and continues to be the interests of the company s shareholders taken as a whole the board has a responsible governance culture and has due regard for broader matters so far as they apply in particular the board engages with the manager at every board meeting reviews its relationships with other service providers at least annually and monitors compliance with the company s obligations to debt holders board diversity the board s policy on diversity is that the board seeks to ensure that its structure size and composition including the balance of skills knowledge diversity including gender and experience of directors is sufficient for the effective direction and control of the company although the board had not set a specific target or quota in respect of this policy it had aspired to meet the hampton alexander review target of 33 female board representation and has now done so with the appointment of georgina field following this appointment the board comprises six non executive directors two of whom are women which constitutes 33 3 female board representation summary biographical details of the directors are set out on page 19 the company has no employees social and environmental matters as an investment company with no employees property or activities outside investment environmental policy has limited application the manager considers various factors when evaluating potential investments while a company s policy towards the environment and social responsibility including with regard to human rights is considered as part of the overall assessment of risk and suitability for the portfolio the manager does not necessarily decide to make or not to make an investment on environmental and social grounds the manager applies the united nations principles for responsible investment as an investment vehicle the company does not provide goods or services in the normal course of business and does not have customers accordingly the directors consider that the company is not within the scope of the modern slavery act 2015 this strategic report was approved

traded or where active stock exchange quoted bid prices are not available fair value is determined by reference to a variety of valuation techniques including broker quotes and price modelling where there is no active market unlisted illiquid investments are valued by the directors at fair value based on recommendations from invesco s pricing committee which in turn is guided by the international private equity and venture capital association guidelines the unlisted investment valuations are reviewed on a quarterly basis and at specific trigger events these are evaluated using valuation techniques such as earnings multiples recent arm s length transactions net assets and milestones attained financial liabilities financial liabilities including borrowings are initially measured at fair value net of transaction costs and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method e cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents may comprise cash including short term deposits which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value as well as cash equivalents including money market funds investments are regarded as cash equivalents if they meet all of the following criteria highly liquid investments held in the company s base currency that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value and provide a return no greater than the rate of a three month high quality government bond f derivatives forward currency

recognised in revenue i taxation the liability for corporation tax is based on net revenue for the year excluding non taxable dividends the tax charge is allocated between the revenue and capital account on the marginal basis whereby revenue expenses are matched first against taxable income in the revenue account deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred timing differences are differences between the company s taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements deferred taxation assets are recognised where in the opinion of the directors it is more likely than not that these amounts will be realised in future periods a deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of surplus management expenses and losses on loan relationships as the company is unlikely to have sufficient future taxable revenue to offset against these j dividends dividends are not recognised in the financial statements unless there is an obligation to pay at the balance sheet date dividends are recognised in the year in which they are paid to shareholders 2 income this note shows the income generated from the portfolio investment assets of the company and

instruments comprise the company s investment portfolio derivative financial instruments if the company had any as well as any cash borrowings other receivables and other payables this note sets out risks arising from these in terms of the company s exposure and sensitivity and any mitigation that the manager or board can take the company s strategy for managing investment risk is determined with regard to the company s investment policy as shown on page 12 the management of market risk is part of the investment management process the company s portfolio is managed in accordance with the internal controls and risk management systems as described in the sections thereon in the corporate governance statement page 21 and in the audit committee report page 22 the overall disposition of the company s assets is reviewed by the board on a regular basis the company s financial instruments comprise its investment portfolio as shown on pages 17 and 18 cash borrowings including loan overdraft and notes debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations such as sales and purchases awaiting settlement and accrued income for the purpose of this note cash should be taken to comprise cash and cash equivalents the accounting policies in note 1 include criteria for the recognition and the basis of measurement applied for financial instruments note 1 also includes the basis on which income and expenses arising from financial assets and liabilities are recognised and measured the principal risks that an investment company faces in its portfolio management activities are set out below market risk arising from fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument because of changes in market prices market risk comprises three types of risk currency risk interest rate risk and other price risk currency risk arising from fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument because of changes in foreign exchange rates interest rate risk arising from fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument because of changes in market interest rates and other price risk arising from fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument for reasons other than changes in foreign exchange rates or market interest rates liquidity risk arising from any difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities credit risk arising from financial loss for a company where the other party to a financial instrument fails to discharge an obligation risk management policies and procedures the directors have delegated to the manager the responsibility for the day to day investment activities of the company as more fully described in the business review as an investment trust the company invests in equities and other investments for the long term so as to meet its investment objective and policies in pursuing its investment objective the company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in either a reduction in the company s net assets or a reduction of the profits available for dividends the risks applicable to the company and the policies the company used to manage these risks for the two years under review follow 16 1 market risk the company s manager assesses the company s direct exposure when making each investment decision and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis the board meets at least quarterly to assess risk and review investment performance no other derivative or hedging instruments are utilised to manage market risk gearing is used to enhance returns but this also increases the company s exposure to market risk and volatility 16 1 1 currency risk the majority of the company s assets liabilities and income are denominated in sterling there is some exposure to euros swiss francs and us dollars management of the currency risk the manager monitors the company s direct exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis and reports to the board on a regular basis forward currency contracts can be used to reduce the company s exposure to anticipated future changes in exchange rates which are used also to achieve the portfolio characteristics that assist the company in meeting its investment objective and policies all contracts are limited to currencies and amounts commensurate with the asset denominated in those currencies during the year no forward currency contracts were used by the company 2018 none income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt the company does not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is included in the financial statements and its receipt currency exposure the fair values of the company s monetary items that have currency exposure at 31 march are shown below where the company s equity investments which are not monetary items are priced in a foreign currency they have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall level of exposure 31 march 2019 31 march 2018 euro 000 swiss franc 000 us dollar 000 euro 000 swiss franc 000 us dollar 000 foreign currency exposure on net monetary items 145 1 405 814 56 1 037 207 investments at fair value through profit or loss 53 877 28 460 43 222 35 887 total net foreign currency 145 55 282 29 274 56 44 259 36 094 the above may not be representative of the exposure to risk during the year because the levels of foreign currency exposure may change significantly throughout the year currency sensitivity the following table illustrates the sensitivity of the return after taxation for the year using exchange rates for sterling to euros swiss francs and us dollars it is based on the company s monetary foreign currency financial instruments held at each balance sheet date and takes account of any forward foreign exchange contracts if used that offset the effects of changes in currency exchange rates the possible change in exchange rates of 1 4 2018 2 0 for euros 2 5 2018 2 6 for swiss francs and 2 8 2018 3 4 for us dollars has been determined based on market volatility in the year using the standard deviation of sterling s fluctuation to the applicable foreign currency against the mean if sterling had strengthened this would have had the following effect 31 march 2019 31 march 2018 euro 000 swiss franc 000 us dollar 000 euro 000 swiss franc 000 us dollar 000 income statement profit loss after taxation revenue return 7 35 48 1 34 34 capital return 1 347 797 1 124 1 220 total return after taxation for the year 7 1 382 845 1 1 158 1 254 if sterling had weakened to the same extent for the currencies above the effect would have been the exact opposite in the opinion of the directors the above sensitivity analysis is not representative of the year as a whole since the level of exposure may change frequently as part of the currency risk management process of the company 16 1 2 interest rate risk interest rate movements may affect the level of income receivable on cash deposits and the interest payable on variable rate borrowings when the company has cash balances they are held on variable rate bank accounts yielding rates of interest dependent on the base rate of the custodian at the year end the company had uncommitted bank facilities and senior secured loan notes details of which are shown in notes 11 and 12 the company uses the facilities when required at levels approved and monitored by the board at the maximum overdraft and loan of 140 million the effect of a 1 in the interest rate would result in a decrease increase to the company s income statement of 1 4 million 2018 1 4 million 16 1 3 other price risk other price risks i e changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk may affect the value of the equity investments but it is the business of the manager to manage the portfolio to achieve the best return for an acceptable level of risk management of other price risk the directors manage the market price risks inherent in the investment portfolio by meeting regularly to monitor on a formal basis the manager s compliance with the company s stated objectives and policies and to review investment performance the company s portfolio is the result of the manager s investment process and as a result is not correlated with the company s benchmark or the market in which the company invests the value of the portfolio will not move in line with the market but will move as a result of the performance of the company shares within the portfolio if the value of the portfolio rose or fell by 10 at the balance sheet date the return after tax for the year would increase or decrease by 101 7 million 2018 104 8 million respectively 16 2 liquidity risk liquidity risk is minimised as

minimised by using only approved counterparties and transactions on a delivery versus payment basis the company s ability to operate in the short term may be adversely affected if the company s custodian suffers insolvency or other financial difficulties however with the support of the depositary s restitution obligation the risk of outright credit loss on the investment portfolio is remote the board reviews the custodian s annual controls report and the manager s management of the relationship with the custodian cash balances are limited to a maximum of 1 of net assets with any one deposit taker with only approved deposit takers being used this limit is at the discretion of the board and is reviewed on a regular basis no cash was held at the year end 2018 nil the maximum credit

blackrock chairman s statement for the six months to 31 march 2019 dear shareholder i am pleased to present the company s half yearly financial report for the six months to 31 march 2019 period highlights interim dividend of 3 00 us cents per share yield of 4 3 based on share price at 28 may 2019 interim dividend for 2019 and final dividend for 2018 nav total return of 2 0 in us dollar terms with dividends reinvested share price total return of 2 0 in us dollar terms with dividends reinvested 6 150 000 new ordinary shares issued via tap issuance and 33 906 693 new ordinary shares issued via the c share issue performance and overview during the six months to 31 march 2019 the company generated a nav total return in us dollars of 2 0 its benchmark index returned 3 4 the company s share price total return was 2 0 by comparison the company s previous benchmark index the msci frontier markets index returned 2 2 and the msci emerging markets index returned 1 7 the company s investment objective is to achieve long term capital growth since launch in december 2010 the company s nav total return has been 51 7 compared to the benchmark index total return of 40 5 in us dollar terms with dividends reinvested for sterling based investors the nav total return has been 81 0 since launch versus the benchmark index total return of 66 8 in sterling terms with dividends reinvested although the period under review was characterised by considerable volatility your company has generated a positive absolute nav return over the past six months a sell off in frontier markets occurred in q4 of 2018 resulting in a significant fall in valuations however the markets gained some ground back in q1 of 2019 a slow down in global economic growth and a tightening of global liquidity acted as headwinds to frontier market performance during 2018 and ongoing geo political tensions also added to volatility to date 2019 appears to be a more benign environment for frontier market investing with signs that the upward pressure on us interest rates has begun to reduce a full description of the key contributors and detractors to performance during the period portfolio activity and the investment managers views on the outlook for the second half of the year are set out in their report which follows revenue return and dividends the company s revenue return per share for the six months ended 31 march 2019 amounted to 3 19 us cents 2018 2 27 us cents the board is pleased to declare an interim dividend of 3 00 us cents per share 2018 3 00 us cents per share payable on 28 june 2019 to shareholders on the company s register on 7 june 2019 the shares will go ex dividend on 6 june 2019 the final dividend of 4 40 us cents per share for the year ended 30 september 2018 was declared on 10 december 2018 and paid to shareholders on 7 february 2019 the company also declared a special dividend of 1 00 us cent at this time reflecting additional non recurring income received during that financial year and ahead of the c share conversion share capital the directors recognise the benefit of ensuring that the company s share price remains close to its underlying net asset value nav accordingly the directors monitor the share price closely and will consider the issue at a premium or repurchase at a discount of ordinary shares to balance demand and supply in the market for the period under review the company s ordinary shares have traded at an average premium to nav of 2 6 and were trading at a premium of 1 1 on a cum income basis at 28 may 2019 the directors currently have the authority to buy back an amount of shares in the market equivalent to 14 99 of the company s issued share capital and also to issue new shares equivalent to 10 of the company s issued share capital excluding any shares held in treasury in response to demand for its shares the company has issued 6 150 000 new ordinary shares during the period for a gross total consideration of us 10 845 000 the new shares were issued at a premium to the prevailing nav and were therefore accretive to the company s nav the board believes that the issue of new shares by the company where demand cannot be met in the market helps to regulate the share price premium discount to nav and the economies of scale achieved through the enlargement of the company are beneficial to shareholders since the period end and up to the date of this report the company has issued no further new ordinary shares no shares were bought back in the period under review or up to the date of this report c share issue following shareholder approval in a general meeting the company issued 44 927 580 c shares with a nominal value of 10 cents each on 27 november 2018 the majority of which were issued in connection with the reconstruction of blackrock emerging europe plc the c shares were subsequently converted into ordinary shares on 11 january 2019 in accordance with the terms of the c share prospectus and circular the c share issue raised us 57 010 000 which consisted of cash and other assets transferred under the rollover option in connection with the scheme of reconstruction of blackrock emerging europe plc and proceeds received from the placing and offer for subscription these assets were invested in accordance with the company s existing investment policy please see note 11 for further information outlook your board believes that the company s frontier market universe continues to represent a compelling proposition for the medium to long term investor these markets generally exhibit superior gross domestic product gdp growth to developed markets and obtaining exposure to them through a diversified portfolio significantly reduces the volatility inherent in the individual markets themselves as demonstrated by the table below the volatility of the company s returns has been surprisingly low thanks to the low correlation between different frontier markets which tend to be driven by internal developments and domestic investor flows since launch in december 2010 the volatility of the company s nav has been lower than that of major indices such as s p 500 index ftse all share index and msci emerging markets index blackrock frontiers investment trust surprisingly low volatility company nav 1 6 s p 500 1 9 ftse all share 2 2 msci emerging markets 2 4 the figures shown relate to past performance past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results and should not be the sole factor of consideration when selecting a product or strategy source bloomberg msci as at end february 2019 volatility of weekly returns since 17 december 2010 inception date of the company the board also believes that the company s revised investment policy provides the investment managers with a more sustainable investment universe within which they can take best advantage of the opportunities available outside the developed and major emerging markets the board remains confident that the investment managers possess the potential to maintain their strong track record of outperformance over the long run having extensive resources deployed to these inefficient markets and the local market knowledge required to manage this dynamic and exciting asset class furthermore the strong underlying cash flows and high dividend yields of companies in the frontiers universe combined with historically low valuations especially when compared to developed markets present a unique and compelling investment opportunity audley twiston davies chairman 30 may 2019 investment manager s report portfolio market commentary in the six months ended 31 march 2019 the company returned 2 0 on a us dollar basis with dividends reinvested versus its benchmark index which returned 3 4 over this time period the msci emerging markets index rose by 1 7 and the msci frontier markets index rose by 2 2 since inception the company has returned 51 7 compared to the 40 5 return of its benchmark index and the 25 2 return of the msci frontier markets index while msci emerging markets index lagged returning 16 1 indonesia 14 0 was the best performing market in the frontiers universe as its currency benefitted from a weaker us dollar given softening signals from the federal reserve of a pause in the rate hiking cycle our positions in semen indonesia building materials manufacturer mitra adiperkasa retailer and astra international conglomerate contributed well to returns over the period saudi arabia 14 0 rose driven by inflows to the market in anticipation of inclusion in the msci emerging markets index by msci despite a falling oil price for most of the period with the market trading at a significant premium to emerging markets on a forward price earnings multiple of 16x we maintain our view that the market is overly expensive and there are better opportunities elsewhere hence we currently hold very little exposure to saudi arabia with the market rising during the period our significant 13 0 underweight in saudi arabia relative to the benchmark index detracted from relative performance stock selection in malaysia contributed well to returns through telecommunications company telekom malaysia 24 0 which improved from a very low valuation and auto manufacturer umw 15 0 which delivered strong results and saw upgrades in analyst expectations our holding of acacia mining 66 0 a gold mining business operating in tanzania added to returns on expectations of a resolution of the dispute with the tanzanian government following the appointment of a new ceo at barrick gold the company also reported strong operating results we have since fully exited our position greek banks national bank of greece and alpha bank were both strong contributors to performance during q1 of 2019 as they rallied amid increased expectations of an agreed solution for the reduction of outstanding non performing loan exposures and a sovereign debt upgrade participation in the initial public offering of kazakh uranium company kazatomprom 23 0 benefited the company kazatomprom holds the world s largest uranium reserves accounting for 23 0 of total global uranium production and is one of the world s lowest cost producers our position in united arab emirates uae property company emaar development 21 0 detracted from returns whilst the outlook for the dubai property market remains muted we feel that investors have overly discounted this for what remains the country s most prestigious developer and that the stock looks relatively cheap hence we continue to hold it our holding in turkish gold mining company koza altin 27 0 detracted from returns as the stock declined in line with the rest of the market despite strong operating performance as an exporter the company should benefit operationally from the recent decline in the turkish lira an overweight position in romanian financials brd groupe société générale 10 0 and banca transilvania 14 0 weighed on performance due to the announcement of potential adverse tax policy developments in early december 2018 these measures were actually reversed in early 2019 and the stocks have now recovered the majority of their underperformance portfolio activity in terms of positioning we reduced exposure to saudi arabia amid expensive valuations which have not been reflecting the lower oil price environment we exited thai petrochemical company indorama on concern over weakening demand trends across developed markets we also initiated a position in drinks company thai beverage which should benefit from a pickup in activity in thailand the stock trades at an attractive valuation relative to the thai market and the market has heavily discounted the valuation of its acquisition of sabeco vietnam s leading beer company we allocated more capital to one of our most preferred countries indonesia by initiating a position in semen indonesia where we see operating profit accelerating above expectations the company continued to increase its exposure to egypt by adding to medical diagnostic services operator integrated diagnostics and real estate developer medinet nasr on the back of improvements in the economy s fiscal health inflation that looks to have peaked and a more sustainable current account deficit we added more exposure to vietnam which we think will benefit from greater manufacturing outsourcing from china we also bought copper miner kaz minerals in kazakhstan where we see an underappreciation of their high quality assets and flexibility on capital expenditure spending which should protect the balance sheet in the case of market stress most recently we have reduced exposure to greek financials post their strong first quarter rally and have also trimmed positions in argentina outlook we continue to be positive on frontier markets especially where those markets are experiencing improved macroeconomic conditions better political governance cash flow growth and cheap valuations relative to peers furthermore the company has offered an attractive and growing dividend over time despite income not featuring in its objectives thanks to growing earnings on its underlying investments dividend payments per share gbp company dividend growth has been driven by strong frontier market company fundamentals special dividend dividend 2011 1 90 2012 2

not be the sole factor of consideration when selecting a product or strategy based on interim and final dividends declared for the period and where applicable special dividends source blackrock end december 2018 while emerging and frontier markets delivered strong returns in q1 2019 indicators of market sentiment look far from overstretched countries in our frontiers universe offer significant value compared to developed markets and some of them have a market capitalisation equal to or even smaller than the market capitalisation of a single stock listed in the developed world the market capitalisation of california based media services provider netflix is more than the market capitalisation of greece and turkey combined we note that the gdp of these two economies totals more than us 1 100 billion while the net income of netflix is circa us 1 billion we believe that active managers and long term investors can find compelling opportunities in frontier markets which in our opinion currently are out of favour with the majority of global investors we continue to position for a positive environment for emerging and frontier markets in aggregate supported by a lower interest rate environment together the wide subset of countries that make up our investible universe continue to exhibit strong gdp growth have low government debt levels and offer an opportunity to invest in companies with strong cash flow and high dividend yields on some of the lowest valuations in the world the low correlation between frontier markets and all developed and emerging markets mean that the inclusion of a frontier markets fund within a portfolio can bring significant diversification benefits all percentage movements are expressed in us dollar terms sam vecht and emily fletcher blackrock

loss of us 710 000 for the company 2 market exposure in the case of equity investments is the same as fair value in the case of cfds it is the market value of the underlying shares to which the

is that of an investment trust company within the meaning of section 1158 of the corporation tax act 2010 2 basis of preparation the half yearly financial statements have been prepared using the same accounting policies as set out in the company s annual report and financial statements for the year ended 30 september 2018 which were prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs as adopted by the european union and applied in accordance with international accounting standard 34 interim financial reporting insofar as the statement of recommended practice sorp for investment trust companies and venture capital trusts issued by the association of investment companies aic revised in november 2014 and updated in january 2017 and february 2018 is compatible with ifrs the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with guidance set out in the sorp adoption of new and amended standards and interpretations ifrs 9 financial instruments the classification and measurement requirements of ifrs 9 have been adopted retrospectively as of the date of initial application on 1 october 2018 however the company has chosen to take advantage of the option not to restate comparatives therefore the 2018 comparative figures are presented and measured under ias 39 all financial assets previously held at fair value continue to be measured at fair value and accordingly there has been no impact as a result of the adoption of ifrs 9 all financial assets that were classified as loans and receivables and measured at amortised cost continue to be so ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers the company adopted ifrs 15 as of the date of initial application of 1 october 2018 ifrs 15 replaces ias 18 revenue and establishes a five step model to account for revenue arising from contracts with customers in addition guidance on interest and dividend income have been moved from ias 18 to ifrs 9 without significant changes to the requirements therefore there was no impact of adopting ifrs 15 for the company c share liability on 27 november 2018 the company issued 44 927 580 c shares with a nominal value of 10 cents each at a price of 1 00 per share on 11 january 2019 the c shares were converted into ordinary shares the conversion ratio which has been calculated by reference to the net assets of the company attributable to the ordinary shares and the net assets of the company attributable to the c shares as at the close of business on 7 january 2019 was 0 7547 ordinary shares for every c share held the c shares when in issue were listed on the london stock exchange after the conversion of the c shares into ordinary shares the c shares were delisted on 22 january 2019 whilst the c shares were in issue the results assets and liabilities attributable to the c shares were accounted for in a separate pool to the results assets and liabilities of the ordinary shares a share of the management fee and other expenses for the period the c shares had been in issue was allocated to the c share pool c shares are recognised on issue at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs after initial recognition c shares are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method amortisation is credited or charged to finance income or finance costs in the statement of comprehensive income transaction costs are amortised to the earliest conversion period the c shares issued represented contracts for conversion into a variable number of ordinary shares and therefore the c shares are classified as liabilities under ias 32 the classification resulted in the issue costs and the return on the c shares being presented as finance costs in the company s statement of comprehensive income the return on the c shares represented an increase in the assets attributable to the c shares over and above the proceeds raised from their issue at the time that it arose the directors considered whether the c share liability should be valued at fair value or stated at amortised cost the c shares were traded on the london stock exchange the amortised cost value of the c share pool equated to the net asset value of the c shares which the directors considered was the most appropriate way to value the liability the liability was extinguished on 11 january 2019 upon the conversion of c shares into ordinary shares 3 income six months ended 31 march 2019 unaudited us 000 six months ended 31 march 2018 unaudited us 000 year ended 30 september 2018 audited us 000 investment income uk dividends

requires the company to classify fair value measurements using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of inputs used in making the measurements the valuation techniques used by the company are explained in the accounting policies note 2 g as set out on pages 57 and 58 in the company s annual report and financial statements for the year ended 30 september 2018 categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset the fair value hierarchy has the following levels level 1 quoted market price for identical instruments in active markets a financial instrument is regarded as quoted in an active market if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange dealer broker industry group pricing service or regulatory agency and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm s length basis the company does not adjust the quoted price for these instruments level 2 valuation techniques used to price securities based on observable inputs this category includes instruments valued using quoted market prices in active markets for similar instruments quoted prices for similar instruments in markets that are considered less than active or other valuation techniques where all significant inputs are directly or indirectly observable from market data valuation techniques used for non standard instruments such as options currency swaps and other over the counter derivatives include the use of comparable recent arm s length transactions reference to other instruments that are substantially the same discounted cash flow analysis option pricing models and other valuation techniques commonly used by market participants making the maximum use of market inputs and relying as little as possible on entity specific inputs as at the year ended 30 september 2018 the p notes were valued using the underlying equity bid price and the inputs to the valuation were the exchange rates used to convert the p note valuation from the relevant local currency to us dollars at the year end date no p notes were held as at 31 march 2019 as at the period end the cfds were valued using the underlying equity bid price and the inputs to the valuation were the exchange rates used to convert the cfd valuation from the relevant local currency in which the underlying equity was priced to us dollars at the period end date there have been no changes to the valuation technique since the previous year or as at the date of this report level 3 valuation techniques using significant unobservable inputs this category includes all instruments where the valuation technique includes inputs not based on observable data and these inputs could have a significant impact on the instrument s valuation this category includes instruments that are valued based on quoted prices for similar instruments where significant entity determined adjustments or assumptions are required to reflect differences between the instruments and instruments for which there is no active market the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety for this purpose the significance of an input is assessed against the fair value measurement in its entirety if a fair value measurement uses observable inputs that require significant adjustment based on unobservable inputs that measurement is a level 3 measurement assessing the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgement considering factors specific to the asset or liability the determination of what constitutes observable requires significant judgement by the investment manager the investment manager considers observable data to be that market data that is readily available regularly distributed or updated reliable and verifiable not proprietary and provided by independent sources that are actively involved in the relevant market contracts for difference and p notes have all been classified as level 2 investments as their valuation has been based on market observable inputs represented by the market prices of the underlying quoted securities to which these contracts expose the company the table below sets out fair value measurements using ifrs 13 fair value hierarchy financial assets liabilities at fair value through

30 05 2019 trade and technology trigger michael roberts warns that the us china trade war brings with it the threat of another global downturn despite all the optimistic talk by donald trump about the state of the us economy the latest data on economic activity and industrial production suggest that america is joining europe and japan in a sharp slowdown as we enter the second half of 2019 and this is at a time when the trade and technology war between the us and china has moved up another gear and so threatens to trigger an outright global recession before the year is out jp morgan economists report that the so called flash may pmis purchasing managers indexes for the us europe and japan point to a 0 7 point decline consistent with just 2 5 annual growth in global gross domestic product pmis are surveys of company views on their current and future sales and purchases they have proved to be reasonable guides to actual production and 2 5 growth globally is considered to be the stall speed for the world economy below which a recession is indicated jp morgan finds that global manufacturing is suffering most being nearly at 50 in the pmi anything below 50 means contraction but services which constitute 70 80 of most major economies at least in the official definition are also sliding towards the levels of the mini recession of 2015 16 and most concerningly according to jpm the global manufacturing and services expectations measures look set to fall roughly two points in may and would push the indexes beneath the lows set in early 2016 like other forecasts the economic outlook published last week by the organisation of economic cooperation and development predicts slower growth this year than last in most big economies in some cases much slower what is more even in 2020 global growth will not return to the pace it reached in the past few years it says angel gurría its secretary general stated the world economy is in a dangerous place slowdown up to now it has been in europe and japan that signs of a slowdown and even an outright recession were visible but now the us economy may be joining them the us manufacturing pmi dropped to 50 6 in may implying almost stagnation it was the lowest reading since september 2009 as new orders fell for the first time since august 2009 while output and employment rose less than previously the services sector also dropped back and the overall economic indicator showed the weakest expansion in the private sector since may 2016 then on may 24 we had actual data for us manufactured durable goods new orders had fallen by 2 1 compared to a month earlier transportation equipment also down two of the last three months was a major factor in the decrease the atlanta fed s gdpnow model estimate a very reliable indicator of future growth puts us real gdp growth in the second quarter of 2019 at just 1 3 when we get to europe the latest figure for the continent s powerhouse german manufacturing activity makes particularly dismal reading may saw a fifth month of contraction in the manufacturing sector as new orders continued to fall sharply largely due to lower demand across the car industry and the effects of customer destocking in addition the rate of job losses accelerated to the quickest since january 2013 even with the services sector holding up overall activity in germany looks very weak and the business morale survey is at its lowest for nearly five years activity in the euro zone as a whole is also at a near five year low japan s economy is worsening for the first time in more than six years according to one of the government s main indicators the index of economic conditions compiled by japan s cabinet office fell 0 9 from february to march that prompted government statisticians to cut their assessment of the economy from weakening to worsening the lowest of five levels the last time the cabinet office used the bottom grade to describe the economy was in january 2013 barclays economist kazuma maeda said that the mechanical downgrade in the assessment did not necessarily imply that a downturn was in prospect but he added that said there is mounting concern about an economic recession nominal activity growth in japan which can be viewed as an up to date proxy for nominal gdp has been falling since the end of 2017 since the decline in real output growth has been greater than the rise in inflation on the core nominal activity measure the rate of increase has now dipped to around 0 5 lower than it was at bottom of the 2016 deflationary shock as an aside it is worth noting that japan is supposed to be the poster child of keynesian fiscal and monetary policy the bank of japan has negative interest rates and has bought virtually all government bonds available from the banks as well as corporate debt and stock through massive credit injections in the last 10 years and it has consistently run budget deficits to try and boost the economy so much so that the government debt to gdp is the highest in the world but nominal gdp growth and prices continue to stagnate those who support modern monetary theory should take note yes you can have budget deficits permanently and run up public debt without consequences for inflation or even the currency in an economy like japan but you cannot get a permanent boost to growth if japan s corporations will not invest and neither will the government creating money does not necessarily create value the irony is that prime minister shinzo abe plans to raise the sales tax later this year to try and lower the deficits and debt ratios in line with neoliberal policy the last time he did that japan went into recession outside the imperialist blocs the so called emerging market economies are also slowing turkey argentina and pakistan are already in recession while brazil and south africa are on the brink and capital flows to these economies from the imperialist bloc are drying up while public sector investment has nearly ground to a halt net public investment in emerging market countries has fallen below 1 of gdp for the first time on record raising fears of widening infrastructure gaps the share of national output that developing world governments are spending on investment in assets such as schools hospitals and transport and power infrastructure net of depreciation of the existing capital stock has fallen from 3 3 in 1997 to a low of just 0 9 last year according to data from the international monetary fund this is well below what the imf believed as needed to meet basic needs and allow countries to close infrastructure gaps that are slowing the pace of development indeed if you exclude china then investment growth is dropping in the rest of the g20 economies only the us and india are keeping investment positive if they should falter since investment is the driver a global recession would follow if china is stripped out of the data the weighted average for the rest of the emerging world is 3 9 of gdp markedly lower than the 4 8 figure seen as recently as 2010 the 49 low income developing countries mainly in africa but also encompassing the likes of vietnam bangladesh and moldova are even more badly placed with the imf calculating they need to invest an additional 7 1 of gdp a year until 2030 on roads electricity and water alone with health and education added in this rises to a colossal 15 4 of gdp or 528 billion a year profitability low profitability explains above all else why corporate investment has been so weak since 2009 what profits have been made have been switched into financial speculation mergers and acquisitions share buybacks and dividend payouts also there has been some hoarding of cash by the faangs facebook apple amazon netflix and google all this is because the profitability of productive investment remains historically low the other key factor in the long depression has been the rise in debt particularly corporate debt with profitability low companies have run up more debt in order to fund projects or speculate the big companies like apple or microsoft can do this because they have cash hoards to fall back on if anything goes wrong the smaller companies can only manage this debt spiral because interest rates remain at all time lows and so servicing the debt is still feasible as long as there is not a downturn in sales and profits when fundamentals like profitability and debt turn sour for capital then anything can trigger a slump each crisis has a different trigger or proximate cause the 1974 75 international recession was triggered by a sharp rise in oil prices and the us abandoning the dollar gold standard in 1971 the 1980 82 slump was triggered by a housing bubble in europe and a manufacturing crisis in the major economies the 1990 92 recession was triggered by the iraq war and oil prices the 2001 mild recession was the result of the bursting of the dot com bubble and the great recession was started with the collapse of the housing bubble in the us and the ensuing credit crunch brought on by the international diversification of credit derivatives but underlying each of these crises was a downward movement in the profitability of productive capital and eventually a slowdown or decline in the mass of profits it now seems possible that brewing trade war between the us and china could be a new trigger for a global recession certainly us investment bank morgan stanley has raised such a risk its analysts stated while a temporary escalation of trade tensions could be navigated without much damage at all a lasting breakdown would inflict serious pain if talks stall no deal is agreed upon and the us imposes 25 tariffs on the remaining circa 300 billion of imports from china we see the global economy heading towards recession the danger coming from the trade war has also been highlighted according to the oecd international trade has slowed abruptly its rate of increase has fallen from 5 5 in 2017 to what the oecd thinks will be 2 1 and 3 1 this year and next that is lower than projected economic growth meaning trade is shrinking as a share of global economic activity since 2009 it had been the slowdown in investment that has led to a dip in trade growth and the imf estimated that three quarters of the trade growth slowdown could be attributed to weak economic activity especially in investment but now the boot seems to be on the other foot the oecd numbers on aggregate investment are corroborated by more fine grained data most big us companies investment spending as reported in regulatory filings has stalled dramatically a wall street journal investigation of 356 of the s p 500 companies found that they spent only three percent more on capital in the first quarter year on year down from a 20 growth rate a year earlier for the biggest capital spenders investment fell outright trade frictions seem the main cause directly for businesses particularly reliant on chinese demand such as specialised chip producers as well as indirectly through the increased uncertainty spreading through the economy another survey has found that many us companies operating in china are also holding back from investing morgan stanley also warned not to underestimate the impact of trade tensions in a number of ways firstly the impact on the us corporate sector would be more widespread as china could put up non tariff barriers such as restriction of purchases given the global growth slowdown that would follow profits from firms international operations would be hit and companies would not be able to fully pass on the tariff increases to consumers chain reaction what makes it likely that the trade war will not be resolved amicably to avoid a global recession is that the battle between the us and china is not just over unfair trade it is much more an attempt by the us to maintain its global technological superiority in the face of china s fast rise to compete the attack on huawei globally organised by the us is just a start a chain reaction is under way as a giant industry braces for a violent shock us investment bank goldman sachs has noted that since 2010 the only place where corporate earnings have expanded is in the us and this according to goldmans is entirely down to the super tech companies global profits ex technology are only moderately higher than they were prior to the financial crisis while technology profits have moved sharply upwards mainly reflecting the impact of large us technology companies the growth slowdown is the result of low investment and profitability in most economies and in most sectors only the huge tech companies in the us have bucked this trend helped by a recent profits bonanza from the trump tax reforms but now the technology war with china will hit tech profits too even if the us and china reach a trade deal the imf is very concerned its new chief economist gita gopinath commented while the impact on global growth is relatively modest at this time the latest escalation could significantly dent business and financial market sentiment disrupt global supply chains and jeopardise the projected recovery in global growth in 2019 roberto azevêdo director general of the world trade organisation said the us china trade war was hurting the global economy the wto has been bypassed by the us as the trump administration aims its attacks directly on china according to azevêdo 580 billion of restrictive measures were introduced in the last year seven times more than the previous year this is holding back investors this is holding back consumers and of course it is having an impact on the expansion of the global economy everyone loses every single country will lose unless we find a solution for this indeed michael roberts blogs at

the perspective atlanta georgia may 30 2019 president forky klon weah s mansions fellow liberians four months ago during my state of the nation address i reported to you that the state of the nation remains strong this is still true today as i deliver my second major national address in 2019 i wish to speak today to you fellow citizens my brothers and my sisters on matters of critical national importance i wish to speak to liberians across our beloved country and to liberians in the diaspora and to liberians of every tribe age religion and political affiliation i have dedicated all of my energy compassion and solidarity over many decades to you all today we share a determination to see our people prosper and our country develop we the liberian people are strong and capable we know this because we have overcome the division and destruction of war we conquered ebola and we have peacefully transferred the honor and duties of political leadership in accordance with our constitution and the rule of law i am proud to say today that liberia is a democracy where people who seek to do so lawfully peacefully and responsibly can and do express their opinions whether in our legislature on our campuses in teashops and in peaceful demonstrations this is not sudan where one man ruled for 30 years and now the military is in control this is not venezuela where citizens are denied their rights where the legislature is unable to play its role and humanitarian aid is blocked from reaching people in desperate need in liberia while we will continue to face many challenges such as managing inflation creating jobs and fighting corruption our commitment to democratic principles is strong and central to our country s development and stability my fellow citizens a nation is not defined only by easy and happy times when everything is going well rather a nation is defined by the ability of its people to overcome difficult moments in their history and this is only possible when we come together as one people our strength will always lie in our unity because if we are divided we will never overcome the ills of our society fellow citizens we liberians have had some difficult moments but those moments do not define us those dark times did not define us we overcame that gloomy history and today liberia is a shining multiparty democracy in which freedom is supreme with the help of our regional and international partners we overcame both war and the disease liberia has since remained a haven of peace and has undergone a successful democratic transfer of power today the peace and security of this country is in the hands of liberians themselves after the withdrawal of all united nations troops in 2018 today we have a multi party active democracy in which political dissent or criticism is tolerated today we have unprecedented press and media freedom and have decriminalized free speech by law today liberia is a democracy where civil society groups and organizations can advocate openly for issues they care about today liberia is a democracy in which our integrity institutions monitor our implementation of law and policy my fellow liberians it is these freedoms that will define us as a people it is our toleration of political opposition and opposing ideas that will enrich our national dialogue and discourse it is our ability to manage this culture of freedom and tolerance for criticism that can sustain our peace it is reconciliation and social justice for all liberians that will bring us all together to face and overcome our difficult moments today we face a difficult economic moment but this moment like other moments of our history will soon come to pass the economic challenge we face today has to do with the structure of our economy we have lost significant revenue from the fall in the prices of iron ore and rubber and several of our rubber farmers have lost their income and ability to spend in the economy liberia is no longer receiving the emergency aid that came in the years after the war and large grants from our multilateral partners have also dried up the amount of remittances we receive from abroad in us dollars has also declined all of these realities complicate our macroeconomic situation the sudden drop in us dollar inflows puts pressure on the economy and devalues the liberian dollar moving prices upward the macroeconomic policies we have today are policies tailored to the time that we had free inflows of united states dollars we are now changing these policies to reflect the economic realities of our time and so my fellow liberians i want you to know that i am aware of the difficulties and hardships that the rising exchange rate is causing you and the effect it is having on prices of all goods and commodities in the market i am deeply concerned about these issues and i am working day and night to resolve them i will now summarize the broad actions that the government is taking to stabilize our economy we are delivering a new and improved fiscal policy that will be announced with the passage of a credible national budget for the 2019 2020 fiscal year in the last several years we have passed a budget that exceeds our revenue potential we are now working together with counterparts in the other branches of government to pass a realistic budget to achieve this will require sacrifices from all our actions will involve reform of our large wage bill rationalizing government spending to put more resources to critical sectors like health education and agriculture improving the way government makes payments to government entities and vendors who supply the government with goods and services and some actions on domestic arrears that the government owes local vendors as a stimulus to the economy on the monetary front we are taking actions to instill greater confidence in the central bank of liberia and the banking sector at large the integrity and independence of the central bank will be assured and protected under my administration and this resolve will be critical in the years ahead in this regard i wish to announce that the government of liberia under my leadership will no longer borrow from the central bank of liberia for its short term liquidity needs for monetary policy to work liberians must develop confidence in the banking sector today most of the liberian dollars in our economy is outside the banking sector we are shortly going to announce new policy initiatives that should increase the confidence of liberians in the liberian dollar these policies will provide strong incentives for liberians to keep their money in the bank and for commercial banks to invest more in the liberian dollar economy my fellow liberians in spite of the difficult economic conditions we did not default on our responsibility to ensure that the lives and livelihood of our people are improved utilizing domestic revenue which has increased as compared to the previous fiscal period we implemented several infrastructural and social programs that are impacting our people significantly these projects include the pavement of roads in the various communities in monrovia and some leeward counties the hiring of an additional 2000 health workers to greatly reduce the capacity gap in the health sector the complete reconditioning of jfk medical laboratory along with the ongoing comprehensive renovation of the facilities the construction of hundreds of housing units for low income earners the introduction of tuition free education in all public universities in liberia the training of more doctors for specialization in various fields of medicine the payment of all waesce students fees in 2018 the allocation of over us 6 million united states dollars to the liberia electricity corporation which enabled it to expand connections to more communities the pavement of several major highway corridors in the country we implemented these and many other projects to directly and positively affect the lives of our people my fellow citizens for a few months now there have been speculations and allegations surrounding the printing and delivery of our local currency the liberian dollar with some suggesting that an amount of up to sixteen billion liberian dollars had somehow gone missing in that process my government felt that it was important to investigate these allegations and in this regard a presidential investigative team was commissioned to do so in order to ensure an independent view a second investigation was simultaneously launched with the support of the united states government which facilitated the hiring of an international audit firm kroll associates the recently submitted reports of both of these investigations found that an amount of 15 5 billion liberian dollars was printed and delivered to the central bank of liberia however both reports presented evidence that additional liberian dollars had been printed in excess of the amounts contracted and had been imported into liberia but could not be accounted for it is important to note however that apart from the unauthorized surplus the reports indicate that all other banknotes ordered were properly accounted for and that there was no missing money immediately upon receipt of these reports the government of liberia commenced the prosecution of officials and employees of the central bank of liberia whose duty and official responsibility it was to manage the printing and delivery of liberian dollar bank notes as you are all aware those prosecutions are on going through the liberian legal system under due process of law no one has been arrested illegally or detained unjustifiably in connection with these trials i hereby pledge to ensure that the trials will continue until the courts of liberia issue final verdicts in this matter my fellow citizens i am fully aware of the negative impact of the declining exchange rate on the economic well being of the liberian people and i know that this is causing serious hardship for everyone but most especially for the ordinary liberians who have no financial cushion to protect them from these harsh conditions in order to slow down or halt the depreciation of the liberian dollar and thereby bring some much needed relief to the suffering of our people my government was advised by its economic management team in close collaboration with the central bank of liberia to make an infusion of 25 million into the economy through the central bank the purpose being to mop up the excess liquidity of liberian dollars at the completion of the mop up exercise criticisms and allegations were made that the process had not been done in a proper and professional manner and that there had been irregularities and issues of mismanagement these issues were referred by me to the minister of justice and attorney general of liberia for further investigation he thereupon referred the matter to the general auditing commission upon completion of its investigation the general auditing commission has reported its findings to the minister of justice who has recently announced these findings to the general public the investigative report found that of the us 25 million authorized to be used for the mop up only us 17 million was used and that this was exchanged for an equivalent ld2 6 billion liberian dollars the gac report also provides accounting evidence that the amount of ld2 6 billion liberian dollars was deposited into the central bank however major concerns were raised surrounding several cbl listed businesses that are denying that they participated in the mop up exercise as well as other cbl listed businesses that were found not to be in existence at the time of the gac audit the report also found major discrepancies and unexplained variances in the accounting records of the cbl the minister of justice and attorney general has now requested the liberia anti corruption commission to investigate these irregularities the aim of this exercise is to determine criminal liability all those found criminally liable will face the full weight of the law my fellow citizens all of these reports and lapses point to a major lack of systems and controls at the central bank of liberia and call into question the ability of its present leadership to effectively revamp its internal mechanisms to provide greater accountability and professionalism so that confidence and credibility would be restored to the institution to provide the opportunity for the central bank to have a new direction i have accepted the resignation of the deputy governor for economic policy the executive governor is scheduled for age related mandatory retirement in the next three months during that period we will work to transition the bank to a new management the new cbl leadership will be recruited by a vetting committee to be established it will be composed of an independent team of professional liberians to be named shortly any qualified liberian interested in becoming a part of this new leadership team may submit applications to the vetting committee whether they are resident in liberia or abroad and regardless of gender or political affiliation meanwhile i will also announce a new board of governors next week my fellow citizens my government will shortly announce a series of policy measures that are intended to stabilize our economy in the short term and position it for growth in the medium to long term we are working with stakeholders on measures that are intended to bring down prices we are working to attract new investments in agriculture and we are working to improve our business climate to reduce the costs and hurdles of doing business in liberia we are privileged to have the support of the united nations the african union and ecowas as well as our other international partners who have invested in our future and who continue to offer the assistance and advice we need to improve our country we wish to assure our international development partners that we are committed to upholding the norms of good governance soon we will welcome a team from the international monetary fund coming to create an imf program tailored for liberia such a program will help us to take the needed steps to stabilize our economy restore confidence in our currency and offer technical assistance to continue social services an imf program requires greater discipline across government budgets we will be introducing salary caps for government workers and asking our legislators to share the burden as well we will review performance and revenues from our state owned enterprises ensuring that leakages or inefficiencies do not undercut the ability of the government to support its people we have seen other african countries including ghana rwanda and senegal benefit from imf programs and i believe liberia can do so as well my fellow citizens we liberians should work together in our attempts to tackle our toughest problems and seek to make the choices that will lead to changes that have broad positive effects for our country to attract investors and create jobs for our people we need to start reforms now that will pay off in the future my government is committed to the pro poor agenda that will lift up all of our people not only a few education and healthcare are at the heart of our agenda but we are also prioritizing roads and infrastructure to grow economic opportunity even as we build a better future we are addressing the problems of the past that still cast shadows over our people s lives we are implementing land reform and local governance laws passed by our legislature last year and we are supporting dialogue at the local level with assistance from international partners that advances reconciliation and unity we are also strengthening our legal system training magistrates and judges and shortening pre trial detention to improve access to justice my fellow citizens we intend to intensify our fight against corruption but as we battle corruption our fight will be based on the facts and the evidence of corrupt activities that is adduced by reports from audits that have been professionally conducted rather than mere perceptions and unsubstantiated allegations in the next several days my government will begin the review of all general auditing commission audits over the past 10 years and will commence legal actions against every person that is implicated in these audit reports anyone found culpable will face the full force of the law in this same spirit my government also intends to contract international auditing and investigative firms to go after all monies and resources that were illegally taken from liberia over the last 10 years we must all take the fight against corruption to a new level as a form of social justice for all our people my fellow citizens our national dialogue must be based on truth facts and evidence and our national discourse must also be civil in this age of social media let us use this medium as a resource for nation building and the promotion of peace rather than a tool of national destruction my fellow citizens article 17 of the liberian constitution deals with the rights of all citizens to peaceful assembly as well as the right to present petitions to their government for the sake of clarity i would like to quote article 17 in its entirety all persons at all times in an orderly and peaceable manner shall have the right to assemble and consult upon the common good to instruct their representatives to petition the government or other functionaries for the redress of grievances and to associate fully with others or refuse to associate in political parties trade unions and other organizations my fellow citizens in closing l once again wish to pledge my absolute commitment to the protection of each and every right and freedom granted to each and every one of you under our constitution it is the use of these freedoms that will define us as a people it is our toleration of political opposition and opposing ideas that will enrich our national dialogue and discourse it is our ability to manage this culture of freedom and tolerance for criticism that can sustain our peace it is reconciliation and social justice for all liberians that will bring us all together to face and overcome our difficult moments god bless us all and bless liberia our native land
egyptian banks are expected to record a strong loan growth of 22 5 during 2019 as macroeconomic conditions improve and lower interest rates boost demand simultaneously government s share of total loans will remain sizeable but decline gradually in the medium term as its austerity drive progresses and private sector activity picks up according to fitch solution africa monitor north africa june 2019 report issued on tuesday in libya s case the report indicates that libyan national army lna commander general khalifa haftar s advance toward tripoli threatens to exacerbate the country s civil conflict and trigger further refugee outflows haftar appears to be either looking to expand and consolidate his territorial control or pressure the rival government of national accord in tripoli into political concessions on the other hand the report forecasts that morocco s current account deficit will widen to 5 1 of the gdp in 2019 from an estimated 4 0 of the gdp in 2018 while gdp growth is to record to 2 9 and 3 2 in 2019 and 2020 respectively daily news egypt took a dive into the report to understand the latest economic and political risks for the north african region egypt remains on right track fitch believes that egyptian banks look set to record strong loan growth over 2019 due to the witnessed improvement in macroeconomic conditions with declining inflation easing pressures on local households and businesses and a more competitive exchange rate boosting exports regarding monetary policy the report cites that the central bank of egypt cbe has resumed its monetary easing cycle cutting interest rates by 100 basis points bps at its latest policy meeting on february 14 2019 with the aim of boosting credit expansion to promote private sector activity the report forecasts that cbe will pause its easing cycle around mid 2019 to allow for the inflationary impact of subsidy cuts to feed through consequently the agency revised their forecast for egyptian banks loan growth to 22 5 in 2019 from the previous 18 1 this also reflects the steady acceleration in loan growth seen over the second half of 2018 from 15 3 year over year y o y in july to 22 8 at the latest reading in november we nevertheless continue to highlight risks of global financial volatility returning and higher oil prices which could yet return a hawkish bias to the cbe s policy trajectory the report indicates over the medium term fitch notes that the government is looking to introduce a new tax law on sovereign debt holdings which could weigh on banks interest margins unless they divert a greater share of their liquidity toward loans this may serve to encourage loan growth in the years ahead should demand from high quality borrowers pick up sufficiently to facilitate such a shift in november 2018 several reports about a proposed change to how banks account for their income from government debt and that the new tax method will require accounting for income from treasuries as part of taxable income which would result in banks having to reallocate costs to match revenues according to the report the government s share of total loans will remain sizeable but decline gradually in the years ahead crowding out of the private sector remains an issue as credit demand from the government which accounted for 30 9 of total loans in november remains strong the growth in loans to the government averaged 36 5 in the first 11 months of 2018 as the fiscal deficit looks set to narrow only gradually we expect continued expansion in this segment over the next several years albeit at a decelerating pace meanwhile we believe private sector loan growth will pick up significantly as cost pressures ease borrowing costs reduce and the government continues to invest heavily in infrastructure credit extension to industry trade services and households rose by 8 0 27 4 9 7 and 18 6 respectively in november 2018 suggesting this dynamic is already playing out the report adds furthermore deposits will also expand although at a slower pace than loans strong economic activity and falling unemployment coupled with lower inflation will boost egyptians real incomes and likely raise saving rates we highlight that much of the population still remains unbanked which means there is substantial room for organic growth in lenders deposit bases over the coming years it is estimated that around 10 15 only of the egyptian population are banked though a higher rate in the range of 30 35 is estimated when taking into account individual savings at post offices the cbe s easing cycle will cap gains to some extent however fitch expects the pace of cuts to be gradual keeping real rates relatively attractive in the near to medium term overall the agency forecasts deposit growth at 15 0 in 2019 marking a slight increase from an estimated 14 5 in 2018 consequently a gradual increase in egypt s loan to deposit ratio is to be expected however at an estimated 45 8 in the third quarter q3 of 2018 and this remains among the lowest levels regionally concerning banks asset quality the report indicates that it has remained relatively high despite a challenging macroeconomic environment non performing loans npls stood at 4 4 of total loans as per the cbe data from q3 of 2018 having fallen from 11 0 in 2011 partly the result of npl write offs in terms of foreign exchange fx exposure fitch believes that egyptian banks have limited exposure to currency risks with foreign assets accounting for less than 10 of the total meanwhile the overall capital adequacy ratio of egyptian banks has improved from 14 0 in december 2016 to 15 6 in june 2018 egyptian pound set for further stability the report forecasts that the egyptian pound is likely to remain fairly stable in 2019 amid robust economic growth an improving external position and still attractive real interest rates in the short term three to six months the report indicates that the pound appreciation against the united states dollar in recent weeks as a result of reduced global financial volatility and renewed foreign interest in egyptian debt we expect the unit to remain fairly stable over the next few months amid slowing global financial tightening and reduced fears of a global growth correction however fitch foresees that as the cbe has now phased out its repatriation mechanism which previously had served to limit exchange rate volatility consequently somewhat greater movement in the pound moving forward is expected on the long term the agency retains our view for relative pound stability throughout the next six to 24 months while the cbe s likely resumption of its monetary easing cycle will put downside pressure on the unit we highlight that the pace of cuts is likely to prove gradual keeping real rates relatively attractive the report cites political instability as a downside risk to egypt s ongoing economic recovery and by extension the value of the pound while not our core view popular unrest could spread as a result of still challenging conditions for egyptian households and businesses and continued political repression in turn this could deter tourists from travelling to the country and also discourage the government from implementing further fiscal consolidation measures the latter would weigh on business confidence foreign investment and dollar inflows and thus cause faster than expected depreciation of the pound in addition large scale outflows of portfolio investments remain a concern in the event of a global growth correction and resultant risk off sentiment said the report libya oil prices ease deficit tripoli offensive increase risks of conflict escalation fitch report indicates that the libyan national army lna commander general khalifa haftar s advance toward tripoli threatens to exacerbate the country s civil conflict and trigger further refugee outflows the report explains that haftar appears to be either looking to expand and consolidate his territorial control or pressure the rival government of national accord gna in tripoli into political concessions should haftar be aiming for sustained territorial expansion then risks of conflict escalation would heighten dramatically both in the capital and elsewhere where lna forces may now be stretched too thin to fight off rival militias despite the ongoing conflict libya s fiscal deficit will gradually narrow over the coming quarters supported by higher oil revenues as recorded by the tripoli based authorities the majority of libya s tax revenue comes from oil and there is limited scope for any non oil revenue increases according to the report libya s crude oil production has been climbing over the past couple of years averaging 1 1m barrels per day b d in november 2018 its highest level since 2013 the report forecasts that libya s production will average 1 3m b d in 2019 and 1 35m b d day in 2020 higher than the 1m b d level recorded in 2018 concurrently oil prices are set to continue heading higher the decision by opec to cut 1 2m b d of supply as of january 2019 will help maintain a floor under brent and set the stage for gains in the new year as such our fitch oil and gas team forecasts brent to average 75 per barrel bbl for 2019 implying significant gains from current spot price levels of around 60 bbl morocco account deficit to widen eurozone weakness to curb growth fitch solutions believe morocco s current account deficit will widen to 5 1 of the gdp in 2019 from an estimated 4 0 of the gdp in 2018 according to the report the main driver is the widening of the goods trade deficit on the back of weak external demand and a rising import bill which would be mitigated by tourism and remittances the report forecasts that investor sentiment will remain broadly positive supported by robust external support and low short term external debt obligations by regional standards furthermore fitch expects morocco s current account deficit to grow in 2019 to 5 1 of the gdp mostly on the back of a widening goods trade deficit this would be noticeably larger than our 2018 estimate of 4 0 of the gdp but somewhat below the 10 year historical average of 5 6 of the gdp we at fitch solutions have revised down morocco s 2019 and 2020 growth forecasts to 2 9 and 3 2 respectively from 3 3 in both years on the back of a deteriorating growth outlook for the eurozone the report indicates algeria the transition question remains on april 2019 algeria s president abdelaziz bouteflika 82 announced his resignation after nearly two decades in power according to the report the move follows over a month of widespread protests across the country which began in response to the president s decision to run for a fifth term in office protests have since evolved into a wider expression of disapproval of the ruling elite composed of an opaque mix of military and business leaders as well as the president s close circle of the ruling elite fitch solutions forecasts that bouteflika s accelerated exit may have been the result of growing pressure from the military leadership with army chief of staff general ahmed gaid salah having repeatedly called for the president s resignation over the past week rather than signalling intensified rivalry between the military leadership and the executive branch of government therefore they believe the move points to continued relative cohesion within the political elite who appears to be looking for a way to grant just enough concessions to placate protesters while still maintaining control over the post bouteflika political transition

us is winning trade war with china for now the ongoing battle between the united states and china for economic supremacy isn t only being fought in the gilded ballrooms of washington as trade negotiators from either side parry over automobile parts content intellectual property rights government subsidies and the like casualties and victories are also borne out over the decks of hulking freighters that carry the commodities which make up the nuts and bolts of international trade indeed shipping statistics are often sought by economics and traders trying to predict the health of a country s economy or the world economy the baltic dry index bdi is one such leading indicator another is the purchasing managers index pmi pmis are a monthly survey of supply chain managers across 19 industries an economy with a pmi of over 50 is considered to be growing under 50 means an economy is treading water or possibly drowning this article is concerned with the baltic dry index and other shipping statistics such as cargo volumes through west coast ports that we can use to determine who at this stage china or the us is winning the trade war the overall conclusion we at ahead of the herd came up with is that the united states is winning in terms of raw economic data but at a cost to both economies of roughly 165 billion in two way trade the losers also include us consumers who are paying more for imported goods and companies in both countries that can t afford 25 tariffs for an extended period of time baltic dry index created by the london based baltic exchange the baltic dry index is a measure of supply and demand for bulk cargo such as iron ore lumber coal grain etc demand for such bulk shipped as opposed to containerized cargo raw materials is a predictor of future economic growth for example a country that is expanding its steel output will order more iron ore and coal which will increase the demand for shipping these commodities therefore an expanding or contracting bdi is considered to be a leading indicator of industrial production and economic activity the bdi is calculated by assessing multiple shipping rates across 20 routes for each vessel category capesize vessels weighing over 100 000 dead weight tonnes dwt these ships cannot go through the panama canal panamax ships 60 000 80 000 dwt that can go through the panama canal and supramaxes or handymaxes similar in size to a panamax but with specialized loading discharging equipment members of the baltic exchange contact dry bulk shippers worldwide in order to gather the prices of each raw material included in the index then calculate an average price for each the bdi is issued daily those that follow the baltic dry index diligently can glean precious information in which to make investment decisions that few investors are aware of for example the bdi is known to have predicted the 2008 recession when the prices of key commodities in the index suddenly dropped the bdi has also been shown to correlate with stock market indices the movement of the baltic dry index usually shows up around 25 trading days later in the machinations of the s p 500 which is pretty useful as it can help determine when to buy or sell equities a recent article in 321gold shows a graph whereby the bdi and the s p 500 are closely correlated except for january and february 2019 when the lines diverge ie a significant drop in the bdi didn t show up in the s p but the outlier event explained the author was likely the collapse of a tailings dam in brazil which suddenly meant a large decrease in the shipping of ore from vale s minas gerais mine right now the bdi is moving higher which could signal a leg up in the s p 500 if the correlation holds we can also use the bdi to analyze the trade war the index rose to a 2018 high last september but it dropped sharply over 50 in the first two months of the year to the lowest in two years due to declining demand for commodities particularly china the world s largest commodities consumer why would that be well there are two factors at play the first is slowed shipments between china and the us in 2019 as tariffs first introduced in july of 2018 started kicking in many shippers throughout 2018 tried shipping as much product as they could before an increase in tariff rates from 10 to 25 more about that below the second as mentioned is vale s iron ore tailings disaster the two factors account for the decline in the bdi for january and february an article in seeking alpha said february was likely the bottom for shipping rates with some capesize vessels being chartered for under the break even rate of 15 000 a day or more indeed the bdi has risen since then and is currently sitting at just over 1 000 note the five year bdi hit an all time low in the beginning of 2016 which correlates to the bottom of the 2012 16 mining bear market weak global growth now that we understand what the bdi is and how it can be used as an analytical tool we turn to the state of the global economy investors are not only worried about the effects of the trade war on global trade they are also concerned it is weighing on global economic growth what is the state of the world economy what can shipping statistics tell us about where the economy is heading nearly a year into the trade war between china and the us observers are starting to see it in more geopolitical terms no longer is this about tariffs on steel and soybeans it s morphed into a fight over technology ie the conflict with huawei and zte rare earths are being introduced as possible pawns and it can even be framed as the battle for global supremacy between the planet s leading economic and military contenders the united states and china witness the constant tensions in the south china sea china s unsuccessful role in containing north korea and its controversial belt and road initiative which seeks to create a china centric trading block in southern asia to counter us influence the trade war is spilling over into other areas too equity markets are in turmoil stocks of us multinationals have declined and the price of oil ended its worst week of the year last friday us and chinese consumers are having to pay more for imports which is likely to shrink consumption and weigh on each s gdp according to the federal reserve bank of new york the latest round of tariffs will cost the average american household 831 this year in short it s not looking good bank of america merrill lynch recently warned that increased tensions may impact markets severely in a note to clients stating rather ominously the most important point to grasp is whether the trade war is just about trade or instead we are just witnessing the early innings of the most important geopolitical conflict of our time as quoted in yahoo finance cnn paints an equally foreboding picture noting in an article on sunday that treasury yields are down and that global economic data has disappointed which could easily lead to another stock market downturn once the rot sets in escalating tensions between the united states and china clearly pose a problem businesses are saying that new rounds of tit for tat tariffs will hit their bottom lines while economists warn of global ripple effects the situation is made worse by the fact that there s no end to the fight in sight goldman sachs analysts said last week that if the united states moves forward with threatened tariffs on all remaining imports from china it would push the us stock market down an additional 4 markets have already been rattled by trade fears the dow just declined for the fifth straight week its longest weekly losing streak in nearly eight years but it s not just about whether markets wake up to the fact that they d priced in a trade deal that was far from certain apprehension over trade is now magnifying other signs of weakness resurfacing concerns about slowing global growth that dominated markets in december recent economic data has revealed key soft spots manufacturing in europe and china appears weak germany s economy appears to have slowed this quarter to little more than a crawl according to research firm capital economics which pointed to manufacturing and business climate figures the chances of britain crashing out of the european union without a deal have also increased meanwhile the yield on the benchmark 10 year us treasury fell to its lowest level last thursday since late 2017 bond yields tend to fall when investors are worried about sluggish growth then there s us oil which fell nearly 7 last week to 58 63 a barrel it was the worst week in five months but there s more orders for durable goods are down and the pmis of the countries that count are frankly sucking wind wolf street called the us pmi figure the cleanest of the dirty shirts the finance publication notes that orders for durable goods like cars and appliances have steadily ticked down since december and have shown no growth for three months in a row the pmis for us services and manufacturing in may were the lowest since recessionary 2009 after the data was released gdp forecasts for the second quarter were slashed from 2 2 to 2 in the best case scenario barclays plc to 2 25 to 1 in the worst case jpmorgan chase across the pond in europe germany s pmis have been awful according to a survey at least the us is above 50 the pmi of europe s strongest economy slumped to the mid 40s the lowest since july 2012 near the bottom of the euro debt crisis said wolf street placing trade war concerns at the heart of the problem the manufacturing sector has been weak since february but the pmi survey suggests that the sector s woes intensified in may to mean factories will therefore likely act as an increasing drag on the economy in the second quarter trade wars remained top of the list of concerns among manufacturers alongside signs of slower sales and weaker economic growth both at home and in key export markets the survey said meanwhile china s pmi the one everybody watches also slipped further under the 50 threshold from 49 5 in january to 49 2 in february cnbc however sounds a glimmer of hope noting that china s steel imports for the first two months were pretty close to last year s same period this suggests fairly steady demand and fits with a picture of a chinese economy that has lost some momentum but isn t yet at risk of a serious slowdown tabulating the trade war score of course what we all really want to know is who s winning the trade war on may 6 reuters asked that question and came up with some valuable insights we decided to compare their data to our shipment data to see if they match by and large they do for those having trouble keeping track of all these tariffs a recap the trade war kicked off last july with 34 billion of tariffs on chinese imports this was followed by 16 billion worth last august and another 200 billion in september china matched us duties with its own tariffs on american goods the trump administration threatened to up the tariffs on the september list of products from 10 to 25 but that was suspended pending trade talks the collapse of those talks earlier this month means the 25 rate kicks in june 1 the latest development is that a further 325 billion in chinese imports is being put into motion the result of which is that all chinese imports will become subject to tariffs as for the trade war s impact these are the key takeaways according to reuters in the first quarter of 2019 chinese imports tanked by a third compared to last year s q1 and exports fell by a tenth the sector of chinese exports that has been worst hit is machinery and electrical equipment the trade war has knocked between 0 1 and 0 2 off us gdp but for china it could mean a loss of 0 3 to 0 6 of gdp that doesn t seem like a big difference but in gdp terms it is in the first quarter the chinese economy grew by 6 4 compared to 6 7 in the second quarter of last year the last quarter before tariffs were imposed for the us the equivalent figures are 3 2 versus 2 9 the flow of us imports is being re routed in other words goods that would normally come from china are coming from elsewhere like vietnam south korea and mexico the centre for economic policy a think tank estimates 165 billion in trade has been lost or redirected to avoid tariffs oceangoing freight volumes down from record highs we can utilize shipping statistics to trace the pattern of imports and exports that we see imprinted by the trade war first it s interesting to note that 2018 was a record year for shipments of commodities hit by tariffs the reason is retailers stocking up on goods they knew would get hammered with a 15 increase 10 to 25 if trade talks failed this is called front loading and it shows up in port statistics california s three major ports los angeles long beach and oakland handle about half of the united states containerized cargo 2018 saw a notable trend of more imports coming from china due to front loading and a drop off in us exports to china chinese imports to all three ports increased from 5 4 million containers in 2017 to 5 7 million in 2018 exports to china on the other hand dropped from 881 128 containers to 701 493 containers year on year the ceo of maersk the world s largest containerized shipping company remarked that chinese exports to the us grew 5 10 in the third quarter of 2018 versus a 25 30 fall in us exports to china a record 539 5 billion in chinese goods were imported by the us in 2018 but only 120 3 billion worth of american products were shipped fast forward to the present situation which looks quite a bit different seaborne imports into all three california gateways from china have slipped considerably wall street journal reported container imports into los angeles and long beach declined a combined 10 2 compared to february 2017 the port of oakland saw a 5 drop in volumes trading data evidence shows the united states is substituting chinese made products from those manufactured elsewhere according to s p global market intelligence chinese furniture imports fell 13 5 in the first quarter versus a 37 2 increase in imports from vietnam and a 19 3 hike from taiwan refrigerator imports from china dropped 24 1 but south korea and mexico each exported 32 more fridges to the us tire imports from china were down 28 6 replaced by vietnam s which more than doubled to 141 7 us china trade deficit at 5 year low currently the united states is exporting more to china despite tariffs while importing less from china the result as president donald trump hoped is a lessening of the us trade deficit with china in fact the deficit is at a five year low in particular the chinese are importing more coking coal from the states five times as much in april compared to march even though there are 25 tariffs on us thermal coal and coking coal china has also resumed buying us soybeans not so fast i started this article by asking a simple question who is winning the trade war i wanted to take a bit of a different tack by answering the question with shipping data actual shipments are something tangible and therefore have more value in my opinion than gdp data a pmi or imports and exports shipping stats also give us as investors something to watch for they are important indicators of future economic activity and are therefore ignored at our peril remember those who paid attention to the baltic dry index could have avoided the great recession the us is in fact winning the trade war we see it in the slowed imports of chinese goods and increased exports of us goods with the resultant narrowing of the us china trade deficit shipments from china went bonkers last year as us retailers stocked up before getting whacked by 25 tariffs now those same companies are shunning china and cozying up to south korea vietnam and mexico chinese goods are being replaced that was the whole idea but is this not a pyrrhic victory consider that in order to gain the upper hand over the chinese the trump administration has forced a reduction of 165 billion in two way trade global growth is weak the us pmi is barely holding above 50 ie the us economy growing stock markets are nervous critical minerals are just waiting to be hit by china which has a monopoly on them the us has little to zero production of dozens of these economic and defense critical metals meanwhile us and chinese consumers have to pay a hidden tax on the higher cost of hundreds of imported goods granted the trade war winning formula is being reflected in us economic stats which at first blush look pretty good in the first quarter the us economy barreled along at 3 2 a year ago it was at 4 2 economic growth peaked in 2014 at close to 6 when obama was president then dropped under 1 as the us election cycle began in 2015 since trump has taken the helm the trend line is clearly up employment has fallen to 3 6 which is the lowest since the mid 1960s over 50 years ago african american unemployment is at a record low after hitting an all time high of 26 828 on october 3 2018 the dow jones industrial average traded sideways until april 5 2019 when the closing bell rang on a yearly top of 26 424 the s p 500 is up about 20 since its december low the economy has added over 5 4 million jobs since trump and his team entered the white house after a decade of stagnation real wages hourly pay accounting for inflation have grown 3 2 an economy that shows those kind of numbers usually has high inflation but even here the united states is well within a comfortable range at 1 6 it s actually below the fed s 2 target june will mark the 10th year of a growing us economy but this economy is built on a weak foundation based on tax cuts and high corporate earnings derived from stock buybacks in december 2017 the trump administration passed the tax cuts and jobs act the legislation slashed the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 and the top individual tax rate shrunk to 37 it also cut income tax rates doubled the standard deduction and eliminated personal exemptions but the most important change concerned the repatriation of profits that us corporations were holding overseas under the tax cuts and jobs act companies were incentivized to bring their overseas profits to the united states where they would be taxed at a one time rate of 15 5 which is lower than the regular corporate tax rate of 21 suddenly these companies found themselves flush with cash and they needed to find a way to spend it stock buybacks are a good option because they allow management to stuff cash back into the company indirectly by reducing the share float it makes them their earnings per share look good which drive fat compensation packages in 2018 us companies set a record 1 trillion in stock buybacks as an example of how companies have used buyback programs to improve their metrics consider apple since 2012 apple s buyback program cut its outstanding shares by one quarter doubled its earnings per share and ended up with a 150 increase in its share price there is clearly a strong connection between repatriation stock buybacks and higher than normal corporate earnings is it any coincidence that half a trillion dollars worth of overseas profits were brought home in 2018 during which time the united states saw the most share buybacks in history along with sky high corporate earnings data firm refinitiv estimates profit growth among s p 500 companies at 23 in 2018 s p stocks were up 13 in the first quarter of 2019 the best q1 performance since 1998 and a booming stock market i don t think so and even though repatriation has run its course buybacks are popular on wall street share repurchases have increased every quarter of the last four quarters and the buying frenzy is set to continue lower taxes and high corporate earnings are certainly helping the us economy to grow according to the congressional budget office cbo about 0 3 of the 2 9 gdp growth in 2018 can be attributed to the 1 5 trillion tax cut the repatriation of corporate profits appears to be a good thing the problem is in allowing companies to keep more of their profits the government is depriving itself of tax revenue the cbo forecasts the 1 5 trillion tax cut will add 1 5 trillion to the national debt over the next 11 years how will the government pay for such massive ticket items as the 2 trillion infrastructure plan just proposed print more money i guess and heave it onto the mountainous debt pile the trump administration like the reagan adminstration before it believes that robust corporate earnings will put more money into the hands of workers the trickle down effect to spend but that isn t happening cnn quotes the congressional joint committee on taxation in reporting that two thirds of taxpayers paid around 100 less in taxes in 2018 about the cost of a nice dinner for two in fact the tax cuts worked out much better for those making between 500 000 and a million who were an average 5 2 richer compared to households making under 50 000 in 2018 whose after tax income rose by just 0 6 the rich are indeed getting richer granted consumer spending is up 12 7 trillion in the first quarter of 2018 to 13 trillion in q1 2019 which is important because it represents two thirds of the us economy but as we discovered when researching what is behind the us economy s strength this just means more consumer debt us credit card debt skyrocketed to 870 billion in 2018 a new record so the us is winning the trade war for now but what happens after all the overseas profits have been blown on share buybacks and the tariffs really begin to bite the us white shirt of the dirty shirt western economies might become a tad bit soiled worse what if the trade war turns nasty and beijing decides to pull out the big guns china could stop buying us treasuries which would cause the us dollar to plunge or slap embargoes on critical metals like rare earths and lithium crucial to the new electric economy and the defense of the nation conclusion economist stephen roach has an interesting take on the trade war writing in project syndicate roach invokes history to expose a parallel between the us trade conflict with japan in the 1980s and the current battle with china he argues that the united states should really look in the mirror and address its own problems notably the low us savings rate before throwing stones at asia back in the 1980s japan was portrayed as america s greatest economic threat not only because of allegations of intellectual property theft but also because of concerns about currency manipulation state sponsored industrial policy a hollowing out of us manufacturing and an outsize bilateral trade deficit in its standoff with the us japan ultimately blinked but it paid a steep price for doing so nearly three lost decades of economic stagnation and deflation today the same plot features china notwithstanding both countries objectionable mercantilism japan and china had something else in common they became victims of america s unfortunate habit of making others the scapegoat for its own economic problems like japan bashing in the 1980s china bashing today is an outgrowth of america s increasingly insidious macroeconomic imbalances in both cases a dramatic shortfall in us domestic saving spawned large current account and trade deficits setting the stage for battles 30 years apart with asia s two economic giants i agree with roach as much as i am comforted in knowing that america is so far beating china i can t help thinking is this all going to come back and bite us in the end by richard rick mills www

egyptian banks are expected to record a strong loan growth of 22 5 during 2019 as macroeconomic conditions improve and lower interest rates boost demand simultaneously government s share of total loans will remain sizeable but decline gradually in the medium term as its austerity drive progresses and private sector activity picks up according to fitch solution africa monitor north africa june 2019 report issued on tuesday in libya s case the report indicates that libyan national army lna commander general khalifa haftar s advance toward tripoli threatens to exacerbate the country s civil conflict and trigger further refugee outflows haftar appears to be either looking to expand and consolidate his territorial control or pressure the rival government of national accord in tripoli into political concessions on the other hand the report forecasts that morocco s current account deficit will widen to 5 1 of the gdp in 2019 from an estimated 4 0 of the gdp in 2018 while gdp growth is to record to 2 9 and 3 2 in 2019 and 2020 respectively daily news egypt took a dive into the report to understand the latest economic and political risks for the north african region egypt remains on right track fitch believes that egyptian banks look set to record strong loan growth over 2019 due to the witnessed improvement in macroeconomic conditions with declining inflation easing pressures on local households and businesses and a more competitive exchange rate boosting exports regarding monetary policy the report cites that the central bank of egypt cbe has resumed its monetary easing cycle cutting interest rates by 100 basis points bps at its latest policy meeting on february 14 2019 with the aim of boosting credit expansion to promote private sector activity the report forecasts that cbe will pause its easing cycle around mid 2019 to allow for the inflationary impact of subsidy cuts to feed through consequently the agency revised their forecast for egyptian banks loan growth to 22 5 in 2019 from the previous 18 1 this also reflects the steady acceleration in loan growth seen over the second half of 2018 from 15 3 year over year y o y in july to 22 8 at the latest reading in november we nevertheless continue to highlight risks of global financial volatility returning and higher oil prices which could yet return a hawkish bias to the cbe s policy trajectory the report indicates over the medium term fitch notes that the government is looking to introduce a new tax law on sovereign debt holdings which could weigh on banks interest margins unless they divert a greater share of their liquidity toward loans this may serve to encourage loan growth in the years ahead should demand from high quality borrowers pick up sufficiently to facilitate such a shift in november 2018 several reports about a proposed change to how banks account for their income from government debt and that the new tax method will require accounting for income from treasuries as part of taxable income which would result in banks having to reallocate costs to match revenues according to the report the government s share of total loans will remain sizeable but decline gradually in the years ahead crowding out of the private sector remains an issue as credit demand from the government which accounted for 30 9 of total loans in november remains strong the growth in loans to the government averaged 36 5 in the first 11 months of 2018 as the fiscal deficit looks set to narrow only gradually we expect continued expansion in this segment over the next several years albeit at a decelerating pace meanwhile we believe private sector loan growth will pick up significantly as cost pressures ease borrowing costs reduce and the government continues to invest heavily in infrastructure credit extension to industry trade services and households rose by 8 0 27 4 9 7 and 18 6 respectively in november 2018 suggesting this dynamic is already playing out the report adds furthermore deposits will also expand although at a slower pace than loans strong economic activity and falling unemployment coupled with lower inflation will boost egyptians real incomes and likely raise saving rates we highlight that much of the population still remains unbanked which means there is substantial room for organic growth in lenders deposit bases over the coming years it is estimated that around 10 15 only of the egyptian population are banked though a higher rate in the range of 30 35 is estimated when taking into account individual savings at post offices the cbe s easing cycle will cap gains to some extent however fitch expects the pace of cuts to be gradual keeping real rates relatively attractive in the near to medium term overall the agency forecasts deposit growth at 15 0 in 2019 marking a slight increase from an estimated 14 5 in 2018 consequently a gradual increase in egypt s loan to deposit ratio is to be expected however at an estimated 45 8 in the third quarter q3 of 2018 and this remains among the lowest levels regionally concerning banks asset quality the report indicates that it has remained relatively high despite a challenging macroeconomic environment non performing loans npls stood at 4 4 of total loans as per the cbe data from q3 of 2018 having fallen from 11 0 in 2011 partly the result of npl write offs in terms of foreign exchange fx exposure fitch believes that egyptian banks have limited exposure to currency risks with foreign assets accounting for less than 10 of the total meanwhile the overall capital adequacy ratio of egyptian banks has improved from 14 0 in december 2016 to 15 6 in june 2018 egyptian pound set for further stability the report forecasts that the egyptian pound is likely to remain fairly stable in 2019 amid robust economic growth an improving external position and still attractive real interest rates in the short term three to six months the report indicates that the pound appreciation against the united states dollar in recent weeks as a result of reduced global financial volatility and renewed foreign interest in egyptian debt we expect the unit to remain fairly stable over the next few months amid slowing global financial tightening and reduced fears of a global growth correction however fitch foresees that as the cbe has now phased out its repatriation mechanism which previously had served to limit exchange rate volatility consequently somewhat greater movement in the pound moving forward is expected on the long term the agency retains our view for relative pound stability throughout the next six to 24 months while the cbe s likely resumption of its monetary easing cycle will put downside pressure on the unit we highlight that the pace of cuts is likely to prove gradual keeping real rates relatively attractive the report cites political instability as a downside risk to egypt s ongoing economic recovery and by extension the value of the pound while not our core view popular unrest could spread as a result of still challenging conditions for egyptian households and businesses and continued political repression in turn this could deter tourists from travelling to the country and also discourage the government from implementing further fiscal consolidation measures the latter would weigh on business confidence foreign investment and dollar inflows and thus cause faster than expected depreciation of the pound in addition large scale outflows of portfolio investments remain a concern in the event of a global growth correction and resultant risk off sentiment said the report libya oil prices ease deficit tripoli offensive increase risks of conflict escalation fitch report indicates that the libyan national army lna commander general khalifa haftar s advance toward tripoli threatens to exacerbate the country s civil conflict and trigger further refugee outflows the report explains that haftar appears to be either looking to expand and consolidate his territorial control or pressure the rival government of national accord gna in tripoli into political concessions should haftar be aiming for sustained territorial expansion then risks of conflict escalation would heighten dramatically both in the capital and elsewhere where lna forces may now be stretched too thin to fight off rival militias despite the ongoing conflict libya s fiscal deficit will gradually narrow over the coming quarters supported by higher oil revenues as recorded by the tripoli based authorities the majority of libya s tax revenue comes from oil and there is limited scope for any non oil revenue increases according to the report libya s crude oil production has been climbing over the past couple of years averaging 1 1m barrels per day b d in november 2018 its highest level since 2013 the report forecasts that libya s production will average 1 3m b d in 2019 and 1 35m b d day in 2020 higher than the 1m b d level recorded in 2018 concurrently oil prices are set to continue heading higher the decision by opec to cut 1 2m b d of supply as of january 2019 will help maintain a floor under brent and set the stage for gains in the new year as such our fitch oil and gas team forecasts brent to average 75 per barrel bbl for 2019 implying significant gains from current spot price levels of around 60 bbl morocco account deficit to widen eurozone weakness to curb growth fitch solutions believe morocco s current account deficit will widen to 5 1 of the gdp in 2019 from an estimated 4 0 of the gdp in 2018 according to the report the main driver is the widening of the goods trade deficit on the back of weak external demand and a rising import bill which would be mitigated by tourism and remittances the report forecasts that investor sentiment will remain broadly positive supported by robust external support and low short term external debt obligations by regional standards furthermore fitch expects morocco s current account deficit to grow in 2019 to 5 1 of the gdp mostly on the back of a widening goods trade deficit this would be noticeably larger than our 2018 estimate of 4 0 of the gdp but somewhat below the 10 year historical average of 5 6 of the gdp we at fitch solutions have revised down morocco s 2019 and 2020 growth forecasts to 2 9 and 3 2 respectively from 3 3 in both years on the back of a deteriorating growth outlook for the eurozone the report indicates algeria the transition question remains on april 2019 algeria s president abdelaziz bouteflika 82 announced his resignation after nearly two decades in power according to the report the move follows over a month of widespread protests across the country which began in response to the president s decision to run for a fifth term in office protests have since evolved into a wider expression of disapproval of the ruling elite composed of an opaque mix of military and business leaders as well as the president s close circle of the ruling elite fitch solutions forecasts that bouteflika s accelerated exit may have been the result of growing pressure from the military leadership with army chief of staff general ahmed gaid salah having repeatedly called for the president s resignation over the past week rather than signalling intensified rivalry between the military leadership and the executive branch of government therefore they believe the move points to continued relative cohesion within the political elite who appears to be looking for a way to grant just enough concessions to placate protesters while still maintaining control over the post bouteflika political transition

clash of civilisations theme south china morning post scholars with the peterson institute for international economics think tank in washington just back from china said on tuesday that their official reception at china s zhongnanhai leadership compound was markedly less hospitable than in years past we got a 50 minute non stop lecture pausing only for translation about this being a clash of civilisations said adam posen the group s president who declined to say which member of the politburo they met with and some of it was a bit extreme peterson institute scholars said this lecture by

reduce china s trade surplus with the united states kevin rudd opinion trump hands china an easy win in the trade war the new york times together with recent moves against the chinese telecom company huawei presumably intended to pressure beijing further the possibility of negotiating a revised agreement that is more accommodating to american interests is now very slim instead what i have seen in beijing over the last few weeks is a country moving in exactly the opposite direction even if a trade deal with the united states is still possible some in the chinese leadership are now starting to ask why bother they argue that in technology investment foreign policy national security and human rights the trump administration has made it clear that it has embarked on a more adversarial position toward china so why should beijing expend any more political capital on a trade deal perhaps it s better in china s view to cut its losses now and get ready for the next cold war comment i would add that the events of the last year have only confirmed what xi and some others in the leadership and especially the pla believed but were trying to delay as long as possible to build up china s comprehensive national power that the us always intended to keep china down and that some form of conflict was always inevitable china cannot weaponize its u s treasury bonds carnegie endowment for international peace michael pettis a number of recent articles suggest that chinese officials may reduce their purchases of u s government bonds it is very unlikely that china can do so in any meaningful way because doing so would almost certainly be costly for beijing and even if china took this step it would have either no impact or a positive impact on the u s economy 3 official propaganda some of these excerpts are wrong but there is value in reading what they are saying china asks state media to pick battles carefully with long us trade war looming sources say south china morning post internal briefings held this week reflected the chinese leadership s line of thinking that china has to make serious preparations for the worst case scenario of an intense broad based and extended confrontation with the us on the trade technology and geopolitical fronts while also keeping open the option that tensions with washington could ease we have been told not to use the us side generally in our copy because there are many different voices within the us said one state media executive who declined to be identified because the instructions are confidential the idea is that there are people in the us who are against the trade war or the confrontational approach towards china a second source who works as an executive in a state owned enterprise said that the response by beijing to the recent us escalation of trade tensions remains restrained despite an outpouring of nationalistic commentaries in china s state media comment so what does restrained look like at least there are no people shouting slogans in front of the us embassy or trying to smash american shops in china said the state owned enterprise executive us stock market threats self defeating global times china will explore more choices to replace the us stock market we believe there will be lots of markets worldwide that welcome promising chinese enterprises the us shuts a door against china s opening

sweden gui congyou holds a press briefing on the trade war started by the us against china ambassador gui said first i wish to state that whether it is a hot war a cold war a trade war a technology war or whatever kind of war the chinese side firmly opposes them all an observation of the over 5000 years of history of the chinese nation tells us that it is not in our tradition or dna to wage war against other countries peace and harmony is the essence of confucianism of the chinese nation a culture that advocates harmony is in the core values of the chinese nation and it is also the philosophy for development followed by the chinese nation when it comes to trade the idea that harmony and peace brings wealth is the way we approach business it means one can make a fortune through treating others kindly and peacefully ambassador gui said facing foreign invasions and wars imposed by foreign powers the chinese nation never feared retreated or caved instead we rose up and fought back there is no shortage of such examples in china s history our resistance against the barbaric aggressions occupation division and enslavement of western powers since modern times especially the 14 years of the war of resistance against japan is ample proof of that the us side bears full responsibility on the china us trade war as it is unilaterally started by the us since the us started the trade war with china at the beginning of last year the chinese side has been sincerely negotiating with the us out of our commitment to peace and harmony we will continue to be committed to reform and opening up we will continue to deepen reform and open up wider we are ready to open up further to all other countries including sweden we welcome more trade with sweden and greater investment from

safeguard its interests in the arena of trade china has been maintaining social exchanges and encouraging communication at all levels between the two societies including promoting youth think tanks and other exchanges china is aware that to avoid strategic confrontation benign interactions at the national level in the future need solid support of society however some politicians in washington shake the public foundation in the interest of their own political ends trump described russiagate as a total political witch hunt of which he is a victim currently his administration s bigoted moves

and trade pboc mulls scrapping benchmark lending rate governor says caixin the central banker s comment was the latest signal that china is gearing up to make interest rates more market oriented the country has been moving in that direction since 1996 but a two track system remains one track involves interest rates set largely by the market such as the seven day interbank pledged repo rate the other track refers to benchmark deposit and lending interest rates which are set by the central bank economists interviewed by caixin said they think the central bank s first move to unify the interest rate tracks will focus on lending rates rather than deposit rates in consideration of possible market reactions unifying benchmark and market based deposit rates could lead to fiercer competition among banks seeking deposits in turn forcing them to raise rates on loans to companies which would move counter to government efforts to lower borrowing costs amid slowing economic growth

screens showing stock market movements at a securities company in beijing may 20 2019 image lam yik fei the new york times beijing president donald trump s trade war with china has prompted a broad rethinking of how the two economies have become so intertwined leading some manufacturers to trim supply chains in china and american authorities to start cutting off crucial technology for chinese companies now another important area is getting a close look financial markets some trade experts and others urging the trump administration to keep a hawkish stance are discussing whether the white house should curb china s access to wall street chinese companies have raised tens of billions of dollars through american financial markets in recent years steve bannon trump s former chief strategist said there were continuing efforts inside and outside the administration to rethink china s role in american stock markets in part because of a lack of transparency about the ultimate owners of chinese companies the new york stock exchange and nasdaq are breaching their fiduciary responsibility to institutional investors the pension funds of hardworking americans bannon said it s outrageous all of it should be shut down immediately adding fuel to the discussion alibaba the chinese e commerce giant that held a hugely successful initial public offering in new york five years ago is now considering also listing its shares in the semiautonomous chinese city of hong kong according to a person familiar with the matter the person who asked for anonymity because the discussions were not public said the move was not under consideration because of geopolitical worries as the united states ramps up other barriers to trade the outlook for the financial sector on both sides of the pacific is starting to change part of a broader decoupling between the two economies there are growing calls on the u s side for complete decoupling which is causing chinese enterprises to re evaluate their reliance not just on u s technology but also on other u s resources including financial markets said andy mok a senior fellow at the center for china and globalization a leading research group in beijing china has long considered wall street an ally in the late 1990s beijing appealed to senior financial executives to lobby the clinton administration to allow it to join the world trade organization the club of nations that sets global trade rules senior executives of major firms like goldman sachs and the blackstone group often meet with top chinese leaders they have also acted as go betweens counseling trump administration officials on how the trade war is being received both in china and on wall street big banks see the fast growing country as an important source of business even if they have largely been blocked from competing in china s tightly controlled financial system chinese companies have raised tens of billions of dollars through american financial markets in recent years wall street banks have earned big fees from advising chinese businesses on initial public offerings and on acquisitions of american businesses and real estate china is full of amazing entrepreneurs whom we look forward to welcoming said robert h mccooey jr a senior vice president of listing services at nasdaq the trump administration hasn t announced any moves to cut off china and chinese companies continue to enjoy access to american markets just two weeks ago luckin coffee a chinese competitor to starbucks surged in its trading debut in new york though its shares have since traded lower but skepticism is growing among some administration officials and legislators about the presence of chinese companies on american capital markets and in major stock indexes in a letter in april a bipartisan group of senators including marco rubio r fla urged the administration to increase disclosure requirements for chinese companies listed in the united states that pose national security risks or are complicit in human rights abuses the letter named hikvision which the trump administration is considering blocking from purchasing america components over its role in the surveillance and mass detention of uighurs a mostly muslim ethnic minority hikvision is a component of msci stock indexes and its investors have included ubs jpmorgan and the public pension funds of teachers in california and new york americans would likely be very troubled if not outraged to learn that their retirement and other investment dollars are funding chinese companies with links to the chinese government s security apparatus and malevolent behavior the letter read it s not clear how much credence such ideas have with the president and his current advisers but if washington did act china has its own way to strike back chinese entities mainly the country s central bank and sovereign wealth fund own at least 200 billion in shares in the united states by one estimate giving beijing a possible additional weapon should chinese leaders decide to sell china s economic policymakers are aware of that extreme option people familiar with the policymaking said they insisted on anonymity because of the political and diplomatic sensitivity of the issue such a move could shake the american stock market which trump considers a barometer of his success for many years policymakers economists and bankers have asked what might happen to the u s economy should china suddenly dump much of the 1 3 trillion it holds in united states debt selling stocks could be more potent than paring back bonds stock markets tend to respond to smaller sums of money than u s government bonds do because the market for treasury bills is simply so big china is unlikely to dump shares quickly said mark sobel a former longtime treasury official who is now the u s chairman of the london based official monetary and financial institutions forum doing so not only would upset the united states but also could mean selling shares at a loss during a temporary dip in prices which would hurt the investment return on china s assets in my experience china s reserve managers have always acted in a professional manner and sought to promote financial stability sobel wrote in an email in the past chinese government agencies have quietly and gradually sold part of their american stock holdings when they have needed extra dollars to help manage the value of the currency said brad setser an economist at the council on foreign relations in new york chinese firms that start changing their relationship with american financial markets now face questions over whether their moves are trade related shanghai based semiconductor manufacturing international corp a computer chipmaker traded mostly in hong kong is shifting the trading of its american depositary shares from the new york stock exchange to the far less visible over the counter market smic as it is known attributed the decision to low trading volume in its shares in new york smic has been considering this migration for a long time and it has nothing to do with the trade war or with the trans pacific dispute over huawei a chinese tech company smic said in a statement in response to questions the migration requires a long preparation and timing has coincided with the current trade rhetoric which may lead to misconceptions alibaba has long discussed selling its shares in mainland china or hong kong so it is not clear what role if any the trade war had in its considerations jack ma the co founder of alibaba had said at a conference in january last year that he would consider whether to do another stock listing in hong kong for alibaba a hong kong share sale could allow more chinese investors to put their money in a company that many of them use in their daily lives alibaba s stepped up discussions over listing in hong kong were reported earlier by bloomberg with the trade war going on mok at the beijing research group said chinese companies were now more likely to think twice about depending on american financial markets there is no desire on the chinese side for decoupling he said but it is maybe a prudent management decision to reduce risk exposure
what the us china trade war is doing to the world s markets the setback experienced by local investors in may was driven primarily by global concerns related to the escalating us china trade conflict rather than political developments in sa investors remain on edge following the escalation of the us china trade battle apart from raising tariffs on chinese imports the trump administration has also effectively blocked huawei and other firms from using us technology the market is increasingly internalising the indications that the white house s actions are not just motivated by the trade deficit with china but also by longer term strategic competition between the two superpowers the trade spat is therefore unlikely to be resolved immediately however talk of a new cold war is premature as the extensive trade links between the two countries mean both still have an incentive to work together in contrast there was very little trade between the us and the old soviet union chart 1 global equities down on trade uncertainty source refinitiv moving parts global trade has many moving parts making it difficult to judge what the exact impact will be we have already seen declines in us imports from china following the imposition of tariffs on certain goods last year while imports from a country like vietnam have surged presumably as some companies are shifting production there and elsewhere to avoid tariffs this is china s loss and vietnam s gain nonetheless the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd the club of rich nations has warned that overall growth in global trade is set to slow to 2 below the growth rate of the global economy in other words trade is becoming a smaller component of total economic activity that by itself is not a problem unless it creates uncertainty that results in firms postponing hiring or investment decisions you could say the same thing about brexit which continues to consume the uk s ruling class and has cost prime minister theresa may her job inflation still low us consumers have also seen some price increases over the past year due to higher tariffs and now an expanded set of goods could see price increases but overall us consumer inflation remains low for a number of reasons these include the fact that while chinese imports are significant most goods sold in the us are not manufactured in china the dollar has also strengthened this year putting downward pressure on imported prices finally us consumers spend much more on services than on goods indeed the minutes of the previous federal reserve fed monetary policy meeting released with a three week lag and always scrutinised by investors show a greater focus on inflation being too low rather than too high the fed sees the recent dip in inflation as being driven by transitory factors this might be the case but such temporary factors cannot explain why core inflation has averaged only 1 6 since a 2 target was officially adopted in 2012 one implication is that the fed might have tightened policy too quickly despite trying hard to be gradual there is some evidence to support this view with bank lending cooling in the past few months while the interest rate sensitive housing and vehicle markets have certainly slowed business investment has also moderated institutions like the fed are slow to admit mistakes and the shift to its current patient stance is as much of a mea culpa as we re likely to get at this stage the market is signalling that rate cuts are looming with the us 10 year treasury yield down to 2 3 the lowest level since early 2017 the market might have to wait a while for the patient fed to oblige chart 2 10 year us treasury yield source refinitiv the fed is the single most important central bank in the world anchoring borrowing costs for the world s reserve currency the european central bank ecb the other major central bank also released meeting minutes last week these show that ecb policymakers are concerned that their optimism that growth would pick up later this year has been dented and are discussing additional measures to support the economy other central banks are not sitting still so far this month malaysia new zealand and the philippines have cut while the reserve bank of australia hinted that it would cut at its next meeting in june pretty much a u turn from its position at the start of the year on hold one central bank that remains wedded to its views if less so than before is our reserve bank its monetary policy committee mpc left the repo rate unchanged at 6 75 with two out of five members arguing for a cut the case for lower rates is strong next week we will probably get official confirmation that the economy contracted by around 1 5 in the first quarter this will make it difficult to achieve full year growth rates well above last year s 0 8 indeed the reserve bank now expects growth of only 1 this year down from its previous forecast of 1 3 and while it expects growth to rise to 1 8 next year the risks are to the downside meanwhile data from stats sa show that annual consumer inflation surprisingly dipped in april to 4 4 while most economists expected 4 6 it is the 13th month in the past two years that inflation undershot expectations according to a reuters poll over time one would expect economists to overestimate inflation as frequently as they underestimate it the fact that inflation is persistently lower than expectation is telling a big petrol price hike saw petrol inflation rise to 12 food inflation was surprisingly low especially meat inflation partly due to lower exports following the outbreak of foot and mouth disease food prices are volatile and cyclical and there are already signs that food inflation should rise in coming months core inflation which measures prices for items other than food fuel and energy declined to 4 1 it has been below the mid point of the reserve bank s 4 6 target range since september 2017 and below the upper end of the range since february 2010 it better reflects the underlying inflationary pressures in the economy and as is the case globally firms struggle to pass input cost increases on to consumers this is good for bonds the asset class most sensitive to inflation and bad for domestic equities given that it implies lower margins chart 3 local inflation and rates source refinitiv the reserve bank s forecast is for headline inflation to average 4 5 in 2019 and 5 1 in 2020 down from 4 8 and 5 3 respectively this is much closer to the mid point of the target range and therefore opens the door to a rate reduction the reserve bank s argument for keeping rates high has long rested on four pillars firstly inflation expectations remain close to 6 instead of being anchored close to the mid point of the range secondly growth is being held back by structural factors outside the control of the reserve bank such as load shedding political uncertainty and skills shortages thirdly the rand is vulnerable to sudden depreciation due to shifts in global risk perceptions particularly expectations of us interest rate changes and a weaker rand in turn could feed into higher inflation and finally the current stance is still characterised as broadly accommodative it is the last two arguments that are questionable they imply that the mpc is not nearly as data dependent as it likes to say it is though the rand is indeed vulnerable the fed has clearly signalled that it is on hold but more importantly the pass through of rand weakness to consumer inflation has been persistently weaker than estimated over the past decade and if the repo rate was really at an accommodative level consumer borrowing would be much higher in fact the real repo rate of 2 3 is in line with and not below the reserve bank s already high estimate of the theoretical neutral real interest rate either way the odds of a rate cut have increased while such a move would not by itself lift the economy out of the doldrums every bit helps if combined with policy reforms from the new cabinet it could provide a much needed boost to confidence keep calm the year started off well for local investors with returns closer to what we expect from asset classes longer term may has been a setback with local equities and local listed property in particular pulling back sharply this had nothing to do with the elections or any other political developments but was driven by global concerns stemming from the escalation of the trade conflict as well as a few company specific issues other asset classes are still ahead of cash year to date with local bonds having a good month and global returns still in double digit territory in rand terms diversification has therefore helped this year local investors have experienced a run of disappointments and the recent volatility is likely to compound their despondency but remember that markets typically overreact to headlines and uncertainty and this is probably one of those instances dave mohr is chief investment strategist and izak odendaal an investment strategist at old mutual multi managers brought to you by moneyweb
patriotism would certainly prefer its continuance and application to the great purposes of the public education roads rivers canals and such other objects of public improvement as it may be thought proper to add to the constitutional enumeration of federal powers president thomas jefferson 1806 state of the union message to congress how could democrats guarantee a second trump term come out in favor of so called free trade when walter mondale was nominated by the democratic party to take on ronald reagan in 1984 he uttered in his acceptance speech a single line that did more than anything else that year to lose him the election he said mr reagan will raise taxes and so will i he won t tell you i just did the republicans turned it into a campaign ad and it played over and again dragging mondale so far down that he lost every state in the country except his home state of minnesota what mondale said was true and reagan did raise taxes on working people eleven times but that was still the moment when mondale signed his own political death warrant americans had been bitten badly in the previous decade by inflation and the reagan recession and were in no mood to give more of their hard earned money to the government or anybody else in 2020 trade will be as potent an issue as taxes were in 1984 this election cycle it s starting to look like democrats are about to make the same mistake of not defending the paychecks of working people only this time the democratic quote will be trump won t succeed in bringing home your jobs but neither will i because i support all of the trade agreements that took your jobs in the first place instead the democratic party must return to its pre 1992 progressive protectionist union roots and steal this issue right out of trump s mouth saying that he s not protecting american workers jobs well enough or fast enough they should run hard in 2020 on the progressive caucus s long held position that we use protectionist policies including tariffs to end our trade deficits and bring back home our jobs the disastrous trade deficits we ve been running since the reagan era are damaging to the future of america for a variety of reasons from national security to where the profits from american companies end up to the flattening of american working wages and benefits trump pointed this out in 2016 and as egberto willies points out at dailykos it s a large part of why he s in the white house right now this was not how the founders intended it and it s not how working americans want it yes tariffs will initially raise the price of foreign manufactured goods and that will make it viable for american manufacturers to start up new factories as more manufacturing jobs come to the united states wages will rise american workers know this while nobody wants to pay more for a toaster or a refrigerator with good manufacturing jobs people will have larger paychecks american workers know this too in 1981 in a bow to their wall street and transnational corporate patrons republicans embraced free trade rejecting traditional american protectionist trade policies through the 1980s reagan and george h w bush negotiated nafta and helped kick start the wto while democrats warned us of what was coming tragically in 1992 a new but growing part of the democratic party the democratic leadership council or dlc joined reagan bush when bill clinton said he was going to push and sign reagan s trade deals in that act the democratic party turned their backs on the two centuries of american trade policy that had turned us into the industrial powerhouse of the world beginning the great decline of working people here and american workers know it no matter how much centrist democratic politicians try to ignore it the simple fact is that we no longer in any meaningful way make computers or tvs or clothes or power tools or toys or pretty much anything in the usa except military hardware guns processed food and fracked gas thus when we stimulate our economy by putting money into the pockets of working people they go to walmart and buy things made in asia creating jobs in that part of the world and leaving our wealth in china and american workers know it regardless of the pundits on tv free trade rather than fair trade is a guaranteed ticket to the poorhouse for any fully developed nation and the evidence is overwhelming king henry vii in fact introduced the concept of free trade as something that england should encourage other countries to do while it maintained protectionism as john f kennedy told the nation in his october 13 1960 debate with richard nixon we have to be able to sell abroad more than we consume from abroad if we re going to be able to meet our obligations but the wall street democrats continued to push reagan s policies from the election of 1992 right up to and through the election of 2016 it s been an electoral disaster for example in july 2009 with no evident irony or apparent understanding of how south korea went about becoming a modern economic powerhouse president obama lectured the countries of africa during his visit to ghana as the new york times reported mr obama said that when his father came to the united states his home country of kenya had an economy as large as that of south korea per capita today he noted kenya remains impoverished and politically unstable while south korea has become an economic powerhouse in the same day s newspaper the lead editorial titled tangled trade talks repeated the essence of the mantra of its confused op ed writer thomas l friedman that so called free trade is the solution to a nation s economic ills there are few things that could do more damage to the already battered global economy than an old fashioned trade war the times opined so we have been increasingly worried by the protectionist rhetoric and policies being espoused by politicians across the globe and in this country but south korea did not ride the free trade train to success no country ever has in fact south korean economist ha joon chang details south korea s economic ascent in his brilliant 2008 book bad samaritans the myth of free trade and the secret history of capitalism in 1961 south korea was as obama said as poor as kenya with an 82 per capita annual income and many obstacles to economic strength the country s main exports were primary commodities such as fish and human hair for wigs that s how the korean technology giant samsung started by exporting fish fruits and vegetables today it s one of the world s largest conglomerates by revenue and market capitalization 254 billion in 2017 by throwing out free trade and embracing protectionism during the 1960s south korea managed to do in 50 years what it took the united states 100 years and britain 150 years to do after a military coup in 1961 general park chung hee implemented short term plans for south korea s economic development he instituted the heavy and chemical industrialization program and south korea s first steel mill and modern shipyard went into production in addition south korea began producing its own cars and used import tariffs to discourage imports electronics machinery and chemicals plants soon followed all sponsored or subsidized and tariff protected by the government between 1972 and 1979 the per capita income grew over five times then south korean citizens adopted new protectionist slogans for example it was viewed as civic duty to publicly shame anyone caught smoking foreign cigarettes all money made from exports went into developing industry south korea enacted import bans high tariffs and excise taxes on thousands of products by the 80s south korea was still far from the industrialized west but it had built a solid middle class south korea s transformation was to quote chang as if haiti had turned into switzerland this transformation was accomplished through protecting fledgling industries with high tariffs and subsidies and only gradually opening itself to global completion in addition the government ran or heavily funded many of the larger industries at least until they were globally competitive the government ran or regulated the banks and therefore the credit it controlled foreign exchange and used its currency reserves to import machinery and industrial imports at the same time the government tightly controlled foreign investment in south korea and largely ignored enforcement of foreign patent laws korea focused on exporting basic goods to fuel and protect its high tech industries with tariffs and subsidies had south korea adopted the free trade policies espoused by friedman bill clinton and the new york times it would still be exporting fish and be just as poor per capita as kenya while american voters may not know the details of south korea s rise they understand the principles no matter what the pundits say on tv another favorite friedman free trade example is the success of toyota s lexus luxury car immortalized in his book the lexus and the olive tree but again the reality is quite different than what friedman naively portrays in his book in fact japan subsidized toyota not only in its development but even after it failed terribly in the american markets in the late 1950s in addition early in toyota s development japan kicked out foreign competitors like gm thus because the japanese government financed toyota at a loss for roughly 20 years built high tariff and other barriers to competitive imports and subsidized exports auto manufacturing was able to get a strong foothold and we now think of japanese exports being synonymous with automobiles for about 200 years we understood well the benefits of tariffs subsidized exports and protectionist policies in the united states and american working people still understand them every president from george washington to jimmy carter aggressively used tariffs and regulated foreign investment every president prior to reagan considered free trade particularly in which every other country maintains vat taxes to protect their domestic economies but we don t to be absurd and worked instead for fair trade trade that would benefit america and american workers in his 1978 state of the union address for example president carter said by working closely with our friends abroad we can promote the economic health of the whole world with fair and balanced agreements lowering the barriers to trade despite the inevitable pressures that build up when the world economy suffers from high unemployment we must firmly resist the demands for self defeating protectionism but free trade must also be fair trade and i am determined to protect american industry and american workers against foreign trade practices which are unfair or illegal three years later when ronald reagan came into office as the result of 190 years of alexander hamilton s plan the united states was the world s largest importer of raw materials the world s largest exporter of finished manufactured goods and the world s largest creditor we bought iron ore from other countries and manufactured it into tvs and washing machines here that we then exported to the rest of the world and when countries couldn t afford to buy our manufactured goods we loaned them the money because of reagan clinton s neoliberal free trade we ve completely flipped that upside down we re now the world s largest exporter of raw materials the world s largest importer of finished goods and the world s largest debtor we now export raw materials to china and buy from them manufactured goods and we borrow from them 1 2 trillion as of this moment to do it this by the way is the virtual definition of a third world country democrats need to re embrace hamilton s principles as put into practice in 1793 and largely kept in place until 1993 when clinton signed the nafta agreement that had been negotiated by reagan and bush the congressional progressive caucus knows how to do this and donald trump sure knows the politics of it it s pretty straightforward notwithstanding all the chatter from new democrat democrats and the talking heads on cable news returning to the governing principles the democratic party has held since its creation by thomas jefferson in the 1790s is a bold move no doubt for any president or party to make but they re largely the policies that progressive democrats like ohio s senator sherrod brown have been running and winning on for generations tariffs built america they paid the largest share of the cost of the federal government from the founding of the republic until the civil war two thirds of the federal budget until world war i and about a third at the time of world war ii thus jefferson noted how tariffs were producing surpluses for the united states tariffs paid for 90 percent of his 1806 budget in his 1806 state of the union message to congress the question therefore now comes forward jefferson said to what other objects shall these surpluses be appropriated and the whole surplus of impost after the entire discharge of the public debt and during those intervals when the purposes of war shall not call for them shall we suppress the impost and give that advantage to foreign over domestic manufactures he answered his own rhetorical question a few sentences later pointing out that americans wouldn t want the government to drop the tariffs instead he noted their patriotism would certainly prefer its continuance and application to the great purposes of the public education roads rivers canals and such other objects of public improvement as it may be thought proper to add to the constitutional enumeration of federal powers progressive democrats have been pushing for a return to jefferson until carter protectionist policies ever since bill clinton split apart the party over the issue with his advocacy of nafta in the 1992 election if the democrats want to beat trump they need to get with the progressives trade program in a big strong and fast way democrats must point out that trump is doing protectionism wrong because he s doing his tariffs by executive order which only last as long as his administration does no company is going to build a factory based on that thin assurance and the anti tariff republican party will never pass such a policy trump is screwed in that regard congress should be negotiating our trade agreements in the open and passing them as solid long lasting legislation so companies have multi decade horizons of tariff protections democrats need to return the party to its past mission of putting american workers and the environment first but if the democrats promote free trade in 2020 get ready for four more years of donald trump gloating at us all from 1600 pennsylvania avenue i m for free trade if it becomes the party s mantra will be the 2020

meaningful view of a country s reserves top 10 countries with the biggest forex reserves the foreign reserves are held by the central banks and monetary authorities of a country the reserves fluctuate frequently based on the currency exchange rates international trade and other factors here are the top ten foreign currency reserves by country 10 brazil as of april 2019 the south american nation holds 378 9 billion in foreign exchange reserves including gold sdrs and other reserves brazil is one of the world s largest economies but it has been struggling in the last few years due to rising unemployment and delayed fiscal reforms 9 south korea s korea has 404 billion in reserves as of april 2019 according to the bank of korea it s an export driven economy and is home to electronics giants like samsung and lg electronics s korea s main imports are raw materials such as oil the nation uses its high tech exports to finance the importation of these goods 8 india as per data from the reserve bank of india the country holds 420 5 billion in foreign exchange reserves india s growth is driven by domestic consumption its imports are significantly higher than exports india receives around 70 billion of foreign currency in remittances from indians living abroad every year 7 hong kong hong kong is the semi autonomous special administrative region sar of china it reports separate

foreign exchange reserves in us government securities such as treasury bills china s central bank current holdings of us bonds are over 1 trillion purpose you might be wondering why the us and leading european nations such as germany the united kingdom and france don t feature among the top 10 the primary reason is that they don t need to hoard other countries currencies because their own currencies dollar and euro are the most popular reserve currencies most of the international transactions take place in the us dollar or euro faqs what is the world s strongest currency many would argue that the u s dollar is the world s strongest currency with trillions of dollars in circulation foreign exchange reserves are placed by foreign nations in us bonds and other liabilities for their reliable value what country has the safest currency a safe and reliable currency is dependent on a strong and independent central bank there is debate about which nation has the safest currency but morgan stanley thinks in practice the usd holds the title how much is pakistan s foreign currency reserve foreign exchange reserves of pakistan s reserve banks equal 13 4 billion enough money in practice to finance around three to four months of imports what currency will replace the us dollar it is doubtful that the usd will be replaced as the reserve currency in the near future many banks and foreign governments prefer investing in treasury bills and other us government securities due to their stability and as a reliable store of value how much are india s foreign reserves according to the reserve bank of india the country s foreign currency reserves are 575 billion as of the end of 2020 the foreign exchange reserves of india s central bank consist of the following assets foreign currency assets gold special drawing rights sdrs and reserve tranche position conclusion for many years england ruled the world by its military and its banks the pound was the world s premier and most used currency in the early part of the 20th century particularly after world war i that started to change what the future holds for the dollar is impossible to forecast but for the time being there are few competitors to the us dollar
the prime minister will have to boost spending in his second term even as the government s finances worsen mumbai india with promises to spend vast amounts of money narendra modi won a second term as india s prime minister earlier this month and by a bigger margin than many had predicted that was despite two disastrous economic policy moves and a slowdown in growth but his electoral victory was probably the easy part now once the pomp and circumstance of his inauguration are over he and his bharatiya janata party led coalition will have to deliver on those campaign pledges just as the government s finances deteriorate the party s 2019 manifesto included a raft of expensive spending pledges including 1 4 trillion over five years for infrastructure as well as a significant investment in india s ailing agriculture sector and plans to transform india into a global manufacturing hub india s economy does appear to be in need of a boost economists at the central statistics office estimated gross domestic product gdp grew by 6 6 percent in the last quarter of 2018 down from 7 7 percent in the previous year while the country s gdp data and other statistics have recently come under scrutiny multiple other indicators also hint at trouble ahead car and motorbike sales are down pointing to a decline in consumer spending and foreign direct investment equity inflows are at the lowest in six years but analysts say modi is politically well positioned to implement a host of major economic reforms having secured an overwhelming majority in the lower house the bjp could also capture a majority in the upper house by 2020 as seats become vacant in states that are party strongholds but his single biggest problem in carrying out those plans is that his government is already spending more than it receives in revenues and by a bigger margin than it had predicted its so called fiscal deficit as a proportion to the size of the economy officially stands at 3 4 percent but one unconfirmed media report this month suggested it could have been as high as 4 5 percent in february in april the central government announced that it will borrow 4 4 trillion rupees 63bn in the first six months of the financial year that is an astonishing and unprecedented sum of money which shows just how much fiscal pressure the government is under saurabh mukherjea chief investment officer and founder of marcellus investment managers told al jazeera the government received 15 percent less in tax and other revenues than it had projected between april december 2018 for this reason no rational observer expects the government to go ahead with a spending spree right now says mukherjea indian voters understand this paradigm of pre election generosity followed by a tightening of the purse strings he added need of the hour some economists believe policymakers should pursue large spending programmes regardless of a widening fiscal deficit greater public investment is precisely the need of the hour there s no need for such fiscal orthodoxy r nagaraj an economist at the indira gandhi institute of development research told al jazeera governments should not fear increasing debt in the domestic currency if the funds are used productively inflation is managed and private investment is stimulated he added nagaraj points to india s debt to gdp ratio which at 67 percent according to imf data is one of the lowest among emerging economies and significantly below china s estimated at 253 percent in june 2018 the government should not fritter away its political capital as happened last time but push ahead with projects that could generate jobs and boost the local economy nagaraj added an investment of 1 4 trillion in public infrastructure over five years may seem ambitious given the government s total expenditure in 2018 19 was 352bn however if you include schools dispensaries public transport and hospital in the mix too then this is well within the government s capacity says mukherjea if the government sells roads to private investors much like they have done with airports then gradually this expenditure will look less demanding he added band aid solutions one of the most visible economic crises of recent years is india s distressed rural economy tens of thousands of farmers from across the country marched in the capital as part of a series of protests in november 2018 they wanted higher prices for their crops in a market flooded by cheap imports and blocked exports as the government focussed on taming food inflation they also demanded loan waivers to help relieve high levels of personal debt a big reason why thousands of poor farmers commit suicide every year in response the government pledged an enormous 114 percent increase in funding for the agriculture ministry to help tackle the deepening crisis this interim budget announcement in february included provisions for a new farmers pension scheme an income support guarantee scheme of 86 a year and interest free loans up to 1 437 while in favour of income support schemes to low income groups maitreesh ghatak an economics professor at the london school of economics calls many of these subsidies band aid solutions that do little to address structural problems what we really need is greater institutional and infrastructural investment price reforms and insurance to protect against downside risk he said ghatak believes current proposals are propping up mechanisms that do not encourage farmers to move out of crops that are unprofitable or address why they are not able to receive better prices for their produce in the first place complacent industrial policy in its pledge to double the size of india s economy to 5 trillion by 2025 the government has restated its commitment to its make in india campaign launched in 2014 the programme aims to develop the country s fragile manufacturing sector unlike many other asian economies india is yet to transition from a largely agrarian economy to an industrialised one manufacturing sector s contribution to gdp has stagnated at 15 percent for the past five years bangladesh recently overtook india in this respect according to world bank data india became complacent in the late 1990s says nagaraj when policymakers thought a boom in the country s services sector would leapfrog the workforce from farming to financial services as governments pinned their hopes on india becoming the world s back office many like him hope the government will concentrate on formulating a new industrial policy and foster a better business environment in 1994 china and india spent roughly the same on as a percentage of gdp but china began to promote technological advancement while we left things to market forces today china spends over three times as much as india nagaraj said this must not continue he added calling for greater state involvement in providing long term finance for investment improving local infrastructure and providing technology support however a worldwide economic slowdown and protectionist policies that are shrinking demand for goods in key markets like the united states and parts of europe could hamper new delhi s ambitions to boost manufacturing and double exports manufacturers will need to reclaim the domestic market suggests nagaraj adding that this will help india become a less import dependent economy while supporting the sector s growth a brewing crisis markets responded positively to news of a bjp win expecting it to lead to a period of political stability the administration has received global recognition for its progressive economic reforms the introduction of a national value added tax vat system and new bankruptcy courts helped raise india s position on the world bank s ease of doing business rankings by 65 places in four years but a botched implementation of the vat left many small firms tied up in costly red tape forcing them to let go of staff and modi s shock move in 2016 to pull more than 85 percent of cash from circulation part of an anti corruption drive hurt consumers put the brakes on growth and spooked private investment as seen in a slowdown in new project proposals none of this has hurt the stock market the main bse sensex index is up nearly 10 percent so far this year but many economists point to india s low wage growth and research suggesting rising unemployment as more accurate signs of the poor health of the economy another problem that could trip modi up in his second term is the country s privately owned lenders so called shadow banks or non banking financial companies the central bank the reserve bank of india earlier this month proposed setting minimum financial safety buffers for such companies so they can meet depositors demands a glaring example of the depth of this crisis was last year s collapse of infrastructure leasing and financial services il fs a large shadow bank after a series of defaults by the company the government stepped in and took control of it to prevent the knock on collapse of other lenders meanwhile the proportion of borrowers missing payments at state banks is rising posing yet another economic headache for the new government our version of the lehman brothers collapse is happening right now and should be the government s most pressing concern says mukherjea referring to the credit vacuum created by the fall of il fs but despite the government s rescue of il fs and the rbi injecting 30 3bn into public sector banks analysts warn that the sector will remain a drain on government finances if structural problems continue to be ignored as the new modi government prepares to take office it appears his administration may need to spend more time putting out fires before it can begin building roads

challengers to president trump as of february 2020 only weld remains in the campaign food and farming haven t been high on the list of campaign priorities in recent decades except maybe in iowa but this year that appears to be shifting with the pivotal role that rural voters played in the 2016 election firmly in mind many presidential candidates are zooming in to address the challenges that abound in today s farm country and a number of them are connecting agriculture to other pressing issues notably climate change food insecurity economic development and more we first published this

email us joe biden vice president 2009 2017 u s senator d delaware 1973 2009 as a senator joe biden expressed support for family farmers pushing for limited subsidy payments to big ag transparent country of origin labeling and fair competition we must have a smart and tough trade policy that levels the playing field for farmers in the global economy biden said during a 2007 iowa stop that means we have to fight for fair agreements to keep markets open and review and enforce the trade agreements we have in my administration trade officials will ensure enforcement is a priority as vice president his farm policy moves caught some flak the national sustainable agriculture coalition heavily criticized biden s negotiations for the 2013 farm bill extension which provided 5 billion for commodity subsidies at the expense of smaller reform and aid programs in 2014 corn belt biofuel growers were infuriated when they suspected biden influenced the epa s lowering of the renewable fuel standard although biden s aides rejected those claims according to politico earlier in his congressional career biden three times introduced a bill to prohibit distribution of food to foreign countries under the agricultural trade development and assistance act unless all domestic food assistance programs were adequately provided for that year in 2008 he and two colleagues urged president bush to add an additional 200 million to a 350 million request for emergency food aid funding to iraq in may biden raised hackles when reuters reported that he was crafting a middle ground climate policy in june biden introduced a climate plan that proposes 1 7 trillion in spending and a tax or fee on pollution with the aim of eliminating the nation s net carbon emissions by 2050 with environmental targets similar to the goals of the green new deal in mid july biden unveiled a plan for rural america through investments in agriculture rural economies and infrastructure the plan also

and promote organic agriculture in her four terms in congress she has also proposed a number of bills on agricultural research to advance methods including integrated pest management an alternative to commonly used pesticides early in 2019 gabbard criticized trump s trade wars for hurting farmers stating on social media that they had caused record bankruptcy in farmers and that median farm income was 1 548 in 2018 however politifact revealed that bankruptcy declarations were not at record levels and that her provided dollar amount omitted off farm income which brought the median farm household income to 76 598 in 2018 huffington post reported in mid august that gabbard is one of five democratic candidates who have announced support for a ban on new factory farms in iowa the proposal is part

it s been another risk off session in global markets with equity markets and bond yields lower as investors remain concerned about a prolonged us china trade war the 10 year treasury yield hit its lowest level since september 2017 the 10 year australian government bond fell below the rba s cash rate and nz rates made record lows across the curve as markets anticipated more central bank easing the usd has strengthened against the risk off backdrop and is approaching its highs of the year the nz budget is today market sentiment remains fragile and dominated by us china trade war concerns the current focus among market participants is whether china is going to announce restrictions on exports of its rare earth deposits which are used in a range of consumer goods electronics and military equipment yesterday the chinese state run people s daily issued an editorial entitled united states don t underestimate china s ability to strike back in which it said don t say we didn t warn you in reference to china s willingness to use rare earths as retaliation in the conflict us direct imports of rare earths from china were reasonably small last year at around 180m but they are found in many imported consumer goods on a more positive note the us treasury declined to name china as a currency manipulator in its semi annual report to congress which would have further inflamed the already tense relations between the two countries global equity markets have fallen amidst these continued concerns about the trade war with the s p500 1 lower on the day having been down 1 3 at one stage the

continued to push lower in sympathy with the falls in equities as market conviction on central bank easing increased the 10 year treasury yield reached its lowest level since september 2017 at 2 21 during new york morning trading this left it more than 100bps below the highs reached less than seven months ago us yields have retraced somewhat over the past few hours after a very weak 7 year treasury note auction which tailed almost 2bps suggesting that the big decline in rates may be starting to impact investor demand the 10 year treasury yield is currently 3bps lower on the day at 2 24 while the 3m10y yield curve is 11bps inverted which continues to fuel market chatter about the risks of a us recession market expectations of fed rate cuts have continued to build albeit without any economic data or central bank talk to trigger the moves the market is now pricing an almost 80 chance of a september rate cut with 40bps priced by the end of this year and over three cuts by the end of 2021 the rates market looks reasonably well priced for a series of insurance cuts by the fed in response to the trade conflict but rates will fall further if the us economy were to slip into recession not our expectation triggering a deeper easing cycle from the fed rates markets elsewhere have gone the same way as the us with a 5bp fall in australian and nz government bonds yesterday and a 2bp fall in german bunds overnight to 0 18 the australian 10 year government bond reached 1 48 inverting to the rba cash rate in nz the 10 year swap reached 1 935 with the market now pricing a better than even chance that the ocr falls to 1 by early next year yesterday s nz anz business survey was disappointing with only a small bounce in both the own activity and headline business confidence readings despite the government s decision not to go ahead with its proposed capital gains tax our economics team noted that at face value the level of own activity is consistent with annual average gdp growth of around 1 5 below both our and the rbnz s forecasts while the plunge in residential construction intentions to the lowest level in a decade implied big downside risks to the residential investment outlook the risk off backdrop has led to further gains in the usd with the dxy approaching its highs of the year reached late april and the bbdxy index which has a 20 weight to em currencies reaching a fresh high for the year the increase in fed rate cut expectations has been outweighed by usd demand stemming from the increase in risk aversion it seems the japanese yen

pakistan yet again finds itself in a macro economic mess with the international monetary fund imf coming to its rescue with a 6 billion bailout package conditional on macro economic adjustments by the government pakistan is not the only country to approach imf as time and again various countries have knocked on the imf s doors but do imf bailouts really work effectiveness of imf s bailouts may be understood by analysing two major crises of the recent past historically latin american economies have been tumultuous alternating from debt to currency crisis to hyperinflation and recession specifically let s talk about the tequila crisis of latin america of 1994 triggered by a sharp devaluation of mexican peso the tequila effect decline in the values of other currencies thereafter spread to other latin american countries the imf has extended multiple bailouts to these countries to tackle hyperinflation speculative capital outflows and plummeting growth in lieu of austerity measures after a bout of temporary recovery these economies continued to plunge in and out of crises the latin american experience several factors explain this first for centuries latin american economies have experienced political instability at the hands of military leaders and weak governments elected on macro economic populism with decades of lacklustre growth second higher economic growth post 1990s was primarily driven by external debt foreign investments and speculation making them highly susceptible to global pressures third most latin american economies are resource rich and suffer from intermittent phases of the resource curse admittedly the trouble lies with poor fiscal prudence and economic mismanagement as a result multiple imf bailouts and radical austerity packages of opening up these economies without robust political and economic institutions have have led to further deepening of recession and speculative outflows unless core economic management is strengthened no number of bailouts can redeem these economies the other case is that of the asian crisis which unfolded against the backdrop of decades of economic prosperity although the crisis originated in thailand following a stark devaluation of thai baht signs of overheating in the economy stock market bubbles external deficits started appearing earlier a confluence of external and domestic shocks coupled with weak growth in japan and europe translated into an economic cyclone that soon spread to the asian tigers also the slump in global export demand negatively impacted south east asian exports short term credit and speculation boom had run their course making way for mounting deficits this led to a reversal of market sentiment massive capital flight and bank runs triggering a currency crisis at its peak the imf stepped in to bail out south east asian economies in lieu of reforms within a few years these economies restored growth to pre crisis levels perhaps not surprisingly these governments have successfully prevented future economic crises since 1997 what explains their effective recovery first asian economies started experiencing a growth boom in 1970s driven by domestic savings and transition from agriculture to industry second their governments instead of radically opening up their economies followed a process of gradual integration with the global economy consequently 1990s saw a surge in foreign investment and credit expansion where the asian tigers became a magnet for foreign investment and speculation alike which proved to be their undoing unlike latin american economies asian crisis was more indicative of an irrational self reinforcing speculation than major fundamental flaws in macro economic management that is why they could leverage imf support and re embark onto the path of recovery and growth imf bailouts are therefore not insurance against economic crisis and their effectiveness depends on certain factors first the nature of the country s macro economic fundamentals outward looking policy driven by growth strategies or does it have inconsistent weak fundamentals fuelled by macro economic populism second is the nature of the economy s growth model growth driven by domestic savings or foreign capital reliant on manufacturing sector or natural resources which in turn determines its vulnerability to external shocks third is the degree of political stability and quality of governance which are directly correlated to effectiveness of policy response fourth and an all pervasive factor is the mismatch between the imf loan and conditions of structural adjustment imposed on the crisis ridden economy while the former is short term in nature structural adjustment is a long term commitment accordingly it stands to reason that such a time mismatch impacts the effectiveness of the imf loans the writer is young professional economic advisory council to prime minister niti aayog views expressed are personal

gains and charges or expenses including acquisition integration and manufacturing related costs which we may incur as part of our continuing operations with respect to the company s guidance expectations the company has not reconciled non gaap diluted earnings per share guidance to gaap diluted earnings per share due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting acquisition related integration and restructuring charges and expenses which are reconciling items between the non gaap and gaap measure due to the unknown effect timing and potential significance of such charges and expenses that impact gaap diluted earnings per share the company is not able to provide such guidance reconciliation of gaap results to non gaap results to supplement our financial results and guidance presented on a gaap basis we use non gaap measures that we believe are helpful in understanding our results the non gaap measures exclude costs which we generally would not have otherwise incurred in the periods presented as a part of our continuing operations our non gaap financial results and guidance are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable gaap measures and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap management uses supplemental non gaap financial measures internally to understand manage and evaluate our business and make operating decisions these non gaap measures are among the factors management uses in planning and forecasting for future periods we believe it is useful for investors to understand the effects of these items on our consolidated operating results our non gaap financial measures may include the following adjustments and as appropriate the related income tax effects and changes in income attributable to noncontrolling interests we exclude the effect of amortization and impairment of intangible assets from our non gaap financial results amortization of intangible assets will recur in future periods however the amounts are affected by the timing and size of our acquisitions impairment of intangible assets is a non recurring cost we exclude the effect of acquisition and integration expenses and the effect of restructuring expenses from our non gaap financial results such expenses generally diminish over time with respect to past acquisitions however we generally will incur similar expenses in connection with any future acquisitions we incurred significant expenses in connection with our acquisitions and also incurred certain other operating expenses or income which we generally would not have otherwise incurred in the periods presented as a part of our continuing operations acquisition and integration expenses include items such as personnel costs for transitional employees other acquired employee related costs and integration related professional services restructuring expenses include items such as employee severance product rationalization facility and other exit costs we exclude other exceptional or unusual charges or expenses and gains or income these can be variable and difficult to predict such as certain litigation expenses and product transition costs and are not what we consider as typical of our continuing operations investors should consider non gaap financial measures in addition to and not as replacements for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap we report revenue growth using the non gaap financial measure of pro forma which includes constant currency revenue and revenue from acquisitions and excludes coopersurgical product line exits in both periods management also presents and refers to constant currency information so that revenue results may be evaluated excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations to present this information current period revenue for entities reporting in currencies other than the united states dollar are converted into united states dollars at the average foreign exchange rates for the corresponding period in the prior year we define the non gaap measure of free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures we believe free cash flow is useful for investors as an additional measure of liquidity because it represents cash flows that are available for repayment of debt repurchases of our common stock or to fund our strategic initiatives management uses free cash flow internally to understand manage make operating decisions and evaluate our business in addition we use free cash flow to help plan and forecast future periods the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries reconciliation of selected gaap results to non gaap results

u s inflation was much weaker than initially thought in the first quarter amid a sharp slowdown in domestic demand which could cast doubts on the federal reserve s view that the benign price pressures were largely because of temporary factors the weak inflation pulse reported by the commerce department on thursday could also pile pressure on the u s central bank to cut interest rates especially as the economy appeared to slow in the second quarter fed chairman jerome powell said recently he believed the soft inflation may wind up being transient the personal consumption expenditures pce price index excluding the volatile food and energy components increased at a 1 0 rate last quarter the government said the so called core pce price index which is the fed s preferred inflation measure was previously reported to have risen at a 1 3 pace the increase last quarter was the smallest in four years and pushed inflation further below the fed s 2 target inflation has been running below its target this year and president donald trump has urged the fed to cut rates the low inflation readings are likely to be persistent said sung won sohn an economics professor at loyola marymount university in los angeles with both inflation and economic growth going in the wrong direction the fed is likely to cut rates later this year the fed early this month kept rates unchanged and signaled little inclination to adjust monetary policy anytime soon inflation has been restrained in part by weaker prices for portfolio management services apparel and airfares economists said the sharp downward revision to the first quarter inflation rate raised the risk of a lower core pce price index number in april with healthcare costs rising at both the producer and consumer levels in april economists had expected the core pce price index reading to remain unchanged at 1 6 year on year in april the government will publish the april core pce price index data on friday inflation hit the fed s 2 target in march last year for the first time since april 2012 this raises the chances that tomorrow s core pce inflation rate prints at 1 5 on a year over year basis which would potentially give the fed more ammunition to worry about a low inflation rate said john ryding chief economist at rdq economics in new york the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies while u s treasury prices rose stocks on wall street were trading higher slowing growth the government also reported on thursday that gross domestic product increased at a 3 1 annualized rate in the first quarter pared from the 3 2 pace it estimated last month the economy grew at a 2 2 pace in the october december period the economy will mark 10 years of expansion in july the longest on record growth last quarter was however flattered by the volatile export inventory and defense components excluding trade inventories and government spending the economy grew at a 1 3 rate the slowest since the second quarter of 2013 this measure of domestic demand increased at a 2 6 pace in the fourth quarter when measured from the income side the economy grew at a rate of 1 4 in the first quarter gross domestic income gdi increased at a 0 5 pace in the fourth quarter the average of gdp and gdi also referred to as gross domestic output and considered a better measure of economic activity increased at a 2 2 rate in the january march period up from a 1 3 growth pace in the fourth quarter the inventory and export driven growth spurt appears to have fizzled early in the second quarter the slowdown largely reflects the fading stimulus from the trump administration s hefty tax cuts and spending increases last year a trade war between the united states and china is also hurting the economy in another report on thursday the commerce department said exports fell 4 2 in april the report added to weak april data on industrial production orders for long lasting manufactured goods retail and home sales the growth drag from inventories is however likely to be small the government reported that wholesale inventories increased 0 7 last month while stocks at retailers rose 0 5 the atlanta fed is forecasting gdp rising at a 1 3 rate in the second quarter a recession is not in our baseline but we note the dangers from the recession bias leading to self fulfilling prophecies said lydia boussour a senior u s economist at oxford economics in new york the economy is seen supported by a strong labor market which is boasting the lowest unemployment rate in nearly 50 years in a separate report on thursday the labor department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 3 000 to a seasonally adjusted 215 000 for the week ended may 25
dollar trades generally higher today as risk markets stabilized partly helped by recovery in treasury yields too economic data from us generally matched expectations markets also shrugged off repeated comments from us and china regarding trade war though at the time of writing canadian dollar is the strongest one lifted by rebound in oil price yen is the weakest one as stocks are recovering technically current developments suggests that usd jpy s consolidation from 109 02 low is in its third leg and further rise is in favor that might help lift eur jpy higher today meanwhile gbp usd continues to gyrate towards 1 2605 support eur gbp also refuses to retreat deeper below 0 8805 temporary top the pound is vulnerable to around of selloff and that could limit any recovery attempt in gbp jpy it s a bit early to call for a breakout but eur usd is edging lower towards 1 1107 support and this level will be watched in other markets us stocks open generally higher with dow trading up

reports at the white house that china would love to make a deal with us we had a deal and they broke the deal i think if they had it to do again they wouldn t have done what they did on the tariffs he said china is subsidizing products so the united states taxpayers are paying for very little of it and pointed to the little impact of tariffs on inflation trump also said i think we re doing very well with china china open to sell rare earths to other countries halted us soy purchases china continued its hard line rhetorics on the topic of us china trade war commerce industry repeated the pledge to fight till the end if us keeps escalating tensions and china will firmly defend its own national interests there is no indication of more talks as china said us sincerity is in doubt in addition to the usual stuffs the commerce industry also said china is willing to meet reasonable demand for rare earths from other countries though it would be unacceptable that countries using chinese rare earths to manufacture products would turn around and suppress china separately it s reported that china has halted soy purchases from the us already government data indicates china bought about 13 million metric tons of us soybeans since december while there is no cancellation of previous orders there is no further orders to continued the so called goodwill buying us q1 gdp growth

investment imports also decreased there was negative contribution from residential fixed investment the acceleration in gdp growth reflected an upturn in state and local government spending accelerations in private inventory investment and in exports and a smaller decrease in residential investment these were partly offset by decelerations in pce and nonresidential fixed investment and a downturn in federal government spending us trade deficit widened slightly to usd 72 1b both exports and imports contracted us trade deficit widened slightly to usd 72 1b in april up from usd 71 9b

four week moving average of continuing claims dropped 3 5k to 1 673m boe ramsden most financial stability risks from no deal brexit mitigated boe deputy governor dave ramsden said in case of a smooth brexit with transition the mpc expected uk growth to pick up leading to excess demand and building domestic inflationary pressure in such case further monetary tightening is appropriate ramsden s gdp growth expectation was a little more pessimistic however he also saw downside risks to productivity while he s also less optimistic on investment recovery thus his overall view on monetary policy was broadly in line with the mpc ramsden noted that the biggest risk to the uk economy and uk financial stability remains that of a brexit outcome of no deal and no transition but he emphasized that most risks to financial stability that could arise have been mitigated even though a no deal no transition brexit could still be expected to bring significant market volatility as well as economic instability boj sakurai shouldn t recklessly seek to hit price target with additional easing boj board member makoto sakurai said the central bank shouldn t recklessly seek to achieve our price target with additional easing instead the best monetary policy approach was to patiently maintain the current stimulus program he acknowledged that achievement of our price target is being delayed but that s because the relationship between monetary policy and price moves are changing and becoming more complex sakurai also said boj should be very mindful of the negative effects of the ultra loose monetary

as expected by many market participants at the last wednesday meeting the bank of canada kept the current monetary policy and key interest rate unchanged at 1 75 the recent escalation of the trade conflict has increased uncertainty regarding economic prospects the central bank said at the same time the leaders of the bank believe that the slowdown in economic growth in canada is temporary expecting an improvement in economic activity in the country and referring to the acceleration in the 2nd quarter the recent decision of the white house to remove duties on canadian steel and aluminum will have a positive impact on canadian exports and investment because it increased the likelihood of ratifying the revised north american free trade agreement nafta on friday 12 30 gmt an increase in volatility in the usd cad trades is expected due to the publication of important macro statistics for the us and canada it is expected that canadian gdp grew by 1 3 in the 2nd quarter after weak growth in the first three months of the year some economists believe that growth in the 2nd quarter could exceed the central bank estimate and be 2 or higher at the same time the april data on consumer spending in the united states which will also be released at the same time may adversely affect investors expectations regarding the us economy if the data are weak after weak data on industrial production and retail sales in the united states published earlier if weak macro data starts to come in from the usa then the probability of a decrease in the fed s interest rate will increase investors already estimate the likelihood of a rate cut in 2019 at 83 versus 64 a month ago it is also necessary to take into account that on the last trading day of the week and month many market participants will want to take profits in long positions in the us dollar which will cause its decline thus next month a corrective decline in the usd cad pair may start with targets at the support levels of 1 3452 fibonacci level 23 6 of the downward correction to the pair growth in the global uptrend from september 2012 and 0 9700 1 3435 ема200 on the 4 hourly chart 1 3420 ema50 on the daily chart the breakdown of the level 1 3420 will provoke a deeper decline to the support levels of 1 3325 ема144 1 3275 ема200 on the daily chart above the key levels 1 3325 1 3275 usd cad maintains a long term positive trend a return to the zone above the local resistance level of 1 3520 will be a signal for the resumption of long positions with targets at the resistance levels of 1 3660 2018 highs 1 3790 2017 highs support levels 1 3465 1 3452 1 3435 1 3420 1 3325 1 3275 resistance levels 1 3520 1 3600 1 3660 1 3790 trading scenarios sell stop 1 3480 stop loss 1 3530 take profit 1 3465 1 3452 1 3435 1 3420 1 3325 1 3275 buy stop 1 3530 stop loss 1 3480 take profit 1 3600 1 3660 1 3790 usdcad current trading positions
africa s economies cannot afford to miss out on the digital revolution a conference of finance ministers in march discussed the ways the continent can equip its economies to cash in on the opportunities shoshana kedem reports africa is grasping the technological revolution with both hands hundreds of millions of venture capital dollars are flowing into the region which remains the fastest growing mobile phone market in the world and an emerging competitor in the global race for tech with innovation hubs sprouting up throughout the continent solutions are being found to solve uniquely african problems and dissolve barriers to trade financial services and capital but governments need to do more to seize on the opportunities of the global digital economy which is set to grow from 11 5 trillion in 2016 to over 23 trillion by 2025 in response the un economic commission for africa eca set the focus of its 2019 conference of african ministers of finance planning and economic development squarely on the subject held in marrakesh in march under the title fiscal policy trade and the private sector in the digital era a strategy for africa the conference was chaired by morocco s secretary general of the ministry of finance zouhair chorfi who introduced it saying digitalisation is a great opportunity for africa it can transform africa by increasing competitiveness promoting strong integration and reducing the cost of doing business zouhair chorfi the secretary general of the ministry of economy and finance of morocco the digital economy already accounts for more than 5 of gross domestic product gdp in some african nations this could be more than doubled to 12 20 if countries harness the economic potential of digital technology the ability of countries to do this will determine how fast they grow in the coming decade and will help them raise up to 400bn to bridge their 600bn financing gap africa shows every sign of being ready for rapid economic transformation in the coming decade but countries need to digitise their economies and reform their tax systems to drive revenues and finance development said eca executive secretary vera songwe in her opening speech the importance of digitalisation and the digital economy in driving growth and structural transformation as well as optimising fiscal performance in africa cannot be overstated she said such digital developments can have a transformative effect across the economy by reducing barriers to entry and expanding market reach for businesses creating jobs and boosting both domestic and foreign trade in goods and services the continent s burgeoning populations and embryonic levels of technology and underdeveloped infrastructure can be turned to an advantage if countries adopt new technologies straight away and use them to leapfrog into the 21st century the week of round tables and expert discussions sought to equip ministers and financial policymakers with the technocratic know how to reform their economies and legal systems to promote innovation in the digital age delegations from 40 african countries shared their experiences on issues ranging from investing in the technical skills of future workforces to using technology to build more inclusive and efficient financial institutions taxing the unbanked one way countries can build more fiscally capable states is by broadening and digitising their tax systems to ensure much needed revenues don t slip through the net on average african countries collect less than 16 of gdp in tax in comparison with over 34 in oecd countries the shortfalls are felt in infrastructure health and education a lack of investment in tax collection sprawling informal economies and poor access to banking more than 60 of africans do not have a bank account are just some of the factors contributing to this problem the eca s economic report on africa 2019 launched on the sidelines of the conference emphasises how digitising tax administration and investing in data collection could help to broaden the tax base around 500m africans have no official id which contributes to their exclusion from banking systems implementing digital id systems can help to overcome this problem by improving tax assessments and administration enhances the government s capacity to mobilise additional resources digital id systems yield gains in efficiency and convenience that could result in savings to taxpayers and government of up to 50 billion a year by 2020 says the report rwanda managed to boost revenue collection by 6 of gdp by introducing e taxation while south africa used online tax payments to trim compliance costs by 22 4 highlighting how digital identification can help identifyand track taxpayers vera songwe said without ids people can t participate in financial activities provided by banks with digitalisation they can receive a digital identity for use in their banking all they have to do is own a smartphone while biometrics will do the rest technological dawn in east africa songwe pointed to countries in the east african community that are growing at almost double the rate of those in the rest of the continent on the back of their investment in technology infrastructure and better fiscal policies that help startups to flourish despite the fact that the continent as a whole is only growing at 3 2 the east african horn is growing at 6 2 they are one of the highest competitors of information technology that we can see they are investing in fiscal policies and they are collecting revenues better she said these policies have seen nairobi s tech hub grow into a 1bn silicon savannah that is home to 200 startups and tech giants such as microsoft and intel entrepreneurs from across the continent s startup spectrum took part in a side session led by the african fintech network that gathered fintech companies from across 20 countries to thrash out how governments can promote policies that advance innovation and lift the continent s rising tech hubs speaking at the session songwe said that companies such as m pesa and nigeria s flutterwave were building the blocks for africa s silicon shaped future in 2007 m pesa became the first company in africa to offer electronic payment systems transforming kenya s banking system by effectively giving anyone with a mobile phone the chance to have a bank account in their pocket flutterwave recently partnered with visa to create the continent s very own equivalent of paypal called getbarter in another first they allowed visa cardholders on the continent to send and receive funds at home or internationally helping to process 1bn in transactions in 2018 what s holding africa back there is enough evidence that africa can be digitally transformed but what is holding us back nigeria s former ict minister omobola johnson asked the fintech session it s not funding as startup investment in africa jumped to record levels in 2018 increasing almost four fold to raise 725 6m across 458 deals according to weetracker s 2018 venture investment report most of this funding came not from philanthropists but from hard nosed investors seeking strong returns in the continent s budding technology sector in 2018 alone venture capitals and funds invested 350m 700m into mobile tech companies that are solving african challenges and it s literally doubling every year said johnson who now works as a senior partner at tech focused venture capital firm tl capital she said that what was stopping african innovators from competing with the world s tech giants was poor regulation and a lack of understanding on the part of banks the biggest challenge for fintech companies today is regulation policy and the fact that many central banks do not innovate and do not understand what it takes to scale and build a technology company another stumbling block for africa s digital revolution is infrastructure and basic access to electricity phones and the internet connectivity loops societies into emerging technologies from the banking sector to education agriculture and finance it will also be a core driver of productive employment opportunities and future healthcare only 43 of the continent has access to electricity less than half the global access rate of 87 according to the latest survey by the world bank the number of people without electricity is also expected to snowball with africa s population boom another issue is the affordability of the internet the internationally agreed target is for 1gb of data to cost no more than 2 of the average national monthly income in africa this currently stands at 8 76 compared to 3 5 in latin america or 1 54 in asia songwe noted public and private sectors must cooperate after a week of deliberations between country delegations and technocrats finance ministers joined the conference to be presented with the the recommendations that they could take home these recommendations will also be used by the un whose policymakers will use them to prioritise and allocate resources to fund development projects in a keynote speech concluding the conference un deputy secretary general amina mohamed emphasised that governments cannot lead the digital revolution alone public and private sectors must come together and cooperate with governments to help them realise their population s human potential and adapt to sectors such as e commerce where retail trade is predicted to skyrocket to 300bn by 2025 what brings us here today is the promise and potential that the digital economy can bring to the table to the extent that many are seeing the emergence of a fourth industrial revolution she said digitisation is making it easier to access financial services enter markets and expand reach notably to communities living outside of the major cities and commercial centres amina mohammed the deputy secretary general of the united nations at the uneca s conference of ministers in marrakech but we also know that digital platforms and e commerce are reshaping economies faster than policymakers can keep up our policy efforts must be designed to boost these opportunities today s discussions can help move the needle on how we capitalise digitisation for fiscal policy and revenue generation a critical aspect of all policy reform has to be capacity building the benefits of digitisation will only be fully harnessed if countries take active steps to invest in infrastructure and above all human capabilities governments cannot do this alone the private and public sectors must work together to operationalise this agenda

the call over to dan dan dan bodner president chief executive officer and chairman thank you alan good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us to review our first quarter results outlook and three year targets we are pleased to have started the year strong our first quarter results were ahead of our guidance for both revenue and eps and we are well positioned for year of double digit revenue and eps growth on a non gaap basis we believe our strong results reflect the execution of our strategy which we began two years ago to accelerate innovation in the areas of automation and cloud we believe this strategy will enable us to sustain growth over the long run and today we are pleased to introduce three year targets first i would like to review our very strong q1 results year over year revenue increased 9 on a gaap basis 11 on a non gaap basis and 13 on a non gaap constant currency basis year over year operating margins increased 190 basis points on a gaap basis and 340 basis points on a non gaap basis reflecting the significant operating leverage in our financial model eps came in at 0 02 on a gaap basis and 0 73 on a non gaap basis a 38 increase year over year and cash from operations came in at 93 million a 55 increase year over year reflecting the underlying strength in our business overall our results were strong across particularly every key metric i m very pleased with our q1 performance which makes the year more linear and gives us confidence to raise our annual guidance again now i d like to provide some q1 highlights by business segments starting with customer engagement in customer engagement q1 non gaap revenue increased 14 on a reported basis and 16 on a constant currency basis we are pleased with our results and are guiding to 11 non gaap revenue growth for the full year last week we had the opportunity to showcase our latest customer engagement innovations at our annual user event in orlando florida attendance was up 20 year over year and we were pleased to have some of the world s greatest brands presenting at our conference including uber verizon aarp and mastercard we received very positive feedback on our latest solution including our voice of the customer platform which we announced during the events and which i will discuss in more detail later overall the energy generated by our customers partners and employees was incredibly high during the quarter we continued to win new customers displaced competitor and expand with existing customers including in order for more than 10 million from a leading telecommunications company as this customer is standardizing on verint s customer engagement platform and we are displacing multiple point solutions from other vendors this eight figure deal will be deployed on premise due to the customers preference for an on premise solution in the area of cloud we re seeing growing adoption and during the quarter we received many large cloud orders including a 9 million order from a technology company a 3 million order from a bank and a 2 million order from a healthcare company with various components of our portfolio deployed in the cloud we are cutting across customers for many industries the common threat is a desire to work with the vendor that can help them migrate to the cloud seamlessly turning to cyber intelligence q1 revenue increased 5 year over year on a reported basis and 7 year over year on a constant currency basis this compares to a very strong first quarter last year in which revenue increased 13 year over year regarding margins we are pleased with our year over year improvements as we continue to make progress with the software model transition during q1 we received many large orders including orders for approximately 25 million 15 million 10 million and 5 million reflecting the strength of our portfolio demand for our solutions remains strong and we re guiding to 10 non gaap cyber intelligence revenue growth for the year earlier in the quarter we had the opportunity to showcase our latest cyber intelligence innovation at our annual security user event in italy attendance at this year event was up 20 year over year and we were pleased to have customers attending from 70 countries the theme of the event was the art of intelligence and included hands on demos actual case studies and opportunity for customers to learn from peers experiences customers commented on our strong pace of innovation and the many innovative capabilities we demonstrated at events turning to guidance today we are raising fiscal 20 non gaap guidance for revenue by 5 million and for eps by 0 05 this is the third time we have raised guidance providing our initial annual guidance in early december we first raised revenue guidance by 20 million on december 17 the second we raised guidance by 25 million on march 27th and the third time is today by 5 million in total we have raised our top line guidance by 50 million to date of which 30 million is from the foresee acquisition with regard to eps our strategy is to expand margins while accelerating the top line and we are pleased with our margin expansion in q1 our new non gaap eps guidance of 3 65 reflects continued margin expansion and 14 year over year growth i would now like to discuss our three year targets last year we discussed our goal for long term double digit growth today we are providing three year targets for verint overall as well as some more details on our two segments overall we are targeting the following for fiscal 22 on a non gaap basis for revenue we are targeting 1 65 billion reflecting 10 cagr for eps we re targeting 4 70 reflecting 14 cagr now let s take a closer look at our customer engagement three year targets last week during our analyst event to help investors understand our cloud transition we introduced three year targets for revenue cloud revenue recurring revenue and adjusted ebitda margins for non gaap customer engagement revenue we re targeting 10 cagr which would take our customer engagement revenue to 1 08 billion in three years our revenue target a few points of contribution from maintenance conversion uplift that doug will discuss later but let s not assume any future acquisitions assuming increasing market demand for cloud we expect our recurring revenue to be about 70 of our customer engagement revenue by fiscal 22 with respect to margins while we have already achieved best in class margins we expect our adjusted ebitda margins to continue to expand to around 30 driven by cloud growth and greater scale overall we believe we can continue to execute our cloud transition creating benefits for both our customers and verint and we have discussed in prior calls we believe that behind the leadership and strong momentum is our strategic decision to accelerate our investments in automation and cloud more than ever before our customers are focused on elevating the customer experience and at the same time reducing operating costs automation is critical to achieving our customers objective and consequently a core strategic initiative for verint based on input from our customers and our intimate knowledge of the industry we have created a portfolio that infuses automation throughout the customer engagement process with respect to cloud we believe we are at the inflection point and more and more customers are moving from just talking about cloud to embracing it the trends manifest itself in two ways new cloud deployments and immigration from on premise deployment to the verint cloud we ve been preparing for cloud adoption to accelerate and we are differentiated across three layers first our cloud applications offer customers very rich functionality with feature parity between on premise and cloud which customers really like because it makes their transition to the cloud seamless this is something that most of our competitors do not offer second we are flexible go to market approach the large customer to operate some verint solutions on premise and some in the verint cloud and to migrate to the cloud at their own pace and third we invested in very strong cloud operations that are global scalable secured and efficient in fact our recent saas deployments target a best in class 80 gross margin as we have discussed over the last two years we ve been investing to accelerate innovation our financial targets with this strategy were to drive sustainable growth for mid single digit two years ago to double digit growth over the next three years while at the same time expanding margins and more than doubling our cloud revenue we have invested in organic r d and also carefully analyze buy versus build decisions resulting in several tuck in technology acquisitions intended to accelerate innovation our customer engagement r d operation is very efficient running at the level of 13 of revenue this level is best in class compared to our peers with a very healthy ratio of 5 3 gross margin dollars for every r d dollar invested our estimated non gaap customer engagement operating margins of approximately 26 last year are also best in class due to strong competitive differentiation across our portfolio our post acquisitions has been focused on adding technology to expand our portfolio strategically and shorten time to market over the last two years our acquisitions have largely consisted of small companies without profits and strategy has been to integrate technology quickly and to drive incremental revenue and earnings from our overall portfolio and now i would like to provide an example of buy versus build process using our recent foresee acquisition most of the customer has been an integral part of our customer engagement portfolio and with the market moving away from point solutions to voc platform we decided to accelerate our investment both organically and inorganically to accelerate our time to market we evaluated more than five different voc assets before selecting foresee for it s superior digital customer experience technology employee talents and domain expertise as part of our diligence we ve evaluated not only foresee s technology and people but also its operational strength and weaknesses customer base and financials we learned that foresee revenues were rapidly declining since their parent company bankruptcy and they had significant losses including a 12 million loss in 2017 and a 15 million loss in 2018 we also learned that their customer renewal rates was declining and was at low 60s in q4 last year suggesting that the revenue decline might accelerate into the current year while foresee s historical financial profile presented obvious challenges we decided to acquire foresee for 65 million based on their superior technology people domain expertise and the following integration plan first our plan was focused on strategic target of integrating the foresee technology with the verint s voc platform we quickly began the technology integration including merging their r d and product management organizations second we increased the level of engagement with forsee s customers to reduce attrition and retain them based on our clear roadmap to our broader voc platform consistent with the market shift to platforms and third given their significant historical losses we sacrificed revenue for profitability this year and completed swift operational integration coupled with rightsizing the organization while renewal rates continue to decline to the low 50s in q1 we believe we are taking the right steps toward achieving the strategic and financial objective that we targeted currently we estimate that forsee s revenues for the year will be between 30 million to 40 million based on the progress we ve been making so far with the integration as discussed before we raised guidance 3 times since the acquisition of foresee and our current guidance assumes the low end of the estimated range of 30 million of foresee revenue in our 900 million customer engagement revenue guidance we generally measure the success of a tuck in acquisition across two metrics strategic and financial in the case of foresee on the strategic side we measure success based on sustainable growth of our customer engagement portfolio and accelerating time to market on the financial side we achieved profitability on day one and now expect to achieve a revenue level this year that translates to a purchase price of 2x revenue or less i m pleased to report that last week during our annual customer conference we launched a new version of our voc platform including the foresee technology and other innovations we had more than 100 foresee customers at the event and we received very positive feedback from both verint customers and foresee legacy customers in summary foresee is a good example of our thoughtful approach to buy versus build decision making and now we leverage both internal r d and technology acquisitions to accelerate our innovation before turning to cyber intelligence let me summarize customer engagement as follows we believe the investments we ve made over the last two years combined with market readiness will accelerate our transition to the cloud and we expect the conversion of our maintenance stream to contribute a few points toward our 10 cagr revenue target while we will continue to evaluate tuck in acquisitions using our buy versus build decision making process our target do not assume any future acquisitions and finally we expect our customer engagement margins to continue to expand driven by our growing scale and our shift to the cloud turning to cyber intelligence as we have discussed in prior calls we expect non gaap revenue to grow at 10 cagr over the next three years which will take us to 575 million of revenue in fiscal 22 at this scale and with the transition to sort them all we expect our adjusted ebitda margin to exceed 20 an improvement of over 450 bps over the next three years on a non gaap basis in addition to margin improvement there are significant benefits to customers and to verint for moving to a software model that i will discuss shortly behind our double digit revenue growth is demand for data mining software as an effective tool to address security threats that are becoming more pervasive and complex data volumes are growing quickly requiring legacy data mining tools to get refreshed at a rapid pace as a result security organizations are seeking innovative data mining software to better the tax investigate and neutralize threats as part of our innovation we focused on automation to help customers shorten the investigative process and reduce dependancy on large numbers of intelligence analysts and data scientists with respect to moving to a software model we believe there are significant benefits to our customers from productivation of our solution making our software easier to implement and easier to refresh which is critical in a rapidly evolving technology landscape more and more customers have realized that the integrator model is limited in terms of system openness and their ability to quickly deploy software enhancements the investments we ve made in the software model creates even more competitive differentiation now i would like to discuss r d and cyber intelligence our r d investment has been around 20 of revenue in recent periods in line with security peers and that s been focused on automation unbundling the software and minimizing hardware customization and integration services by verint with respect to buy versus build in cyber intelligence technology acquisitions have not been required for our transition to a software model and that transition has been driven primarily by organic r d investments we are very happy with the margin expansion we ve achieved to date including in q1 overall over the last two years we achieved 300 basis points of ebitda margin improvement and over the next three years we are targeting an additional 450 basis points of expansion on a non gaap basis in summary we believe the combination of our leadership position and market demand for advanced data mining software will enable us to continue to grow our cyber intelligence revenue at the 10 cagr over the next three years at the same time we re making progress with transitioning the business to a software model which will drive strategic and financial benefits to verint before handing the call over to doug i would like to highlight four elements of our growth strategy first as we discussed today our goal is to grow revenue at 10 cagr over the next three years with margin expansion driving eps cagr of 14 secondm we plan to pursue acquisitions opportunistically to drive additional shareholder value and put variance in an even stronger competitive position our long term targets do not assume any future acquisitions third we expect strong cash generation and our primary cash usage will be for m a however if we cannot find desirable deals we will consider using any excess cash to repurchase shares and finally our board is committed to continued refreshments ensuring we have the skills to drive shareholder value over the last three years we added three new directors and we plan to bring on another independent directors during the current fiscal year i would also like to say that given the success of our growth strategy our strong performance and the value we re creating for our shareholders we believe the proxy contest is entirely unwarranted as the strategy is unfolded we provide a new disclosure to help investors better understand the changes in our business and as our track record clearly shows we have an ongoing practice of board refreshment i would like to thank our shareholders for the support we are receiving from them and we encourage shareholders to vote for all verint nominees on the white proxy card that is all we will have to say on the proxy side on today s call including during the q a portion of the call we want to focus on our very strong performance now let me turn the call over to doug douglas robinson chief financial officer yes thanks dan and good afternoon everyone our discussion today will include non gaap financial measures a reconciliation between our gaap and non gaap financial measures is available as alan mentioned in our earnings release and in the ir section of our website differences between our gaap and non gaap financial measures include adjustments related to acquisitions including fair value revenue adjustments ammortization of acquisition related intangibles certain other acquisition related expenses stock based compensation as well as certain other items that can vary significantly in amount in frequency for certain metrics it also includes adjustments related to foreign exchange rates i d like to start by looking at our q1 performance our first quarter results were strong across practically every key metric q1 non gaap revenue came in at 324 million and 11 year over year increase as reported in a 13 on a constant currency basis our q1 non gaap gross margins were approximately 67 up 350 bps from q1 last year with both segments showing year over year improvement we were particularly pleased with the improvement in our cyber intelligence segments gross margins which i ll discuss in a minute our non gaap operating income came in at 62 3 million up a very strong 35 year over year our growth in operating income to non gaap operating margins to 19 2 a 340 bps increase from q1 of last year our adjusted ebitda for the quarter came in at 70 1 million a 29 1 year over year increase these strong results drove diluted non gaap eps of 0 73 for the quarter up 38 from the 0 53 eps in q1 of last year we are also very pleased to have increased our gaap cash from operations year over year by 55 to 93 million in q1 i would also like to mention that q1 is the first quarter that we have had a year over year comparison on the same basis under asc 606 the new accounting standard company s adopted last year as you can see our year over year performance in q1 was very strong and as reported in the same 606 basis as q1 in the prior year i mentioned this because last year we were required to reported results under both 605 and 606 which created some confusion on the trends in our business as we had discussed throughout last year we prepared for asc 606 during fiscal 18 and therefore at the beginning of last year fiscal 19 we changed certain business practices and built our budget to align with 606 accounting as a result the disclosure in our 10 k and 10 q showing our fiscal 19 results under 605 was not a meaningful comparison because the results under 605 no longer accurately reflected our business performance once we implemented the business practice changes i mentioned we believe our results last year under 606 reflect our true performance which is also demonstrated by our strong 22 increase in cash from operations last year as well as our strong earnings and operating cash flow performance in q1 of this year on the same 606 basis our guidance for fiscal 20 which we ve now raised several times also reflects the same steady state 606 compare in other words as we said previously we believe our results last year would have been similar to what we reported absent the 606 transition now i d like to review our q1 results by segment turning to customer engagement non gaap revenue increased 14 from last year as reported and 16 on a constant currency basis today we are reporting additional revenue metrics for our customer engagement segments including recurring revenue non recurring revenue before reviewing these metrics for q1 i d like to start with some definitions recurring revenue includes cloud and maintenance and non recurring revenue includes on premise solutions and professional services we are also breaking down cloud into saas an optional managed services in q1 non gaap recurring revenue increased 23 and non gaap non recurring revenue increased 6 5 year over year non gaap cloud revenue came in at 56 million an increase over 58 year over year in q1 our saas and managed services mix was about 75 25 on a fully allocated basis our customer engagement non gaap gross margins were 68 4 and our non gaap operating margins were 23 3 overall we are pleased with our strong customer engagement revenue growth and continued margin expansion in q1 turning to cyber intelligence q1 revenue increased 5 year over year on a reported basis and 7 year over year on a constant currency basis this compares to a very strong first quarter in the prior year and which revenue increased 13 year over year on a fully allocated basis cyber intelligence non gaap gross margins increased 710 bps year over year to 65 while our margins continue to benefit from our transition to a software model in q1 wee also had a very favorable mix the improvement in gross margins took our non gaap fully allocated operating margins to a 11 1 in q1 in summary we are targeting another year of 10 non gaap annual revenue growth with expanding margins i d now like to take you through our updated fiscal 2020 guidance as dan mentioned earlier today we are raising our non gaap guidance for the third time since early december call we now expect total revenue of 1 375 billion with a range of plus or minus 2 reflecting just over 10 growth for the year by segment we expect 10 growth in cyber intelligence and 11 growth in customer engagement as dan mentioned our guidance assumes about 30 million of revenue from foresee overall our 10 outlook for customer engagement reflects mid to high single digit revenue growth excluding our recent acquisitions from an operating margin perspective we expect operating margins in fiscal 20 of approximately 22 we expect our non gaap quarterly interest and other expense excluding the potential impact of foreign exchange to be approximately 5 75 million given the volatility in foreign exchange rates that could be future gains or losses related to balance sheet translations in our future results which are not included in our guidance we expect our non gaap tax rate to be approximately 10 5 for the year reflecting the amount of cash taxes we expect to pay this year based on these assumptions and assuming approximately 67 5 million average diluted shares outstanding for the year we are expecting non gaap diluted eps at the midpoint of our revenue guidance to be approximately 3 65 a 0 05 increase from our prior guidance and 0 15 increase from the initial guidance in december our new eps guidance reflects another year of 14 eps growth in addition to our annual guidance we d like you to provide some color on the progression of the year for modeling purposes for non gaap revenue in q2 we expect revenue to increase approximately 10 million sequentially with an eps of around 0 80 we expect another sequential increase in q3 followed by our usual seasonally strong q4 i would like to discuss now our three year targets in more detail as dan mentioned earlier today we are introducing three year non gaap targets for total revenue of 1 65 billion and earnings per share of 4 70 driving these targets is verint s core competency and actionable intelligence these targets assume no adverse change in the economy although we believe we can perform relatively well in an economic downturn based on historical experience i ll spend the next few minutes taking a closer look at our three year targets for each segment starting with the customer engagement given the faster adoption of cloud that we have been seeing and the shift away from on premise solutions we expect non gaap non recurring revenue to relatively flat over the next three years with non gaap recurring revenue increasing at a 15 cagr to 750 million this should drive recurring revenue to around 70 of our total customer engagement revenue compared to 59 last year within cloud we expect saas to grow faster than optional managed services and to represent 85 of our cloud revenue in three years within saas revenue we have bundled saas and unbundled saas our saas revenue is substantially generated from bundled saas which provides access to our software with standard managed services which is what our customers prefer however occasionally some customers and partners want license rights to our software separate for unbundled from managed services which for accounting purposes are considered term licenses the unbundled saas can be deployed in the cloud either by verint or cloud partner and renew like saas so is included in our recurring revenue i would like to give you a few examples of the unbundled saas one example is when a cloud partner that hosts our software in their cloud without purchasing any of our standard managed services another example is a customer that refers to purchase both components from verint software and managed services but separately due to the customers desire to have software deployment flexibility since unbundled saas is a small portion of our total cloud revenue and the mix of bundled and unbundled saas is expected to be similar in fiscal 19 and in fiscal 20 the impact is not material now let s discuss how the transition to more recurring revenue will positively affect our margins despite already having a very healthy 26 fully allocated non gaap operating margins and 28 3 adjusted ebitda margins in our customer engagement business looking forward we see two factors we believe will have a positive impact on our margins first our margins will benefit as recurring revenue becomes a larger percentage of our revenue this is because gross margins in our recurring revenue are in the mid to high 70s while gross margins that are non recurring revenue are in the mid 50s as our recurring revenue grows at a 15 cagr and becomes a greater part of our revenue our gross margin should improve due to the more favorable mix second we expect to maintain our r d expense at around 13 of customer engagement revenue at the same time we expect some operating leverage from sg a as we continue to scale the business the combination of gross margin expansion and operating leverage is expected to drive our customer engagement non gaap operating income margins to approximately 27 5 with adjusted ebitda margins of around 30 in three years before concluding i d like to spend a few minutes discussing dynamics between maintenance and cloud revenue as we discussed on prior calls we currently generate more than 300 million of maintenance revenue that we expect will move to the cloud gradually over time the conversion of maintenance to cloud could result in a significant revenue uplift for verint as the dollar of maintenance revenue can convert to cloud revenue at a 2 times rate or higher today we have a cloud first strategy which we believe will facilitate this transition because of this conversion we expect maintenance revenue to be flat to modestly declining over the next three years this trend reflects growth in maintenance from new on premise deployments offset by some maintenance revenue converting to cloud revenue as we make this transition we expect our non gaap estimated gross margins on recurring revenue to remain in the mid to high 70s due to the mix shift discussed earlier between saas maintenance and managed services revenue overall the transition from on premise to cloud is expected to contribute to our revenue growth by a few points and to help our margin expansion over the next three years if the transition occurs at a rate faster than we re expecting our cloud rate could accelerate before concluding since we provided three year targets today we thought it d be helpful to also discuss our long term capital allocation plans verint ended last year with 468 million of cash and we expect to generate around 800 million of cash over the next three years after deducting capex we expect to have more than 1 1 billion of cash available for working capital and technology acquisitions or potentially a larger transaction however if we cannot find desirable deals we would consider using excess cash to repurchase stock regarding our debt we have 400 million of convertible debt due in june 21 and 425 million of term loans due in june 2024 we do not plan to settle the convertible debt in shares and plan to refinance as we get closer to maturity likely with another convertible note or additional term loan while we spend time today discussing our long term targets i d like to end the call where we started with our strong q1 results we are very pleased to start the year strong and look forward to another successful year this concludes my prepared remarks so with that operator can we please open up the lines for questions questions and answers operator certainly operator instructions our first question comes from shaul eyal with oppenheimer your line is now open shaul eyal oppenheimer analyst thank you good afternoon congrats on the quarter and improved outlook as well as the increase in inaudible dan i want to ask by asking with respect to your organic growth this year can you help us reconcile with organic growth with your 10 organic target for the next two years in either words what s driving this organic growth right now dan bodner president chief executive officer and chairman okay sure that s a good question so let me start with this year and i ll break it down and then we ll go into the next three years so we gave guidance this year for 1 375 billion for both cyber intelligence customer engagement so let s start with the cyber intelligence our guidance for this year is 475 million that represents 10 growth and now we look at the organic inorganic we did one deal last year in november we bought a company called nowforce we paid 4 million for this company at closing and this company did 2 million of revenue last year so pretty much our guidance for this year is organic and also our guidance for the next cagr of 10 is organic now let s move to customer engagement where we did more acquisitions our guidance for this year for customer engagements is 900 million and that s represent 11 growth over the last 12 months we acquired three companies we acquired foresee with 65 million in december plus we acquired two other small companies one focused on wfm technology that we acquired mid last year for 27 million and one focused on the smb technology that we acquired in february this year for 20 million so as i said before and doug explained in our guidance foresee represents 30 million of inorganic revenue out of the 900 million guidance and if you take all these three companies foresee and the other two combined they represent a little over 40 million of inorganic revenue in our 900 million guidance but they also contributed a little bit more than 10 million last year so you can do the math and our 11 guidance this year is actually consistent with our target for mid to high single digit organic growth for this year and this 11 say growth is about two thirds organic and one third inorganic for this year now taking this and moving into the next two years fiscal 21 and 22 we are targeting 10 organic growth but that s inclusive also of the maintenance conversion and we discussed that maintenance convert to cloud we re going to have some uplift so that s going to start to contribute also a few points to our revenue growth in those years so now you can see the bridge if we re achieving mid to high single digit organic growth and this year and also we don t need to expand our portfolio and achieve the same level in the next few years plus this few points of maintenance conversion this is how we got to set the target to 10 cagr over the next three years and of course if the maintenance conversion will accelerate this could be an upside shaul eyal oppenheimer analyst got it thank you for that elaborated answer and maybe moving giving you brought up foresee so it would appear now it is part of a broader force of a customer strategy what s the long term thinking from that perspective down the road on voiced over the customer business dan bodner president chief executive officer and chairman yes so basically voice of the customer is an integral part of our portfolio and we talked about what customers really want to achieve our customers they want to elevate the customer experience and reduce operational costs and voice of the customer is a critical part of that and we ve been investing in voice of the customer now for few years organically and inorganically and foresee complements what we ve built as the voc platform that is omni channel that has very strong analytics and also that uses a lot of automation to bring the insight into action so foresee specifically is providing digital customer experience capabilities and we were impressed with the technology foresee s been in the business for many years we found great people with great talent in the company and we also find a lot of domain expertise about digital customer experience we launched last week and shaul you were in our user conference so hopefully you re able to see the responses to the demonstration we got very strong response from verint customers and foresee customers yes there was the main launch of main stage was our new version of voc platform and what we do now is we combine customer the customer voice not only surveys which include email service text surveys and voice surverys and so on but also indirect feedback that we collect through a lot of voice calls and chats and emails and social media that basically bring back feedback to the organization on the customer experience and the first step into customer experience is actually measuring it in terms of net promoter score and any other metric that can measure what the customer response is but also brings that action quickly in real time into operations so that organization can actually take action and make improvements and as you know verint has been very strong on the operational side and we now have voice of the customer that cut the cost marketing and operations and help people on both sides from marketing and from operation to measure the customer experience and to improve it and do make sure that the action the corrective action of taking actually creating a better net promoter score and elevating the customer experience for on a sustainable basis so our we see voc as an integral part of our customer engagement portfolio we expect our portfolio to grow 10 and we still expect the voc platform to contribute at 10 or better into this growth shaul eyal oppenheimer analyst thank you alan roden senior vice president corporate development and investor relations sure operator thank you and our next question comes from daniel ives with wedbush your line is now open daniel ives wedbush securities analyst yes thank you dan maybe you could talk about the commerce the conversations you have with customers at the company maybe this year and how that compared with previous years is it are deals becoming more strategic where verint sits maybe you can just start there from a high level dan bodner president chief executive officer and chairman yes i think we had a much bigger conference we had more attendance our customers talking to customers for most of the presentations actually by customers discussing their experiences and helping other customers leverage their experience to create roi in their organizations i would say that overall the energy level was up customers are much more interested in the cloud we ve always we ve always had people talking about moving to the cloud but things like what we ve done with feature priority where our solutions have feature priority between on premise and cloud really helped customers to make decision to transition because they don t have to retrain users we don t have to change processes they really is a very seamless transition from on prem to cloud so that s that was very well received so i think we certainly are encouraged by cloud is accelerating automation was absolutely the number one discussion on the floor we ve we showcased automation across our entire portfolio we talked about how we automate not just one part of this but you know the customer engagement process consist of a hierarchy of many different processes that are intertwined and working together and we showed how automation can really help create very quick roi and that was very well received and i think we are helping customers to prioritize their automation projects and being able to actually invest now and not just wait to the future to just wait until automation really going to bring value because i think they got much more much more convinced that there is value now and they also heard that from other customers from peers that have implemented during automation and start to see very very strong roi so there are very very strong conference daniel ives wedbush securities analyst okay maybe look obviously m a is a hot topic maybe you can just talk about going forward in the next 12 months does it feel verint will be more aggressive less aggressive fees from an m a should we expect if there are yields focused on cloud as sort of a segment maybe just sit on that thanks dan bodner president chief executive officer and chairman yeah so when we look at m a first we know we operate in very fragmented market both in customer engagement and cyber intelligence so we are basically we have two programs within the m a program we have technology tuck ins this is actually a program that is run by our head of products and the part people are constantly looking at this build versus buy decisions and again we wanted to stress that we are targeting 10 exclusive of any tuck ins but obviously if we can accelerate technology even faster we will and we get our both strategic and financial objectiveness we will continue with the tuck ins and then we have another program that generally look at m a in our market and whether we can create a strong irr by either consolidating or growing the business making ourselves more competitive taking out synergies and so forth in terms of capital allocation as we said we plan to generate about 800 million of cash over the next three years and predominantly would like to use that as a dry powder for m a but if we don t find desirable opportunities then we will return the cash to shareholders operator thank you and the next question comes from samad samana with jefferies your line is now open samad samana jefferies analyst hi thanks for taking my questions and nice quarter maybe first we definitely appreciate the increased disclosure and the amount of data provided today it s lot to digest but certainly much appreciated i think one of things that s that got to me was the smb acquisition that focuses on smb and i know that a one of the growth factors for the company i was wondering if maybe you could touch a little bit more about progress that you re making in the smb channel and then i have a couple of follow ups on the financial results for the quarter dan bodner president chief executive officer and chairman yeah the smb company that we bought is called monet they focus on smb technology we quickly bought them into our portfolio and while they brought few channels obviously we have a very large partner network so the plan there is very quick seamless integration very strong collaboration with monet people we found again very talented people there which you happy to bring over to the verint team and the plan is very simple we are offering a bigger smb portfolio to our partners and at the same time we are one of the few companies in smb that can also help them to move from smb to enterprise in a very seamless way so that s very important to our partners they sometimes work with multiple smb partners and then they have to work with enterprise partners separately and verint can actually is a one stop shop we ve always been very strong in terms of developing partners i think generally partners find verint to be very easy to do business with and as i mentioned also before while for the enterprise business we go to market in both our direct sales force and partners currently and going forward we are going after the smb pocket smb market with partners only we think that s a very efficient way and we hope to scale the business quickly in this way with a bigger portfolio and this acquisition certainly helped us to accelerate the time to market for the smb market samad samana jefferies analyst that s helpful and then maybe a follow on foresee and i know a couple of questions have been asked but if you could just maybe help us reconcile how the company did close to let s say 67 million in 2018 and then therein guided for 20 million contribution in 2019 or fiscal 20 which would be effectively calendar 19 i guess i m just trying to understand bridge the gap between that 67 million to the initial 20 million guidance and what the company saw when i gave that and then i guess for the incremental raised from the 20 number that 30 to 40 potential is it being that new business being driven by verint or is that something that you had discounted inside of foresee when you made the acquisition that turned out to be better than expected i guess just maybe be helping bridge that would be helpful for investors dan bodner president chief executive officer and chairman yes okay so the 67 million last year was with 15 15 million of losses and there was bigger losses than the year before right and we also found in diligence that they had renewal rates of the low 60 s in q4 and the q4 is a big renewal quarter for any company so clearly we expected that we have to do a few things first to expect further customer attrition and while the technology is strong i think customers are starting to move away from point solutions and foresee did not have the resources to develop a platform they were trying and they were on way to develop a bigger platform but they couldn t finish the job and obviously it makes sense for the foresee team to join forces with verint and help us to complete a platform quickly and also this helps them to go back to their customers and give them a roadmap which we already did with most of their customers and as i said we brought more than 100 foresee customers into our annual event and showcase the new release so the revenue this year is very much predicated on the idea that we re going to stop the attrition and we are giving customers a clear roadmap on how they can not only improve the foresee product but continue to expand with the verint platform into other areas so i also mentioned that in q1 we had further attrition and renewal rates was at the low 50s but we think we re taking the right steps so it let me reconcile the guidance first in terms of guidance we raised guidance three times the first time that we raised guidance was in december when we acquired foresee and we wanted to give a slower we wanted to tell investors that we paid 65 million and it s not a healthy company we re not buying it for their revenue or losses we re buying it for technology but we believe and we had very strong conviction that we can do at least 20 million which will be 3x revenue at that level obviously we were not happy with 20 and we were trying to get better but that was the flow and we raised guidance again in march by 25 million and part of that was because we started to see that we are taking the right steps with foresee and at that point we felt that 30 million of guidance is more appropriate so our 25 million increase in march was about 10 million attributable to foresee and 15 million to other parts of our business including the monte acquisition that we did in february it was about 5 million that we are taking into our guidance so that s kind of the way we thought about guidance today our view is that we should be able to generate 30 million to 40 million we made the business profitable day one and not only are profitable but also integrated so the r d organization the product management team already working hard on our roadmap which is really the strategic objective of the acquisition and the same time the feedback we got last week on the floor in our annual event is giving us in the bit more comfort about where this is going to end this year having said that even if we end up only with 30 million of profitable business paying 65 million for 30 million our saas business is profitable we certainly meeting our objectives for acquisitions and if we can achieve 40 million the high end of the range is obviously even better multiple longer term we think foresee is very important component of our voc platform and i m very pleased with the way we progressed with innovation samad samana jefferies analyst i really appreciate that very thorough answer and that s very helpful and for the sake of everybody else in the q a behind me i ll jump back in the queue of with my other questions but thank you so much for that answer that s very helpful dan bodner president chief executive officer and chairman okay sure inaudible operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from dan bergstrom with rbc capital markets your line is now open daniel bergstrom rbc capital markets analyst yes thanks for taking my question apologize for the background noise could you talk a little bit about the pace that maintenance conversion we should expect over the next several years understanding it s still early but i believe accelerating is that going to be largely customer driven or there are levers you could look to pull at some point to encourage conversion dan bodner president chief executive officer and chairman yes that s a good question i think the best thing we can do and we already did is what i mentioned before has future priority the biggest objection that we hear from customers is that they got the product is working you know there are under maintenance we re refreshing the product already pretty often so while they want to move to the cloud they are more interested in moving to the cloud with solutions that don t have rather than actually transitioning the one they do have so we have many customers that we saw new solutions in the cloud and they kept their existing solutions on premise and of course with the verint flexibility you can do that you can leave behind solution an on prem and work seamlessly with new solutions that are in the cloud so the feature priority actually takes away the last objection which is i don t want to drop my operation i don t want to move to the cloud and find a new application that require to change process or to train users on some new ways of doing business and we took that away with a feature priority so at this point i think that what s driving our customers to convert is a simple financial analysis of what s more expensive to keep their own data center and they re all it people that need to maintain the data center or to basically move to the cloud and outsource this operation to the verint cloud and i think for many customers the answer will be let s move to verint s because verint is more efficient we do it for many many customers when we do a security patching we forecast was at the same time so for many customers will be it s just more economical to take our solution and move to the verint cloud however there will be some customers that will remain on prem for a lot of different reasons i announced today many cloud deals but also announced over 10 million due from a large telco that actually wanted to stay on prem and that was a deal where we displaced many competitors because that standardized on verint and we certainly discussed with them cloud both in terms of converting our own solutions of cloud and converting the compared solutions of the cloud and all of the discussions they are remaining on premise so we certainly can do both but we are seeing customers moving more and more to the cloud and we certainly took a lot of the objections that the customer have regarding cloud we took that away and i think we re going to acceleration so the bottom line is we discussed last week on the webcast doug mentioned that we expect about 10 million conversion this year going to 20 million next year going to 30 million the following year daniel bergstrom rbc capital markets analyst great thanks dan bodner president chief executive officer and chairman sure operator thank you and our next question comes from jeffrey kessler with imperial capital your line is now jeffrey kessler imperial capital analyst thank you dan about this past december on your fourth quarter conference call you divided the cyber security business into three segments and what i m interested in finding out is three years ago cyber security because of emerging markets mainly but perhaps because one of two of the segments weren t performing that well was doing very poorly we re not up to your expectations not up to investors expectations what has changed from then until now with regards to one the geographic split let s call it disparity being done away but more importantly what are those which of those three parts or all those three parts have been improved to allow you to get this to a 10 growth area where it had been it had actually been shrinking dan bodner president chief executive officer and chairman yeah so just to remind everyone the three parts of cyber intelligence include physical security cyber security and the intelligence community and i would say that generally speaking automation is driving interest in all three parts of the security business because the exponential growth in data is a problem for all security customers in physical security as you know jeff explanation growth come from a lot of devices and in cyber security just growth in terms of the networks and endpoints and of course the intelligence agencies are have access to enormous amount of data so the ability to automatically capture data analyze data and put the insights to work is certainly something that is differentiating verint because it helps them to complete investigator investigations fastener and doing so with fewer cyber analyst and data scientists that are very very difficult to hire and retain so it s a combination of automating the investigated process and automating the collection and analysis of the data that i think contributed to improving growth rates in all parts of our security business jeffrey kessler imperial capital analyst great thank you that s the question that i have thank you alan roden senior vice president corporate development and investor relations yeah sure jeff operator thank you and i am showing no further questions in the queue at this time i d like to turn the call back to alan roden for any closing remarks alan roden senior vice president corporate development and investor relations thank you

guidance was 16 0 to 18 0 gross margin in the first quarter of 2019 was better than expected primarily due to a lower blended module manufacturing cost compared to our previous forecast canadian solar s mss business comprises primarily the design development manufacture and sale of solar modules other solar power products and solar system kits the mss business also provides engineering procurement and construction epc and operating and maintenance o m services canadian solar s energy business comprises primarily the development and sale of solar projects operating solar power projects and the sale of electricity the module sales from the company s mss business to its energy business are on terms and conditions similar to sales to third parties the company develops solar power projects worldwide where applicable the company may apply for and or be entitled to receive a feed in tariff fit for its projects alternatively the company may participate in public or private energy auctions and bidding which result in long term power purchase agreements ppas the company may also sell all or part of the electricity generated from its solar power projects on the merchant power market because of the longer lead time two to four years to develop solar power projects and bring them to a commercial operation date cod the actual gross margin of a project may deviate from the expected gross margin the deviation may be caused by but not limited to changes in the political and economic conditions in host countries project specific conditions price movements of solar modules and other components epc services and the capital return requirements of solar asset buyers in recent years the company has sold some solar power projects before cod we typically refer to these sales as notice to proceed or ntp sales revenue is lower while gross margin percentage is higher in ntp sales compared to cod sales even if the absolute margin is the same results from the company s energy business

chief executive officer of canadian solar commented after achieving close to 140 growth of net profit in 2018 from the 2017 level we reasonably expected a healthy pause in the first quarter of 2019 due to the acceleration of some high profit project sales from 2019 into 2018 the appreciation of the rmb lost manufacturing days related to our erp system upgrade and the impact of chinese new year on production and sales volumes despite these challenges we remained focused and delivered q1 2019 solar module shipments revenue and gross margin at or above our expectations we are encouraged by the healthy demand levels we are seeing in our key markets stability in module asps and anticipated higher utilization of our capacity our late stage utility scale solar power project pipeline including those under construction increased to approximately 3 4 gwp as of april 30 2019 the sale of the majority of these projects remains on track for 2020 or later our portfolio of solar power plants in

fourth quarter of 2018 our continued organizational focus on profitable module sales helped us deliver a 21 6 gross margin in a challenging quarter which was above our expectations our overall profitability for the first quarter 2019 was impacted by a foreign exchange loss due to the appreciation of the rmb against the u s dollar lost manufacturing days and a lower production volume due to our erp system upgrade and the chinese new year holiday as well as anticipated lower sales of solar power projects compared to the previous quarter we expect our profitability will improve as we move

thank you jennifer and welcome to everyone joining our call 2019 is off to a great start and our strong financial performance illustrates the progress we have already made against our goals for this year this performance was driven by our innovative merchandising and marketing strategies as well as our focus on operational excellence we delivered value and convenience across our footprint of more than 15 000 stores and we believe our neighborhood store concept continues to resonate with our customers as most of you know we have a lot of exciting things happening at dollar general and i m looking forward to updating you on our progress during today s call advertisement advertisement i ll start with a few key highlights from our first quarter before turning the call over to john for a more in depth look at our financial results after that i ll walk you through the progress we re making on our four strategic initiatives and finally i ll highlight the continued momentum our four operating priorities are generating for the business turning now to our first quarter performance we delivered comp sales growth of 3 8 additionally net sales grew 8 3 to 6 6 billion compared to net sales of 6 1 billion in the first quarter of 2018 this strong net sales performance in the first quarter of 2019 showed once again that we can continue to drive sales growth from both new stores and mature stores additionally during the first quarter we continue to gain market share in highly consumable product sales which was a key driver of our strong and balanced performance syndicated data indicated we had mid to high single digit growth in both units and dollars over the 4 12 24 and 52 week periods ending may 4 2019 our 3 8 comp growth rate for the first quarter of 2019 resulted from both an increase in average basket size as well as our highest customer traffic growth in over a year driving profitable traffic to our stores remains a priority and we re pleased to see our efforts delivering during the quarter we saw another very strong quarter of growth in sales of consumables our non consumable sales growth was driven by strong results in both seasonal and home as part of our ongoing merchandising strategy we continue to reduce space for hanging apparel in order to reallocate square footage to categories that our customers are shopping most in our stores as expected by intentionally downsizing our apparel offering we saw a negative overall comp in apparel that said we believe we are executing the write back to basics apparel strategy and we are reallocating the square footage to highly productive items that our customers are seeking as we noted in our last call we believe sales in the fourth quarter of 2018 benefited from the acceleration of certain snap payments from february to january although the shift in these payments created a sales headwind for q1 i m pleased to note that we only gave back approximately half of the benefit we saw in the fourth quarter we attribute this result to our strategic promotional activity in the fourth quarter which we believe drove loyalty and share gains among existing and new customers as we intended even as we continue to gain share we believe there is significant opportunity for us to take even more share we will continue to keep the customer at the center of everything we do and we re excited about the many opportunities we have to become an even more important partner to her as we move through 2019 and beyond advertisement advertisement with that i ll now turn the call over to john to provide you with a little bit more detail on the first quarter financial results john w garratt executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you todd and good morning everyone i m going to walk you through the financial details of the first quarter unless i specifically note otherwise all comparisons are year over year as todd already discussed sales i will start with gross profit gross profit as a percentage of sales was 30 2 in the first quarter a decrease of 23 basis points this decrease was primarily attributable to increases in distribution transportation costs a greater proportion of sales coming from the consumables category which generally has a lower gross profit rates at our other product categories and sales of lower margin products comprising a higher proportion of sales within the consumables category partially offsetting these items were higher initial markups on inventory purchases as we said we would we normalized our promotional markdown activity in the first quarter following targeted increases at the end of fiscal 2018 advertisement advertisement sg a as a percentage of sales was 22 5 an increase of 6 basis points the increase was primarily driven by increased employee benefits and occupancy costs as a percentage of sales partially offset by lower repairs and maintenance and workers compensation expenses as we noted on our fourth quarter call we are investing this year in our four strategic initiatives we remain excited about the long term transformative potential of these initiatives and believe we are making the right upfront investments in 2019 to deliver mid to long term benefits moving down the income statement our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20 8 and compares to 21 6 last year diluted earnings per share for the first quarter increased 8 8 to 1 48 the team did a nice job delivering the bottom line in the quarter despite headwinds from the investments and initiatives and the change we made to our inventory replenishment process turning now to our balance sheet which remains strong merchandise inventories were 4 1 billion at the end of the first quarter up 14 3 overall and an increase of 8 2 on a per store basis as we have previously discussed we began implementing a change to our inventory replenishment process in the first quarter that we believe will allow us to support even higher levels of on shelf availability as anticipated in addition to the gross margin headwind impact in the quarter the change also contributed to our slightly higher overall inventory levels in addition to our inventory replenishment efforts we are implementing more rigorous on shelf availability processes these processes are focused on improving the in stock performance of stores that do not meet our standards in the first quarter we saw a 26 in stock improvement in the below standard stores we know on shelf availability is a critical component of the overall customer satisfaction and convenience and ultimately sales we believe that we can continue to drive improvements in this area we continue to believe our inventory is in great shape and that these tactics position us to support and drive sales growth in fiscal 2019 and beyond our goal over time remains to have our inventory growth be in line with or below our sales growth advertisement advertisement the business continues to generate significant cash flow from operations totaling 574 million in the first quarter an increase of 25 5 million or 4 7 total capital expenditures for the first quarter were 145 million and included our planned investments in new stores remodels and relocations continued investments in construction of our amsterdam new york distribution center and spending related to the strategic initiatives during the quarter we repurchased 1 7 million shares of our common stock for approximately 200 million and paid a quarterly dividend of 0 32 per common share outstanding at a total cost of 83 million at the end of the first quarter the remaining share repurchase authorization was approximately 1 1 billion our capital allocation priorities have served us well and remain unchanged our first priority is investing in high return growth opportunities including new store expansion and infrastructure to support future growth we also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividends all while maintaining our current investment grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3 times adjusted debt to ebitdar i want to touch upon our fiscal 2019 financial guidance as most of you know tariff rates recently increased from 10 to 25 on certain goods from china as we have discussed with you on previous calls we have been executing on a variety of efforts to mitigate the impact of tariffs on our customers and our business our efforts have focused on four key areas continual negotiations with our vendors product substitution product reengineering and country of origin diversification we will do everything we can to minimize the impact of tariffs on our customers but even with these efforts we believe our shoppers will be facing higher prices as 2019 progresses our focus remains on maintaining our everyday low price leadership which is a key pillar of our value proposition even though the outlook for additional tariffs appeared to be more positive as we entered 2019 our focus on these efforts never waned as a result of this work and our strong start to fiscal 2019 we believe we can deliver on our current 2019 guidance with this in mind we are reiterating the 2019 guidance announced on march 14 2019 our guidance does not contemplate the impact of any additional increases in tariff rates or the expansion of additional products subject to tariffs beyond those currently in effect advertisement advertisement i also want to provide you with some updated color on some of our expectations we have noted that we are seeing a more balanced transportation marketplace which has helped alleviate some of the pressure we saw in the back half of 2018 however fuel costs have risen more than initially forecast and we anticipate these costs could be a gross margin headwind throughout 2019 despite transportation and tariff headwinds we continue to believe that we should see improvements in the gross margin year over year comparison as we move throughout the year regarding sg a we continue to expect to spend approximately 50 million on our strategic initiatives in 2019 while we expect these expenses to sequentially increase throughout the remainder of the year we anticipate that the overall impact of these investments will most significantly pressure operating profit in the second quarter as anticipated the change we made to our inventory replenishment process resulted in a higher inventory level at the end of the first quarter and we expect to see somewhat elevated levels throughout 2019 we are very pleased with our strong first quarter and are proud of the team s execution we believe our guidance reflects the strong start to the year while contemplating known headwinds as well as the fact that there is still a lot of year left ahead of us as always we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital with the goal of delivering consistent strong financial performance while strategically investing in initiatives for the long term growth we remain confident in our business model and our ongoing operating priorities to drive profitable same store sales growth helping new store returns strong free cash flow and long term shareholder value with that i will turn the call back over to todd advertisement advertisement todd vasos chief executive officer thank you john we re very pleased with the first quarter results and the strong start to 2019 we have an innovative robust portfolio of initiatives that are beginning to gain momentum and i want to take the next few minutes to update you on the progress we made this past quarter starting with our non consumable initiative or nci as a reminder nci is our early stage initiative focused on a new expanded product offering in key non consumable categories of home domestics housewares party and occasion the nci offering was available to more than 1 100 stores at the end of the first quarter and we plan to include it in approximately 2 400 stores by the end of 2019 we have learned a lot from these stores and we are already applying the lessons learned from successes in many non consumable departments across the chain we re very excited about the results we re seeing from these stores and have now moved through many replenishment cycles we are seeing lifts in non consumable sales particularly within seasonal and home but also delighted to be seeing a positive halo effect in consumable sales additionally while it s still early we are seeing a positive impact on customer traffic in these stores as a result we are driving higher sales and seeing improvements in both mix and gross margin in these stores next i want to update you on dg fresh which is one of the new strategic initiatives we introduced in our q4 call in march as a reminder dg fresh is a strategic multi phase shift to self distribution of frozen and refrigerated goods such as dairy and deli we began shipping from our first dg fresh facility in pottsville pennsylvania in january and we are serving more than 800 stores in the northeast while it s still early we are already successfully reducing product costs on these types of items we believe that we continue to scale dg fresh it will be meaningfully improve our gross margin two other important goals for dg fresh are to drive higher on time delivery and in stocks and we are encouraged by the early results which are in line with our projections advertisement advertisement in addition to the gross margin and in stock benefits dg fresh will eventually allow us to control our own destiny in these categories this will include a wider selection of both national and private brands that our customers seek as well as enhanced offering of better for you items while produce is not included in the initial rollout we believe dg fresh could provide a path forward to expanding our produce offering to more stores in the future we have signed leases on three more dg fresh facilities that we intend to open in 2019 we plan to begin shipping from our second facility in clayton north carolina within the next few weeks for fiscal 2019 our goal remains to rollout our self distribution model to as many as 5 000 stores from up to four facilities we re excited about dg fresh and the many benefits it can deliver for our customer and our business and we believe it can be accretive as early as 2020 turning now to digital during the first quarter the team continued to make great strides in deploying technology to further enhance the in store experience one great example of this work is our launch of the all new dollar general app which redesigned the coupon clipping experience for our customer removing friction in the clipping process in several ways our customers can now search for coupons by product category type or name and they can also use the app to scan a product and search for any available coupon in addition we ve introduced new features that help integrate our digital and traditional media including an interactive circular we are very excited with the early feedback our digital coupons continue to grow in popularity with our customers and we now have approximately 17 million digital coupon subscriber accounts and more than 300 million digital coupons were clipped in the first quarter we also continue to innovate within the dg go app as a reminder this app allows customers to use their phones to scan items as they shop see a running total of items in their basket using our cart calculator and then skip the line by using the dg go checkout through the end of the first quarter we have had more than 200 000 downloads of dg go and are averaging more than 40 000 monthly active users we have dg go checkout in approximately 250 stores and our goal is to have dg go in approximately 750 stores by the end of the fiscal year we have previously noted that our customers are using the cart calculator functionality frequently as a budgeting and optimization tool even when they are not using dg go to checkout based on this insight we intend to make cart calculator available in more than 12 000 stores by the end of the fiscal year as we move through 2019 we will continue to focus our efforts on developing new tools to enhance the value and convenience proposition for our customers for example we re working on consolidating our dg go and dollar general coupon apps in the one easy to use customer friendly app additionally we are identifying opportunities to harness the power of the data we have available to us and how we use that data to increase our ability to personalize the shopping experience for our customers we will continue to evolve our digital suite of tools to serve not only the customers we have today but also the customers of the future our digital strategy is an important component of our long term growth strategy and we re excited about the many opportunities ahead our fourth strategic initiative is fast track fast track is a two pronged approach to increasing labor productivity in our stores enhancing customer convenience and further improving on shelf availability there are two key components to fast track first we are streamlining the stocking process in our stores this starts with an update of sorting processes at our distribution centers that is facilitating our ability to optimize the way we pack our rolltainers our goal is to reduce the number of steps required to get product from truck to our store shelves to help you visualize this our goal is that each rolltainer only contain products for one or two adjacent aisles while this may sound simple the improved efficiencies from this change are expected to save a significant amount of store labor that can be redeployed to other customer facing activities or channeled into labor productivity gains our goal is to complete the resorting process in all existing traditional distribution centers by the end of 2020 as part of our streamline stocking process we will also look to incorporate more shelf ready packaging while this will take a little bit more time to achieve we believe we can reduce the number of case packs that must be broken apart and thus reduce the amount of time spent restocking shelves between deliveries and or reduce the number of items mis characterized as an out of stock this should have a positive impact to us on on shelf availability as items that may appear to be out of stock that are actually either on our sky shelves or in our backroom the second key component to fast track is a self checkout test which will allow customers to scan and pay further items with little to no assistance from our associates we believe this checkout option can further improve speed of checkout for our customers and reduce the number of labor hours devoted to checking out our customers our goal is to begin the self checkout pilot in select stores later in 2019 as john mentioned while there will be a significant sg a price tag for fast track in 2019 and upfront one we believe that it can enhance customer convenience and also drive sg a expense over time we believe we are the innovative leader in our channel and we are excited about our long term strategic initiatives we remain committed to our four operating priorities and i want to take our last few minutes to update you on some of the recent efforts our first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth cooler door expansion continues to be the most impactful merchandising initiative we began our cooler expansion efforts in earnest in 2013 in addition to being a great traffic and ticket driver our success in expanding our cooler footprint has provided the scale necessary to initiate dg fresh in the first quarter we added more than 12 000 cooler doors across the chain we also increased the number of stores with our better for you offering in the first quarter bringing the total for the chain to approximately 3 400 stores our new good smart private brand continues to be popular with our customers and it remains an important part of our better for you offering we have many ongoing efforts in the health and beauty area in 2019 most recently we launched believe our private cosmetic brand with all items priced at 5 or less we have seen great initial customer response to this aspirational brand and we are excited for more of our customers to try these goods over time the final merchandising initiative i want to highlight today is the partnership with western union as we announced in the first quarter this is a great opportunity to leverage our real estate footprint to offer our customers the ability to send or receive cash in more than 15 000 convenient locations this agreement creates value for dollar general in two key ways first we receive a commission for each transaction and second by delivering a new service that our customers want we believe that it can become a traffic driver over time as you ll hear from us frequently the customer is at the center of everything we do and this new service is another great example of offering her solutions she wants beyond these sales driving initiatives we are continuing efforts to capture several gross margin opportunities in addition to the gross margin benefits of nci and dg fresh reducing shrink remains an important opportunity for us we rolled out nearly 900 more electronic article surveillance units in the first quarter bringing the total number of stores with eas to approximately 11 000 our goal remains to have eas in approximately 13 000 stores by the end of the year we also continue to pursue distribution and transportation efficiencies to support our profitable sales growth as john noted we are seeing some continued inflation in 2019 in transportation costs primarily from fuel rates which further emphasizes the importance of these efforts for example we continue to make progress in reducing stem miles and our longview distribution center has ramped up nicely since we began shipping in january and we intend to begin shipping from our distribution center in amsterdam new york later this year we re also further expanding our private fleet and intend to grow it by at least another 75 tractors by the end of fiscal 2019 this year s private fleet expansion will be largely focused on our dg fresh facilities and we believe it remains an important part of our overall transportation strategy finally foreign sourcing remains a long term gross margin opportunity and our goals include increasing penetration as well as diversifying countries from which we source the team is successfully finding products in key categories that can be sourced internationally and we believe there are many additional products and channels to explore our second priority is capturing growth opportunities our proven high return low risk model for real estate growth remains a core strength for our business our real estate model continues to focus on the five metrics that have served us well in evaluating thousands of new stores in recent years these metrics include new store productivity actual sales performance average returns cannibalization and the payback period even as we see changes on the competitive landscape our real estate projections continue to perform well against these metrics reinforcing our belief that new store growth is the best use of our capital our remodel and relocation program is in a great supplement to our new store growth strategy and overall we continue to see strong results from our portfolio of real estate projects we made tremendous progress toward achieving our real estate project goals in the first quarter during the quarter we opened 240 new stores remodeled 330 stores including 128 dgtp remodels and relocated 27 stores we also added produce to approximately 50 stores bringing the total of stores across the chain offering produce to approximately 480 as a reminder on average our traditional remodel stores which have an average of 22 cooler doors deliver a 4 to 5 comp lift and the dgtp remodel which has an average of 34 higher capacity coolers delivers a 10 to 15 comp lift with the addition of produce driving comps to the high end of this range we have a robust real estate pipeline in place and we are excited about the continued growth ahead of us in 2019 our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low cost operator the discipline with which the team approaches spending continues to be a great strength our clear and defined process to control expenses government spending decisions and has resulted in a strong cost control mindset we continue to focus efforts around the organization of reducing costs where possible through a zero base budgeting process while this operating philosophy is generally focused on cost reduction it has also proven to be a great springboard for many of the ideas in fact this process was the foundation for both fast track and western union and we believe it continues to serve us well as we reinforce our position as a low cost operator our fourth and final operating priority is to invest in our people as we believe they are a competitive advantage we believe the opportunity to develop a career with a growing retailer is unique in many of the communities we call home and we are proud of the thousands of associates who have taken advantage of this opportunity more than 11 000 of our current store managers are internal promotes and we continue to champion strong development and training programs for our associates to grow on the supply chain side our first class of employees has completed their private fleet driving training program this program pays for distribution center associates to obtain their commercial driver s licenses and furthers their careers to keep a close eye on we keep a close eye on key metrics related to our employees our people and we are pleased with what we are seeing we continue to have a robust applicant flow at every level additionally while it s still early in the year store manager turnover is trending better in 2019 than 2018 which was our best year on record we are continually engaging with our entire employee base and we believe this dialogue is vital to cultivating the strong dollar general culture remaining an employer of choice is an important priority for us and we believe that we are well positioned to continue to attract and retain talent in closing we are very pleased with our strong first quarter and excited about our position and outlook for the remainder of 2019 as we said we would we are driving growth on multiple fronts and i m delighted with the team s ability to deliver across so many complex projects simultaneously our real estate growth strategy is generating thousands of new store openings and remodels and we have a portfolio of robust initiatives in place that we believe will have a meaningful positive impact on our business for years to come in short we are using our mature and stable business as a foundation to drive innovation and growth we believe we operate in the most attractive sector of retail and we continue to differentiate the dollar general business from the rest of the retail landscape through our distinct combination of value and convenience in a unique real estate footprint our mission of serving others guides all we do at dollar general and the team remains focused on serving our customers every day while driving long term value for our shareholders i want to thank each of our more than 137 000 employees across the company for all of their hard work every day i m excited about what we can accomplish together in 2019 with that operator we would now like to open the lines for questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions our first question or comment comes from the line of matt boss from jpmorgan your line is open matt boss jpmorgan analyst congrats on a hey congrats on a great quarter guys todd vasos chief executive officer thank you john w garratt executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you matt boss jpmorgan analyst so todd maybe to start off you outlined a laundry list of top line initiatives under way i think you probably could have hosted an analyst day for how much is clearly going on i guess maybe could you help segment opportunities you think contributed to your first quarter comp what you are the most excited about maybe into the back half of the year versus initiatives you see accelerating into next year and beyond todd vasos chief executive officer sure our cooler program continues to be one of the key drivers matt to what we ve seen in our success so far in 2019 and also what we ve seen in the past what i m also excited about is what we re seeing in a lot of the initiatives that we continue to work on in our hba world as an example the teams are doing a great job there and the customer is really resonating to our great prices our values as well as our extensive private brand and national brand offering in those areas so they continue to do very well and our new cosmetic line believe i think will continue to build momentum as we move into the second quarter and back half of this year as you look at later parts of this year and into next we believe that many of our initiatives including nci will continue to build momentum and also our dg fresh initiative as i look at that over the long term later this year and into next it s already starting to deliver the gross margin that we see through better cost of goods but also it s showing us that we can be better in stock by controlling our own destiny there and so we believe that that ll start paying even more dividends as we move to the back half of the year we re very bullish on what we see in our top line right now and we will continue to push as much as we can to continue to see these great results as we move through the back half of the year matt boss jpmorgan analyst great maybe then just a follow up on the sg a front so excluding the incremental 50 million of initiative spend any underlying change to the 2 5 to 3 comp as the expense leverage point and todd i guess larger picture is it fair to think about this year s strategic initiatives build as a peak level as you kind of look forward todd vasos chief executive officer yeah i ll let john start and i ll add a little color john w garratt executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah in terms of sg a we are pleased with the q1 cost control we deleveraged 6 basis points but as we mentioned we are investing in initiatives for future growth there was somewhat of a shift from q1 to q2 but very pleased with the cost control in terms of the leverage point as we discussed before there is an impact as you are investing in things like dg fresh which we see as enhancing our operating margin over time that does put pressure on sg a as you re investing some labor in the stores and our initiatives like that but i would say we remain laser focused on cost control we don t see it differently and the main change here is that dynamic of investing in these strategic initiatives which we see is helping our operating margin and being as accretive as early as next year operator thank you in the interest of time we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow up please our next question or comment comes from the line of michael lasser from ubs your line is open michael lasser ubs analyst thanks for taking my question given the success you had in the first quarter why shouldn t we expect a comp at better than the 2 that s implied at the in your full year comp guidance of 2 5 over the next few quarters todd vasos chief executive officer yeah hi michael this is todd when i look at the rest of the year we do feel very good about where the comp is headed we got a lot of year ahead of us right and there is a could be a lot of noise out there we don t know what these this last list of tariffs may or may not do to our core consumer and really the consumer base in general so i think we re our guidance reflects appropriate where the where we are today and where those risks still may lie but we re doing everything we can to continue to drive that top line and of course drive traffic and our key here is traffic and traffic is king we know that and we continue to all of our efforts around our sales are really guided by that traffic growth michael lasser ubs analyst in on the subject of tariffs we know that 5 of your sales come from direct imports with china being one of those countries do you have an overall estimate of your cost of goods exposure to china if the list 4 does go through john w garratt executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so as you indicated it s about 6 of our purchases measured at cost are tied to direct imports predominantly china centric although we have been diversifying in recent years this is an impact facing all retail our exposure is relatively lower compared to many and the team has been working very diligently to mitigate this impact as evidenced by the updated guidance or the guidance that we maintained the team is working on continual negotiations with vendors product substitution product reengineering and continuing to change the origin of country where it s coming from we re doing everything we can to minimize the impact on the customers but as you know this is as others have said this is probably something that s going to impact the customers particularly if the list 4 comes out i d rather not speculate on what that impact will be hard to say how that things will shake out there but we believe that we are very well positioned to serve our customer as we re priced right we re conveniently located and we re there to help her in good times and bad todd vasos chief executive officer and michael i ll just add as well remember we are a limited source limited sku retailer meaning we don t have to carry everything and we can make decisions on what to carry and what not to carry depending on cost of goods and what may or may not increase and i think the team has done a real nice job in the first few lists and while list 4 is very extensive that work is ongoing right now as well so stay tuned we re hoping that there ll be some resolution here but make no mistake that this will if list 4 goes in it will cost the consumer on during and with her budgets the great thing is though i believe that dollar general stands ready to be able to serve that customer because she ll need us more at that time michael lasser ubs analyst sounds good thank you so much and good luck operator thank you our next question or comment comes from the line of karen short from barclays your line is open karen short barclays analyst hi thanks very much great quarter todd vasos chief executive officer thank you karen short barclays analyst just a quick just a question in terms of having such a strong 1q obviously you indicated there will be more sg a pressure in 2q but i guess any thoughts on keeping kind of the full year overall guidance given that some of these costs abate in the second half and gross margin compares also get quite a bit easier john w garratt executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i ll start by saying we feel great about the fundamentals of the business and the strong start to the year as i did note there was some investment spending shifted from q1 to q2 and importantly we absorbed the impact of the recently enacted tariff increases not previously assumed into the guidance and as todd mentioned there s still a lot of year left to tap the comp laps are a little tougher as the year goes on but we feel great about the business we feel comfortable about the guidance we ve provided and we re very pleased with the start of the year karen short barclays analyst okay and then just switching to comps for a second on the nci maybe can you give a little bit of color on the comp lift that you re seeing in the stores and also the margin impact and then you made a comment on the 26 improvement i guess in in stocks at the below standard stores any color you can give us on the comp benefit from having a better in stock todd vasos chief executive officer sure on the nci program we are very pleased with the early results there the team has done a really nice job in procuring goods we re now into our fourth and fifth replenishment cycle and some of the product that i ve seen recently with this newest wave is even better than the previous one so i could tell you that we feel very good with what we re seeing we re seeing an overall lift in the store both in our non consumable areas and our consumable areas so we re getting a very nice halo effect out of that and not only are we seeing those lifts in our top line sales but we re seeing gross margin benefits of course in our non consumable area but overall as well for the entire box so we re feeling very good about where we re going we ll do up to 2 400 stores this year and looking to see how we accelerate that as we move into 2020 and beyond but again we feel very good your second part of the question was on the in stock piece we ve been working very hard started at the end of last year and relooking at how we look at on shelf availability and very proud of what the team has done in and around making sure we have product on the shelf for our consumers now it did come with a little bit of cost of some inventory but as you alluded to and we talked about in our prepared remarks we re seeing in the 20 range increase of on shelf availability meaning in stocks for our customer and i could tell you that in those stores it s meaningful and it does add to the comp so we ll continue to work that that piece and as i also talked about as fast track continues to move forward and this would probably be more into the late 19 and into 2020 we are going to be getting some on shelf availability benefits from that as well as we continue to reduce those case packs and rationalize our sku base on the shelf to better keep our in stock levels on fast movers and stay tuned for more of that we believe that will pay some real benefits as we move into the end of the year and in the 20 karen short barclays analyst great that s helpful thanks operator thank you our next question or comment comes from the line of paul trussell from deutsche bank your line is open paul trussell deutsche bank analyst good morning and great quarter todd vasos chief executive officer thanks paul paul trussell deutsche bank analyst the gross margin performance in 1q was better than my forecast just curious how it stacked up to your expectations and previously you had mentioned that you expected the most pressure on a year over year basis in 1q just want to make sure that guidance still stands and just give some overall puts and takes on gpm john w garratt executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah we were pleased with the performance in q1 we d indicated that on our q4 call that q1 will be pressured but we did say that we expected to see sequential improvement on a year over year basis as we went from q4 to q1 but nonetheless we did see pressure from the change in the replenishment process as well as the ongoing pressure of distribution transportation cost and the ongoing mix pressures however as we said we would we were successful in normalizing the promotional markdown costs while at the same time delivering strong comps and traffic so we re very pleased with that the team did a great job managing through the various headwinds and as we said in our prepared statements we expect to see further sequential improvement over the balance of the year on a year over year comp basis and longer term we believe we have a lot of opportunities to increase not only gross margin but operating margin over time as todd indicated we are very excited about the progress we re making on dg fresh as we convert items and convert stores we re seeing the benefits of the cost savings we expected there very pleased with what we re seeing from nci in terms of not only the sales lift but also the improvement that adds to mix we re investing more in eas units we re going to be adding another 3 000 this year we ve seen great success from that and the benefit it has on shrink and there continues to be opportunities for us with category management increasing foreign sourcing penetration increasing private label penetration and we mentioned the non consumable opportunity and then lastly while we did see pressure from transportation costs in q1 and fuel remains a pressure we re very pleased by what we ve seen in terms of the proactive efforts of the team to mitigate these efforts and take advantage of an improving environment so we re optimistic that over the long term we can not only maintain but enhance overall operating margin over the long term that s the way we look at it paul trussell deutsche bank analyst thanks for that color and just as a follow up todd could you maybe just speak bigger picture to what your core consumer is saying about their financial health and overall sentiment on the economy and then maybe rank for us as you look in your stores comp gains occurring from your core customer coming more frequently versus shopping the store more broadly versus actually getting that trade down from higher income shoppers thank you todd vasos chief executive officer yeah sure paul yeah when you look at our gains our core consumer is continuing to tell us i feel pressure but again this core consumer always is under pressure financially her income levels are on the lower end as we all know and saying that she continues to tell us that she s back to work she continues to tell us that she has got a little bit more money in her pocket more so from productivity meaning more working more hours than actual wage growth but yet more money she has headwinds make no bones about it she still has headwinds of healthcare being one of the largest rents continues to be out there for her as a headwind but as we looked into last year when we started to hear from our consumer that she was feeling a little bit more stressed we continue to hear that but what we do very well here is we re able to move our promotional activity our mix inside the store our end cap presentations to match where we believe she will be and we did that in the first quarter and i believe very successfully and we ll continue to do that as our customer tells us where she believes she ll be in her journey as we move through 2019 the as you look at our consumers overall though i would tell you that our consumer that makes a little bit more money so that next level up consumer is our fastest growing consumer that we have here at dollar general so that trade in is alive and well but it s not coming at any cost of our core consumer and our core consumer continues to come more often as well as we re seeing that she s spending more when she s in the store so we re both getting the transaction growth side and that basket side so we feel very good about our customer segments and where they re headed and the great thing is we re attracting the higher end consumer i believe because of all of the work that we ve done in this box over the years paul trussell deutsche bank analyst thanks so much best of luck operator thank you our next question or comment comes from the line of rupesh parikh from oppenheimer your line is open rupesh parikh oppenheimer analyst good morning thanks for taking my question and also congrats on a nice quarter todd vasos chief executive officer thank you rupesh parikh oppenheimer analyst so i had two questions on your dg fresh effort so i guess first anything that has surprised you thus far i know it s only been a few months at this point and then as you think longer term or even in the intermediate term how do you think about what flows to the bottom line versus being reinvested in the business from some of the gross margin benefits that you expect to see todd vasos chief executive officer yeah right now i would tell you that the dg fresh initiative is really performing about where we thought it would perform again our teams are very good at executing very complex projects and this as you could imagine is one of the big ones but i would tell you opening a 1 000 stores a year and remodeling another 1 000 is no easy feat so we re very good at this type of work and i would tell you that dg fresh was no different and it s executing as we thought and are producing the results that we thought you heard from john we re seeing the cost of goods savings we re seeing better in stocks already at store level and we re only 800 stores in and so more to come as we move through the next cycles of this the great thing is the plan is rolling out as designed we ve already got all four of our dcs signed and ready to go and the next one we will be shipping here in the next few weeks so we feel good about that and then as you continue to look at dg fresh on that margin rate the great thing about dollar general is we never took our eye off of price whether that d be in our fresh area or our dry areas of the company and we re priced very very well across the board so i would tell you that we feel very good about that and we feel very good about those margin gains that should come from this over time should the majority of it should drop to the bottom line which is very exciting rupesh parikh oppenheimer analyst great and one quick follow up question weather clearly a challenge last year and it appeared also a challenge in q1 just curious if you guys think you had a negative impact on your business john w garratt executive vice president and chief financial officer what i would say is there are a lot of puts and takes between weather lapse weather this year and the pull forward of the snap benefit when you net all that together all that noise together it s about a push and really the 3 8 comp was a solid 3 8 comp not impacted by any real outside noise rupesh parikh oppenheimer analyst great thank you operator thank you our next question or comment comes from the line of anthony chukumba from loop capital markets your line is open anthony chukumba loop capital markets analyst good morning thanks for taking my question so related question on comps i mean in the first quarter obviously you had the pull forward because of the snap benefit of 70 basis points it sounds you got half of that back tax refunds looked like were a little bit lower than people expected and then weather was pretty bad so putting that all together what do you think allowed you to do close to a 4 comp with those three headwinds was it macro or was it more about the positive impact of the of a lot of initiatives that you talked about in this call thank you todd vasos chief executive officer yeah i would tell you that our core consumer again is has a little bit more money in their pocket but i would tell you when you look at the performance and as we see it broken down in the categories that we watch very closely here many of our gains occurred from the initiatives that either we worked through in 2018 that are continuing to still pay off and even some of those early 2019 ones so it gives us a lot of confidence that we re on the right track and as we move through the rest of this year anthony chukumba loop capital markets analyst that s helpful thanks a lot todd vasos chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question or comment comes from the line of scot ciccarelli from rbc capital markets your line is open scot ciccarelli rbc capital markets analyst good morning guys so i know a bunch of people have asked about kind of the comp momentum but todd specifically you talked about how last year which where we generally saw rising average ticket but softer traffic was due to the relative health of your core customer and trip consolidation so i guess what i m kind of trying to figure out is what specifically changed this quarter i mean you had mentioned cooler expansion earlier in the call but you ve been expanding cooler doors for years so i guess i m trying to figure out specifically in 1q maybe what changed on the traffic front thanks todd vasos chief executive officer yeah so i think the best way to look at this is two things number one i mentioned earlier this core consumer started to signal middle of last year that she was feeling a little bit more pressure not feeling as robust as she did so i would tell you that this core consumer her shopping patterns are and habits are changing a little bit we re seeing it and maybe moving more back to what we were used to seeing with maybe not quite as a fuller full basket and coming a little bit more often now one quarter doesn t make a year so we re going to continue to watch what she does but in q1 we saw some start of that normalization back to where this core customer normally is resonating at the other thing that i would tell you in q1 specifically is the actions we took in q4 promotionally to really solidify that customer in q4 did exactly exactly what we thought and brought forward that customer in a very sticky manner if you will the q1 and she spent accordingly so we feel good about that initiative in q4 it did exactly what we thought in q1 and i believe that was a big piece of why we only gave back half of that snap benefit that we pushed in the q4 last year from that top line scot ciccarelli rbc capital markets analyst interesting okay thanks guys operator thank you our next question or comment comes from the line our final question comes from the line of kelly bania from bmo capital markets your line is open kelly bania bmo capital markets analyst good morning thanks for fitting me in just wanted to ask another one about tariff sounds like you did a lot of work there to mitigate that and do some substitutions just was wondering if you can help us understand how much price you expect to pass along and maybe too early to tell from a competitive standpoint but how do you think you performed on that mitigation strategy relative to competitors and how much price do you think really we re going to see being passed through broadly todd vasos chief executive officer as again you take a look at dollar general and again we ve been all along many many years now we ensure that we have the right price for our consumer we watch price very very closely here but the other thing to keep in mind about dollar general i mentioned earlier is we don t have to carry everything we re a limited sku assorted retailer and we can make decisions based on a lot of different factors to include price meaning cost of goods and we ll continue to do that as we move through this these tariffs i think our teams have done a great job to date but i would tell you even through the first three lists if you will we ve seen in the marketplace the consumer is paying a little bit more money across the board in the marketplace and with list 4 looming out there which is probably the big well not probably it is the biggest impacted list i would have to assume the consumer is going to bear the brunt of some of this as well and so we re doing everything we can here at dollar general to make sure we soften that blow but again the great thing is this model works so well in good times and not so good times and if this consumer is having to pay more across the board at every retailer because of these tariffs we will stand ready to be able to with open arms to take her in when she needs us most and we re positioning ourselves for that as we move through 2019 kelly bania bmo capital markets analyst okay thanks and maybe just a follow up on the prior question about the stickiness and the promotional activity that you did last quarter how do you expect that or do you expect that stickiness to continue to impact your consumer and the traffic patterns for the rest of the year todd vasos chief executive officer what we see normally is that that stickiness does stay with us for a couple of quarters so we believe that we ll still see some benefit from that as we move into q2 may not be quite as much as q1 but again we feel very good about where we are and our start to the fiscal year so we feel that that customer resonates very well with price and value we know that and we continue to offer that so even though that we ve normalized the promotional activity you got to remember who dollar general is and that is everyday low price on the shelf as she can count on and she sees that when she s in the store each and every day so again we feel very good about our competitiveness on price and we feel good about our both traffic and ticket as we move into the second quarter and back half of this year kelly bania bmo capital markets analyst thank you operator thank you that concludes our q a session today i d like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks todd vasos chief executive officer thank you very much and we hope to talk to you soon thank you operator ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today s conference this concludes the program you may now disconnect

is off to a great start and our strong financial performance illustrates the progress we have already made against our goals for this year this performance was driven by our innovative merchandising and marketing strategies as well as our focus on operational excellence we delivered value and convenience across our footprint of more than 15 000 stores and we believe our neighborhood store concept continues to resonate with our customers as most of you know we have a lot of exciting things happening at dollar general and i m looking forward to updating you on our progress during today s call i ll start with a few key highlights from our first quarter before turning the call over to john for a more in depth look at our financial results after that i ll walk you through the progress we re making on our four strategic initiatives and finally i ll highlight the continued momentum our four operating priorities are generating for the business turning now to our first quarter performance we delivered comp sales growth of 3 8 additionally net sales grew 8 3 to 6 6 billion compared to net sales of 6 1 billion in the first quarter of 2018 this strong net sales performance in the first quarter of 2019 showed once again that we can continue to drive sales growth from both new stores and mature stores additionally during the first quarter we continue to gain market share in highly consumable product sales which was a key driver of our strong and balanced performance syndicated data indicated we had mid to high single digit growth in both units and dollars over the 4 12 24 and 52 week periods ending may 4 2019 our 3 8 comp growth rate for the first quarter of 2019 resulted from both an increase in average basket size as well as our highest customer traffic growth in over a year driving profitable traffic to our stores remains a priority and we re pleased to see our efforts delivering during the quarter we saw another very strong quarter of growth in sales of consumables our non consumable sales growth was driven by strong results in both seasonal and home as part of our ongoing merchandising strategy we continue to reduce space for hanging apparel in order to reallocate square footage to categories that our customers are shopping most in our stores as expected by intentionally downsizing our apparel offering we saw a negative overall comp in apparel that said we believe we are executing the write back to basics apparel strategy and we are reallocating the square footage to highly productive items that our customers are seeking as we noted in our last call we believe sales in the fourth quarter of 2018 benefited from the acceleration of certain snap payments from february to january although the shift in these payments created a sales headwind for q1 i m pleased to note that we only gave back approximately half of the benefit we saw in the fourth quarter we attribute this result to our strategic promotional activity in the fourth quarter which we believe drove loyalty and share gains among existing and new customers as we intended even as we continue to gain share we believe there is significant opportunity for us to take even more share we will continue to keep the customer at the center of everything we do and we re excited about the many opportunities we have to become an even more important partner to her as we move through 2019 and beyond with that i ll now turn the call over to john to provide you with a little bit more detail on the first quarter financial results john w garratt executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you todd and good morning everyone i m going to walk you through the financial details of the first quarter unless i specifically note otherwise all comparisons are year over year as todd already discussed sales i will start with gross profit gross profit as a percentage of sales was 30 2 in the first quarter a decrease of 23 basis points this decrease was primarily attributable to increases in distribution transportation costs a greater proportion of sales coming from the consumables category which generally has a lower gross profit rates at our other product categories and sales of lower margin products comprising a higher proportion of sales within the consumables category partially offsetting these items were higher initial markups on inventory purchases as we said we would we normalized our promotional markdown activity in the first quarter following targeted increases at the end of fiscal 2018 sg a as a percentage of sales was 22 5 an increase of 6 basis points the increase was primarily driven by increased employee benefits and occupancy costs as a percentage of sales partially offset by lower repairs and maintenance and workers compensation expenses as we noted on our fourth quarter call we are investing this year in our four strategic initiatives we remain excited about the long term transformative potential of these initiatives and believe we are making the right upfront investments in 2019 to deliver mid to long term benefits moving down the income statement our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20 8 and compares to 21 6 last year diluted earnings per share for the first quarter increased 8 8 to 1 48 the team did a nice job delivering the bottom line in the quarter despite headwinds from the investments and initiatives and the change we made to our inventory replenishment process turning now to our balance sheet which remains strong merchandise inventories were 4 1 billion at the end of the first quarter up 14 3 overall and an increase of 8 2 on a per store basis as we have previously discussed we began implementing a change to our inventory replenishment process in the first quarter that we believe will allow us to support even higher levels of on shelf availability as anticipated in addition to the gross margin headwind impact in the quarter the change also contributed to our slightly higher overall inventory levels in addition to our inventory replenishment efforts we are implementing more rigorous on shelf availability processes these processes are focused on improving the in stock performance of stores that do not meet our standards in the first quarter we saw a 26 in stock improvement in the below standard stores we know on shelf availability is a critical component of the overall customer satisfaction and convenience and ultimately sales we believe that we can continue to drive improvements in this area we continue to believe our inventory is in great shape and that these tactics position us to support and drive sales growth in fiscal 2019 and beyond our goal over time remains to have our inventory growth be in line with or below our sales growth the business continues to generate significant cash flow from operations totaling 574 million in the first quarter an increase of 25 5 million or 4 7 total capital expenditures for the first quarter were 145 million and included our planned investments in new stores remodels and relocations continued investments in construction of our amsterdam new york distribution center and spending related to the strategic initiatives during the quarter we repurchased 1 7 million shares of our common stock for approximately 200 million and paid a quarterly dividend of 0 32 per common share outstanding at a total cost of 83 million at the end of the first quarter the remaining share repurchase authorization was approximately 1 1 billion our capital allocation priorities have served us well and remain unchanged our first priority is investing in high return growth opportunities including new store expansion and infrastructure to support future growth we also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividends all while maintaining our current investment grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3 times adjusted debt to ebitdar i want to touch upon our fiscal 2019 financial guidance as most of you know tariff rates recently increased from 10 to 25 on certain goods from china as we have discussed with you on previous calls we have been executing on a variety of efforts to mitigate the impact of tariffs on our customers and our business our efforts have focused on four key areas continual negotiations with our vendors product substitution product reengineering and country of origin diversification we will do everything we can to minimize the impact of tariffs on our customers but even with these efforts we believe our shoppers will be facing higher prices as 2019 progresses our focus remains on maintaining our everyday low price leadership which is a key pillar of our value proposition even though the outlook for additional tariffs appeared to be more positive as we entered 2019 our focus on these efforts never waned as a result of this work and our strong start to fiscal 2019 we believe we can deliver on our current 2019 guidance with this in mind we are reiterating the 2019 guidance announced on march 14 2019 our guidance does not contemplate the impact of any additional increases in tariff rates or the expansion of additional products subject to tariffs beyond those currently in effect i also want to provide you with some updated color on some of our expectations we have noted that we are seeing a more balanced transportation marketplace which has helped alleviate some of the pressure we saw in the back half of 2018 however fuel costs have risen more than initially forecast and we anticipate these costs could be a gross margin headwind throughout 2019 despite transportation and tariff headwinds we continue to believe that we should see improvements in the gross margin year over year comparison as we move throughout the year regarding sg a we continue to expect to spend approximately 50 million on our strategic initiatives in 2019 while we expect these expenses to sequentially increase throughout the remainder of the year we anticipate that the overall impact of these investments will most significantly pressure operating profit in the second quarter as anticipated the change we made to our inventory replenishment process resulted in a higher inventory level at the end of the first quarter and we expect to see somewhat elevated levels throughout 2019 we are very pleased with our strong first quarter and are proud of the team s execution we believe our guidance reflects the strong start to the year while contemplating known headwinds as well as the fact that there is still a lot of year left ahead of us as always we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital with the goal of delivering consistent strong financial performance while strategically investing in initiatives for the long term growth we remain confident in our business model and our ongoing operating priorities to drive profitable same store sales growth helping new store returns strong free cash flow and long term shareholder value with that i will turn the call back over to todd todd vasos chief executive officer thank you john we re very pleased with the first quarter results and the strong start to 2019 we have an innovative robust portfolio of initiatives that are beginning to gain momentum and i want to take the next few minutes to update you on the progress we made this past quarter starting with our non consumable initiative or nci as a reminder nci is our early stage initiative focused on a new expanded product offering in key non consumable categories of home domestics housewares party and occasion the nci offering was available to more than 1 100 stores at the end of the first quarter and we plan to include it in approximately 2 400 stores by the end of 2019 we have learned a lot from these stores and we are already applying the lessons learned from successes in many non consumable departments across the chain we re very excited about the results we re seeing from these stores and have now moved through many replenishment cycles we are seeing lifts in non consumable sales particularly within seasonal and home but also delighted to be seeing a positive halo effect in consumable sales additionally while it s still early we are seeing a positive impact on customer traffic in these stores as a result we are driving higher sales and seeing improvements in both mix and gross margin in these stores next i want to update you on dg fresh which is one of the new strategic initiatives we introduced in our q4 call in march as a reminder dg fresh is a strategic multi phase shift to self distribution of frozen and refrigerated goods such as dairy and deli we began shipping from our first dg fresh facility in pottsville pennsylvania in january and we are serving more than 800 stores in the northeast while it s still early we are already successfully reducing product costs on these types of items we believe that we continue to scale dg fresh it will be meaningfully improve our gross margin two other important goals for dg fresh are to drive higher on time delivery and in stocks and we are encouraged by the early results which are in line with our projections in addition to the gross margin and in stock benefits dg fresh will eventually allow us to control our own destiny in these categories this will include a wider selection of both national and private brands that our customers seek as well as enhanced offering of better for you items while produce is not included in the initial rollout we believe dg fresh could provide a path forward to expanding our produce offering to more stores in the future we have signed leases on three more dg fresh facilities that we intend to open in 2019 we plan to begin shipping from our second facility in clayton north carolina within the next few weeks for fiscal 2019 our goal remains to rollout our self distribution model to as many as 5 000 stores from up to four facilities we re excited about dg fresh and the many benefits it can deliver for our customer and our business and we believe it can be accretive as early as 2020 turning now to digital during the first quarter the team continued to make great strides in deploying technology to further enhance the in store experience one great example of this work is our launch of the all new dollar general app which redesigned the coupon clipping experience for our customer removing friction in the clipping process in several ways our customers can now search for coupons by product category type or name and they can also use the app to scan a product and search for any available coupon in addition we ve introduced new features that help integrate our digital and traditional media including an interactive circular we are very excited with the early feedback our digital coupons continue to grow in popularity with our customers and we now have approximately 17 million digital coupon subscriber accounts and more than 300 million digital coupons were clipped in the first quarter we also continue to innovate within the dg go app as a reminder this app allows customers to use their phones to scan items as they shop see a running total of items in their basket using our cart calculator and then skip the line by using the dg go checkout through the end of the first quarter we have had more than 200 000 downloads of dg go and are averaging more than 40 000 monthly active users we have dg go checkout in approximately 250 stores and our goal is to have dg go in approximately 750 stores by the end of the fiscal year we have previously noted that our customers are using the cart calculator functionality frequently as a budgeting and optimization tool even when they are not using dg go to checkout based on this insight we intend to make cart calculator available in more than 12 000 stores by the end of the fiscal year as we move through 2019 we will continue to focus our efforts on developing new tools to enhance the value and convenience proposition for our customers for example we re working on consolidating our dg go and dollar general coupon apps in the one easy to use customer friendly app additionally we are identifying opportunities to harness the power of the data we have available to us and how we use that data to increase our ability to personalize the shopping experience for our customers we will continue to evolve our digital suite of tools to serve not only the customers we have today but also the customers of the future our digital strategy is an important component of our long term growth strategy and we re excited about the many opportunities ahead our fourth strategic initiative is fast track fast track is a two pronged approach to increasing labor productivity in our stores enhancing customer convenience and further improving on shelf availability there are two key components to fast track first we are streamlining the stocking process in our stores this starts with an update of sorting processes at our distribution centers that is facilitating our ability to optimize the way we pack our rolltainers our goal is to reduce the number of steps required to get product from truck to our store shelves to help you visualize this our goal is that each rolltainer only contain products for one or two adjacent aisles while this may sound simple the improved efficiencies from this change are expected to save a significant amount of store labor that can be redeployed to other customer facing activities or channeled into labor productivity gains our goal is to complete the resorting process in all existing traditional distribution centers by the end of 2020 as part of our streamline stocking process we will also look to incorporate more shelf ready packaging while this will take a little bit more time to achieve we believe we can reduce the number of case packs that must be broken apart and thus reduce the amount of time spent restocking shelves between deliveries and or reduce the number of items mis characterized as an out of stock this should have a positive impact to us on on shelf availability as items that may appear to be out of stock that are actually either on our sky shelves or in our backroom the second key component to fast track is a self checkout test which will allow customers to scan and pay further items with little to no assistance from our associates we believe this checkout option can further improve speed of checkout for our customers and reduce the number of labor hours devoted to checking out our customers our goal is to begin the self checkout pilot in select stores later in 2019 as john mentioned while there will be a significant sg a price tag for fast track in 2019 and upfront one we believe that it can enhance customer convenience and also drive sg a expense over time we believe we are the innovative leader in our channel and we are excited about our long term strategic initiatives we remain committed to our four operating priorities and i want to take our last few minutes to update you on some of the recent efforts our first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth cooler door expansion continues to be the most impactful merchandising initiative we began our cooler expansion efforts in earnest in 2013 in addition to being a great traffic and ticket driver our success in expanding our cooler footprint has provided the scale necessary to initiate dg fresh in the first quarter we added more than 12 000 cooler doors across the chain we also increased the number of stores with our better for you offering in the first quarter bringing the total for the chain to approximately 3 400 stores our new good smart private brand continues to be popular with our customers and it remains an important part of our better for you offering we have many ongoing efforts in the health and beauty area in 2019 most recently we launched believe our private cosmetic brand with all items priced at 5 or less we have seen great initial customer response to this aspirational brand and we are excited for more of our customers to try these goods over time the final merchandising initiative i want to highlight today is the partnership with western union as we announced in the first quarter this is a great opportunity to leverage our real estate footprint to offer our customers the ability to send or receive cash in more than 15 000 convenient locations this agreement creates value for dollar general in two key ways first we receive a commission for each transaction and second by delivering a new service that our customers want we believe that it can become a traffic driver over time as you ll hear from us frequently the customer is at the center of everything we do and this new service is another great example of offering her solutions she wants beyond these sales driving initiatives we are continuing efforts to capture several gross margin opportunities in addition to the gross margin benefits of nci and dg fresh reducing shrink remains an important opportunity for us we rolled out nearly 900 more electronic article surveillance units in the first quarter bringing the total number of stores with eas to approximately 11 000 our goal remains to have eas in approximately 13 000 stores by the end of the year we also continue to pursue distribution and transportation efficiencies to support our profitable sales growth as john noted we are seeing some continued inflation in 2019 in transportation costs primarily from fuel rates which further emphasizes the importance of these efforts for example we continue to make progress in reducing stem miles and our longview distribution center has ramped up nicely since we began shipping in january and we intend to begin shipping from our distribution center in amsterdam new york later this year we re also further expanding our private fleet and intend to grow it by at least another 75 tractors by the end of fiscal 2019 this year s private fleet expansion will be largely focused on our dg fresh facilities and we believe it remains an important part of our overall transportation strategy finally foreign sourcing remains a long term gross margin opportunity and our goals include increasing penetration as well as diversifying countries from which we source the team is successfully finding products in key categories that can be sourced internationally and we believe there are many additional products and channels to explore our second priority is capturing growth opportunities our proven high return low risk model for real estate growth remains a core strength for our business our real estate model continues to focus on the five metrics that have served us well in evaluating thousands of new stores in recent years these metrics include new store productivity actual sales performance average returns cannibalization and the payback period even as we see changes on the competitive landscape our real estate projections continue to perform well against these metrics reinforcing our belief that new store growth is the best use of our capital our remodel and relocation program is in a great supplement to our new store growth strategy and overall we continue to see strong results from our portfolio of real estate projects we made tremendous progress toward achieving our real estate project goals in the first quarter during the quarter we opened 240 new stores remodeled 330 stores including 128 dgtp remodels and relocated 27 stores we also added produce to approximately 50 stores bringing the total of stores across the chain offering produce to approximately 480 as a reminder on average our traditional remodel stores which have an average of 22 cooler doors deliver a 4 to 5 comp lift and the dgtp remodel which has an average of 34 higher capacity coolers delivers a 10 to 15 comp lift with the addition of produce driving comps to the high end of this range we have a robust real estate pipeline in place and we are excited about the continued growth ahead of us in 2019 our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low cost operator the discipline with which the team approaches spending continues to be a great strength our clear and defined process to control expenses government spending decisions and has resulted in a strong cost control mindset we continue to focus efforts around the organization of reducing costs where possible through a zero base budgeting process while this operating philosophy is generally focused on cost reduction it has also proven to be a great springboard for many of the ideas in fact this process was the foundation for both fast track and western union and we believe it continues to serve us well as we reinforce our position as a low cost operator our fourth and final operating priority is to invest in our people as we believe they are a competitive advantage we believe the opportunity to develop a career with a growing retailer is unique in many of the communities we call home and we are proud of the thousands of associates who have taken advantage of this opportunity more than 11 000 of our current store managers are internal promotes and we continue to champion strong development and training programs for our associates to grow on the supply chain side our first class of employees has completed their private fleet driving training program this program pays for distribution center associates to obtain their commercial driver s licenses and furthers their careers to keep a close eye on we keep a close eye on key metrics related to our employees our people and we are pleased with what we are seeing we continue to have a robust applicant flow at every level additionally while it s still early in the year store manager turnover is trending better in 2019 than 2018 which was our best year on record we are continually engaging with our entire employee base and we believe this dialogue is vital to cultivating the strong dollar general culture remaining an employer of choice is an important priority for us and we believe that we are well positioned to continue to attract and retain talent in closing we are very pleased with our strong first quarter and excited about our position and outlook for the remainder of 2019 as we said we would we are driving growth on multiple fronts and i m delighted with the team s ability to deliver across so many complex projects simultaneously our real estate growth strategy is generating thousands of new store openings and remodels and we have a portfolio of robust initiatives in place that we believe will have a meaningful positive impact on our business for years to come in short we are using our mature and stable business as a foundation to drive innovation and growth we believe we operate in the most attractive sector of retail and we continue to differentiate the dollar general business from the rest of the retail landscape through our distinct combination of value and convenience in a unique real estate footprint our mission of serving others guides all we do at dollar general and the team remains focused on serving our customers every day while driving long term value for our shareholders i want to thank each of our more than 137 000 employees across the company for all of their hard work every day i m excited about what we can accomplish together in 2019 with that operator we would now like to open the lines for questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions our first question or comment comes from the line of matt boss from jpmorgan your line is open matt boss jpmorgan analyst congrats on a hey congrats on a great quarter guys todd vasos chief executive officer thank you john w garratt executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you matt boss jpmorgan analyst so todd maybe to start off you outlined a laundry list of top line initiatives under way i think you probably could have hosted an analyst day for how much is clearly going on i guess maybe could you help segment opportunities you think contributed to your first quarter comp what you are the most excited about maybe into the back half of the year versus initiatives you see accelerating into next year and beyond todd vasos chief executive officer sure our cooler program continues to be one of the key drivers matt to what we ve seen in our success so far in 2019 and also what we ve seen in the past what i m also excited about is what we re seeing in a lot of the initiatives that we continue to work on in our hba world as an example the teams are doing a great job there and the customer is really resonating to our great prices our values as well as our extensive private brand and national brand offering in those areas so they continue to do very well and our new cosmetic line believe i think will continue to build momentum as we move into the second quarter and back half of this year as you look at later parts of this year and into next we believe that many of our initiatives including nci will continue to build momentum and also our dg fresh initiative as i look at that over the long term later this year and into next it s already starting to deliver the gross margin that we see through better cost of goods but also it s showing us that we can be better in stock by controlling our own destiny there and so we believe that that ll start paying even more dividends as we move to the back half of the year we re very bullish on what we see in our top line right now and we will continue to push as much as we can to continue to see these great results as we move through the back half of the year matt boss jpmorgan analyst great maybe then just a follow up on the sg a front so excluding the incremental 50 million of initiative spend any underlying change to the 2 5 to 3 comp as the expense leverage point and todd i guess larger picture is it fair to think about this year s strategic initiatives build as a peak level as you kind of look forward todd vasos chief executive officer yeah i ll let john start and i ll add a little color john w garratt executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah in terms of sg a we are pleased with the q1 cost control we deleveraged 6 basis points but as we mentioned we are investing in initiatives for future growth there was somewhat of a shift from q1 to q2 but very pleased with the cost control in terms of the leverage point as we discussed before there is an impact as you are investing in things like dg fresh which we see as enhancing our operating margin over time that does put pressure on sg a as you re investing some labor in the stores and our initiatives like that but i would say we remain laser focused on cost control we don t see it differently and the main change here is that dynamic of investing in these strategic initiatives which we see is helping our operating margin and being as accretive as early as next year operator thank you in the interest of time we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow up please our next question or comment comes from the line of michael lasser from ubs your line is open michael lasser ubs analyst thanks for taking my question given the success you had in the first quarter why shouldn t we expect a comp at better than the 2 that s implied at the in your full year comp guidance of 2 5 over the next few quarters todd vasos chief executive officer yeah hi michael this is todd when i look at the rest of the year we do feel very good about where the comp is headed we got a lot of year ahead of us right and there is a could be a lot of noise out there we don t know what these this last list of tariffs may or may not do to our core consumer and really the consumer base in general so i think we re our guidance reflects appropriate where the where we are today and where those risks still may lie but we re doing everything we can to continue to drive that top line and of course drive traffic and our key here is traffic and traffic is king we know that and we continue to all of our efforts around our sales are really guided by that traffic growth michael lasser ubs analyst in on the subject of tariffs we know that 5 of your sales come from direct imports with china being one of those countries do you have an overall estimate of your cost of goods exposure to china if the list 4 does go through john w garratt executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so as you indicated it s about 6 of our purchases measured at cost are tied to direct imports predominantly china centric although we have been diversifying in recent years this is an impact facing all retail our exposure is relatively lower compared to many and the team has been working very diligently to mitigate this impact as evidenced by the updated guidance or the guidance that we maintained the team is working on continual negotiations with vendors product substitution product reengineering and continuing to change the origin of country where it s coming from we re doing everything we can to minimize the impact on the customers but as you know this is as others have said this is probably something that s going to impact the customers particularly if the list 4 comes out i d rather not speculate on what that impact will be hard to say how that things will shake out there but we believe that we are very well positioned to serve our customer as we re priced right we re conveniently located and we re there to help her in good times and bad todd vasos chief executive officer and michael i ll just add as well remember we are a limited source limited sku retailer meaning we don t have to carry everything and we can make decisions on what to carry and what not to carry depending on cost of goods and what may or may not increase and i think the team has done a real nice job in the first few lists and while list 4 is very extensive that work is ongoing right now as well so stay tuned we re hoping that there ll be some resolution here but make no mistake that this will if list 4 goes in it will cost the consumer on during and with her budgets the great thing is though i believe that dollar general stands ready to be able to serve that customer because she ll need us more at that time michael lasser ubs analyst sounds good thank you so much and good luck operator thank you our next question or comment comes from the line of karen short from barclays your line is open karen short barclays analyst hi thanks very much great quarter todd vasos chief executive officer thank you karen short barclays analyst just a quick just a question in terms of having such a strong 1q obviously you indicated there will be more sg a pressure in 2q but i guess any thoughts on keeping kind of the full year overall guidance given that some of these costs abate in the second half and gross margin compares also get quite a bit easier john w garratt executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i ll start by saying we feel great about the fundamentals of the business and the strong start to the year as i did note there was some investment spending shifted from q1 to q2 and importantly we absorbed the impact of the recently enacted tariff increases not previously assumed into the guidance and as todd mentioned there s still a lot of year left to tap the comp laps are a little tougher as the year goes on but we feel great about the business we feel comfortable about the guidance we ve provided and we re very pleased with the start of the year karen short barclays analyst okay and then just switching to comps for a second on the nci maybe can you give a little bit of color on the comp lift that you re seeing in the stores and also the margin impact and then you made a comment on the 26 improvement i guess in in stocks at the below standard stores any color you can give us on the comp benefit from having a better in stock todd vasos chief executive officer sure on the nci program we are very pleased with the early results there the team has done a really nice job in procuring goods we re now into our fourth and fifth replenishment cycle and some of the product that i ve seen recently with this newest wave is even better than the previous one so i could tell you that we feel very good with what we re seeing we re seeing an overall lift in the store both in our non consumable areas and our consumable areas so we re getting a very nice halo effect out of that and not only are we seeing those lifts in our top line sales but we re seeing gross margin benefits of course in our non consumable area but overall as well for the entire box so we re feeling very good about where we re going we ll do up to 2 400 stores this year and looking to see how we accelerate that as we move into 2020 and beyond but again we feel very good your second part of the question was on the in stock piece we ve been working very hard started at the end of last year and relooking at how we look at on shelf availability and very proud of what the team has done in and around making sure we have product on the shelf for our consumers now it did come with a little bit of cost of some inventory but as you alluded to and we talked about in our prepared remarks we re seeing in the 20 range increase of on shelf availability meaning in stocks for our customer and i could tell you that in those stores it s meaningful and it does add to the comp so we ll continue to work that that piece and as i also talked about as fast track continues to move forward and this would probably be more into the late 19 and into 2020 we are going to be getting some on shelf availability benefits from that as well as we continue to reduce those case packs and rationalize our sku base on the shelf to better keep our in stock levels on fast movers and stay tuned for more of that we believe that will pay some real benefits as we move into the end of the year and in the 20 karen short barclays analyst great that s helpful thanks operator thank you our next question or comment comes from the line of paul trussell from deutsche bank your line is open paul trussell deutsche bank analyst good morning and great quarter todd vasos chief executive officer thanks paul paul trussell deutsche bank analyst the gross margin performance in 1q was better than my forecast just curious how it stacked up to your expectations and previously you had mentioned that you expected the most pressure on a year over year basis in 1q just want to make sure that guidance still stands and just give some overall puts and takes on gpm john w garratt executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah we were pleased with the performance in q1 we d indicated that on our q4 call that q1 will be pressured but we did say that we expected to see sequential improvement on a year over year basis as we went from q4 to q1 but nonetheless we did see pressure from the change in the replenishment process as well as the ongoing pressure of distribution transportation cost and the ongoing mix pressures however as we said we would we were successful in normalizing the promotional markdown costs while at the same time delivering strong comps and traffic so we re very pleased with that the team did a great job managing through the various headwinds and as we said in our prepared statements we expect to see further sequential improvement over the balance of the year on a year over year comp basis and longer term we believe we have a lot of opportunities to increase not only gross margin but operating margin over time as todd indicated we are very excited about the progress we re making on dg fresh as we convert items and convert stores we re seeing the benefits of the cost savings we expected there very pleased with what we re seeing from nci in terms of not only the sales lift but also the improvement that adds to mix we re investing more in eas units we re going to be adding another 3 000 this year we ve seen great success from that and the benefit it has on shrink and there continues to be opportunities for us with category management increasing foreign sourcing penetration increasing private label penetration and we mentioned the non consumable opportunity and then lastly while we did see pressure from transportation costs in q1 and fuel remains a pressure we re very pleased by what we ve seen in terms of the proactive efforts of the team to mitigate these efforts and take advantage of an improving environment so we re optimistic that over the long term we can not only maintain but enhance overall operating margin over the long term that s the way we look at it paul trussell deutsche bank analyst thanks for that color and just as a follow up todd could you maybe just speak bigger picture to what your core consumer is saying about their financial health and overall sentiment on the economy and then maybe rank for us as you look in your stores comp gains occurring from your core customer coming more frequently versus shopping the store more broadly versus actually getting that trade down from higher income shoppers thank you todd vasos chief executive officer yeah sure paul yeah when you look at our gains our core consumer is continuing to tell us i feel pressure but again this core consumer always is under pressure financially her income levels are on the lower end as we all know and saying that she continues to tell us that she s back to work she continues to tell us that she has got a little bit more money in her pocket more so from productivity meaning more working more hours than actual wage growth but yet more money she has headwinds make no bones about it she still has headwinds of healthcare being one of the largest rents continues to be out there for her as a headwind but as we looked into last year when we started to hear from our consumer that she was feeling a little bit more stressed we continue to hear that but what we do very well here is we re able to move our promotional activity our mix inside the store our end cap presentations to match where we believe she will be and we did that in the first quarter and i believe very successfully and we ll continue to do that as our customer tells us where she believes she ll be in her journey as we move through 2019 the as you look at our consumers overall though i would tell you that our consumer that makes a little bit more money so that next level up consumer is our fastest growing consumer that we have here at dollar general so that trade in is alive and well but it s not coming at any cost of our core consumer and our core consumer continues to come more often as well as we re seeing that she s spending more when she s in the store so we re both getting the transaction growth side and that basket side so we feel very good about our customer segments and where they re headed and the great thing is we re attracting the higher end consumer i believe because of all of the work that we ve done in this box over the years paul trussell deutsche bank analyst thanks so much best of luck operator thank you our next question or comment comes from the line of rupesh parikh from oppenheimer your line is open rupesh parikh oppenheimer analyst good morning thanks for taking my question and also congrats on a nice quarter todd vasos chief executive officer thank you rupesh parikh oppenheimer analyst so i had two questions on your dg fresh effort so i guess first anything that has surprised you thus far i know it s only been a few months at this point and then as you think longer term or even in the intermediate term how do you think about what flows to the bottom line versus being reinvested in the business from some of the gross margin benefits that you expect to see todd vasos chief executive officer yeah right now i would tell you that the dg fresh initiative is really performing about where we thought it would perform again our teams are very good at executing very complex projects and this as you could imagine is one of the big ones but i would tell you opening a 1 000 stores a year and remodeling another 1 000 is no easy feat so we re very good at this type of work and i would tell you that dg fresh was no different and it s executing as we thought and are producing the results that we thought you heard from john we re seeing the cost of goods savings we re seeing better in stocks already at store level and we re only 800 stores in and so more to come as we move through the next cycles of this the great thing is the plan is rolling out as designed we ve already got all four of our dcs signed and ready to go and the next one we will be shipping here in the next few weeks so we feel good about that and then as you continue to look at dg fresh on that margin rate the great thing about dollar general is we never took our eye off of price whether that d be in our fresh area or our dry areas of the company and we re priced very very well across the board so i would tell you that we feel very good about that and we feel very good about those margin gains that should come from this over time should the majority of it should drop to the bottom line which is very exciting rupesh parikh oppenheimer analyst great and one quick follow up question weather clearly a challenge last year and it appeared also a challenge in q1 just curious if you guys think you had a negative impact on your business john w garratt executive vice president and chief financial officer what i would say is there are a lot of puts and takes between weather lapse weather this year and the pull forward of the snap benefit when you net all that together all that noise together it s about a push and really the 3 8 comp was a solid 3 8 comp not impacted by any real outside noise rupesh parikh oppenheimer analyst great thank you operator thank you our next question or comment comes from the line of anthony chukumba from loop capital markets your line is open anthony chukumba loop capital markets analyst good morning thanks for taking my question so related question on comps i mean in the first quarter obviously you had the pull forward because of the snap benefit of 70 basis points it sounds you got half of that back tax refunds looked like were a little bit lower than people expected and then weather was pretty bad so putting that all together what do you think allowed you to do close to a 4 comp with those three headwinds was it macro or was it more about the positive impact of the of a lot of initiatives that you talked about in this call thank you todd vasos chief executive officer yeah i would tell you that our core consumer again is has a little bit more money in their pocket but i would tell you when you look at the performance and as we see it broken down in the categories that we watch very closely here many of our gains occurred from the initiatives that either we worked through in 2018 that are continuing to still pay off and even some of those early 2019 ones so it gives us a lot of confidence that we re on the right track and as we move through the rest of this year anthony chukumba loop capital markets analyst that s helpful thanks a lot todd vasos chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question or comment comes from the line of scot ciccarelli from rbc capital markets your line is open scot ciccarelli rbc capital markets analyst good morning guys so i know a bunch of people have asked about kind of the comp momentum but todd specifically you talked about how last year which where we generally saw rising average ticket but softer traffic was due to the relative health of your core customer and trip consolidation so i guess what i m kind of trying to figure out is what specifically changed this quarter i mean you had mentioned cooler expansion earlier in the call but you ve been expanding cooler doors for years so i guess i m trying to figure out specifically in 1q maybe what changed on the traffic front thanks todd vasos chief executive officer yeah so i think the best way to look at this is two things number one i mentioned earlier this core consumer started to signal middle of last year that she was feeling a little bit more pressure not feeling as robust as she did so i would tell you that this core consumer her shopping patterns are and habits are changing a little bit we re seeing it and maybe moving more back to what we were used to seeing with maybe not quite as a fuller full basket and coming a little bit more often now one quarter doesn t make a year so we re going to continue to watch what she does but in q1 we saw some start of that normalization back to where this core customer normally is resonating at the other thing that i would tell you in q1 specifically is the actions we took in q4 promotionally to really solidify that customer in q4 did exactly exactly what we thought and brought forward that customer in a very sticky manner if you will the q1 and she spent accordingly so we feel good about that initiative in q4 it did exactly what we thought in q1 and i believe that was a big piece of why we only gave back half of that snap benefit that we pushed in the q4 last year from that top line scot ciccarelli rbc capital markets analyst interesting okay thanks guys operator thank you our next question or comment comes from the line our final question comes from the line of kelly bania from bmo capital markets your line is open kelly bania bmo capital markets analyst good morning thanks for fitting me in just wanted to ask another one about tariff sounds like you did a lot of work there to mitigate that and do some substitutions just was wondering if you can help us understand how much price you expect to pass along and maybe too early to tell from a competitive standpoint but how do you think you performed on that mitigation strategy relative to competitors and how much price do you think really we re going to see being passed through broadly todd vasos chief executive officer as again you take a look at dollar general and again we ve been all along many many years now we ensure that we have the right price for our consumer we watch price very very closely here but the other thing to keep in mind about dollar general i mentioned earlier is we don t have to carry everything we re a limited sku assorted retailer and we can make decisions based on a lot of different factors to include price meaning cost of goods and we ll continue to do that as we move through this these tariffs i think our teams have done a great job to date but i would tell you even through the first three lists if you will we ve seen in the marketplace the consumer is paying a little bit more money across the board in the marketplace and with list 4 looming out there which is probably the big well not probably it is the biggest impacted list i would have to assume the consumer is going to bear the brunt of some of this as well and so we re doing everything we can here at dollar general to make sure we soften that blow but again the great thing is this model works so well in good times and not so good times and if this consumer is having to pay more across the board at every retailer because of these tariffs we will stand ready to be able to with open arms to take her in when she needs us most and we re positioning ourselves for that as we move through 2019 kelly bania bmo capital markets analyst okay thanks and maybe just a follow up on the prior question about the stickiness and the promotional activity that you did last quarter how do you expect that or do you expect that stickiness to continue to impact your consumer and the traffic patterns for the rest of the year todd vasos chief executive officer what we see normally is that that stickiness does stay with us for a couple of quarters so we believe that we ll still see some benefit from that as we move into q2 may not be quite as much as q1 but again we feel very good about where we are and our start to the fiscal year so we feel that that customer resonates very well with price and value we know that and we continue to offer that so even though that we ve normalized the promotional activity you got to remember who dollar general is and that is everyday low price on the shelf as she can count on and she sees that when she s in the store each and every day so again we feel very good about our competitiveness on price and we feel good about our both traffic and ticket as we move into the second quarter and back half of this year kelly bania bmo capital markets analyst thank you operator thank you that concludes our q a session today i d like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks todd vasos chief executive officer thank you very much and we hope to

million compared to 901 0 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 1 42 billion in the first quarter of 2018 the sequential decrease was primarily due to the previously disclosed acceleration of certain high profit project sales into 2018 from 2019 an enterprise resource planning erp system upgrade which resulted in 5 days of work stoppage at several manufacturing facilities and the anticipated lower production and sales volumes due to the impact of the chinese new year holiday the year over year decrease was primarily due to the higher revenue contribution from project sales and higher solar module asp in the prior period first quarter 2019 guidance was 450 million to 480 million total solar module shipments in the first quarter of 2019 were 1 575 mw compared to 1 951 mw in

manufacturing cost compared to our previous forecast canadian solar s mss business comprises primarily the design development manufacture and sale of solar modules other solar power products and solar system kits the mss business also provides engineering procurement and construction epc and operating and maintenance o m services canadian solar s energy business comprises primarily the development and sale of solar projects operating solar power projects and the sale of electricity the module sales from the company s mss business to its energy business are on terms and conditions similar to sales to third parties the company develops solar power projects worldwide where applicable the company may apply for and or be entitled to receive a feed in tariff fit for its projects alternatively the company may participate in public or private energy auctions and bidding which result in long term power purchase agreements ppas the company may also sell all or part of the electricity generated from its solar power projects on the merchant power market because of the longer lead time two to four years to develop solar power projects and bring them to a commercial operation date cod the actual gross margin of a project may deviate from the expected gross margin the deviation may be caused by but not limited to changes in the political and economic conditions in host countries project specific conditions price movements of solar modules and other components epc services and the capital return requirements of solar asset buyers in recent years the company has sold some solar power projects before cod we typically refer to these sales as notice to proceed or ntp sales revenue is lower while gross margin percentage is higher in ntp sales compared to cod sales even if the absolute margin is the same results from the company s energy business may be lumpy from quarter to quarter depending on project ntp and cod dates project sale transaction dates and the profit level of each

a healthy pause in the first quarter of 2019 due to the acceleration of some high profit project sales from 2019 into 2018 the appreciation of the rmb lost manufacturing days related to our erp system upgrade and the impact of chinese new year on production and sales volumes despite these challenges we remained focused and delivered q1 2019 solar module shipments revenue and gross margin at or above our expectations we are encouraged by the healthy demand levels we are seeing in our key markets stability in module asps and anticipated higher utilization of our capacity our late stage utility scale solar power project pipeline including those under construction increased to approximately 3 4 gwp as of april 30 2019 the sale of the majority of these projects remains on track for

8 million compared to 134 7 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 our continued organizational focus on profitable module sales helped us deliver a 21 6 gross margin in a challenging quarter which was above our expectations our overall profitability for the first quarter 2019 was impacted by a foreign exchange loss due to the appreciation of the rmb against the u s dollar lost manufacturing days and a lower production volume due to our erp system upgrade and the chinese new year holiday as well as anticipated lower sales of solar power projects compared to the previous quarter we expect our profitability will improve as we move through 2019 we signed an agreement in april to sell 80 interest in our 482 6 mwp late stage project portfolio in brazil and expect to close this transaction and

2018 and 1 42 billion in the first quarter of 2018 the sequential decrease was primarily due to the previously disclosed acceleration of certain high profit project sales into 2018 from 2019 an enterprise resource planning erp system upgrade which resulted in 5 days of work stoppage at several manufacturing facilities and the anticipated lower production and sales volumes due to the impact of the chinese new year holiday the year over year decrease was primarily due to the higher revenue contribution from project sales and higher solar module asp in the prior period first quarter 2019

guidance was 16 0 to 18 0 gross margin in the first quarter of 2019 was better than expected primarily due to a lower blended module manufacturing cost compared to our previous forecast canadian solar s mss business comprises primarily the design development manufacture and sale of solar modules other solar power products and solar system kits the mss business also provides engineering procurement and construction epc and operating and maintenance o m services canadian solar s energy business comprises primarily the development and sale of solar projects operating solar power projects and the sale of electricity the module sales from the company s mss business to its energy business are on terms and conditions similar to sales to third parties the company develops solar power projects worldwide where applicable the company may apply for and or be entitled to receive a feed in tariff fit for its projects alternatively the company may participate in public or private energy auctions and bidding which result in long term power purchase agreements ppas the company may also sell all or part of the electricity generated from its solar power projects on the merchant power market because of the longer lead time two to four years to develop solar power projects and bring them to a commercial operation date cod the actual gross margin of a project may deviate from the expected gross margin the deviation may be caused by but not limited to changes in the political and economic conditions in host countries project specific conditions price movements of solar modules and other components epc services and the capital return requirements of solar asset buyers in recent years the company has sold some solar power projects before cod we typically refer to these sales as notice to proceed or ntp sales revenue is lower while gross margin percentage is higher in ntp sales compared to cod sales even if the absolute margin is the same results from the company s energy business

chief executive officer of canadian solar commented after achieving close to 140 growth of net profit in 2018 from the 2017 level we reasonably expected a healthy pause in the first quarter of 2019 due to the acceleration of some high profit project sales from 2019 into 2018 the appreciation of the rmb lost manufacturing days related to our erp system upgrade and the impact of chinese new year on production and sales volumes despite these challenges we remained focused and delivered q1 2019 solar module shipments revenue and gross margin at or above our expectations we are encouraged by the healthy demand levels we are seeing in our key markets stability in module asps and anticipated higher utilization of our capacity our late stage utility scale solar power project pipeline including those under construction increased to approximately 3 4 gwp as of april 30 2019 the sale of the majority of these projects remains on track for 2020 or later our portfolio of solar power plants in

fourth quarter of 2018 our continued organizational focus on profitable module sales helped us deliver a 21 6 gross margin in a challenging quarter which was above our expectations our overall profitability for the first quarter 2019 was impacted by a foreign exchange loss due to the appreciation of the rmb against the u s dollar lost manufacturing days and a lower production volume due to our erp system upgrade and the chinese new year holiday as well as anticipated lower sales of solar power projects compared to the previous quarter we expect our profitability will improve as we move through 2019 we signed an agreement in april to sell 80 interest in our 482 6 mwp late stage project portfolio in brazil and expect to close this transaction and recognize the revenue after the second quarter of 2019 in addition in may we completed the sale of the 134 mwp mustang project in the u s and the 68 mwp aguascalientes project in mexico utility scale solar project pipeline the company divides its utility scale solar project pipeline into two categories an early to mid stage pipeline and a late stage pipeline the late stage pipeline includes primarily those projects that have feed in tariffs fits or power purchase agreements ppas and are expected to be built within the next four years the company cautions that some late stage projects may not reach completion due to such

everyone and thank you for joining us to review our first quarter results outlook and three year targets we are pleased to have started the year strong our first quarter results were ahead of our guidance for both revenue and eps and we are well positioned for year of double digit revenue and eps growth on a non gaap basis we believe our strong results reflect the execution of our strategy which we began two years ago to accelerate innovation in the areas of automation and cloud we believe this strategy will enable us to sustain growth over the long run and today we are pleased to introduce three year targets first i would like to review our very strong q1 results year over year revenue increased 9 on a gaap basis 11 on a non gaap basis and 13 on a non gaap constant currency basis year over year operating margins increased 190 basis points on a gaap basis and 340 basis points on a non gaap basis reflecting the significant operating leverage in our financial model eps came in at 0 02 on a gaap basis and 0 73 on a non gaap basis a 38 increase year over year and cash from operations came in at 93 million a 55 increase year over year reflecting the underlying strength in our business overall our results were strong across particularly every key metric i m very pleased with our q1 performance which makes the year more linear and gives us confidence to raise our annual guidance again now i d like to provide some q1 highlights by business segments starting with customer engagement in customer engagement q1 non gaap revenue increased 14 on a reported basis and 16 on a constant currency basis we are pleased with our results and are guiding to 11 non gaap revenue growth for the full year last week we had the opportunity to showcase our latest customer engagement innovations at our annual user event in orlando florida attendance was up 20 year over year and we were pleased to have some of the world s greatest brands presenting at our conference including uber verizon aarp and mastercard we received very positive feedback on our latest solution including our voice of the customer platform which we announced during the events and which i will discuss in more detail later overall the energy generated by our customers partners and employees was incredibly high during the quarter we continued to win new customers displaced competitor and expand with existing customers including in order for more than 10 million from a leading telecommunications company as this customer is standardizing on verint s customer engagement platform and we are displacing multiple point solutions from other vendors this eight figure deal will be deployed on premise due to the customers preference for an on premise solution advertisement advertisement in the area of cloud we re seeing growing adoption and during the quarter we received many large cloud orders including a 9 million order from a technology company a 3 million order from a bank and a 2 million order from a healthcare company with various components of our portfolio deployed in the cloud we are cutting across customers for many industries the common threat is a desire to work with the vendor that can help them migrate to the cloud seamlessly turning to cyber intelligence q1 revenue increased 5 year over year on a reported basis and 7 year over year on a constant currency basis this compares to a very strong first quarter last year in which revenue increased 13 year over year regarding margins we are pleased with our year over year improvements as we continue to make progress with the software model transition during q1 we received many large orders including orders for approximately 25 million 15 million 10 million and 5 million reflecting the strength of our portfolio demand for our solutions remains strong and we re guiding to 10 non gaap cyber intelligence revenue growth for the year earlier in the quarter we had the opportunity to showcase our latest cyber intelligence innovation at our annual security user event in italy attendance at this year event was up 20 year over year and we were pleased to have customers attending from 70 countries the theme of the event was the art of intelligence and included hands on demos actual case studies and opportunity for customers to learn from peers experiences customers commented on our strong pace of innovation and the many innovative capabilities we demonstrated at events turning to guidance today we are raising fiscal 20 non gaap guidance for revenue by 5 million and for eps by 0 05 this is the third time we have raised guidance providing our initial annual guidance in early december we first raised revenue guidance by 20 million on december 17 the second we raised guidance by 25 million on march 27th and the third time is today by 5 million in total we have raised our top line guidance by 50 million to date of which 30 million is from the foresee acquisition advertisement advertisement with regard to eps our strategy is to expand margins while accelerating the top line and we are pleased with our margin expansion in q1 our new non gaap eps guidance of 3 65 reflects continued margin expansion and 14 year over year growth i would now like to discuss our three year targets last year we discussed our goal for long term double digit growth today we are providing three year targets for verint overall as well as some more details on our two segments overall we are targeting the following for fiscal 22 on a non gaap basis for revenue we are targeting 1 65 billion reflecting 10 cagr for eps we re targeting 4 70 reflecting 14 cagr now let s take a closer look at our customer engagement three year targets last week during our analyst event to help investors understand our cloud transition we introduced three year targets for revenue cloud revenue recurring revenue and adjusted ebitda margins for non gaap customer engagement revenue we re targeting 10 cagr which would take our customer engagement revenue to 1 08 billion in three years our revenue target a few points of contribution from maintenance conversion uplift that doug will discuss later but let s not assume any future acquisitions assuming increasing market demand for cloud we expect our recurring revenue to be about 70 of our customer engagement revenue by fiscal 22 with respect to margins while we have already achieved best in class margins we expect our adjusted ebitda margins to continue to expand to around 30 driven by cloud growth and greater scale overall we believe we can continue to execute our cloud transition creating benefits for both our customers and verint advertisement advertisement and we have discussed in prior calls we believe that behind the leadership and strong momentum is our strategic decision to accelerate our investments in automation and cloud more than ever before our customers are focused on elevating the customer experience and at the same time reducing operating costs automation is critical to achieving our customers objective and consequently a core strategic initiative for verint based on input from our customers and our intimate knowledge of the industry we have created a portfolio that infuses automation throughout the customer engagement process with respect to cloud we believe we are at the inflection point and more and more customers are moving from just talking about cloud to embracing it the trends manifest itself in two ways new cloud deployments and immigration from on premise deployment to the verint cloud we ve been preparing for cloud adoption to accelerate and we are differentiated across three layers first our cloud applications offer customers very rich functionality with feature parity between on premise and cloud which customers really like because it makes their transition to the cloud seamless this is something that most of our competitors do not offer second we are flexible go to market approach the large customer to operate some verint solutions on premise and some in the verint cloud and to migrate to the cloud at their own pace and third we invested in very strong cloud operations that are global scalable secured and efficient in fact our recent saas deployments target a best in class 80 gross margin as we have discussed over the last two years we ve been investing to accelerate innovation our financial targets with this strategy were to drive sustainable growth for mid single digit two years ago to double digit growth over the next three years while at the same time expanding margins and more than doubling our cloud revenue advertisement advertisement we have invested in organic r d and also carefully analyze buy versus build decisions resulting in several tuck in technology acquisitions intended to accelerate innovation our customer engagement r d operation is very efficient running at the level of 13 of revenue this level is best in class compared to our peers with a very healthy ratio of 5 3 gross margin dollars for every r d dollar invested our estimated non gaap customer engagement operating margins of approximately 26 last year are also best in class due to strong competitive differentiation across our portfolio our post acquisitions has been focused on adding technology to expand our portfolio strategically and shorten time to market over the last two years our acquisitions have largely consisted of small companies without profits and strategy has been to integrate technology quickly and to drive incremental revenue and earnings from our overall portfolio and now i would like to provide an example of buy versus build process using our recent foresee acquisition most of the customer has been an integral part of our customer engagement portfolio and with the market moving away from point solutions to voc platform we decided to accelerate our investment both organically and inorganically to accelerate our time to market we evaluated more than five different voc assets before selecting foresee for it s superior digital customer experience technology employee talents and domain expertise as part of our diligence we ve evaluated not only foresee s technology and people but also its operational strength and weaknesses customer base and financials we learned that foresee revenues were rapidly declining since their parent company bankruptcy and they had significant losses including a 12 million loss in 2017 and a 15 million loss in 2018 we also learned that their customer renewal rates was declining and was at low 60s in q4 last year suggesting that the revenue decline might accelerate into the current year while foresee s historical financial profile presented obvious challenges we decided to acquire foresee for 65 million based on their superior technology people domain expertise and the following integration plan first our plan was focused on strategic target of integrating the foresee technology with the verint s voc platform we quickly began the technology integration including merging their r d and product management organizations advertisement advertisement second we increased the level of engagement with forsee s customers to reduce attrition and retain them based on our clear roadmap to our broader voc platform consistent with the market shift to platforms and third given their significant historical losses we sacrificed revenue for profitability this year and completed swift operational integration coupled with rightsizing the organization while renewal rates continue to decline to the low 50s in q1 we believe we are taking the right steps toward achieving the strategic and financial objective that we targeted currently we estimate that forsee s revenues for the year will be between 30 million to 40 million based on the progress we ve been making so far with the integration as discussed before we raised guidance 3 times since the acquisition of foresee and our current guidance assumes the low end of the estimated range of 30 million of foresee revenue in our 900 million customer engagement revenue guidance we generally measure the success of a tuck in acquisition across two metrics strategic and financial in the case of foresee on the strategic side we measure success based on sustainable growth of our customer engagement portfolio and accelerating time to market on the financial side we achieved profitability on day one and now expect to achieve a revenue level this year that translates to a purchase price of 2x revenue or less i m pleased to report that last week during our annual customer conference we launched a new version of our voc platform including the foresee technology and other innovations we had more than 100 foresee customers at the event and we received very positive feedback from both verint customers and foresee legacy customers in summary foresee is a good example of our thoughtful approach to buy versus build decision making and now we leverage both internal r d and technology acquisitions to accelerate our innovation advertisement advertisement before turning to cyber intelligence let me summarize customer engagement as follows we believe the investments we ve made over the last two years combined with market readiness will accelerate our transition to the cloud and we expect the conversion of our maintenance stream to contribute a few points toward our 10 cagr revenue target while we will continue to evaluate tuck in acquisitions using our buy versus build decision making process our target do not assume any future acquisitions and finally we expect our customer engagement margins to continue to expand driven by our growing scale and our shift to the cloud turning to cyber intelligence as we have discussed in prior calls we expect non gaap revenue to grow at 10 cagr over the next three years which will take us to 575 million of revenue in fiscal 22 at this scale and with the transition to sort them all we expect our adjusted ebitda margin to exceed 20 an improvement of over 450 bps over the next three years on a non gaap basis in addition to margin improvement there are significant benefits to customers and to verint for moving to a software model that i will discuss shortly behind our double digit revenue growth is demand for data mining software as an effective tool to address security threats that are becoming more pervasive and complex data volumes are growing quickly requiring legacy data mining tools to get refreshed at a rapid pace as a result security organizations are seeking innovative data mining software to better the tax investigate and neutralize threats as part of our innovation we focused on automation to help customers shorten the investigative process and reduce dependancy on large numbers of intelligence analysts and data scientists with respect to moving to a software model we believe there are significant benefits to our customers from productivation of our solution making our software easier to implement and easier to refresh which is critical in a rapidly evolving technology landscape more and more customers have realized that the integrator model is limited in terms of system openness and their ability to quickly deploy software enhancements the investments we ve made in the software model creates even more competitive differentiation now i would like to discuss r d and cyber intelligence our r d investment has been around 20 of revenue in recent periods in line with security peers and that s been focused on automation unbundling the software and minimizing hardware customization and integration services by verint with respect to buy versus build in cyber intelligence technology acquisitions have not been required for our transition to a software model and that transition has been driven primarily by organic r d investments we are very happy with the margin expansion we ve achieved to date including in q1 overall over the last two years we achieved 300 basis points of ebitda margin improvement and over the next three years we are targeting an additional 450 basis points of expansion on a non gaap basis in summary we believe the combination of our leadership position and market demand for advanced data mining software will enable us to continue to grow our cyber intelligence revenue at the 10 cagr over the next three years at the same time we re making progress with transitioning the business to a software model which will drive strategic and financial benefits to verint before handing the call over to doug i would like to highlight four elements of our growth strategy first as we discussed today our goal is to grow revenue at 10 cagr over the next three years with margin expansion driving eps cagr of 14 secondm we plan to pursue acquisitions opportunistically to drive additional shareholder value and put variance in an even stronger competitive position our long term targets do not assume any future acquisitions third we expect strong cash generation and our primary cash usage will be for m a however if we cannot find desirable deals we will consider using any excess cash to repurchase shares and finally our board is committed to continued refreshments ensuring we have the skills to drive shareholder value over the last three years we added three new directors and we plan to bring on another independent directors during the current fiscal year i would also like to say that given the success of our growth strategy our strong performance and the value we re creating for our shareholders we believe the proxy contest is entirely unwarranted as the strategy is unfolded we provide a new disclosure to help investors better understand the changes in our business and as our track record clearly shows we have an ongoing practice of board refreshment i would like to thank our shareholders for the support we are receiving from them and we encourage shareholders to vote for all verint nominees on the white proxy card that is all we will have to say on the proxy side on today s call including during the q a portion of the call we want to focus on our very strong performance now let me turn the call over to doug douglas robinson chief financial officer yes thanks dan and good afternoon everyone our discussion today will include non gaap financial measures a reconciliation between our gaap and non gaap financial measures is available as alan mentioned in our earnings release and in the ir section of our website differences between our gaap and non gaap financial measures include adjustments related to acquisitions including fair value revenue adjustments ammortization of acquisition related intangibles certain other acquisition related expenses stock based compensation as well as certain other items that can vary significantly in amount in frequency for certain metrics it also includes adjustments related to foreign exchange rates i d like to start by looking at our q1 performance our first quarter results were strong across practically every key metric q1 non gaap revenue came in at 324 million and 11 year over year increase as reported in a 13 on a constant currency basis our q1 non gaap gross margins were approximately 67 up 350 bps from q1 last year with both segments showing year over year improvement we were particularly pleased with the improvement in our cyber intelligence segments gross margins which i ll discuss in a minute our non gaap operating income came in at 62 3 million up a very strong 35 year over year our growth in operating income to non gaap operating margins to 19 2 a 340 bps increase from q1 of last year our adjusted ebitda for the quarter came in at 70 1 million a 29 1 year over year increase these strong results drove diluted non gaap eps of 0 73 for the quarter up 38 from the 0 53 eps in q1 of last year we are also very pleased to have increased our gaap cash from operations year over year by 55 to 93 million in q1 i would also like to mention that q1 is the first quarter that we have had a year over year comparison on the same basis under asc 606 the new accounting standard company s adopted last year as you can see our year over year performance in q1 was very strong and as reported in the same 606 basis as q1 in the prior year i mentioned this because last year we were required to reported results under both 605 and 606 which created some confusion on the trends in our business as we had discussed throughout last year we prepared for asc 606 during fiscal 18 and therefore at the beginning of last year fiscal 19 we changed certain business practices and built our budget to align with 606 accounting as a result the disclosure in our 10 k and 10 q showing our fiscal 19 results under 605 was not a meaningful comparison because the results under 605 no longer accurately reflected our business performance once we implemented the business practice changes i mentioned we believe our results last year under 606 reflect our true performance which is also demonstrated by our strong 22 increase in cash from operations last year as well as our strong earnings and operating cash flow performance in q1 of this year on the same 606 basis our guidance for fiscal 20 which we ve now raised several times also reflects the same steady state 606 compare in other words as we said previously we believe our results last year would have been similar to what we reported absent the 606 transition now i d like to review our q1 results by segment turning to customer engagement non gaap revenue increased 14 from last year as reported and 16 on a constant currency basis today we are reporting additional revenue metrics for our customer engagement segments including recurring revenue non recurring revenue before reviewing these metrics for q1 i d like to start with some definitions recurring revenue includes cloud and maintenance and non recurring revenue includes on premise solutions and professional services we are also breaking down cloud into saas an optional managed services in q1 non gaap recurring revenue increased 23 and non gaap non recurring revenue increased 6 5 year over year non gaap cloud revenue came in at 56 million an increase over 58 year over year in q1 our saas and managed services mix was about 75 25 on a fully allocated basis our customer engagement non gaap gross margins were 68 4 and our non gaap operating margins were 23 3 overall we are pleased with our strong customer engagement revenue growth and continued margin expansion in q1 turning to cyber intelligence q1 revenue increased 5 year over year on a reported basis and 7 year over year on a constant currency basis this compares to a very strong first quarter in the prior year and which revenue increased 13 year over year on a fully allocated basis cyber intelligence non gaap gross margins increased 710 bps year over year to 65 while our margins continue to benefit from our transition to a software model in q1 wee also had a very favorable mix the improvement in gross margins took our non gaap fully allocated operating margins to a 11 1 in q1 in summary we are targeting another year of 10 non gaap annual revenue growth with expanding margins i d now like to take you through our updated fiscal 2020 guidance as dan mentioned earlier today we are raising our non gaap guidance for the third time since early december call we now expect total revenue of 1 375 billion with a range of plus or minus 2 reflecting just over 10 growth for the year by segment we expect 10 growth in cyber intelligence and 11 growth in customer engagement as dan mentioned our guidance assumes about 30 million of revenue from foresee overall our 10 outlook for customer engagement reflects mid to high single digit revenue growth excluding our recent acquisitions from an operating margin perspective we expect operating margins in fiscal 20 of approximately 22 we expect our non gaap quarterly interest and other expense excluding the potential impact of foreign exchange to be approximately 5 75 million given the volatility in foreign exchange rates that could be future gains or losses related to balance sheet translations in our future results which are not included in our guidance we expect our non gaap tax rate to be approximately 10 5 for the year reflecting the amount of cash taxes we expect to pay this year based on these assumptions and assuming approximately 67 5 million average diluted shares outstanding for the year we are expecting non gaap diluted eps at the midpoint of our revenue guidance to be approximately 3 65 a 0 05 increase from our prior guidance and 0 15 increase from the initial guidance in december our new eps guidance reflects another year of 14 eps growth in addition to our annual guidance we d like you to provide some color on the progression of the year for modeling purposes for non gaap revenue in q2 we expect revenue to increase approximately 10 million sequentially with an eps of around 0 80 we expect another sequential increase in q3 followed by our usual seasonally strong q4 i would like to discuss now our three year targets in more detail as dan mentioned earlier today we are introducing three year non gaap targets for total revenue of 1 65 billion and earnings per share of 4 70 driving these targets is verint s core competency and actionable intelligence these targets assume no adverse change in the economy although we believe we can perform relatively well in an economic downturn based on historical experience i ll spend the next few minutes taking a closer look at our three year targets for each segment starting with the customer engagement given the faster adoption of cloud that we have been seeing and the shift away from on premise solutions we expect non gaap non recurring revenue to relatively flat over the next three years with non gaap recurring revenue increasing at a 15 cagr to 750 million this should drive recurring revenue to around 70 of our total customer engagement revenue compared to 59 last year within cloud we expect saas to grow faster than optional managed services and to represent 85 of our cloud revenue in three years within saas revenue we have bundled saas and unbundled saas our saas revenue is substantially generated from bundled saas which provides access to our software with standard managed services which is what our customers prefer however occasionally some customers and partners want license rights to our software separate for unbundled from managed services which for accounting purposes are considered term licenses the unbundled saas can be deployed in the cloud either by verint or cloud partner and renew like saas so is included in our recurring revenue i would like to give you a few examples of the unbundled saas one example is when a cloud partner that hosts our software in their cloud without purchasing any of our standard managed services another example is a customer that refers to purchase both components from verint software and managed services but separately due to the customers desire to have software deployment flexibility since unbundled saas is a small portion of our total cloud revenue and the mix of bundled and unbundled saas is expected to be similar in fiscal 19 and in fiscal 20 the impact is not material now let s discuss how the transition to more recurring revenue will positively affect our margins despite already having a very healthy 26 fully allocated non gaap operating margins and 28 3 adjusted ebitda margins in our customer engagement business looking forward we see two factors we believe will have a positive impact on our margins first our margins will benefit as recurring revenue becomes a larger percentage of our revenue this is because gross margins in our recurring revenue are in the mid to high 70s while gross margins that are non recurring revenue are in the mid 50s as our recurring revenue grows at a 15 cagr and becomes a greater part of our revenue our gross margin should improve due to the more favorable mix second we expect to maintain our r d expense at around 13 of customer engagement revenue at the same time we expect some operating leverage from sg a as we continue to scale the business the combination of gross margin expansion and operating leverage is expected to drive our customer engagement non gaap operating income margins to approximately 27 5 with adjusted ebitda margins of around 30 in three years before concluding i d like to spend a few minutes discussing dynamics between maintenance and cloud revenue as we discussed on prior calls we currently generate more than 300 million of maintenance revenue that we expect will move to the cloud gradually over time the conversion of maintenance to cloud could result in a significant revenue uplift for verint as the dollar of maintenance revenue can convert to cloud revenue at a 2 times rate or higher today we have a cloud first strategy which we believe will facilitate this transition because of this conversion we expect maintenance revenue to be flat to modestly declining over the next three years this trend reflects growth in maintenance from new on premise deployments offset by some maintenance revenue converting to cloud revenue as we make this transition we expect our non gaap estimated gross margins on recurring revenue to remain in the mid to high 70s due to the mix shift discussed earlier between saas maintenance and managed services revenue overall the transition from on premise to cloud is expected to contribute to our revenue growth by a few points and to help our margin expansion over the next three years if the transition occurs at a rate faster than we re expecting our cloud rate could accelerate before concluding since we provided three year targets today we thought it d be helpful to also discuss our long term capital allocation plans verint ended last year with 468 million of cash and we expect to generate around 800 million of cash over the next three years after deducting capex we expect to have more than 1 1 billion of cash available for working capital and technology acquisitions or potentially a larger transaction however if we cannot find desirable deals we would consider using excess cash to repurchase stock regarding our debt we have 400 million of convertible debt due in june 21 and 425 million of term loans due in june 2024 we do not plan to settle the convertible debt in shares and plan to refinance as we get closer to maturity likely with another convertible note or additional term loan while we spend time today discussing our long term targets i d like to end the call where we started with our strong q1 results we are very pleased to start the year strong and look forward to another successful year this concludes my prepared remarks so with that operator can we please open up the lines for questions questions and answers operator certainly operator instructions our first question comes from shaul eyal with oppenheimer your line is now open shaul eyal oppenheimer analyst thank you good afternoon congrats on the quarter and improved outlook as well as the increase in inaudible dan i want to ask by asking with respect to your organic growth this year can you help us reconcile with organic growth with your 10 organic target for the next two years in either words what s driving this organic growth right now dan bodner president chief executive officer and chairman okay sure that s a good question so let me start with this year and i ll break it down and then we ll go into the next three years so we gave guidance this year for 1 375 billion for both cyber intelligence customer engagement so let s start with the cyber intelligence our guidance for this year is 475 million that represents 10 growth and now we look at the organic inorganic we did one deal last year in november we bought a company called nowforce we paid 4 million for this company at closing and this company did 2 million of revenue last year so pretty much our guidance for this year is organic and also our guidance for the next cagr of 10 is organic now let s move to customer engagement where we did more acquisitions our guidance for this year for customer engagements is 900 million and that s represent 11 growth over the last 12 months we acquired three companies we acquired foresee with 65 million in december plus we acquired two other small companies one focused on wfm technology that we acquired mid last year for 27 million and one focused on the smb technology that we acquired in february this year for 20 million so as i said before and doug explained in our guidance foresee represents 30 million of inorganic revenue out of the 900 million guidance and if you take all these three companies foresee and the other two combined they represent a little over 40 million of inorganic revenue in our 900 million guidance but they also contributed a little bit more than 10 million last year so you can do the math and our 11 guidance this year is actually consistent with our target for mid to high single digit organic growth for this year and this 11 say growth is about two thirds organic and one third inorganic for this year now taking this and moving into the next two years fiscal 21 and 22 we are targeting 10 organic growth but that s inclusive also of the maintenance conversion and we discussed that maintenance convert to cloud we re going to have some uplift so that s going to start to contribute also a few points to our revenue growth in those years so now you can see the bridge if we re achieving mid to high single digit organic growth and this year and also we don t need to expand our portfolio and achieve the same level in the next few years plus this few points of maintenance conversion this is how we got to set the target to 10 cagr over the next three years and of course if the maintenance conversion will accelerate this could be an upside shaul eyal oppenheimer analyst got it thank you for that elaborated answer and maybe moving giving you brought up foresee so it would appear now it is part of a broader force of a customer strategy what s the long term thinking from that perspective down the road on voiced over the customer business dan bodner president chief executive officer and chairman yes so basically voice of the customer is an integral part of our portfolio and we talked about what customers really want to achieve our customers they want to elevate the customer experience and reduce operational costs and voice of the customer is a critical part of that and we ve been investing in voice of the customer now for few years organically and inorganically and foresee complements what we ve built as the voc platform that is omni channel that has very strong analytics and also that uses a lot of automation to bring the insight into action so foresee specifically is providing digital customer experience capabilities and we were impressed with the technology foresee s been in the business for many years we found great people with great talent in the company and we also find a lot of domain expertise about digital customer experience we launched last week and shaul you were in our user conference so hopefully you re able to see the responses to the demonstration we got very strong response from verint customers and foresee customers yes there was the main launch of main stage was our new version of voc platform and what we do now is we combine customer the customer voice not only surveys which include email service text surveys and voice surverys and so on but also indirect feedback that we collect through a lot of voice calls and chats and emails and social media that basically bring back feedback to the organization on the customer experience and the first step into customer experience is actually measuring it in terms of net promoter score and any other metric that can measure what the customer response is but also brings that action quickly in real time into operations so that organization can actually take action and make improvements and as you know verint has been very strong on the operational side and we now have voice of the customer that cut the cost marketing and operations and help people on both sides from marketing and from operation to measure the customer experience and to improve it and do make sure that the action the corrective action of taking actually creating a better net promoter score and elevating the customer experience for on a sustainable basis so our we see voc as an integral part of our customer engagement portfolio we expect our portfolio to grow 10 and we still expect the voc platform to contribute at 10 or better into this growth shaul eyal oppenheimer analyst thank you alan roden senior vice president corporate development and investor relations sure operator thank you and our next question comes from daniel ives with wedbush your line is now open daniel ives wedbush securities analyst yes thank you dan maybe you could talk about the commerce the conversations you have with customers at the company maybe this year and how that compared with previous years is it are deals becoming more strategic where verint sits maybe you can just start there from a high level dan bodner president chief executive officer and chairman yes i think we had a much bigger conference we had more attendance our customers talking to customers for most of the presentations actually by customers discussing their experiences and helping other customers leverage their experience to create roi in their organizations i would say that overall the energy level was up customers are much more interested in the cloud we ve always we ve always had people talking about moving to the cloud but things like what we ve done with feature priority where our solutions have feature priority between on premise and cloud really helped customers to make decision to transition because they don t have to retrain users we don t have to change processes they really is a very seamless transition from on prem to cloud so that s that was very well received so i think we certainly are encouraged by cloud is accelerating automation was absolutely the number one discussion on the floor we ve we showcased automation across our entire portfolio we talked about how we automate not just one part of this but you know the customer engagement process consist of a hierarchy of many different processes that are intertwined and working together and we showed how automation can really help create very quick roi and that was very well received and i think we are helping customers to prioritize their automation projects and being able to actually invest now and not just wait to the future to just wait until automation really going to bring value because i think they got much more much more convinced that there is value now and they also heard that from other customers from peers that have implemented during automation and start to see very very strong roi so there are very very strong conference daniel ives wedbush securities analyst okay maybe look obviously m a is a hot topic maybe you can just talk about going forward in the next 12 months does it feel verint will be more aggressive less aggressive fees from an m a should we expect if there are yields focused on cloud as sort of a segment maybe just sit on that thanks dan bodner president chief executive officer and chairman yeah so when we look at m a first we know we operate in very fragmented market both in customer engagement and cyber intelligence so we are basically we have two programs within the m a program we have technology tuck ins this is actually a program that is run by our head of products and the part people are constantly looking at this build versus buy decisions and again we wanted to stress that we are targeting 10 exclusive of any tuck ins but obviously if we can accelerate technology even faster we will and we get our both strategic and financial objectiveness we will continue with the tuck ins and then we have another program that generally look at m a in our market and whether we can create a strong irr by either consolidating or growing the business making ourselves more competitive taking out synergies and so forth in terms of capital allocation as we said we plan to generate about 800 million of cash over the next three years and predominantly would like to use that as a dry powder for m a but if we don t find desirable opportunities then we will return the cash to shareholders operator thank you and the next question comes from samad samana with jefferies your line is now open samad samana jefferies analyst hi thanks for taking my questions and nice quarter maybe first we definitely appreciate the increased disclosure and the amount of data provided today it s lot to digest but certainly much appreciated i think one of things that s that got to me was the smb acquisition that focuses on smb and i know that a one of the growth factors for the company i was wondering if maybe you could touch a little bit more about progress that you re making in the smb channel and then i have a couple of follow ups on the financial results for the quarter dan bodner president chief executive officer and chairman yeah the smb company that we bought is called monet they focus on smb technology we quickly bought them into our portfolio and while they brought few channels obviously we have a very large partner network so the plan there is very quick seamless integration very strong collaboration with monet people we found again very talented people there which you happy to bring over to the verint team and the plan is very simple we are offering a bigger smb portfolio to our partners and at the same time we are one of the few companies in smb that can also help them to move from smb to enterprise in a very seamless way so that s very important to our partners they sometimes work with multiple smb partners and then they have to work with enterprise partners separately and verint can actually is a one stop shop we ve always been very strong in terms of developing partners i think generally partners find verint to be very easy to do business with and as i mentioned also before while for the enterprise business we go to market in both our direct sales force and partners currently and going forward we are going after the smb pocket smb market with partners only we think that s a very efficient way and we hope to scale the business quickly in this way with a bigger portfolio and this acquisition certainly helped us to accelerate the time to market for the smb market samad samana jefferies analyst that s helpful and then maybe a follow on foresee and i know a couple of questions have been asked but if you could just maybe help us reconcile how the company did close to let s say 67 million in 2018 and then therein guided for 20 million contribution in 2019 or fiscal 20 which would be effectively calendar 19 i guess i m just trying to understand bridge the gap between that 67 million to the initial 20 million guidance and what the company saw when i gave that and then i guess for the incremental raised from the 20 number that 30 to 40 potential is it being that new business being driven by verint or is that something that you had discounted inside of foresee when you made the acquisition that turned out to be better than expected i guess just maybe be helping bridge that would be helpful for investors dan bodner president chief executive officer and chairman yes okay so the 67 million last year was with 15 15 million of losses and there was bigger losses than the year before right and we also found in diligence that they had renewal rates of the low 60 s in q4 and the q4 is a big renewal quarter for any company so clearly we expected that we have to do a few things first to expect further customer attrition and while the technology is strong i think customers are starting to move away from point solutions and foresee did not have the resources to develop a platform they were trying and they were on way to develop a bigger platform but they couldn t finish the job and obviously it makes sense for the foresee team to join forces with verint and help us to complete a platform quickly and also this helps them to go back to their customers and give them a roadmap which we already did with most of their customers and as i said we brought more than 100 foresee customers into our annual event and showcase the new release so the revenue this year is very much predicated on the idea that we re going to stop the attrition and we are giving customers a clear roadmap on how they can not only improve the foresee product but continue to expand with the verint platform into other areas so i also mentioned that in q1 we had further attrition and renewal rates was at the low 50s but we think we re taking the right steps so it let me reconcile the guidance first in terms of guidance we raised guidance three times the first time that we raised guidance was in december when we acquired foresee and we wanted to give a slower we wanted to tell investors that we paid 65 million and it s not a healthy company we re not buying it for their revenue or losses we re buying it for technology but we believe and we had very strong conviction that we can do at least 20 million which will be 3x revenue at that level obviously we were not happy with 20 and we were trying to get better but that was the flow and we raised guidance again in march by 25 million and part of that was because we started to see that we are taking the right steps with foresee and at that point we felt that 30 million of guidance is more appropriate so our 25 million increase in march was about 10 million attributable to foresee and 15 million to other parts of our business including the monte acquisition that we did in february it was about 5 million that we are taking into our guidance so that s kind of the way we thought about guidance today our view is that we should be able to generate 30 million to 40 million we made the business profitable day one and not only are profitable but also integrated so the r d organization the product management team already working hard on our roadmap which is really the strategic objective of the acquisition and the same time the feedback we got last week on the floor in our annual event is giving us in the bit more comfort about where this is going to end this year having said that even if we end up only with 30 million of profitable business paying 65 million for 30 million our saas business is profitable we certainly meeting our objectives for acquisitions and if we can achieve 40 million the high end of the range is obviously even better multiple longer term we think foresee is very important component of our voc platform and i m very pleased with the way we progressed with innovation samad samana jefferies analyst i really appreciate that very thorough answer and that s very helpful and for the sake of everybody else in the q a behind me i ll jump back in the queue of with my other questions but thank you so much for that answer that s very helpful dan bodner president chief executive officer and chairman okay sure inaudible operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from dan bergstrom with rbc capital markets your line is now open daniel bergstrom rbc capital markets analyst yes thanks for taking my question apologize for the background noise could you talk a little bit about the pace that maintenance conversion we should expect over the next several years understanding it s still early but i believe accelerating is that going to be largely customer driven or there are levers you could look to pull at some point to encourage conversion dan bodner president chief executive officer and chairman yes that s a good question i think the best thing we can do and we already did is what i mentioned before has future priority the biggest objection that we hear from customers is that they got the product is working you know there are under maintenance we re refreshing the product already pretty often so while they want to move to the cloud they are more interested in moving to the cloud with solutions that don t have rather than actually transitioning the one they do have so we have many customers that we saw new solutions in the cloud and they kept their existing solutions on premise and of course with the verint flexibility you can do that you can leave behind solution an on prem and work seamlessly with new solutions that are in the cloud so the feature priority actually takes away the last objection which is i don t want to drop my operation i don t want to move to the cloud and find a new application that require to change process or to train users on some new ways of doing business and we took that away with a feature priority so at this point i think that what s driving our customers to convert is a simple financial analysis of what s more expensive to keep their own data center and they re all it people that need to maintain the data center or to basically move to the cloud and outsource this operation to the verint cloud and i think for many customers the answer will be let s move to verint s because verint is more efficient we do it for many many customers when we do a security patching we forecast was at the same time so for many customers will be it s just more economical to take our solution and move to the verint cloud however there will be some customers that will remain on prem for a lot of different reasons i announced today many cloud deals but also announced over 10 million due from a large telco that actually wanted to stay on prem and that was a deal where we displaced many competitors because that standardized on verint and we certainly discussed with them cloud both in terms of converting our own solutions of cloud and converting the compared solutions of the cloud and all of the discussions they are remaining on premise so we certainly can do both but we are seeing customers moving more and more to the cloud and we certainly took a lot of the objections that the customer have regarding cloud we took that away and i think we re going to acceleration so the bottom line is we discussed last week on the webcast doug mentioned that we expect about 10 million conversion this year going to 20 million next year going to 30 million the following year daniel bergstrom rbc capital markets analyst great thanks dan bodner president chief executive officer and chairman sure operator thank you and our next question comes from jeffrey kessler with imperial capital your line is now jeffrey kessler imperial capital analyst thank you dan about this past december on your fourth quarter conference call you divided the cyber security business into three segments and what i m interested in finding out is three years ago cyber security because of emerging markets mainly but perhaps because one of two of the segments weren t performing that well was doing very poorly we re not up to your expectations not up to investors expectations what has changed from then until now with regards to one the geographic split let s call it disparity being done away but more importantly what are those which of those three parts or all those three parts have been improved to allow you to get this to a 10 growth area where it had been it had actually been shrinking dan bodner president chief executive officer and chairman yeah so just to remind everyone the three parts of cyber intelligence include physical security cyber security and the intelligence community and i would say that generally speaking automation is driving interest in all three parts of the security business because the exponential growth in data is a problem for all security customers in physical security as you know jeff explanation growth come from a lot of devices and in cyber security just growth in terms of the networks and endpoints and of course the intelligence agencies are have access to enormous amount of data so the ability to automatically capture data analyze data and put the insights to work is certainly something that is differentiating verint because it helps them to complete investigator investigations fastener and doing so with fewer cyber analyst and data scientists that are very very difficult to hire and retain so it s a combination of

2018 and 1 42 billion in the first quarter of 2018 the sequential decrease was primarily due to the previously disclosed acceleration of certain high profit project sales into 2018 from 2019 an enterprise resource planning erp system upgrade which resulted in 5 days of work stoppage at several manufacturing facilities and the anticipated lower production and sales volumes due to the impact of the chinese new year holiday the year over year decrease was primarily due to the higher revenue contribution from project sales and higher solar module asp in the prior period first quarter 2019

guidance was 16 0 to 18 0 gross margin in the first quarter of 2019 was better than expected primarily due to a lower blended module manufacturing cost compared to our previous forecast canadian solar s mss business comprises primarily the design development manufacture and sale of solar modules other solar power products and solar system kits the mss business also provides engineering procurement and construction epc and operating and maintenance o m services canadian solar s energy business comprises primarily the development and sale of solar projects operating solar power projects and the sale of electricity the module sales from the company s mss business to its energy business are on terms and conditions similar to sales to third parties the company develops solar power projects worldwide where applicable the company may apply for and or be entitled to receive a feed in tariff fit for its projects alternatively the company may participate in public or private energy auctions and bidding which result in long term power purchase agreements ppas the company may also sell all or part of the electricity generated from its solar power projects on the merchant power market because of the longer lead time two to four years to develop solar power projects and bring them to a commercial operation date cod the actual gross margin of a project may deviate from the expected gross margin the deviation may be caused by but not limited to changes in the political and economic conditions in host countries project specific conditions price movements of solar modules and other components epc services and the capital return requirements of solar asset buyers in recent years the company has sold some solar power projects before cod we typically refer to these sales as notice to proceed or ntp sales revenue is lower while gross margin percentage is higher in ntp sales compared to cod sales even if the absolute margin is the same results from the company s energy business

chief executive officer of canadian solar commented after achieving close to 140 growth of net profit in 2018 from the 2017 level we reasonably expected a healthy pause in the first quarter of 2019 due to the acceleration of some high profit project sales from 2019 into 2018 the appreciation of the rmb lost manufacturing days related to our erp system upgrade and the impact of chinese new year on production and sales volumes despite these challenges we remained focused and delivered q1 2019 solar module shipments revenue and gross margin at or above our expectations we are encouraged by the healthy demand levels we are seeing in our key markets stability in module asps and anticipated higher utilization of our capacity our late stage utility scale solar power project pipeline including

fourth quarter of 2018 our continued organizational focus on profitable module sales helped us deliver a 21 6 gross margin in a challenging quarter which was above our expectations our overall profitability for the first quarter 2019 was impacted by a foreign exchange loss due to the appreciation of the rmb against the u s dollar lost manufacturing days and a lower production volume due to our erp system upgrade and the chinese new year holiday as well as anticipated lower sales of solar power projects compared to the previous quarter we expect our profitability will improve as we move

swift s latin american regional conference larc explored how banks in the region are looking to increase digitisation while managing cyber and compliance challenges ignacio blanco head of latin america the caribbean at swift opened larc by noting that customer demands from financial services have rapidly increased in the digital world with organisations operating in a world that is hyper connected financial institutions need to evolve from market leaders to digital leaders he said this was supported by an audience poll that asked delegates to think about the main driver for digital transformation in their organisation with business model adaptation 32 and meeting customer expectations 31 being selected as the key drivers accelerating digital transformation as to how banks are approaching this challenge kartikeya swami associate partner at mckinsey company described how they are deploying systems and tools to drive products with an agile test and learn approach developing solutions and getting them out to customers for testing as quickly as possible taking on feedback updating the solution and sending it out for more feedback thinking about what it takes to successfully support the acceleration of digital transformation christopher mager ctp managing director digital office at bny mellon treasury services said that two years ago his institution had moved to pursue a more centralised strategy by creating an enterprise level digital group their clients often hold relationships with a number of the bank s businesses across the world he said so this enterprise view was helpful to provide a seamless approach as part of this process bny mellon created a digital council that has representatives from all the different business groups and key stakeholders while each business within the group should prioritise its own developments there are certain functions that every business undertakes such as onboarding clients or providing reporting for example this is where the digital council and enterprise approach has its focus mager said helping the business structure its data across the enterprise and avoiding duplicating costs kasif wadiwala associate partner at deloitte consulting reinforced the point that financial institutions need a bank wide digital strategy in order to bring all businesses along on the digitisation journey at the same time he added that banks need to understand what their business process rules are and how they manage technological investments before jumping into digitisation projects commenting on his own bank george doolittle executive vice president and head of global payments services corporate investment banking at wells fargo said they realised they had centralised innovation too much and needed to get the various business lines more involved in the process the business lines have the customer connection which is key in developing solutions that actually solve customer needs when it comes to payments for example customers want a fast effective and secure experience this point was raised by beatriz quevedo uman a regional head of client management global liquidity and cash management latin america for hsbc who noted that this need is the same for consumers and businesses alike mo nica garci a luzio vice president of finance at banco bisa added that corporates need more information around their payments which is why her bank had added support for swift gpi last year a question from the audience on day 1 of larc asked about how banks can go about balancing digital innovation with cyber security and regulatory requirements bny mellon s mager responded by saying that his team works closely with business partners on the digital council so that legal and compliance teams at the bank have an input on the bank s innovations it is important to get all key stakeholders on board before investing in and working on innovation in order to address any particular issues before time and resources are spent on a project facing cyber challenges the threat that banks face from cyber criminals was highlighted by swami who commented that 25 7 of all malware attacks in 2018 hit banks and other financial services organisations cyber actors will attempt to infiltrate a local system via a phishing attack a compromised security token or similar pat antonacci head of customer experience at swift explained they would then look to move large volumes of funds over weekends or holidays for example while banks smartened up to this approach and would monitor for these sorts of attacks fraudsters will now try to withdraw smaller but more numerous amounts during weekdays julian dana director of latin america for mandiant at fireeye made the point that advanced persistent threats apts are one group of cyber actors to pay particular attention to today these groups can often be government sponsored apts from countries such as north korea have evolved he noted from acting like hacktivists to now looking for financial gain as a way around economic sanctions ransomware like wannacry is an example of this apts have local contacts to support attacks who can help with reverse engineering to generate an insider threat adam bulava executive director of attack simulation with jp morgan added that the us financial sector has developed cyber response guides across the community to help address cyber threats the more that banks run through these eventualities the better they will be able to respond to a real attack the human element in combating cyber crime was highlighted by carmen zegarra digital crimes unit attorney for microsoft she said that people may have their password underneath their keyboard use basic passwords or use the same password on their company computer that they use on their mobile phone she stressed that organisation wide education is critical to build awareness nine out of ten people will click on a phishing link so the business needs to understand that fighting cyber crime is everyone s responsibility bulava said that jp morgan regularly carries out phishing tests across all of their employees in a move designed to further awareness and to protect the business he added that the bank has a red team of ethical hackers who will attack the bank s environment to try and gain access to data or accounts this can highlight where previously unknown vulnerabilities exist in the bank s infrastructure delegates had a chance to see skylar simmons from swift s own red team carry out a live hack on the second day of larc 2019 simmons showed how a methodical approach could allow a hacker to find a bank s ip address relatively easily see which ports of the bank s ip addresses are open and target the information they could uncover to quickly gain access to the bank s servers using a variety of tools that are easily available online in the hack simmons was able to download sensitive files from the bank s server he also found that the bank had written its own programme to send mt103 messages without using swift interfaces while the system was set up to only allow authorised users to send payment messages having compromised the system the hacker can start checking what security measures exist and bypass these quickly sending tens of millions of dollars to his own accounts the speed at which simmons was able to demonstrate a hacker s attempt to gain access to a bank s core systems provided plenty of food for thought for attending delegates keeping up with compliance as well as balancing an innovative digital agenda with managing the cyber threats banks also need to be able to keep up with the compliance demands they face speaking to this point on the second day of larc sandra depoalo managing director and global head of aml with bny mellon said that the compliance team needs to engage with the business team in a bank to understand new clients before the onboarding process begins she said that aml compliance in the bank could call a similar person in the potential client organisation at the start of this process for example depoalo added that it is important to find out if correspondent banks have similar controls in place if a bank is making repeated requests for information that go unanswered from its correspondent red flags can be quickly raised maristella aldana sanin chief compliance officer at bancolombia agreed with the need for compliance to be close to the business compliance programmes need to be reviewed on a regular basis to ensure they share the ethical principles of the organisation as well as the regulatory rules in compliance she added that they are also trying to improve the customer experience by being as agile and efficient as possible by using new technologies such as bots to scan for suspicious operations and comparing customers with a pool of peers for example corporate governance is critical to ensuring that compliance is understood across the whole organisation carlos e troetsch partner and executive vice president at mmg bank president of felaban said that this allows institutions to be proactive rather than reactive and it should be integrated into a bank s risk programme speaking to different banks in other regions also helps support the understanding of compliance in a bank beneficial ownership was named as the biggest compliance challenge globally by james h freis jr chief compliance officer and managing director at deutsche bo rse group the question is who is behind the corporate entity he said what is the nature of the corporate business and where are the funds coming from while it can be difficult to address beneficial ownership freis said that if it is done right it could create a level playing field across all countries collaboration and innovation to create common standards such as the swift kyc registry help in this regard he added regional considerations the issue of corruption and compliance is clearly top of mind for financial institutions in latin america a poll of delegates showed 69 believe that the biggest concern for latin america today is corruption and its impact on foreign direct investment fdi claudio irigoyen managing director head of latin america economics and foreign exchange fixed income strategy at bank of america merrill lynch commented that this issue has certainly been very important in different national elections in latin america in the past couple of years he did add however that the elephant in the room with regard to fdi is the possibility of us china trade wars on that topic humberto lo pez director of strategy and operations for latin america with the world bank observed a split in latin america noting how the northern part of the region looks to the us while the southern part of region looks to china he added that interest rates in the us could be a concern for companies in latin america with high levels of debt looking at where opportunities exist in the continent irigoyen mentioned brazil saying that expectations have adjusted significantly since the most recent presidential election with the reform bill in brazil expected to be passed by q3 2019 and additionally a market friendly government being elected in argentina there are good economic news stories in the region he said margaret myers director of the asia latin america program inter american dialogue highlighted softbank s us 5bn technology growth fund for start ups which could help to promote growth in the region she added that the advancement of 5g across the region offered the prospect of development in industries such as agriculture and mining in closing larc 2019 swift s ignacio blanco drew attention to the variety of opportunities for banks to accelerate digital transformation in latin america that had been discussed at the conference he concluded by saying that this transformation needs collaboration and it is critical that institutions foster a culture that supports this

go ahead david david joseph meyer co founder chairman of board and chief executive officer thank you john good morning everyone welcome to our first quarter fiscal 2020 earnings conference call on today s call i ll provide a summary of results then an overview for each of our business segments mark will then review financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and then conclude by reviewing our updated modeling assumptions for our fiscal 2020 if you turn to slide three you ll see an overview of our first quarter financial results our first quarter revenue was 278 million with adjusted pre tax income of 600 000 and adjusted earnings per diluted share of 0 02 we generated solid top and bottom line results during the fiscal first quarter by achieving healthy growth across all segments of our business despite challenging industry conditions that continue to persist we are particularly pleased with strong increases in our higher margin parts and service businesses which grew double digits in the quarter the solid performance in this area combined with higher equipment sales drove increased profitability across all our reporting segments versus the prior year period i will now provide additional detail for our three operating segments consisting of our domestic agriculture and construction segments and our international segment on slide 4 is an overview of our domestic agricultural segment across most of our ag footprint our former customers are experiencing an abnormally late cold and wet spring this has caused the delayed planting and this prolonged wet spell has the potential to impact yields crop selection and in some cases fields will not be planted and growers will opt for the multi peril crop insurance payment farmers incomes continue to be negatively impacted by low commodity prices which is partially attributable to retaliatory chinese tariffs in response last week the usda announced the 2019 market facilitation program which will provide 14 5 billion in direct payments to farmers according to a recent usda press release president trump directed secretary perdue to craft a release strategy to support american agricultural producers while the administration continues its work on free fair and reciprocal trade deals to open more markets in the long run to help american farmers compete globally while all the final details of those program are yet to be released early indications point to a high percentage of the aid going to soybean and wheat producers we continue to see our growers fleet duty cycle increasing as their current fleet is becoming more aged along with incurring a higher number of our machine hours this aged fleet along with the benefits of new technology is creating replacement demand for new equipment purchases positive yield trends and carryover from last year s excellent crop is supporting farmers ability to maintain current productive and reliable equipment fleets in addition for the growers who are not updating their fleets the aged and high inaudible equipment typically requires more parts and service repair and our customers will be looking to us for aftermarket support which is an important part of our business model and integral to our long term strategy and focus turning to slide five you will see an overview of our domestic construction segment the strong economy continues to positively impact the construction equipment industry in addition the higher oil prices we have been experiencing spurs demand for construction equipment for both oil production and related infrastructure while we are seeing stronger demand in the metro areas the rural construction equipment markets continue to be negatively impacted by the depressed farm commodity prices we continue to target our farmer customers as an outlet for used construction equipment our rental utilization is trending positively due to the steady demand and our fleet rationalization efforts the operational improvements we have been implementing in our construction equipment stores are producing results as evidenced by our year over year first quarter improvements to our top and bottom lines in our construction equipment segment in addition with our strong first quarter and confidence in our construction equipment business for the balance of the year we have raised our construction segment revenue modeling assumptions from up zero to 5 to up 5 to 10 on slide 6 we have an overview of our international segment including our markets within the countries of bulgaria germany romania serbia and ukraine crop development and growing conditions across much of our footprint is good to average we see overall stability in these regions continued global investment and with the aged machine population a long runway of parts and service revenue growth as the machinery part increases along with the complexity and sophistication that comes with modern farming in these developing markets again we experienced another quarter of solid performance and bottom line contribution from our international segment before i turn the call over to mark i want to thank all our employees for their efforts in executing on a solid first quarter as noted in our release we paid off the remaining principal balance of our original 150 million senior convertible notes on may 1 in conjunction with the maturity of the security again i want to thank our team for their operational execution that allowed us to retire this debt in the face of some very challenging industry conditions our balance sheet remains strong and put us in a good position as acquisition opportunities arise now i d like to turn the call over to mark to review our financial results in more detail mark kalvoda chief financial officer thanks david turning to slide seven we achieved total revenue of 278 million for the fiscal 2020 first quarter an increase of 14 2 compared to last year our revenue increase was across all our business segments and across all revenue categories equipment revenue was up 15 6 parts and service was up 10 7 and 14 respectively all these of these revenue categories benefited from our agram acquisition which occurred in july of last year excluding this acquisition our same store sales were up 11 1 compared to the first quarter last year that was down about 7 our rental and other revenue increased 6 7 in the first quarter due to a higher level of inventory rentals our dollar utilization of our designated rental fleet in our construction segment improved to 20 5 for the current quarter compared to 18 3 in the same period last year on slide eight our gross profit of 54 million for the quarter was an increase of 13 2 compared to the same period last year primarily driven by higher revenues gross margin decreased by 10 basis points to 19 4 versus the prior year due to slightly lower equipment margins and a shift in gross profit mix our operating expenses increased by 5 9 million to 53 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 the increase was impacted by our agram acquisition in the third quarter last year costs associated with the transition of our erp application as well as higher variable expenses such as commissions on the increased revenues as we previously communicated we are undergoing an erp system implementation which is expected to impact gaap earnings this fiscal year by approximately 0 25 per share we view these expenses as non recurring in nature and for the first quarter these expenses were just over 1 million or 0 04 per share despite these increases we were able to achieve greater operating leverage during the quarter as a percentage of revenue operating expenses improved in the first quarter to 18 9 compared to 19 2 in the same quarter last year floorplan and other interest expense decreased 26 5 to 2 5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to 3 4 million in the same quarter last year this reduction was primarily due to a lower level of interest bearing inventory and a decrease in interest expense on our lower principal balance of senior convertible notes in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 our adjusted net income was 500 000 compared to an adjusted loss of 1 6 million in the prior year our adjusted earnings per diluted share was 0 02 compared to an adjusted loss per diluted share of 0 07 in the first quarter of last year for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 adjusted ebitda improved to 6 3 million compared to 5 3 million in the first quarter of last year you can find a reconciliation of adjusted net income adjusted eps and adjusted ebitda to their most directly comparable gaap amounts in the appendix to the slide presentation on slide nine you will see an overview of our segment results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 agriculture revenues were 154 million an increase of 8 3 we experienced a good start to the year despite ongoing industry headwinds with healthy increases in equipment parts and service revenue compared to an ag segment that was down 12 5 in the first quarter last year the increased revenue generated the improved adjusted pre tax income of 1 9 million compared to 1 3 million in the prior year period turning to our construction segment revenue increased 15 9 to 71 million compared to the prior year period the segment s adjusted pre tax loss improved by 800 000 to a first quarter loss of 2 1 million the improvement in segment results was primarily the result of increased revenue this marks the third consecutive quarter of increased quarter over quarter top and bottom line results in this segment as we continue to drive this segment to profitability in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 our international segment revenue was 54 million an increase of 32 2 compared to the same quarter last year the revenue increase was driven by contributions from our agram acquisition which was completed early in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 as well as revenue increases throughout the rest of our european footprint our international segment adjusted pre tax income was 200 000 compared to an adjusted pre tax loss of 100 000 in the same quarter last year on slide 10 we provide an overview of our balance sheet highlights at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2020 we had cash of 63 million as of april 30 2019 our equipment inventory at the end of the first quarter was 490 million an increase of 73 million from january 31 2019 reflecting a 94 million increase in new equipment partially offset by a 22 million decrease in used equipment the equipment inventory turns increased to 1 8 in the current year compared to 1 7 in the prior year i ll provide a little more color on our inventory on the next slide our rental fleet assets at the end of the first quarter increased to 114 million compared to 111 million at the end of fiscal 2019 we continue to anticipate that our fleet size will be around the 110 million level by the end of fiscal 2020 as of april 30 2019 we had 374 million of outstanding floorplan payables on 640 million of total floorplan lines of credit we continue to have ample capacity in our credit lines to handle our equipment financing needs our total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio is a healthy 2 1 this ratio was impacted by the current quarter adoption of the new lease accounting standard which require the recording of lease liabilities have an approximate impact of 0 4 on this metric the ratio of 2 1 is well below the ratio of 3 5 which is the leverage covenant required of our larger bank facilities at the end of the first quarter we had 46 million of outstanding senior convertible notes on may 1 2019 the maturity date of this security we repaid the outstanding principal balance using cash on hand and our existing lines of credit significant cash generation over the past few years allowed us to repay these notes in full without having to replace them with another long term debt facility with the retirement of this debt behind us and our expectation of another good year of generating cash from operations we are in a solid liquidity position during a period of volatility and uncertainty particularly within our ag segment turning to slide 11 i would like to provide additional information on our equipment inventory as i just mentioned a few minutes ago in the current quarter we experienced seasonal stocking of new equipment inventory and saw a nice reduction in used inventory levels these changes are reflected in the size of the red and blue bars in the current quarter on this slide we are maximizing our non interest bearing terms from our manufacturers the dollar amount of non interest bearing inventory is reflected in the grey bars next to the inventory levels as an example in the current quarter we had total equipment inventory of 490 million of which 232 million or 47 4 was non interest bearing since fiscal 2017 the chart clearly demonstrates increasing levels of non interest bearing inventory on relatively flat total equipment inventory levels the primary driver of this improvement is the reduced aging of our inventory as a result of our ongoing life cycle management efforts as more of our inventory remains under interest free terms with our manufacturers this improvement has been the primary reason for the reduction in floorplan interest expense over the past few years we expect that equipment inventories will increase in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and then reduce in the back half of the year non interest bearing inventory levels will follow that seasonal trending as well slide 12 provides an overview of our cash flows from operating activities for the first three months of fiscal 2020 the gaap reported cash flow provided by operating activities for the period was 3 million as part of our adjusted cash flow used for operating activities we include all equipment inventory financing including non manufacturer floorplan activity our adjustments for non manufacturer floorplan payables was 13 million for the first three months of fiscal 2020 we also adjust our cash flow to reflect the constant equity in our equipment inventory which enables us to evaluate operating cash flows exclusive of changes in our equipment inventory financing decisions the equity and our equipment inventory decreased 10 8 points to 23 6 during the three months period ended april 30 2019 and the adjustment for constant equity in equipment inventory represents a 53 million use of cash the decrease in equipment or the decrease in equity in our inventory is primarily due to the seasonal stocking of new equipment inventories in the current quarter and the higher level of floorplan financing available on such inventories as well as borrowing more on our floorplan lines in preparation for the repayment of the outstanding balance of our convertible notes which occurred on may 1 2019 after all the adjustments our adjusted cash flow used for operating activities was 37 million for the three months period ended april 30 2019 compared to 26 million for the same period last year slide 13 shows our updated fiscal 2020 annual modeling assumptions we are increasing our revenue modeling assumptions for construction to reflect the relative strength we experienced during the first quarter and our expectations for the balance of fiscal 2020 our updated construction segment assumption is for growth of 5 to 10 versus flat to up 5 previously we are maintaining the assumptions for agriculture at flat and international at up 10 to 15 recall that our range for international includes the revenue contribution from the agram acquisition which closed in july 2018 despite the solid first quarter performance we remain cautious due to the uncertainty in the ag industry therefore we are maintaining our expectation for adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of 0 75 to 0 95 for fiscal 2020 operator we are now ready for the question and answer session of our call questions and answers operator thank you at this time we ll be conducting a question and answer session operator instructions our first question comes from the line of steve dyer with craig hallum capital group please proceed with your question steven lee dyer craig hallum capital group analyst thank you good morning question on ag in the quarter obviously a really strong resilient quarter given a pretty tough backdrop for your footprint what do you attribute that to is that just upgrade cycle or maybe a little bit more color as to what drove that strength david joseph meyer co founder chairman of board and chief executive officer steve good morning this is dave if you look at last year i think there was some carryover there and we had actually yields pretty much across our whole footprint and some of that typically carries over into the following year definitely a replacement demand is real out there and the age and the hours on the equipment has started increasing and then another at the end of the year last year the soybean growers they from this 2018 market facilitation program picked up another 1 65 for our every bushel of their soybeans they had if you look at the last year this time of the year last year a lot of the growers they were able to contract their soybeans up over that 10 level i think there were some pretty good corn contracts at that time so with that good yield last year with some pretty good contracting that 1 65 market facilitation shot in the arm put lot of our growers in some pretty good position here to really take care of their equipment needs as they go into this year s planting season so that s what we d attribute that to steven lee dyer craig hallum capital group analyst great got it helpful and then corn which you guys have always been fairly correlated to despite nicely north of 4 a bushel here in the last few weeks i guess one do you have any view on the sustainability of that and then two is that something that can change sentiment in your view and if so how long does it need to stay that way before farmers start viewing things differently thank you david joseph meyer co founder chairman of board and chief executive officer yeah over the last couple of days yeah definitely that s put a little more bounce in some of the farmers steps seeing this movement on the corn price and i would say a lot of that s attributed to the potential for a lot less acres going in fortunately in most of our footprint with the exception of south dakota our farmers are they are making progress and i think with this week most of their corn will be in the ground but if you look at indiana or you look at ohio or you look at illinois they are way behind in their corn planting and it continues to be very very wet so there could be on the all supply side with shot in the arm really less supply typically that corn might go up so and some of our growers are locking in some at today s price and they are just going to keep selling more if it keeps going up a little bit so yeah i d say that definitely has the potential for a real positive and it could be a real nice side in the pan and how much corn gets planted and really what happens to the yield as we get later in the year like that typically that your yield potential starts diminishing too so if you take less acres and then less yield across the us there are people are already speculating here of what that supply side could do for a potential corn price steven lee dyer craig hallum capital group analyst got it thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of mig dobre with robert w baird please proceed with your question mircea dobre robert w baird analyst thank you good morning guys i maybe want to start at construction obviously you re raising the guidance there and you had a really nice strong start to the year so i m looking for a little more color in terms of what s driving all of this and especially what s different versus your initial expectations that you had embedded in your outlook mark kalvoda chief financial officer yeah i think with the construction now i think as we mentioned in our prepared remarks it s three quarters now three consecutive quarters of that improved top and bottom line results and it s really we call it blocking and tackling and just focus on all the fundamentals out there one of the areas of improvement is in the inventory improvement that we ve had there that s driving better margins and lower floorplan interest expense in that area particularly within this quarter you saw some of this parts and service our focus in that expert team on driving that parts and service business really came through in the first quarter some of that may had to do maybe to with our late start to the construction season our customers really wanted to make sure out there inaudible is ready to go out there on the construction side as they ve got a compressed season here to get their jobs done i think the last thing is on the rental we talked about the rental utilization being up 2 percentage points again i think some of that fleet rationalization that we ve done showing some benefits here as well as just better execution on that side of the business and getting those rental deals in place so i don t know that it s any one particular thing it s a combination i think of a lot of things that will continue we are expecting to continue to happen and get us to profitability in this segment this year mircea dobre robert w baird analyst to be clear i m mostly wondering what s going on with the top line right i mean you re going from zero to 5 to 5 to 10 and i mean correct me if i m wrong but parts and service and rentals are not enough to generate this change of guidance it seems like equipment demand has to be part of it mark kalvoda chief financial officer yeah i think some of the same things is it s happening on the equipment side just going out and getting that business i think dave indicated in some of his remarks just with the strength of oil some of the sustained strength in oil that s happening particularly up here in the bakken we re seeing some better activity but that s flowing through to some of the other areas and the strength in our metro markets and it is it came through better than what we anticipated particularly late in the quarter here in april where we saw some good positive results there on the equipment sales side mircea dobre robert w baird analyst i see okay and then maybe we can talk a little bit about your guidance in ag you re still calling for flat that implies in the subsequent quarters call it slight decline but i m wondering how you re thinking the second quarter versus the second half what is the progression here because your comparisons obviously are varied so how do you think about it from a modeling perspective mark kalvoda chief financial officer yeah i think from as far as sequentially in the quarters here i think q2 will still see some positive i think q2 q3 and then once you get out to q4 where we had a very strong q4 this last year you will see some of that come off a little bit so i d say some level of growth in q2 q3 and then going negative to a small degree in q4 which is our highest equipment revenue quarter mircea dobre robert w baird analyst okay and then obviously you re not guiding any more to equipment margins and i understand that but when i m looking at q1 you came pretty close to what you ve described as the new normal of 11 is there any variability that you would call out for the rest of the year directionally for us mark kalvoda chief financial officer i think overall yes we kind of alluded to last year getting to that normal we ve came a little bit short in the first quarter here but i don t see i mean there s always some risk in all of this but i think 11 for the year is certainly still attainable even though we started out a little bit low here in the first quarter so no i think q2 q3 tends to be a little bit stronger as well and then when we get out to q4 it will come off a little bit i think we will be higher than where we were last year in q4 but q4 will be a little bit lower than the other quarters of the year mircea dobre robert w baird analyst that s helpful and then maybe last question for me i remember having this discussion on parts and service last quarter because things were already looking like we re going to have maybe a challenging plant season and that proves to be the case yet your performance was really really good here so it looks to me like it surprised you positively correct me if i m wrong i m wondering what was different than what you were initially contemplating and then as you look at the rest of the year with comparisons getting tougher in both parts and service how do you think about growth going forward mark kalvoda chief financial officer yeah i think it did surprise us a little bit it was higher than what we expected we did expect some nice growth last year in the first quarter it was off a decent amount versus the prior year i think another thing multiple speakers yes the comp will be tougher like you said later in the year and the other reason why it s going to be tougher is because of the agram acquisition so we re benefiting from that agram acquisition to the tune of 2 to 3 percentage points here in the first quarter second quarter it will be similar to that and then that goes away i think just similar to what i said maybe on construction we saw more strength in april late in the quarter in parts and service were it really came on and again some of that may have been just due to our customers wanted to make sure that they are prepared for getting out into the field in this case to minimize the break downs that occur and i think that s partially to do with that i think the other thing we re learning is this parts and service tends to be somewhat lumpy and it s hard to predict between quarter to quarter as you mentioned last quarter we were a little disappointed particularly in the service results last quarter and that did come back strong so it tends to be a little bit lumpy at times but as far as to the full year we still expect i think what we mentioned before kind of that mid single digit growth for the full year the biggest quarter is q2 is going to be bigger but q3 is the largest quarter there of course with the harvest so that will kind of make it or break it i think as far as attaining that mid single digits in our parts and service growth for the year mircea dobre robert w baird analyst right so mark to be clear when you re saying q3 the largest you re talking about dollars and revenue not growth correct mark kalvoda chief financial officer that s correct yes mircea dobre robert w baird analyst okay good job guys and thanks for the color mark kalvoda chief financial officer thanks mig operator thank you our next question comes from the line of rick nelson with stephens inc please proceed with your questions rick nelson stephens inc analyst thanks good morning i d like to drill down into the equipment margins we did see some pressure this quarter is that on the new side or the used side and if you could comment on inventory in the channel are other dealers taking advantage of these interest free deals and where you see channel inventory mark kalvoda chief financial officer i think so i ll take it at least the first part here as far as the equipment margins go most of that pressure we saw coming from the ag side on the new used continues to be stable and i think due to those industry supplies and specifically our improved inventory condition that we had but i think that the pressure is there is pricing pressure on that new from competition and difficulty fully passing on some of those oem price increases to the customer especially in this difficult environment as far as other others taking david joseph meyer co founder chairman of board and chief executive officer yeah i can talk to inventory rick a little bit slow so we re comfortable with our current level of new inventory right now what we need we have right plus additional units in q3 and q4 to hit our full year revenue number so we ve got the ability to flex up and down with the q4 orders but we have to get a little more visibility into the both commodity prices and what s going on with the yields and then i can say we ve got that opportunity to flex up and down so we talked a little bit earlier about corn but if that stays on that same price trajectory due to less acres and our order slots in that fourth quarter they could be starting to get they could fill up pretty fast we always have to be kind of cognizant of that then like what like mark explained too in his during our presentation that higher percentage of inventory on that non interest bearing that really helps it s helpful too so the whole picture we feel pretty good it s pretty well thought out plan and i d say we re right on track right now rick nelson stephens inc analyst great so ag segment the revenues were up 8 you re guiding to flat we heard some of the cautionary comments that you made that could cause a slowdown what are the signpost you mentioned corn prices that we should be looking for to shift your expectations david joseph meyer co founder chairman of board and chief executive officer well i think as you look ahead again if we just go back to last year a little bit excellent yields and in some cases record yields across our footprint our growers had the ability to contract this time of year last year at a much higher numbers than what you are seeing today we had a 1 65 soybean market facilitation program so that drove a lot of last year s business now this year we don t know what the yields are going to be we re not sure what the price is going to be we still haven t seen the details of the market facilitation program so definitely there is a level of uncertainty and volatility out there so we need some type of resolution to all of this trade information that s out there but so this year a lot of that first quarter i d say is carryover from last year and then i guess that s still yet to be seen for the balance of the year and so i d say stay tuned rick nelson stephens inc analyst yeah that make sense how about capital allocation your thoughts today you ve got that converts now off the books you are sitting on 63 million in cash do you continue to build the cash or do you think you d be putting it to work any update there mark kalvoda chief financial officer yeah i think certainly getting that convert behind us is big and critical as we ve talked i think there s a lot of opportunity we believe there s a lot of opportunity and particularly on the ag domestic ag side and the length of this being in the trough of the cycle that we ve been in there is good opportunities to go out and get some good quality acquisitions done on the ag side and we re focused on that and that s i think that s the top of our list from a priority standpoint in regards to capital allocation rick nelson stephens inc analyst great thanks and good luck mark kalvoda chief financial officer thanks rick operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from the line of larry de maria with william blair please proceed with your question larry de maria william blair analyst hi good morning everybody i know that maybe this is difficult there s a lot of moving parts but we have prevent plant dates coming up and you have the new program from the government that was mentioned so how are you thinking about overall let s say farmer income in your territory this year because assume there is going to be maybe some less acres and more prevent plant so can you piece it all together and think about how you re thinking about farmer income with obviously probably less yields et cetera but higher prices here so just overarching trying to understand if this is potentially a real pivot for your market or at the end of the day we re still going to talking about trades in another months from now and it s just sorted out thanks david joseph meyer co founder chairman of board and chief executive officer okay so i think we re pretty fortunate larry let s say if you look at minnesota north dakota nebraska and iowa they are actually not too far off from a year ago on getting their corn planted and like i said this week it s 80 degree and in some cases maybe the weather is sunshine and i d say we re going to get all that corn planted this week and some of the corn is up already so i think south dakota is the only thing state we have that s probably a little bit on the left side so i m fairly confident that our growers are pretty resilient and pretty resourceful i d say you re going to see that corn get down and then soybeans are going to follow up right after that so we re fortunate from that standpoint definitely we ve got the market facilitation program we got the trade issues going on and all and we need to get some closure to that to get some of this uncertainty out of the marketplace like that so i think everybody is pushing for that i d say this 2019 market facilitation program that s a positive and that s going to help our growers and i think it s going to be especially helpful for soybean growers and if you look at our five states our five ag states we raise a lot of soybeans so that s going to be good for that i think one thing that as we start to see this corn price start improving a little bit i m not sure if everybody is aware of the amount of corn on hand on the farms in the storage there is in some cases one year s worth of crops two even we ve got some of our growers out with three years worth of crops on hand so any spike in that corn price i think is going to be a benefit not only to this year s crop but that grain on storage is going to get be able to get sold in that standpoint again for some of these guys it could even be a little bit of a tax problem so i d say i think some of our growers are challenged right now the banks are become have a real conservative tone to them i think that some of our growers out there are putting their crop in this year without an operating note so that s going to be a little bit challenging for some of them but i think when you get all of it said and done i like our five states i think we re going to be in pretty good shape as we get through this and like we say we just need to get that the trade issues the tariff issues resolved and get this crop through and get it in the bin so hopefully that gives you a pretty good summary larry de maria william blair analyst no it does it sounds like you guys are in net better position than a lot others and i guess you guys kept the ag outlook and obviously you raised construction but maintained the eps guide a fairly wide range i m just curious about the puts and takes to that and why not narrow it given the slightly better construction and secondly correct me if i am wrong but it sounds like if there is upside to ag and it s mostly going to come later in the year once we drove this and then maybe orders getting better later as opposed to near term is that right mark kalvoda chief financial officer yeah i think so first of all in regards to ag just with all the different uncertainties out there that dave mentioned with the commodity prices trade war weather you mentioned prevent plant all of these things are just a lot of uncertainty out there and on the ce side with the revenue increase there that s obviously going to be the positive a little bit of the offset here is we did run a little bit higher in expenses than what we had anticipated so that ll come off a little bit and i think just keeping in mind that it s a range there on that eps and we re early in the year with a relatively seasonally low first quarter here so there s a lot of the year left to achieve that full year eps range larry de maria william blair analyst okay and then last question thank you you talked about obviously potentially putting some money to work in the m a are there ample opportunities in your territory in the midwest are you looking overseas just curious how things are shaking out now and obviously with kind of an odd backdrop as well so what kind of opportunities are there right now are they there david joseph meyer co founder chairman of board and chief executive officer i think the opportunities are we like this upper midwest footprint we re in and i think we definitely there is ample opportunities still fairly fragmented number of dealerships your aged dealer principles i think there some capital challenges so yes i think we definitely have some good opportunities either contiguous or in this same footprint that we re in today larry de maria william blair analyst okay thanks and good luck guys david joseph meyer co founder chairman of board and chief executive officer okay thanks larry operator thank you ladies and gentlemen that concludes our question and answer session i will turn the floor back to mr meyer for any final comments david joseph meyer co founder chairman of board and chief executive officer okay thank you everyone for being on this call today

yves here i don t know enough about the structure of the iranian economy to assess whether oil export revenue is as critical as this article suggests iran clearly needs foreign currency exports to buy imports like pharmaceuticals and any critical materials and products they don t produce domestically like chips i was under the impression that iran had become pretty autarchical due to having been under sanctions for so long but it may still have enough import dependence to prevent it from simply net spending if the sanctions have indeed meaningfully reduced domestic productive capacity printing would produce inflation pronto the western press says yes however an academic who visited the country in the last year but before the latest round said they didn t see any signs of distress

and birgün produced by globetrotter a project of the independent media institute it s hard to predict what will happen in the oil market as the u s sanctions on iran tighten for now it looks like india japan south korea and turkey will hold off from buying iranian oil these countries with china had been the main sources of iran s foreign exchange it is unlikely at the present time that india japan south korea and turkey will break the u s siege on iran they have made it clear that they do not want to rattle the u s cage request for new waivers from the u s came to naught india s government had said that it would reassess the purchases of cheap iranian oil after the elections it is likely that india will restart some buys but certainly not enough to prevent economic collapse in iran as the may deadline for the u s sanctions loomed these countries bought vast amounts of oil from iran to create their own buffer stocks revenues from the export of oil reached 50 billion for the iranian financial year of 2018 19 ending march 20 the oil sector contributed to 70 percent of iran s exports this income is essential for running iran s government and paying its 4 6 million employees the cost of the government is roughly 24 billion with the collapse of sales to india japan south korea and turkey iran will have a very difficult time raising revenues to maintain its economy the national development fund and the hard currency reserves have already begun to be depleted with dollar holdings now in the tens of billions new silk road tehran has long been hoped that china would continue to buy iranian oil and prevent the meltdown of iran s economy and its government there are two reasons why china would want to ignore u s sanctions and continue to buy iranian oil the first has to do with the fact that iran s oil is cheap and of a quality that chinese refiners prefer the second has to do with iran s crucial location along the line of china s belt and road as well as its string of pearls initiatives chaos in iran or a government in tehran that is pliant to the united states would be unacceptable to beijing roads trains and pipelines the infrastructure of the belt and road initiative are to run from the chinese territory through central asia into iran and then outward toward west asia and via turkey into europe iran s centrality to this project should not be underestimated in the first few months of 2019 china bought about half of iran s crude oil exports it has become a crucial pillar for iran whose diplomats say quite openly that if china no longer buys iran s oil or invests in iran the problems for the country will be grave massive oil buys from china in the weeks leading to the end of the u s waivers are however no indication of the continuation of this relationship chinese oil companies put in large orders to stockpile oil in anticipation of the cuts oil analysts suggest that the two major chinese oil importers china petrochemical corporation sinopec and china national petroleum corporation cnpc have not put in any buys since the u s waivers expired why china is not buying iranian oil china the world s fastest growing consumer of oil continues to buy oil from the united states the world s fastest growing producer of oil these two countries are locked in a trade war with tariffs rising on a raft of products from steel to soybeans china has not placed any tariffs on u s crude oil imports but it has reduced its purchases of u s oil by 80 percent despite china s withdrawal from the u s oil market it has not closed the door on future purchases meanwhile china has increased its oil purchases from saudi arabia by 43 percent in april there is every indication that china will continue to increase its buys from the kingdom during the course of this year to substitute for iranian oil and perhaps for u s oil china has also been slowly increasing its natural gas imports from australia a tendency that is expected to rise new surveillance technology of tankers low oil prices and more constraints on settling bills have made it difficult to smuggle oil out of iran last year smuggled oil out of iran totaled a minuscule 0 3 million barrels per day this is not enough to compensate for the oil purchases stopped by east and south asian countries u s sanctions in this climate have made tanker owners and insurers skittish about carrying iranian oil chinese firms are susceptible to this pressure nonetheless the liberian flagged tanker pacific bravo is said to have loaded iranian oil after the expiry of the waiver and is making its way to china as of this writing the tanker is off the coast of sri lanka when it arrives in china and offloads its cargo how will the u s respond iran iraq syria iran s foreign minister mohammad javad zarif was in baghdad on may 26 he met with iraq s foreign minister mohamed al hakim who said that iraq s government does not believe that the economic blockade namely the u s sanctions was good for the region we stand with iran in its position hakim said earlier in may iraq s oil minister thamer gadhba said that his country would continue to buy iran s natural gas essential for iraq s electricity grid this was despite u s pressure to cut natural gas purchases from iran and to substitute this through a 14 billion deal with u s energy firms including general electric indications show that iraq will not bend to u s pressure at this time nor will iraq block iranian oil from going to syria by truck an energy source that is essential to syria china s shield u s troops continue to arrive in the gulf region threatening iran zarif and al hakim jointly said that this is a dangerous development pressure on iran increases daily china has made it clear that it could buy iranian oil if it can pay in yuan or euros but it does not want to make iran part of its dispute with the united states the appetite to bring iran onto the bargaining table with the united states does not exist in beijing nor is beijing willing to provide iran with a protective shield but there are pressures on china not to ignore its own interests in the region china built a large port in gwadar pakistan which was intended to circumvent the long transit of goods and oil from the gulf through the straits of malacca to the south china sea but there are tensions here as baloch liberation army attacks mount on chinese targets one hundred and fifty kilometers west of gwadar is the iranian port of chabahar developed with indian assistance the united states at a request from the afghan government has turned the other way to continued indian involvement in that port which includes transportation lines to the afghan border through iran iran has signaled that it would be interested in giving china a role in this port if india begins to drift away china has increased its engagement in west asia but not to the point of getting sucked into a conflict that it sees as unfortunate what this means is that iran cannot rely fully on china and yet china is the only antidote to the u s suffocation of iran global oil production is high as are oil inventories oil prices consequently are low and will likely be lowered by reduced global demand projected low oil prices should raise more alarms in tehran since iranian external revenues will decline and so too will its importance to chinese importers the only reason for china to throw a shield around iran is to protect the belt and road initiative not for the oil

the company s chairman and ceo mr david meyer go ahead david david joseph meyer co founder chairman of board and chief executive officer thank you john good morning everyone welcome to our first quarter fiscal 2020 earnings conference call on today s call i ll provide a summary of results then an overview for each of our business segments mark will then review financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and then conclude by reviewing our updated modeling assumptions for our fiscal 2020 if you turn to slide three you ll see an overview of our first quarter financial results our first quarter revenue was 278 million with adjusted pre tax income of 600 000 and adjusted earnings per diluted share of 0 02 we generated solid top and bottom line results during the fiscal first quarter by achieving healthy growth across all segments of our business despite challenging industry conditions that continue to persist we are particularly pleased with strong increases in our higher margin parts and service businesses which grew double digits in the quarter the solid performance in this area combined with higher equipment sales drove increased profitability across all our reporting segments versus the prior year period i will now provide additional detail for our three operating segments consisting of our domestic agriculture and construction segments and our international segment on slide 4 is an overview of our domestic agricultural segment across most of our ag footprint our former customers are experiencing an abnormally late cold and wet spring this has caused the delayed planting and this prolonged wet spell has the potential to impact yields crop selection and in some cases fields will not be planted and growers will opt for the multi peril crop insurance payment farmers incomes continue to be negatively impacted by low commodity prices which is partially attributable to retaliatory chinese tariffs in response last week the usda announced the 2019 market facilitation program which will provide 14 5 billion in direct payments to farmers according to a recent usda press release president trump directed secretary perdue to craft a release strategy to support american agricultural producers while the administration continues its work on free fair and reciprocal trade deals to open more markets in the long run to help american farmers compete globally while all the final details of those program are yet to be released early indications point to a high percentage of the aid going to soybean and wheat producers we continue to see our growers fleet duty cycle increasing as their current fleet is becoming more aged along with incurring a higher number of our machine hours this aged fleet along with the benefits of new technology is creating replacement demand for new equipment purchases positive yield trends and carryover from last year s excellent crop is supporting farmers ability to maintain current productive and reliable equipment fleets in addition for the growers who are not updating their fleets the aged and high inaudible equipment typically requires more parts and service repair and our customers will be looking to us for aftermarket support which is an important part of our business model and integral to our long term strategy and focus turning to slide five you will see an overview of our domestic construction segment the strong economy continues to positively impact the construction equipment industry in addition the higher oil prices we have been experiencing spurs demand for construction equipment for both oil production and related infrastructure while we are seeing stronger demand in the metro areas the rural construction equipment markets continue to be negatively impacted by the depressed farm commodity prices we continue to target our farmer customers as an outlet for used construction equipment our rental utilization is trending positively due to the steady demand and our fleet rationalization efforts the operational improvements we have been implementing in our construction equipment stores are producing results as evidenced by our year over year first quarter improvements to our top and bottom lines in our construction equipment segment in addition with our strong first quarter and confidence in our construction equipment business for the balance of the year we have raised our construction segment revenue modeling assumptions from up zero to 5 to up 5 to 10 on slide 6 we have an overview of our international segment including our markets within the countries of bulgaria germany romania serbia and ukraine crop development and growing conditions across much of our footprint is good to average we see overall stability in these regions continued global investment and with the aged machine population a long runway of parts and service revenue growth as the machinery part increases along with the complexity and sophistication that comes with modern farming in these developing markets again we experienced another quarter of solid performance and bottom line contribution from our international segment before i turn the call over to mark i want to thank all our employees for their efforts in executing on a solid first quarter as noted in our release we paid off the remaining principal balance of our original 150 million senior convertible notes on may 1 in conjunction with the maturity of the security again i want to thank our team for their operational execution that allowed us to retire this debt in the face of some very challenging industry conditions our balance sheet remains strong and put us in a good position as acquisition opportunities arise now i d like to turn the call over to mark to review our financial results in more detail mark kalvoda chief financial officer thanks david turning to slide seven we achieved total revenue of 278 million for the fiscal 2020 first quarter an increase of 14 2 compared to last year our revenue increase was across all our business segments and across all revenue categories equipment revenue was up 15 6 parts and service was up 10 7 and 14 respectively all these of these revenue categories benefited from our agram acquisition which occurred in july of last year excluding this acquisition our same store sales were up 11 1 compared to the first quarter last year that was down about 7 our rental and other revenue increased 6 7 in the first quarter due to a higher level of inventory rentals our dollar utilization of our designated rental fleet in our construction segment improved to 20 5 for the current quarter compared to 18 3 in the same period last year on slide eight our gross profit of 54 million for the quarter was an increase of 13 2 compared to the same period last year primarily driven by higher revenues gross margin decreased by 10 basis points to 19 4 versus the prior year due to slightly lower equipment margins and a shift in gross profit mix our operating expenses increased by 5 9 million to 53 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 the increase was impacted by our agram acquisition in the third quarter last year costs associated with the transition of our erp application as well as higher variable expenses such as commissions on the increased revenues as we previously communicated we are undergoing an erp system implementation which is expected to impact gaap earnings this fiscal year by approximately 0 25 per share we view these expenses as non recurring in nature and for the first quarter these expenses were just over 1 million or 0 04 per share despite these increases we were able to achieve greater operating leverage during the quarter as a percentage of revenue operating expenses improved in the first quarter to 18 9 compared to 19 2 in the same quarter last year floorplan and other interest expense decreased 26 5 to 2 5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to 3 4 million in the same quarter last year this reduction was primarily due to a lower level of interest bearing inventory and a decrease in interest expense on our lower principal balance of senior convertible notes in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 our adjusted net income was 500 000 compared to an adjusted loss of 1 6 million in the prior year our adjusted earnings per diluted share was 0 02 compared to an adjusted loss per diluted share of 0 07 in the first quarter of last year for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 adjusted ebitda improved to 6 3 million compared to 5 3 million in the first quarter of last year you can find a reconciliation of adjusted net income adjusted eps and adjusted ebitda to their most directly comparable gaap amounts in the appendix to the slide presentation on slide nine you will see an overview of our segment results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 agriculture revenues were 154 million an increase of 8 3 we experienced a good start to the year despite ongoing industry headwinds with healthy increases in equipment parts and service revenue compared to an ag segment that was down 12 5 in the first quarter last year the increased revenue generated the improved adjusted pre tax income of 1 9 million compared to 1 3 million in the prior year period turning to our construction segment revenue increased 15 9 to 71 million compared to the prior year period the segment s adjusted pre tax loss improved by 800 000 to a first quarter loss of 2 1 million the improvement in segment results was primarily the result of increased revenue this marks the third consecutive quarter of increased quarter over quarter top and bottom line results in this segment as we continue to drive this segment to profitability in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 our international segment revenue was 54 million an increase of 32 2 compared to the same quarter last year the revenue increase was driven by contributions from our agram acquisition which was completed early in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 as well as revenue increases throughout the rest of our european footprint our international segment adjusted pre tax income was 200 000 compared to an adjusted pre tax loss of 100 000 in the same quarter last year on slide 10 we provide an overview of our balance sheet highlights at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2020 we had cash of 63 million as of april 30 2019 our equipment inventory at the end of the first quarter was 490 million an increase of 73 million from january 31 2019 reflecting a 94 million increase in new equipment partially offset by a 22 million decrease in used equipment the equipment inventory turns increased to 1 8 in the current year compared to 1 7 in the prior year i ll provide a little more color on our inventory on the next slide our rental fleet assets at the end of the first quarter increased to 114 million compared to 111 million at the end of fiscal 2019 we continue to anticipate that our fleet size will be around the 110 million level by the end of fiscal 2020 as of april 30 2019 we had 374 million of outstanding floorplan payables on 640 million of total floorplan lines of credit we continue to have ample capacity in our credit lines to handle our equipment financing needs our total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio is a healthy 2 1 this ratio was impacted by the current quarter adoption of the new lease accounting standard which require the recording of lease liabilities have an approximate impact of 0 4 on this metric the ratio of 2 1 is well below the ratio of 3 5 which is the leverage covenant required of our larger bank facilities at the end of the first quarter we had 46 million of outstanding senior convertible notes on may 1 2019 the maturity date of this security we repaid the outstanding principal balance using cash on hand and our existing lines of credit significant cash generation over the past few years allowed us to repay these notes in full without having to replace them with another long term debt facility with the retirement of this debt behind us and our expectation of another good year of generating cash from operations we are in a solid liquidity position during a period of volatility and uncertainty particularly within our ag segment turning to slide 11 i would like to provide additional information on our equipment inventory as i just mentioned a few minutes ago in the current quarter we experienced seasonal stocking of new equipment inventory and saw a nice reduction in used inventory levels these changes are reflected in the size of the red and blue bars in the current quarter on this slide we are maximizing our non interest bearing terms from our manufacturers the dollar amount of non interest bearing inventory is reflected in the grey bars next to the inventory levels as an example in the current quarter we had total equipment inventory of 490 million of which 232 million or 47 4 was non interest bearing since fiscal 2017 the chart clearly demonstrates increasing levels of non interest bearing inventory on relatively flat total equipment inventory levels the primary driver of this improvement is the reduced aging of our inventory as a result of our ongoing life cycle management efforts as more of our inventory remains under interest free terms with our manufacturers this improvement has been the primary reason for the reduction in floorplan interest expense over the past few years we expect that equipment inventories will increase in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and then reduce in the back half of the year non interest bearing inventory levels will follow that seasonal trending as well slide 12 provides an overview of our cash flows from operating activities for the first three months of fiscal 2020 the gaap reported cash flow provided by operating activities for the period was 3 million as part of our adjusted cash flow used for operating activities we include all equipment inventory financing including non manufacturer floorplan activity our adjustments for non manufacturer floorplan payables was 13 million for the first three months of fiscal 2020 we also adjust our cash flow to reflect the constant equity in our equipment inventory which enables us to evaluate operating cash flows exclusive of changes in our equipment inventory financing decisions the equity and our equipment inventory decreased 10 8 points to 23 6 during the three months period ended april 30 2019 and the adjustment for constant equity in equipment inventory represents a 53 million use of cash the decrease in equipment or the decrease in equity in our inventory is primarily due to the seasonal stocking of new equipment inventories in the current quarter and the higher level of floorplan financing available on such inventories as well as borrowing more on our floorplan lines in preparation for the repayment of the outstanding balance of our convertible notes which occurred on may 1 2019 after all the adjustments our adjusted cash flow used for operating activities was 37 million for the three months period ended april 30 2019 compared to 26 million for the same period last year slide 13 shows our updated fiscal 2020 annual modeling assumptions we are increasing our revenue modeling assumptions for construction to reflect the relative strength we experienced during the first quarter and our expectations for the balance of fiscal 2020 our updated construction segment assumption is for growth of 5 to 10 versus flat to up 5 previously we are maintaining the assumptions for agriculture at flat and international at up 10 to 15 recall that our range for international includes the revenue contribution from the agram acquisition which closed in july 2018 despite the solid first quarter performance we remain cautious due to the uncertainty in the ag industry therefore we are maintaining our expectation for adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of 0 75 to 0 95 for fiscal 2020 operator we are now ready for the question and answer session of our call questions and answers operator thank you at this time we ll be conducting a question and answer session operator instructions our first question comes from the line of steve dyer with craig hallum capital group please proceed with your question steven lee dyer craig hallum capital group analyst thank you good morning question on ag in the quarter obviously a really strong resilient quarter given a pretty tough backdrop for your footprint what do you attribute that to is that just upgrade cycle or maybe a little bit more color as to what drove that strength david joseph meyer co founder chairman of board and chief executive officer steve good morning this is dave if you look at last year i think there was some carryover there and we had actually yields pretty much across our whole footprint and some of that typically carries over into the following year definitely a replacement demand is real out there and the age and the hours on the equipment has started increasing and then another at the end of the year last year the soybean growers they from this 2018 market facilitation program picked up another 1 65 for our every bushel of their soybeans they had if you look at the last year this time of the year last year a lot of the growers they were able to contract their soybeans up over that 10 level i think there were some pretty good corn contracts at that time so with that good yield last year with some pretty good contracting that 1 65 market facilitation shot in the arm put lot of our growers in some pretty good position here to really take care of their equipment needs as they go into this year s planting season so that s what we d attribute that to steven lee dyer craig hallum capital group analyst great got it helpful and then corn which you guys have always been fairly correlated to despite nicely north of 4 a bushel here in the last few weeks i guess one do you have any view on the sustainability of that and then two is that something that can change sentiment in your view and if so how long does it need to stay that way before farmers start viewing things differently thank you david joseph meyer co founder chairman of board and chief executive officer yeah over the last couple of days yeah definitely that s put a little more bounce in some of the farmers steps seeing this movement on the corn price and i would say a lot of that s attributed to the potential for a lot less acres going in fortunately in most of our footprint with the exception of south dakota our farmers are they are making progress and i think with this week most of their corn will be in the ground but if you look at indiana or you look at ohio or you look at illinois they are way behind in their corn planting and it continues to be very very wet so there could be on the all supply side with shot in the arm really less supply typically that corn might go up so and some of our growers are locking in some at today s price and they are just going to keep selling more if it keeps going up a little bit so yeah i d say that definitely has the potential for a real positive and it could be a real nice side in the pan and how much corn gets planted and really what happens to the yield as we get later in the year like that typically that your yield potential starts diminishing too so if you take less acres and then less yield across the us there are people are already speculating here of what that supply side could do for a potential corn price steven lee dyer craig hallum capital group analyst got it thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of mig dobre with robert w baird please proceed with your question mircea dobre robert w baird analyst thank you good morning guys i maybe want to start at construction obviously you re raising the guidance there and you had a really nice strong start to the year so i m looking for a little more color in terms of what s driving all of this and especially what s different versus your initial expectations that you had embedded in your outlook mark kalvoda chief financial officer yeah i think with the construction now i think as we mentioned in our prepared remarks it s three quarters now three consecutive quarters of that improved top and bottom line results and it s really we call it blocking and tackling and just focus on all the fundamentals out there one of the areas of improvement is in the inventory improvement that we ve had there that s driving better margins and lower floorplan interest expense in that area particularly within this quarter you saw some of this parts and service our focus in that expert team on driving that parts and service business really came through in the first quarter some of that may had to do maybe to with our late start to the construction season our customers really wanted to make sure out there inaudible is ready to go out there on the construction side as they ve got a compressed season here to get their jobs done i think the last thing is on the rental we talked about the rental utilization being up 2 percentage points again i think some of that fleet rationalization that we ve done showing some benefits here as well as just better execution on that side of the business and getting those rental deals in place so i don t know that it s any one particular thing it s a combination i think of a lot of things that will continue we are expecting to continue to happen and get us to profitability in this segment this year mircea dobre robert w baird analyst to be clear i m mostly wondering what s going on with the top line right i mean you re going from zero to 5 to 5 to 10 and i mean correct me if i m wrong but parts and service and rentals are not enough to generate this change of guidance it seems like equipment demand has to be part of it mark kalvoda chief financial officer yeah i think some of the same things is it s happening on the equipment side just going out and getting that business i think dave indicated in some of his remarks just with the strength of oil some of the sustained strength in oil that s happening particularly up here in the bakken we re seeing some better activity but that s flowing through to some of the other areas and the strength in our metro markets and it is it came through better than what we anticipated particularly late in the quarter here in april where we saw some good positive results there on the equipment sales side mircea dobre robert w baird analyst i see okay and then maybe we can talk a little bit about your guidance in ag you re still calling for flat that implies in the subsequent quarters call it slight decline but i m wondering how you re thinking the second quarter versus the second half what is the progression here because your comparisons obviously are varied so how do you think about it from a modeling perspective mark kalvoda chief financial officer yeah i think from as far as sequentially in the quarters here i think q2 will still see some positive i think q2 q3 and then once you get out to q4 where we had a very strong q4 this last year you will see some of that come off a little bit so i d say some level of growth in q2 q3 and then going negative to a small degree in q4 which is our highest equipment revenue quarter mircea dobre robert w baird analyst okay and then obviously you re not guiding any more to equipment margins and i understand that but when i m looking at q1 you came pretty close to what you ve described as the new normal of 11 is there any variability that you would call out for the rest of the year directionally for us mark kalvoda chief financial officer i think overall yes we kind of alluded to last year getting to that normal we ve came a little bit short in the first quarter here but i don t see i mean there s always some risk in all of this but i think 11 for the year is certainly still attainable even though we started out a little bit low here in the first quarter so no i think q2 q3 tends to be a little bit stronger as well and then when we get out to q4 it will come off a little bit i think we will be higher than where we were last year in q4 but q4 will be a little bit lower than the other quarters of the year mircea dobre robert w baird analyst that s helpful and then maybe last question for me i remember having this discussion on parts and service last quarter because things were already looking like we re going to have maybe a challenging plant season and that proves to be the case yet your performance was really really good here so it looks to me like it surprised you positively correct me if i m wrong i m wondering what was different than what you were initially contemplating and then as you look at the rest of the year with comparisons getting tougher in both parts and service how do you think about growth going forward mark kalvoda chief financial officer yeah i think it did surprise us a little bit it was higher than what we expected we did expect some nice growth last year in the first quarter it was off a decent amount versus the prior year i think another thing multiple speakers yes the comp will be tougher like you said later in the year and the other reason why it s going to be tougher is because of the agram acquisition so we re benefiting from that agram acquisition to the tune of 2 to 3 percentage points here in the first quarter second quarter it will be similar to that and then that goes away i think just similar to what i said maybe on construction we saw more strength in april late in the quarter in parts and service were it really came on and again some of that may have been just due to our customers wanted to make sure that they are prepared for getting out into the field in this case to minimize the break downs that occur and i think that s partially to do with that i think the other thing we re learning is this parts and service tends to be somewhat lumpy and it s hard to predict between quarter to quarter as you mentioned last quarter we were a little disappointed particularly in the service results last quarter and that did come back strong so it tends to be a little bit lumpy at times but as far as to the full year we still expect i think what we mentioned before kind of that mid single digit growth for the full year the biggest quarter is q2 is going to be bigger but q3 is the largest quarter there of course with the harvest so that will kind of make it or break it i think as far as attaining that mid single digits in our parts and service growth for the year mircea dobre robert w baird analyst right so mark to be clear when you re saying q3 the largest you re talking about dollars and revenue not growth correct mark kalvoda chief financial officer that s correct yes mircea dobre robert w baird analyst okay good job guys and thanks for the color mark kalvoda chief financial officer thanks mig operator thank you our next question comes from the line of rick nelson with stephens inc please proceed with your questions rick nelson stephens inc analyst thanks good morning i d like to drill down into the equipment margins we did see some pressure this quarter is that on the new side or the used side and if you could comment on inventory in the channel are other dealers taking advantage of these interest free deals and where you see channel inventory mark kalvoda chief financial officer i think so i ll take it at least the first part here as far as the equipment margins go most of that pressure we saw coming from the ag side on the new used continues to be stable and i think due to those industry supplies and specifically our improved inventory condition that we had but i think that the pressure is there is pricing pressure on that new from competition and difficulty fully passing on some of those oem price increases to the customer especially in this difficult environment as far as other others taking david joseph meyer co founder chairman of board and chief executive officer yeah i can talk to inventory rick a little bit slow so we re comfortable with our current level of new inventory right now what we need we have right plus additional units in q3 and q4 to hit our full year revenue number so we ve got the ability to flex up and down with the q4 orders but we have to get a little more visibility into the both commodity prices and what s going on with the yields and then i can say we ve got that opportunity to flex up and down so we talked a little bit earlier about corn but if that stays on that same price trajectory due to less acres and our order slots in that fourth quarter they could be starting to get they could fill up pretty fast we always have to be kind of cognizant of that then like what like mark explained too in his during our presentation that higher percentage of inventory on that non interest bearing that really helps it s helpful too so the whole picture we feel pretty good it s pretty well thought out plan and i d say we re right on track right now rick nelson stephens inc analyst great so ag segment the revenues were up 8 you re guiding to flat we heard some of the cautionary comments that you made that could cause a slowdown what are the signpost you mentioned corn prices that we should be looking for to shift your expectations david joseph meyer co founder chairman of board and chief executive officer well i think as you look ahead again if we just go back to last year a little bit excellent yields and in some cases record yields across our footprint our growers had the ability to contract this time of year last year at a much higher numbers than what you are seeing today we had a 1 65 soybean market facilitation program so that drove a lot of last year s business now this year we don t know what the yields are going to be we re not sure what the price is going to be we still haven t seen the details of the market facilitation program so definitely there is a level of uncertainty and volatility out there so we need some type of resolution to all of this trade information that s out there but so this year a lot of that first quarter i d say is carryover from last year and then i guess that s still yet to be seen for the balance of the year and so i d say stay tuned rick nelson stephens inc analyst yeah that make sense how about capital allocation your thoughts today you ve got that converts now off the books you are sitting on 63 million in cash do you continue to build the cash or do you think you d be putting it to work any update there mark kalvoda chief financial officer yeah i think certainly getting that convert behind us is big and critical as we ve talked i think there s a lot of opportunity we believe there s a lot of opportunity and particularly on the ag domestic ag side and the length of this being in the trough of the cycle that we ve been in there is good opportunities to go out and get some good quality acquisitions done on the ag side and we re focused on that and that s i think that s the top of our list from a priority standpoint in regards to capital allocation rick nelson stephens inc analyst great thanks and good luck mark kalvoda chief financial officer thanks rick operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from the line of larry de maria with william blair please proceed with your question larry de maria william blair analyst hi good morning everybody i know that maybe this is difficult there s a lot of moving parts but we have prevent plant dates coming up and you have the new program from the government that was mentioned so how are you thinking about overall let s say farmer income in your territory this year because assume there is going to be maybe some less acres and more prevent plant so can you piece it all together and think about how you re thinking about farmer income with obviously probably less yields et cetera but higher prices here so just overarching trying to understand if this is potentially a real pivot for your market or at the end of the day we re still going to talking about trades in another months from now and it s just sorted out thanks david joseph meyer co founder chairman of board and chief executive officer okay so i think we re pretty fortunate larry let s say if you look at minnesota north dakota nebraska and iowa they are actually not too far off from a year ago on getting their corn planted and like i said this week it s 80 degree and in some cases maybe the weather is sunshine and i d say we re going to get all that corn planted this week and some of the corn is up already so i think south dakota is the only thing state we have that s probably a little bit on the left side so i m fairly confident that our growers are pretty resilient and pretty resourceful i d say you re going to see that corn get down and then soybeans are going to follow up right after that so we re fortunate from that standpoint definitely we ve got the market facilitation program we got the trade issues going on and all and we need to get some closure to that to get some of this uncertainty out of the marketplace like that so i think everybody is pushing for that i d say this 2019 market facilitation program that s a positive and that s going to help our growers and i think it s going to be especially helpful for soybean growers and if you look at our five states our five ag states we raise a lot of soybeans so that s going to be good for that i think one thing that as we start to see this corn price start improving a little bit i m not sure if everybody is aware of the amount of corn on hand on the farms in the storage there is in some cases one year s worth of crops two even we ve got some of our growers out with three years worth of crops on hand so any spike in that corn price i think is going to be a benefit not only to this year s crop but that grain on storage is going to get be able to get sold in that standpoint again for some of these guys it could even be a little bit of a tax problem so i d say i think some of our growers are challenged right now the banks are become have a real conservative tone to them i think that some of our growers out there are putting their crop in this year without an operating note so that s going to be a little bit challenging for some of them but i think when you get all of it said and done i like our five states i think we re going to be in pretty good shape as we get through this and like we say we just need to get that the trade issues the tariff issues resolved and get this crop through and get it in the bin so hopefully that gives you a pretty good summary larry de maria william blair analyst no it does it sounds like you guys are in net better position than a lot others and i guess you guys kept the ag outlook and obviously you raised construction but maintained the eps guide a fairly wide range i m just curious about the puts and takes to that and why not narrow it given the slightly better construction and secondly correct me if i am wrong but it sounds like if there is upside to ag and it s mostly going to come later in the year once we drove this and then maybe orders getting better later as opposed to near term is that right mark kalvoda chief financial officer yeah i think so first of all in regards to ag just with all the different uncertainties out there that dave mentioned with the commodity prices trade war weather you mentioned prevent plant all of these things are just a lot of uncertainty out there and on the ce side with the revenue increase there that s obviously going to be the positive a little bit of the offset here is we did run a little bit higher in expenses than what we had anticipated so that ll come off a little bit and i think just keeping in mind that it s a range there on that eps and we re early in the year with a relatively seasonally low first quarter here so there s a lot of the year left to achieve that full year eps range larry de maria william blair analyst okay and then last question thank you you talked about obviously potentially putting some money to work in the m a are there ample opportunities in your territory in the midwest are you looking overseas just curious how things are shaking out now and obviously with kind of an odd backdrop as well so what kind of opportunities are there right now are they there david joseph meyer co founder chairman of board and chief executive officer i think the opportunities are we like this upper midwest footprint we re in and i think we definitely there is ample opportunities still fairly fragmented number of dealerships your aged dealer principles i think there some capital challenges so yes i think we definitely have some good opportunities either contiguous or in this same footprint that we re in today larry de maria william blair analyst okay thanks and good luck guys david joseph meyer co founder chairman of board and chief executive officer okay thanks larry operator thank you ladies and gentlemen that concludes our question and answer session i will turn the floor back to mr meyer for any final comments david joseph meyer co founder

pakistan is under heavy foreign debt to be paid back according to given schedule and its foreign reserves are not sufficient to pay back the loan instalments and also to pay for the necessary imports therefore pakistan had two options to resolve its balance of payments issue either to raise the entire revenues through the collection of the tax by broadening the tax base and raising the tax or get a bailout package from the international financial institutions ifis like the international monetary fund imf the world bank wb and asian development bank adb pakistan decided to get the imf bailout package which has been agreed to equal to 6 billion us dollars to be paid to pakistan over a period of three years this agreement is subject to the approval by the imf board of directors this package contains some very tough conditions like raising of rs 5400 billion revenue 40 perecent higher than before for the next budget year which will exert a heavy burden on the people as the taxpayers this condition has been kept despite the fact that the imf has predicted very low economic growth rate 2 7 percent in pakistan during this year this is something unusual in the context of pakistan getting bailout package from the imf in july 2018 the us secretary of state michael pompeo had warned the imf that the trump administration will not allow it to lend us dollars to pakistan for repaying china some political circles interpreted this as a message to pakistan that washington might oppose its request for a bailout package from the imf and now it has been apprehended that the agreed upon package may not finally be approved by the imf board of directors despite its sincere efforts in contributing positively towards ending terrorism and achieving peace and prosperity in the region and the world if pakistan is still economically intimidated by the imf and fatf this interpretation is being done in the light of us perceptions that china initiated bri and cpec are aimed at china s power projection world wide that will ultimately change the world balance of power although these projects are primarily economic oriented as described by the chinese government as far as pakistan is concerned it has joined the cpec because of its expected positive impact on the economy which is suffering from low growth cycle and needed a financial and a connectivity push to increase the growth rate and the exports like imf s tough conditions pakistan is also being kept in the grey list of the fatf despite that it has done a lot in the context of tightening money laundering and terrorist financing pakistan is still under constant pressure that it can be moved to the blacklist which can harm it economically as blacklisted countries can be in difficulty in getting loans from the ifis and may also be subjected to economic sanctions since india is a member of the asia pacific group agp of the fatf that is supposed to assess pakistan s performance in countering money laundering and terrorist financing it is playing a negative role by misguiding the apg members by blaming pakistan for supporting terrorism in this context no action has yet been taken by the fatf on the pakistan s request that india should not sit in the group s assessment meetings this further increases pakistan s doubts about the fatf intentions about pakistan in view of the above discussion it is hoped that the us will not get tough on pakistan and will facilitate the approval of the agreed upon loan by the imf board of directors and it will also use its influence in the fatf to recognize pakistan s sincere efforts being made in countering money laundering and terrorist financing and remove it from the grey list also pakistan wishes to establish strategic friendly relations with the us the us authorities should think that it is same pakistan which had secretly facilitated materialization ofthe us diplomatic contacts with china in 1970 now why should the us administration think that pakistan being a friend of china can be hurting the us interests in fact pakistan is still a us partner in the war on terror which is evident from its contributions in making peace in afghanistan by facilitating talks between the us and the taliban therefore it is expected that the us led imf and fatf will not coerce pakistan economically however despite its sincere efforts in contributing positively towards ending terrorism and achieving peace and prosperity in the region and the world if pakistan is still economically intimidated by the imf and fatf then our political leaders should forge unity and use pakistan s own capacity to create required revenues by increasing taxes and through volunteer contributions to pay back the foreign debt and manage its economy if such an eventuality arises the people of pakistan if bravely led have the resilience courage and a spirit of sacrifice to contribute everything to ensure that pakistan s integrity dignity and strategic power

glen hodgson is a senior fellow at the c d howe institute canadians may have recognized by now that our economy has entered a period of structurally slower economic growth due principally to an aging population immediate economic factors often capture the headlines such as the u s china trade dispute whether the u s congress will pass the united states mexico canada agreement usmca high levels of personal debt or higher interest rates these factors combined have increased uncertainty and reduced the consensus growth outlook for canada to well below 1 5 per cent in 2019 aging demographics and sharply slower growth in the labour force however are the real culprits canada s sustainable long term growth rate has fallen below 2 per cent annually with growth potential a bit higher for western provinces and lower in central and atlantic canada canadian businesses and governments alike are hurt by slower growth but provinces and territories are on the front line provincial governments many with large deficits and rising debt are caught in a squeeze between slower revenue growth and the relentless pressure to spend on the priority public services they deliver they have generally tried to grow their way out of fiscal problems relying on a combination of steady revenue growth and controlled spending to restore or maintain sustainable fiscal positions but this approach is unlikely to be adequate in the years ahead here s why government tax revenue will grow much more slowly due to slower growth in nominal gross domestic product the combination of real economic growth plus inflation for example the recent ontario budget projected nominal gdp growth for the province of only 3 4 per cent from 2018 to 2020 declining to 3 2 per cent in 2021 these rates are a full percentage point below ontario s nominal gdp growth in 2016 and 2017 and as much as two percentage points lower than the rate decades ago slower projected nominal gdp growth means less money to support existing and new programs voters generally expect public spending to grow year after year on priority programs health care leads the way representing 40 per cent or more of provincial outlays the political pressure to spend on health care refuses to abate making it hard to find significant savings there in ontario health care made up 41 6 per cent of program spending in 2017 18 any attempt to sharply slow the growth rate of health spending or cut specific programs risks a battle for the hearts and minds of the public between health care advocates and medical professionals on one side and provincial governments representing taxpayers on the other demographic forces too are weighing on health spending the share of public sector health care dollars spent on canadian seniors has increased only marginally so far even as the share of seniors in the population keeps growing but an aging population will inevitably mean future spending pressures provincial decision makers will be challenged to balance access to quality care for older canadians with the cost to the public purse if deep cuts to health care funding are politically risky what else can provincial governments do education infrastructure and economic development are other big ticket items where controlling spending may be a bit easier politically although budget freezes or cuts could affect the long term productive capacity of the provincial economy as a result social programs often absorb a disproportionate share of any cutting exercise and cuts there can and do affect the most vulnerable fiscal circumstances differ by province only a few notably quebec and british columbia have succeeded in balancing the books and reducing their debt each province will need a credible strategy for managing its fiscal position in a world of slower growth in some cases serious fiscal surgery spending reductions as well as finding ways to increase revenue may be necessary alberta s new government is facing tough choices after its election promise to balance the books by 2022 an expert panel has been created and all options including raising more revenue may need to be on the table to deliver fiscal balance as planned and to avoid slippage for its part ontario is now in its second decade of continuous deficit spending the public debt ratio has increased from 24 per cent in 2007 08 to about 40 per cent today and it has still not plateaued the recent downgrade of ontario s credit rating by moody s is a clear signal that financial markets are not endorsing the ford government s five year plan to balance the books in a world of slower growth delays in addressing deficits and debt accomplish little and can even make the problem worse clear eyed level headed provincial fiscal management has never been more important

swift s latin american regional conference larc explored how banks in the region are looking to increase digitisation while managing cyber and compliance challenges ignacio blanco head of latin america the caribbean at swift opened larc by noting that customer demands from financial services have rapidly increased in the digital world with organisations operating in a world that is hyper connected financial institutions need to evolve from market leaders to digital leaders he said this was supported by an audience poll that asked delegates to think about the main driver for digital transformation in their organisation with business model adaptation 32 and meeting customer expectations 31 being selected as the key drivers accelerating digital transformation as to how banks are approaching this challenge kartikeya swami associate partner at mckinsey company described how they are deploying systems and tools to drive products with an agile test and learn approach developing solutions and getting them out to customers for testing as quickly as possible taking on feedback updating the solution and sending it out for more feedback thinking about what it takes to successfully support the acceleration of digital transformation christopher mager ctp managing director digital office at bny mellon treasury services said that two years ago his institution had moved to pursue a more centralised strategy by creating an enterprise level digital group their clients often hold relationships with a number of the bank s businesses across the world he said so this enterprise view was helpful to provide a seamless approach as part of this process bny mellon created a digital council that has representatives from all the different business groups and key stakeholders while each business within the group should prioritise its own developments there are certain functions that every business undertakes such as onboarding clients or providing reporting for example this is where the digital council and enterprise approach has its focus mager said helping the business structure its data across the enterprise and avoiding duplicating costs kasif wadiwala associate partner at deloitte consulting reinforced the point that financial institutions need a bank wide digital strategy in order to bring all businesses along on the digitisation journey at the same time he added that banks need to understand what their business process rules are and how they manage technological investments before jumping into digitisation projects commenting on his own bank george doolittle executive vice president and head of global payments services corporate investment banking at wells fargo said they realised they had centralised innovation too much and needed to get the various business lines more involved in the process the business lines have the customer connection which is key in developing solutions that actually solve customer needs when it comes to payments for example customers want a fast effective and secure experience this point was raised by beatriz quevedo uman a regional head of client management global liquidity and cash management latin america for hsbc who noted that this need is the same for consumers and businesses alike mo nica garci a luzio vice president of finance at banco bisa added that corporates need more information around their payments which is why her bank had added support for swift gpi last year a question from the audience on day 1 of larc asked about how banks can go about balancing digital innovation with cyber security and regulatory requirements bny mellon s mager responded by saying that his team works closely with business partners on the digital council so that legal and compliance teams at the bank have an input on the bank s innovations it is important to get all key stakeholders on board before investing in and working on innovation in order to address any particular issues before time and resources are spent on a project facing cyber challenges the threat that banks face from cyber criminals was highlighted by swami who commented that 25 7 of all malware attacks in 2018 hit banks and other financial services organisations cyber actors will attempt to infiltrate a local system via a phishing attack a compromised security token or similar pat antonacci head of customer experience at swift explained they would then look to move large volumes of funds over weekends or holidays for example while banks smartened up to this approach and would monitor for these sorts of attacks fraudsters will now try to withdraw smaller but more numerous amounts during weekdays julian dana director of latin america for mandiant at fireeye made the point that advanced persistent threats apts are one group of cyber actors to pay particular attention to today these groups can often be government sponsored apts from countries such as north korea have evolved he noted from acting like hacktivists to now looking for financial gain as a way around economic sanctions ransomware like wannacry is an example of this apts have local contacts to support attacks who can help with reverse engineering to generate an insider threat adam bulava executive director of attack simulation with jp morgan added that the us financial sector has developed cyber response guides across the community to help address cyber threats the more that banks run through these eventualities the better they will be able to respond to a real attack the human element in combating cyber crime was highlighted by carmen zegarra digital crimes unit attorney for microsoft she said that people may have their password underneath their keyboard use basic passwords or use the same password on their company computer that they use on their mobile phone she stressed that organisation wide education is critical to build awareness nine out of ten people will click on a phishing link so the business needs to understand that fighting cyber crime is everyone s responsibility bulava said that jp morgan regularly carries out phishing tests across all of their employees in a move designed to further awareness and to protect the business he added that the bank has a red team of ethical hackers who will attack the bank s environment to try and gain access to data or accounts this can highlight where previously unknown vulnerabilities exist in the bank s infrastructure delegates had a chance to see skylar simmons from swift s own red team carry out a live hack on the second day of larc 2019 simmons showed how a methodical approach could allow a hacker to find a bank s ip address relatively easily see which ports of the bank s ip addresses are open and target the information they could uncover to quickly gain access to the bank s servers using a variety of tools that are easily available online in the hack simmons was able to download sensitive files from the bank s server he also found that the bank had written its own programme to send mt103 messages without using swift interfaces while the system was set up to only allow authorised users to send payment messages having compromised the system the hacker can start checking what security measures exist and bypass these quickly sending tens of millions of dollars to his own accounts the speed at which simmons was able to demonstrate a hacker s attempt to gain access to a bank s core systems provided plenty of food for thought for attending delegates keeping up with compliance as well as balancing an innovative digital agenda with managing the cyber threats banks also need to be able to keep up with the compliance demands they face speaking to this point on the second day of larc sandra depoalo managing director and global head of aml with bny mellon said that the compliance team needs to engage with the business team in a bank to understand new clients before the onboarding process begins she said that aml compliance in the bank could call a similar person in the potential client organisation at the start of this process for example depoalo added that it is important to find out if correspondent banks have similar controls in place if a bank is making repeated requests for information that go unanswered from its correspondent red flags can be quickly raised maristella aldana sanin chief compliance officer at bancolombia agreed with the need for compliance to be close to the business compliance programmes need to be reviewed on a regular basis to ensure they share the ethical principles of the organisation as well as the regulatory rules in compliance she added that they are also trying to improve the customer experience by being as agile and efficient as possible by using new technologies such as bots to scan for suspicious operations and comparing customers with a pool of peers for example corporate governance is critical to ensuring that compliance is understood across the whole organisation carlos e troetsch partner and executive vice president at mmg bank president of felaban said that this allows institutions to be proactive rather than reactive and it should be integrated into a bank s risk programme speaking to different banks in other regions also helps support the understanding of compliance in a bank beneficial ownership was named as the biggest compliance challenge globally by james h freis jr chief compliance officer and managing director at deutsche bo rse group the question is who is behind the corporate entity he said what is the nature of the corporate business and where are the funds coming from while it can be difficult to address beneficial ownership freis said that if it is done right it could create a level playing field across all countries collaboration and innovation to create common standards such as the swift kyc registry help in this regard he added regional considerations the issue of corruption and compliance is clearly top of mind for financial institutions in latin america a poll of delegates showed 69 believe that the biggest concern for latin america today is corruption and its impact on foreign direct investment fdi claudio irigoyen managing director head of latin america economics and foreign exchange fixed income strategy at bank of america merrill lynch commented that this issue has certainly been very important in different national elections in latin america in the past couple of years he did add however that the elephant in the room with regard to fdi is the possibility of us china trade wars on that topic humberto lo pez director of strategy and operations for latin america with the world bank observed a split in latin america noting how the northern part of the region looks to the us while the southern part of region looks to china he added that interest rates in the us could be a concern for companies in latin america with high levels of debt looking at where opportunities exist in the continent irigoyen mentioned brazil saying that expectations have adjusted significantly since the most recent presidential election with the reform bill in brazil expected to be passed by q3 2019 and additionally a market friendly government being elected in argentina there are good economic news stories in the region he said margaret myers director of the asia latin america program inter american dialogue highlighted softbank s us 5bn technology growth fund for start ups which could help to promote growth in the region she added that the advancement of 5g across the region offered the prospect of development in industries such as agriculture and mining in closing larc 2019 swift s ignacio blanco drew attention to the variety of opportunities for banks to accelerate digital transformation in latin america that had been discussed at the conference he concluded by saying that this transformation needs collaboration and it is critical that institutions foster a culture that supports this

u s futures european shares rebound asian stocks take a hit from fresh trade salvos yields pare losses curve inversion eases after sending key recession signal u s indices top out utilities underperform key events equities in europe followed u s futures higher this morning against a falling asian session as treasury yields pared losses after dipping to the lowest level in 20 months on wednesday deepening a key component of the yield curve that historically heralds a recession 18 months down the line contracts on the and climbed for seven straight hours though the presumed bearish counterforce within a downtrend suggests this is merely a technical pullback rather than a bottom the advanced with energy companies tracking oil prices which also edged higher for seven hours this morning the pan european gauge is climbing back above the neckline of a h s top after closing slightly below it yesterday the european oil benchmark however has hit resistance levels from tuesday and is set to form its first red candle of the current rally in the earlier asian session most regional indices tracked yesterday s u s decline as the u s china trade war intensified with high level chinese officials of naked economic terrorism the trade led selloff finally caught up with hong kong s 0 44 china s 0 30 and japan s 0 29 while south korea s 0 77 was the only major benchmark to close in the green as bargain hunters bought a dip that reached 10 since mid april global financial affairs on wednesday u s equities slipped to a 12 week low the extended its decline by 0 69 with all sectors but 0 02 which barely managed to cling onto gains closing in the red it s ironic that the most export reliant sector outperformed amid a worsening trade outlook though the basic materials sector should not be confused with what would be at the heart of china s threat to withhold rare earth metals perhaps in the panic of the herd investors bid up the sector simply because of its name it s even more noteworthy that defensive stocks in 1 33 underperformed for the second day in a row instead of outperforming on risk off moreover the recent shift in the from hiking to pausing or even cutting rates means falling yields become less attractive and should thereby push conservative investors into bond proxy sectors like this perhaps however investors expect yields to keep falling so they rush to grab what they consider a bargain at the current rates another explanation may be that the sector s underperformance is driven by profit taking after it hit an all time high on friday technically the price fell back into a declining range after breaking to the topside two weeks ago overall the spx crossed below the 200 dma as did the stressing the importance of the trendline however the price bounced back for both indices demonstrating enough traders defended the milestone to push it back up a bullish signal in doing so the s p 500 formed a hammer another bullish sign having said that the benchmark still closed below the 2 800 level a support and resistance level whose violation suggests bears outweighed bulls as it completed a h s therefore while we expect a pickup after the recent selloff projected in these technical indicators the medium term trend has likely reversed which makes it a short lived climb still considering its penetration is less than 1 5 investors should beware of a bear trap the tumbled 0 87 also completing a h s top as well as closing well below the 200 dma after having completed a bearish pennant finished off with a falling breakaway gap the price however closed off its lows showing some support which might turn into a return move the nasdaq dropped 0 79 to its h s top the tech heavy gauge also found support by the 200 dma as well as the 7 500 round psychological level the gave up 0 82 we have talked a lot about the market structure inconsistency of small cap shares sliding rather than surging on a dismal trade outlook and a strengthening dollar which should favor stocks of domestic companies that don t rely on foreign markets for growth however we consider that this small cap selloff may be typical of a market top when investors first dump speculative stocks while still holding on to more conservative portfolios meanwhile from a technical perspective the index note of caution while all four major u s indices topped out it s not uncommon for a pattern to reverse or at least whipsaw even heavily therefore we urge even aggressive traders to be prudent using both price and time filters to reduce the odds of bear traps meanwhile the yield on treasurys closed at 2 262 yesterday after hitting 2 21 the lowest level since sep 15 2017 the move formed a powerful hammer due to its unusually long lower shadow reeling in treasury buyers who were perhaps too late for the party wednesday s trading pattern gives a good visual on how closely linked treasurys and equities are the spx and the nasdaq both formed hammers and the dow and russell began to pare losses at the same time as treasury yields did as investors backpedaled into stocks while the hammer in yields suggest a bounce in mirror image of that in equities it is expected to be temporary at least from a technical perspective as trading mechanisms and market psychology exacerbate crowd psychology not only did 10 year yields plunge as investors rotated out of risk assets into safe haven securities this added another layer of pessimism on growth their inverted curve to treasury bills widened to the deepest level since 2007 before the 2008 crash many investors and economists believe the yield curve is sending a warning about economic growth in the united states and the world under normal market conditions those who buy debt

with joanie greve and mariana alfaro with joanie greve and mariana alfaro the big idea ken starr he is not president trump does not appreciate it but he may have lucked out that it was bob mueller who investigated him the president attacked mueller on twitter this morning as highly conflicted and claimed that the special counsel would have brought charges if he had anything but there were no charges to bring in fact the former fbi director emphasized during his nine minute speech at the justice department on wednesday that he felt hidebound by an opinion from the office of legal counsel that sitting presidents cannot be indicted he added that he was also guided by the principles of fairness it would be unfair to potentially accuse somebody of a crime when there can be no court resolution of an actual charge the special counsel said in his first public comments since being appointed two years ago if we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime we would have said so advertisement since filing their detailed report mueller and his team have been frustrated by what they perceive as a lack of understanding even among lawmakers about doj guidelines under that policy mueller and his team also think it would be improper for mueller to say that the president would be charged with obstruction were it not for the justice department policy because saying that would amount to a criminal accusation against the president matt zapotosky and devlin barrett report mueller s team came to believe that making any sort of impeachment referral to congress also would fall under the category of accusing the president of a crime according to people familiar with their discussions for those reasons mueller has been guarded and wants to avoid being drawn into a back and forth in congressional testimony that could be tantamount to accusing the president of a crime starr opened his report by advocating for bill clinton s impeachment there is substantial and credible information supporting the following eleven possible grounds for impeachment he wrote a republican investigating a democratic president starr was assisted by a retinue of known anti clinton partisans including a young brett kavanaugh starr testified before the house judiciary committee in 1998 mueller a registered republican has no desire to play along with house democrats who want him to be the star witness of a televised hearing in fact the primary goal of his remarks on wednesday appeared to be obviating the need to appear before congress the report is my testimony mueller said adding that he s resigning from the justice department and returning to private life i hope and expect this to be the only time that i will speak to you in this manner if compelled to appear mueller emphasized that he would not go beyond what s in the report we chose those words carefully and the work speaks for itself he said advertisement this is a blow for democrats who are now struggling internally with how aggressively to pursue mueller s testimony as a house democratic leadership aide put it to rachael bade there are tons of benefits to the visual to animate and dramatize the report elevates public awareness of it during his investigation mueller opted not to force a legal confrontation with trump to secure an in person interview the special counsel agreed to accept written answers that he knew could be vetted carefully by lawyers and he accepted the president s refusal to engage on questions related to obstruction of justice other prosecutors also might have felt more compelled to vocally defend their integrity as well as the government lawyers who work for them trump has repeatedly sought to cast doubt on the integrity of mueller s probe characterizing it once again this morning as both a witch hunt and the greatest presidential harassment in history mueller nodded only briefly yesterday to the professionalism of the career civil servants who assisted him he did not directly push back against trump s two years of attempts to delegitimize and politicize his investigation instead he seems content to let the final product speak for itself advertisement mueller is at the end of his career the vietnam veteran on what s clearly his final tour of duty in government didn t need a platform to make a name for himself the 74 year old was the adult in the room explains marc fisher he delivered his message in the way he has conducted his career by the book in a code designed to inform rather than inflame anyone expecting the special counsel to let his hair down and speak from the heart about what he really thought of trump did not know who mueller is a decorated marine a career prosecutor who wears a white shirt to work every day mueller rose through the government and became fbi director and a valued adviser to presidents of both parties not by speaking his mind but by proving his reserve until now mueller had played the role of the sphinx of the capital when he finally spoke mueller did so in a voice thinned by age but strong in its controlled rectitude after mueller finished a reporter tried to elicit something beyond the written statement but the special counsel said no questions turned and strode out of the room special counsel robert s mueller iii on may 29 said it would be unfair to accuse president trump of a crime since he could not be charged with a crime video the washington post photo salwan georges the washington post first in the 202 republicans for the rule of law an initiative spearheaded by lifelong conservatives who are critical of trump has produced a five minute testimonial video with three former federal prosecutors who are registered republicans discussing how if trump was not president they believe he would have been charged with obstruction of justice based on the information in the mueller report advertisement the video features donald ayer paul rosenzweig and jeffrey harris ayer served as the deputy attorney general under president george h w bush rosenzweig was a senior counsel to starr and deputy assistant secretary for policy at the department of homeland security under george w bush harris served as deputy associate attorney general under ronald reagan and was a principal assistant to rudy giuliani when he was in the justice department the three are among the more than 1 000 former prosecutors who have signed onto a statement asserting that mueller s findings would have produced obstruction charges against trump if he wasn t the president these veterans of the reagan and bush administrations are reminding us that the law applies the same to everyone even the president said chris truax a spokesman for republicans for the rule of law which produced the video in partnership with protect democracy a nonprofit whose charge is to hold the executive branch accountable republicans and all americans need to listen watch the video here advertisement wednesday s press conference was consistent with a persona that frustrates anti trump partisans who dreamed of as an avenging superhero former federal prosecutor ken white writes in the atlantic mueller is a man out of time this is the age of alternatively factual tweets and sound bites he s a by the book throwback who expects americans to read and absorb carefully worded 400 page reports has he met us actor robert de niro who has played mueller on saturday night live pleads with the special counsel to testify before congress in an op ed for today s new york times i know you re as uncomfortable in the spotlight as the president is out of it de niro writes i know you don t want to become part of the political spectacle i understand why you d want to do it away from the public glare but the country needs to hear your voice your actual voice and not just because you don t want them to think that your actual voice sounds like robert de niro reading from cue cards but because this is the report your country asked you to do and now you must give it authority and clarity without if i may use the term obstruction special counsel robert s mueller iii on may 29 said his office could not reach a conclusion on obstruction of justice due to department of justice policy video the washington post photo salwan georges the washington post here are five other takeaways from the speech advertisement 1 mueller emphasized how hard he leaned on opinions from the olc that were released to protect presidents during past crises and that have not been tested in the courts the special counsel s office is part of the department of justice and by regulation it was bound by that department policy charging the president with a crime was therefore not an option we could consider he said the opinions written in 1973 when president richard m nixon faced the watergate investigation and then in 2000 following the starr inquiry into clinton s behavior concluded that initiating criminal proceedings against a sitting president would interfere with the unique constitutional responsibilities of the nation s chief executive rosalind helderman reports mueller cited the 2000 opinion on the first page of the volume of his report explaining his office s approach to assessing whether trump committed obstruction of justice mueller s view that department policy and issues of fairness prevented him from even assessing whether the president broke the law took some constitutional scholars and justice department veterans by surprise even senior justice department officials did not appear aware of mueller s interpretation until he was finalizing his report advertisement the fact that a president cannot be prosecuted does not foreclose a finding by a special counsel of whether a president committed a crime said j michael luttig a former federal appeals court judge who served in the office of legal counsel from 1989 to 1991 the opinions are not nearly as clear as people suggest they are said jonathan turley a law professor at george washington university who said there has been a long standing dispute about whether the constitution truly prohibits the president s indictment 2 mueller s statement highlighted key differences he has with bill barr over the facts and the law mueller said he would have said so if he had confidence the president clearly did not commit a crime but the attorney general announced in march that he had determined trump didn t commit the crime of obstruction of justice based on his review of the special counsel s report on wednesday mueller said there was insufficient evidence to show a conspiracy among trump associates or americans to aid russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 election when barr announced mueller s findings he said there was no evidence to show any such conspiracy barrett notes asked about his disagreements with mueller barr has made a point of emphasizing that when the two men met privately on march 5 to discuss the findings mueller said he would not claim the president would have been charged with a crime if he weren t the president rep adam b schiff d calif chairman of the house intelligence committee called mueller s comments wednesday a direct rebuke of the attorney general s statements spokesmen for mueller and barr said wednesday evening that the two men s statements about the olc memo are not in conflict advertisement trump has repeatedly praised barr to white house aides and friends saying he has defended him and proved to be a real attorney general per josh dawsey trump gave positive reviews to barr s congressional testimony his news conference before the report and his public comments white house officials said the president was pleased that mueller does not want to testify an aide said barr is on a four day trip to alaska to focus on public safety problems facing the native population he declined to answer questions from reporters there about mueller s remarks president trump denied the special counsel s conclusion that russia influenced the 2016 election saying i got me elected video the washington post 3 mueller really wants americans to read both volumes of his 448 page report the obstruction evidence in volume ii has received the lion s share of coverage but the special counsel emphasized russia s interference in the 2016 election which he outlines in volume i that allegation deserves the attention of every american mueller said russian intelligence officers who are part of the russian military launched a concerted attack on our political system he added they used sophisticated cyber techniques to hack into computers and networks used by the clinton campaign they stole private information and then released that information through fake online identities and through the organization wikileaks the releases were designed and timed to interfere with our election and to damage a presidential candidate this comment is notable because trump has so often downplayed the kremlin s efforts russia russia russia that s all you heard at the beginning of this witch hunt hoax the president tweeted this morning and now russia has disappeared because i had nothing to do with russia helping me to get elected it was a crime that didn t exist if our country s political health were better the russian attack would get the attention of every american but mueller gives us more credit than we deserve writes columnist dana milbank his report assumed that our leaders would take seriously the russian threat when presented with overwhelming evidence instead trump laughs about the whole thing with putin republican leaders quash bipartisan efforts to protect the 2020 election from another attack and gop lawmakers instead of pondering the president s culpability and mueller s damning findings demand investigations of investigators treason and attempted coup in appealing to their better angels mueller was naive yet even wednesday as he entered the justice department briefing room stooped and alone he continued to act as though things were on the level russia is preparing to attack us again trump is poised to benefit again unlike in 2016 we now know russia s bad intentions thanks to mueller house speaker nancy pelosi d calif deflected on a question about impeachment saying most democrats are on a path of finding more information video the washington post 4 mueller s statement increases pressure on nancy pelosi to begin impeachment proceedings at least two house democratic chairmen bennie thompson miss of the homeland security committee and jim mcgovern mass of the rules committee joined the impeachment push for the first time yesterday that means 40 house democrats plus rep justin amash r mich are on the record in support of at least opening an impeachment inquiry jm rieger and amber phillips are keeping a running whip count here s an alphabetical list on wednesday pelosi responded to the latest clamor by pointing to democratic victories in the courts to justify a more measured approach bade and karoun demirjian report pelosi has argued privately and publicly that even if the house voted to impeach trump the outcome was preordained in the republican led senate where she said no gop member would vote to convict the president that would give trump an opportunity to claim vindication twice by mueller and by congress pelosi bemoaned the news coverage arguing that pro impeachment democrats received far more attention than some 200 members of the house democratic caucus who do not support such a step house judiciary committee chairman jerrold nadler d n y who has stopped short of advocating for impeachment in public but has privately pushed pelosi to allow an inquiry to begin said congress must act nothing is off the table but we do want to make such a compelling case such an ironclad case that even the republican senate will be convinced of the path that we have to take as a country pelosi said in california many constituents want to impeach the president but we want to do what is right and what gets results there continue to be no real cracks in republican congressional support for trump beyond amash tribalism helps trump congressional republicans with one exception largely backed up the president the chyron on fox news minimized mueller s findings the same way barr did with his initial four page letter mueller there was insufficient evidence to charge broader conspiracy william cohen a former republican congressman senator and defense

republicans today in the face of presidential behavior that is unacceptable by any reasonable standard is both striking and deeply disappointing cohen writes when one talks privately to some republican members they express their disdain and even alarm at how he conducts the nation s affairs yet the same members are reluctant to speak out publicly even in the face of behavior they would find intolerable by any previous occupant of the oval office fear is a potent weapon house judiciary committee chairman jerrold nadler d n y on may 29 spoke about special counsel robert s mueller iii

routine annual investigation of the clinic in march and found numerous violations of state laws the planned parenthood facility in st louis will get its annual license if it addresses the state s

calculating the cost of tariffs and where those costs may appear the longer term consequences however are harder to model from the new york times s neil irwin if there is a slowdown in the chinese economy that causes its demand for oil and other commodities to fall american makers of those commodities could face pain over and above that caused by tariffs directly falling global commodity prices

airport were doing their best to be on time even if their best was different from my own superior best why would anyone look at an experience as expensive and anxiety inducing as flying and want to make it a little bit riskier some chronically late people do of course intend to be on time but a smaller group of frequent fliers heads into air travel with lateness as the goal relishing the thrill of snatching victory from the jaws of defeat i just really live for the feeling of literally running through the airport barefoot because you didn t have time to put your shoes on after security and

from the action factual errors that mar the author s credibility and sourcing that is so opaque it renders the scoops highly suspicious and unreliable in siege the dead arrive at bannon s doorstep in

congressman on the premise that his social media posts were funny making fun of brown people and criminalizing them it s not a joke dehumanizing the mexican culture is not a joke said russell according to video of the event posted on king s facebook page if we presume that every culture is equal and has an equal amount to contribute to our civilization then we re devaluing the

reading time 4 minutes on his 100th day as president evo morales sent the military to occupy bolivia s oil and gas fields in a bid to nationalize reserves of its most important resource it was a dramatic statement that captured attention in bolivia and beyond a decade later morales is adopting a more pragmatic approach there s little fanfare this time but it s getting attention where it counts among foreign firms eager to tap into the country s vast unexplored reserves there is significant gas potential in bolivia but it hasn t been explored mainly due to operators perception of country risk said will holland the cfo of echo energy an independent british oil explorer that signed a deal for an 80 percent stake in a 75 square kilometer block in southern bolivia a single well can produce 150 billion cubic feet of gas he told aq you won t find that in many places in the world echo energy s deal wasn t the first in this new wave of interest in the past two years a number of international oil majors including petrobras and gazprom have announced multi billion dollar investments in bolivian gas exploration projects but echo energy s deal while much smaller suggests bolivia s investment environment has become safe enough to attract smaller independent firms without political cover this would represent a new era of investment said sergio guzman an analyst for political risk consultancy control risks to date most investment in the sector has come from state oil companies and majors from friendly nations such as russia argentina and spain which benefit from privileged diplomatic relations said guzman the entrance of echo energy shows that there are independent firms with the risk appetite to work in bolivia examples of how political risk and poor government administration can hamper natural resource exploration abound in latin america venezuela s current economic collapse has its roots in the epic mismanagement of the world s largest petroleum reserves by the state run oil firm brazil s state oil firm petrobras is the epicenter of the continent s largest ever corruption investigation in mexico oil production has been in steady decline since 2004 while pemex has racked up huge debts due to poor investment decisions and excessive government interference in countries more open to foreign investment such as colombia and peru critics often argue that oil and mining projects are sold off too cheaply with foreign firms profiting disproportionately with limited benefits to the local economy bolivia under morales is different historically the country s gas reserves the second largest in south america have been a source of conflict in the 1930s the country fought a war with paraguay over the chaco scrublands thought to be rich in hydrocarbons in the early 2000s the growth of the gas industry in the eastern lowland city of santa cruz provoked a separatist movement since morales election however the bolivian national gas industry has been used to fuel growth and improve social conditions according to roberto calzadilla bolivia s ambassador to the uk government revenues from hydrocarbons have grown from around 500 million per year in 2006 to 6 billion by 2016 this bonanza has rippled throughout the economy annual gdp growth has hovered around 5 percent since 2010 while extreme poverty has halved from 36 percent of the population to 17 percent according to world bank data the nationalization of the gas industry has changed the country lifting two million bolivians into the middle class said calzadilla despite complaining bitterly about nationalization most oil companies remained in country and simply adjusted to less profitable contracts the morales government has also slowly paid 828 million in compensation to firms nationalized across a range of business sectors around 24 percent of the amount demanded by companies initially now bolivia is at an important crossroads morales is interested in building on existing industry to become an energy hub to the southern cone exporting gas and electricity to brazil and argentina to that end the national hydrocarbons company ypfb has announced a ten year 30 billion investment plan aimed at building pipelines power generation plants and downstream projects such as ammonia plants and gas liquids separation projects to extract added value from gas reserves to provide the feedstock for these projects the ministry of energy is planning to increase its proven gas reserves from 10 5 trillion cubic feet in 2016 to 18 trillion cubic feet in 2025 but while ypfb was reorganized since the nationalization and has become an efficient distributor it still lacks the financial muscle and expertize for expensive and risky exploration projects guzman said expanding capacity would require foreign investment foreign cash and know how and attracting this kind of foreign investment would in turn require greater incentives and guarantees that is echo energy s big bet if bolivia wants to fulfill its potential as a major energy producer it will need to make it more attractive to develop marginal fields said holland echo energy is positioning itself for that eventuality there are signs that a broader regional shift is underway since oil and metal prices began falling in 2014 some latin american countries governed over the last decade by leftist governments have dramatically changed tack on foreign investment in resource projects ecuador and nicaragua still ruled by left wing parties have sought mining investment as a way to attract foreign currency inflows in argentina the macri government has offered shale gas operators a guaranteed buy price to stimulate development of the country s huge vaca muerta basin bolivia can afford to do this incrementally it stashed enough gas revenues away during the boom years to soften the effects of the commodity slump it also maintains state control over a number of strategic assets although even there its tough stance appears to be softening on the wall of calzadilla s office is a framed photo of bolivia s iconic salar de uyuni salt flat in the foreground the word litio has been carved into the salt bolivia contains the world s largest reserves of lithium the in demand metal used in phone batteries electric cars and more the government has pledged to keep its nascent lithium industry under national mining firm comibol developing its resources with foreign firms with the aim of exporting 5 000 tons of lithium cathodes by 2021 but this year for the first time under morales bolivia showcased its mining opportunities at pdac 2017 the world s largest mining conference all this indicates that bolivia might be loosening its strictures on foreign presence in key industries but is keeping its priorities in place interested parties can benefit from greater participation but should respect the firm line the morales government has taken with respect to the state s sovereignty over natural resources said calzadilla we work with partners not patrons he said youkee is an independent journalist and analyst based in bogotá follow him on twitter matyoukee
staff writer wilmington starnews water solution editor as i keep getting texts from the county telling me to conserve water because we don t have enough i can t help but see the irony of millions of gallons of polluted water passing by in the cape fear and two years into this crisis we are no closer to clean water leland is finally on board with the ro plant but wants to own and operate it belville fears that leland has delusions of grandeur and wants to own everything including belville here s my solution and i hope it gets serious consideration belville turns the assets back over to h2go when a newly named water authority is formed from the old h2go with the new entity being separate from any specific town for want of a better name let s call it the bel le na water authority it s regional which has always been one of the arguments the board would have two members from each town so that there is no fear of one taking it over and all would have water from the ro plant then we could finally get started on the ro plant that will bring the northern part of brunswick county clean contaminate free water this issue is too important to keep getting kicked down the road we need clean water now sandra ford leland price of tax cuts editor this past weekend cal thomas did an op ed piece in sn on the national debt showing how so called entitlements are the main cause first of all we paid into social security and medicare all of our working lives so please stop using the gop term entitlement for something we paid for today s national debt is 22 trillion and rising faster in 2018 with a total of 779 billion in 2018 trump tax cuts cost 164 billion the bush tax cuts cost 448 billion wars cost 127 billion and increased defense spending was 156 billion simply put the 2 wars we still are fighting after 15 years post 9 11 defense buildup massive tax cuts for the rich and corporations the deficit would be a surplus the total tax cuts of presidents regan both bush s and now trump represent over 50 of the total deficit of 22 trillion also we have spent a total of 6 trillion dollars in iraq and afghanistan with no end in sight if we had not done the tax cuts and the wars and overspent on the military we would not have a deficit you can blame the middle class and the poor for those entitlements but the real culprit is the gop leadership john lauer southport editor s note an entitlement as a type of federal spending is a government program in which recipients automatically receive benefits that they re eligible for based on the applicable legislation social security is an entitlement because everyone who meets the eligibility criteria is entitled to a benefit by comparison section 8 housing vouchers are a government program that is not an entitlement this doesn t have anything to do with whether or not it s a welfare program but simply because congress appropriates a certain sum of money for the program regardless of whether it s enough to give benefits to everyone who meets the eligibility criteria rabon s power failure editor to use baseball as a metaphor for politics senator bill rabon has thrown us some curveballs in the past the latest is his controversial senate bill 559 demanded and largely written by duke energy for multiyear rate increases duke energy contributed 10 000 to rabon s campaign fund for his pivotal role in advancing the bill thanks to rabon s support of senate bill 559 duke energy can increase electricity rates for homes and businesses for five years avoid the traditional annual reviews for rate hikes will receive huge windfall profits worth hundreds of millions of dollars every year use our tax money to pay for their millions of tons of coal ash cleanup and other coal combustion byproducts mistakes have a negative effect on recruiting new industry to north carolina thanks to multiyear increases senator rabon heard the call from duke energy swing batter batter and he delivered a grand slam giving the homerun to duke energy who pays little to no federal tax on billions in profits is like the billionaire baseball team owner getting taxpayers to foot the bill for stadiums david sink leland school reparations editor if democrats are sincere in their talk about funding reparations their best avenue is the tax free school choice voucher charter private schools have demonstrated their ability to lift black and other minority students out of the public school education ghetto democrats need to embrace opening more charter schools providing vouchers to the tens of thousands on waiting lists it is time the public school teacher unions and democrats stop playing politics jim mulligan wilmington starnew falls short editor two calls i asking me to subscribe to the starnews and two stories whose treatment convinces me not to first a shockingly thin story on the wpd chief s plea to demolish creekwood and houston moore not a new idea chicago how d that work no context background or other voices no hint of coverage to come how is a forced relocation of thousands done fairly what are the consequences what do politicians and community leaders say what s the record from elsewhere second a page one over the fold jump about new flower baskets for front street two photos we learn that our lampposts are sturdy petunias don t like heat and wdi s director worries that flowers need watering seriously who makes these editorial decisions about scope and placement time and again my jaw drops over yet another story choice like the above where safe and happy overshadow news that matters where a true page one story brunswick schools offering free breakfast and lunch to all gets buried it s a pattern and a disappointment i appreciate your constrained resources but that s more reason to focus on what makes newspapers important still robert oppedisano wilmington defending habitat editor a recent letter titled a forgotten american expressed the writer s feeling that no one is looking out for him he is entitled to his opinions and feelings however in his list of grievances he stated habitat for humanity did not build my home as a cape fear habitat for humanity volunteer for 10 years i must respond to his use of this outstanding community agency in such a negative way cfhfh has a dedicated staff hundreds of volunteers and 30 year history of providing low cost housing to deserving families cfhfh does not give houses away participating families complete up to 400 hours of sweat equity save for a down payment and make monthly mortgage payments currently cfhfh has taken on a new role of restoring houses for individuals displaced due to hurricane florence as a member of the board of directors of this wonderful organization i see firsthand the hard work of the staff and many volunteers and the generosity of the community through donations i suggest before the writer of that letter uses such a fine group of people in such an offhand and derogatory way he investigate its history accomplishments and value to the cape fear area michael zentmeyer wilmington invasive government editor today yet another state missouri passed an anti abortion bill another example of republican hypocrisy yes human life is sacred but doesn t that include the lives of those women who decide that they just cannot raise a child at this particular time and if all human life is sacred why do so many anti abortionists support capital punishment don t get me wrong i support capital punishment very much so but it is hypocritical to rail against the taking of one life while advocating the taking of another republicans used to say government is too invasive get the government off the backs of the people fine let s start by keeping the government out of our bedrooms and hospital rooms paul stutz leland
