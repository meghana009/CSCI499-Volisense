moscow the past year was full of events that inevitably split the global geopolitical space into two camps those who still support using us currency as a universal financial tool and those who are turning their back on the greenback global tensions caused by economic sanctions and trade conflicts triggered by washington have forced targeted countries to take a fresh look at alternative payment systems currently dominated by the us dollar rt has taken a deeper look into the recent phenomena of de dollarization summing up which countries have taken steps towards eliminating their reliance on the greenback and the reasons behind their decision china the ongoing trade conflict between the united states and china as well as sanctions against beijing s biggest trading partners have forced china to take steps towards relieving the dollar dependence of the world s second largest economy in beijing s signature soft power style the government hasn t made any loud announcements on the issue however the people s bank of china has been regularly reducing the country s share of us treasuries still the number one foreign holder of the us sovereign debt china has cut its share to the lowest level since may 2017 moreover instead of promptly dumping the greenback china is trying to internationalize its own currency the yuan which was included in the imf basket alongside the us dollar the japanese yen the euro and the british pound beijing has recently made several steps towards strengthening the yuan including accumulating gold reserves launching yuan priced crude futures and using the currency in trade with international partners as part of its ambitious belt and road initiative china is planning to introduce swap facilities in participating countries to promote the use of the yuan moreover the country is actively pushing for a free trade agreement called the regional comprehensive economic partnership rcep which will include the countries of southeast asia the trade pact could easily replace the trans pacific partnership tpp the proposed multi national trade deal which was torn up by us president donald trump shortly after he took office rcep includes 16 country signatories and the potential pact is expected to form a union of nearly 3 4 billion people based on a combined 49 5 trillion economy which accounts for nearly 40 percent of the world s gdp india ranked the world s sixth largest economy india is one of the biggest merchandise importers it s not surprising that the country is directly affected by most global geopolitical conflicts and is significantly impacted by sanctions applied to its trading partners earlier this year delhi switched to ruble payments on supplies of russian s 400 air defense systems as a result of us economic penalties introduced against moscow the country also had to switch to the rupee in purchases of iranian crude after washington reinstituted sanctions against tehran in december india and the united arab emirates sealed a currency swap agreement to boost trade and investment without the involvement of a third currency taking into account that india is the third largest country by purchasing power parity steps of this kind could considerably diminish the role of the greenback in global trading turkey earlier this year turkish president recep tayyip erdogan announced plans to end the us dollar monopoly via a new policy that is aimed at non dollar trading with the country s international partners later turkey s leader announced that ankara is preparing to conduct trade through national currencies with china russia and ukraine turkey also discussed a possible replacement of the us dollar with national currencies in trade transactions with iran the move was prompted by political and economic reasons relations between ankara and washington have been deteriorating since the failed military coup in the country to oust president erdogan in 2016 it s been reported that erdogan suspects us involvement in the uprising and accuses washington of harboring exiled cleric fethullah gulen whom ankara blames for masterminding the coup the turkish economy sank after washington introduced economic sanctions over the arrest of us evangelical pastor andrew brunson on terrorism charges in relation to the uprising erdogan has repeatedly slammed washington for unleashing a global trade war sanctioning turkey and trying to isolate iran the nato member s decision to buy russian s 400 missile systems added fuel to the fire moreover turkey is trying to ditch the dollar in an attempt to support its national currency the lira has lost nearly half of its value against the greenback over the past year the currency plunge was exacerbated by soaring inflation and increasing prices for goods and services iran a triumphant return of iran to the global trading arena did not last long shortly after winning the us presidential election donald trump opted to withdraw from the 2015 nuclear deal signed between tehran and a group of nations including the uk us france germany russia china and the eu the oil rich nation has once again become a target for severe sanctions resumed by washington which has also threatened to introduce penalties against any countries that would violate the embargo the punitive measures banned business deals with the islamic republic and cracked down on the country s oil industry sanctions have forced tehran to look for alternatives to the us dollar as payment for its oil exports iran clinched a deal for oil settlements with india using the indian rupee it also negotiated a barter deal with neighboring iraq the partners are also planning to use the iraqi dinar for mutual transactions to reduce reliance on the us dollar amid banking problems connected to us sanctions russia president vladimir putin said the us is making a colossal strategic mistake by undermining confidence in the dollar putin has never called for restricting dollar transactions or banning the use of us currency however russian finance minister anton siluanov said earlier this year that the country had to dump its holdings of us treasuries in favor of more secure assets such as the ruble the euro and precious metals the country has already taken several steps towards de dollarizing the economy due to the constantly growing burden of sanctions that have been introduced since 2014 over a number of issues russia has developed a national payment system as an alternative to swift visa and mastercard after the us threatened tougher new sanctions that would target russia s financial system so far moscow has managed to partially phase out the greenback from its exports signing currency swap agreements with a number of countries including china india and iran russia has recently proposed using the euro instead of the us dollar in trade with the european union once a top 10 holder of us sovereign debt russia has all but eliminated its holdings of us treasuries moscow has used the money to boost the nation s foreign reserves and to build up its gold stockpile to stabilize the ruble rt

u s expansion will likely peak in the next few months as the effects of tax cuts and fiscal spending wane during the course of 2019 an annual economic forecast released in november by the university of michigan showed effects of tax cuts on u s economy will start to diminish in 2019 before fading out in 2020 meanwhile an october survey conducted by the national association for business economics

current laws generally remain unchanged earlier report from the treasury department showed that federal budget deficit registered 779 billion dollars in the fiscal year 2018 ending sept 30 tightening monetary policy economists hold that a mistaken faster or tighter than expected monetary policy may pose threat to the economy the fed has raised the key short term rate four times in 2018 and indicated two more hikes in 2019 it generally increased rates to keep growth in check and prevent annual inflation from rising much above 2 percent if the central bank were to miscalculate and raise rates too high or too fast it could trigger the very downturn that fed officials have been trying to avoid experts noted bridgewater the world s largest hedge fund warned that the u s economy faces a looming deceleration as tighter monetary policy starts to weigh on growth and ratchets up pressure on financial markets we are at a potential inflection point where the economy is moving from hot to mediocre bob prince co chief investment officer at bridgewater said in a note as long as the fed continues to raise rates the grim reality of an overhanging recession risk will be there and the prudent trade will be away from risk assets said chris low chief economist at ftn financial over the past year the fed s rate hikes have tightened global financial conditions and brought spillover effects for emerging markets some of which have faced strong pressure in capital outflows and currency devaluations bofa merrill lynch forecast global monetary policy to become less friendly in 2019 a divided government means that additional fiscal stimulus in the u s seems unlikely europe is largely frozen in place by its budget rules and japan appears ready to implement yet another ill timed consumption tax hike said its researchers the conference board projected a continuous tightening monetary policy but probably at a moderate pace unless inflation emerges much faster than anticipated global risks the world economy is showing clear signs of a downshift with both developed and emerging economies expected to expand at a slower speed their deflating growth can in turn weigh on the u s economy bofa merrill lynch said in its 2019 outlook that global growth is expected to dip from 3 8 percent in 2018 to 3 6 percent in 2019 amid potential risks adding that the slowing growth is likely a benign slowdown instead of a recession a less friendly policy environment suggests a significant slowing in growth globally and risks including uncertainties caused by lingering global trade tensions and brexit are skewed to the downside according to analysts moreover a poll of economists by reuters in october cautioned that an escalation of global trade actions could lead to substantial slowdown in u s economy by 2019 there would be no winners from a global trade war all countries would ultimately be worse off compared to the status quo noted neil shearing group chief economist at capital economics it would inflict lasting damage to growth and cause a permanent loss of output he added looking beyond 2019 the main concerns are slower growth of labor supply and modest projections of productivity growth said bart van ark executive vice president and chief economist at the conference board the research institute projected global growth to be 3 1 percent in 2019 down from 3 2

mines threat of mass layoffs upsets government and zambians by kalima nkonde story highlights the bottom line is that illicit financial flows leads to a loss of resources on the part of the government and the resources are actually lost into foreign hands our call as civil society has always been can we ensure that we tackle the issue of illicit financial flows because even the debt burden that we are now suffering from is just as a result of that patrick nshindano executive director civil society for poverty reduction cspr 2017 we will not allow situations where mining houses start dictating what type of taxes we should have what government would like to do in these tax measures is to ensure that we seal transfer pricing tax avoidance which been perpetuated by these multinationals companies mines minister richard musukwa december 2018 what we have been highlighting is the paradox with african countries we see a continent that has the largest shortage of finance but also at the same time we are seeing a massive amount of money fleeing the continent we re talking about money that s being stolen or embezzled out of the continent so the paradox is you have a continent that needs money but it s a continent that is also financing the rest of the world in countries that don t need the money money is being lost which could have been used to finance investments professor léonce ndikumana from the university of massachusetts amherst the house may wish to note further that the contribution of the mining sector revenue as percentage of gdp remains low at 4 further provisions on capital allowances and carry forward of losses eliminated potential taxable profits mar speaker the tax structure was simply illusory as only two mining companies were paying company income tax former zambia finance minister alexander chikwanda 2015 i am convinced that today there is more money leaving a continent like africa due to money laundering and tax evasion and illicit financial flows than the money that goes in through official development aid and this is a common responsibility of the international community un secretary general antónio guterres 2017 our heads of state and government are aware that the problem of illicit financial flows is exacerbated by corrupt tendencies lack of or weak african institutions both at national and continental levels in all sectors governance challenges weak tax administration and lack of capacity to monitor and curb such criminal activities former president thabo mbeki chairman au high level panel on iffs illicit financial flows iffs out of the developing world are a key impediment to tackling poverty and inequality they rob the african continent of an estimated 70 billion each year funds that could be used for development iffs are the ugliest chapter in international affairs since slavery an estimated 70 billion and increasing leaves africa each year through illicit outflows global financial integrity president raymond baker the untold story of zambia s excessive debt and low foreign reserves is the negative impact that illicit financial flows have had and continue to have on the country zambians need to be made aware that the debt that the country has accumulated is in a large measure due to the fact that billions of us dollars disappear each year without a trace and end up in tax havens and or absorbed into western economies and now china forcing government to accumulate excessive debt to fill the gap created in order to carry out development projects in the light of the mining houses threats of massive layoffs of over 21 000 zambians following 2019 budget tax reforms affecting them which are meant to ensure zambians benefit more from their resources rather than continue accumulating debt while shareholders of mining houses are getting richer it is appropriate that the debate should be extended to illicit financial flows which mines are alleged to be among the major culprits according to research by global financial integrity and other renowned economists like professor dikumana of massachusetts university zambia and other african countries are net creditors which mean far more money flowed out of zambia than into them thus exposing the hypocrisy of the benefits of foreign direct investment and donor funding recent research shows that the total sum that leaves developing countries each year as unreported financial outflows referred to as illicit capital flight amounts to as much as ten times the annual global aid flows and twice the amount of debt developing countries repay each year it is important to have a full picture of the extent of illicit financial flows problem by taking a holistic and helicopter view with regard to the conduits or channels used to siphon funds out of zambia there are three broad channels that billions of dollars are lost these are through multinational enterprises smuggling of natural resources and through corruption and money laundering activities multinational enterprises tax avoidance and evasion the major culprits of illicit financial flows are multinational enterprises mnes through the manipulation of trade transactions trade misinvoicing under valuing exports and overvaluing imports transfer pricing payments between parent companies and their subsidiaries and profit shifting mechanisms designed to conceal revenues are all common practices by companies seeking to maximise profits in the process undermining or negating the expected positive effect of foreign direct investment and aid according to the world bank mnes like the mines have tended to structure their businesses by consolidating high value functions and related intangible assets in hubs that provide goods and services to their global operations they locate them in low tax jurisdictions or in jurisdictions allowing the establishment of preferentially taxed special purpose entities according to stephen yeboah a research consultant at the african natural resources centre of the african development bank afdb nigeria and zambia are among the worst affected in terms of not benefiting from their resources in africa the practices of misinvoicing in nigeria s oil and zambia s copper exports and imports reflect the challenges that illicit financial flows present to africa s extractive sector between 1996 and 2014 under invoicing of oil exports from nigeria to the united states was worth 69 7 billion in zambia over the same period a record of 28 9 billion of copper exports to switzerland which is more than half of all its copper exports did not reflect in switzerland s import statistics he wrote in his research paper in 2012 the then deputy minister of finance miles sampa reported that zambia had lost 2 billion dollars in tax evasion by mining houses sampa said that only two mines claimed profits in that year and that the other mines for one reason or another some genuine some not are always making losses most of it is due to transfer pricing or tax avoidance in their 2013 report on illicit financial flows iffs from africa global financial integrity and the african development bank said zambia had lost approximately us 8 8 million in iffs from 2001 to 2010 the amount of money mining houses make from zambia which is not apparent to the government and zambians was further confirmed in a video four years ago by vendeta s majority shareholder anil agarwal speaking in march 2014 where he revealed how he bought kcm for just 25 million speaking to the jain international trade organisation 6 in bangalore india march 22 23 2014 he is quoted as having boasted about his investment in kcm it s been 9 years and since then every year it is giving us a minimum of 500 million dollar plus 1 billion dollar every year it has been continuously giving back in july 2017 the zambia financial intelligence centre reported that multinational mining companies were robbing zambia an estimated 3 billion annually through tax evasion and illicit financial flows iff in its 2019 budget the zambian government has made a number of proposed tax changes mainly affecting the mining sector mining houses have threatened jobs cuts in thousands and to cut in future capital investments the government on the other hand through the minister of mines richard musukwa has reacted angrily the minister was quoted by the news diggers newspaper that it will not tolerate the arm twisting and black mailing tactics of the mines the schemes being postulated by mining houses are arm twisting tactics something they cannot do in their home countries but we will not allow situations where mining houses start dictating what type of taxes we should have imagine having a country where we have foreigners telling us how we should tax them when they come here they come under a guise of investors and enjoy a lot of concessions and tax holidays in fact at the time when they start making profits most of them wind up operations they would have already made huge profits so what government would like to do with these tax measures is to ensure that we seek transfer pricing tax avoidance which have been perpetuated by these multinational companies musukwa was quoted by news diggers president lungu through his spokesman amos chanda as reported by news diggers said that the threats of mass layoffs by mines have no merit the government does not accept that mining companies that fully comply with sales tax in australia in the us canada would fail to comply with sales tax in zambia the president does not see merit in the opposition to sales tax as things stand amos chanda said according to lusaka times of 29th december 2018 on arrival on the copperbelt for the pf provincial conference president lungu amplified on the issue by categorically saying government will not allow mine owners lay off workers with impunity lusaka times reported that president lungu said he will a not allow mine workers lay off workers with impunity government will not be intimated by threats from mine owners to lay off workers investors in the mining industry are reminded that mines and minerals are assets of the country which zambians must benefit from through taxes to build roads health centres schools it is clear that state house is not amused by mining house s tactics president lungu should not be taken for granted based on how he gave in to miners demands in the past although he does appear weak slow and indecisive to his critics he has demonstrated in the past that he can take tough and bold decisions as he did with the removal of electricity farm subsidies and street venders which affected ordinary zambians who are his voters the indications from government are that the pf administration have reached a tipping point with regard to multinationals and are throwing the kitchen sink at them mining houses are well advised that given all the allegations of tax avoidance tax evasion suspected illicit financial flows their continued extortionary threats they may just open a pandora s box which will result in a tanzanian s magufuli type mining reforms where they will be worse off the zambian government is under tremendous financial pressure of debt servicing and from the zambian public who are overtaxed and hurting economically it has its back on the wall on the other hand zambians on social media and other fora are in uproar about the greed of mining houses and are overwhelmingly in support of government 2019 budget tax measures the influential economic association of zambia whose opinion the current administration respects and listens to led by dr lubinda haabazoka has come in support of government tax proposals and even made some draconian suggestions of nationalisation zambians are of the view that they have been bearing the bulk of the country s tax burden they feel overtaxed with direct indirect taxes and levies while at the same time subsidising the mines with power it s time the mines paid their fair share of taxes the gripe among zambians is that the mining houses are treated like sacred cows in zambia when their contribution to the ordinary zambian has had minimal impact based on a number of metrics including poverty alleviation mining houses retrenched an estimated 15 000 miners when copper prices were low in 2015 but very few were rehired when prices soared to 7 000 and zambians have been quiet mining houses have previously rejected over five different tax and other proposals to benefit zambia by government such as windfall tax revision of vat rule 18 increase of royalty tax to 8 and 20 for underground and open pit respectively 7 5 on imports of copper concentrate tax statutory instruments 33 and 55 si33 and 55 to monitor and stem illegal or illicit outflows and each time the government has curved in 100 after threats of closure of mines or retrenchment this has made government critics to conclude and accuse the zambian government of being weak and compromised because other governments like tanzania drc south africa have resisted the arm twisting and black mail tactics of mining houses in their countries zambians are urging the government to stand its ground and not budge there are some who are even suggesting the revocation mining licences if they retrench or do not comply others are suggesting that zambia should ask chinese investors to take over as copper and cobalt mining s future is bright with the car electric revolution on the horizon others are asking for nationalisation or increase of government stake in mines through zccm ih so that zambia benefits more from its resources the bottom line zambians argue is that the country s benefits from foreign direct investments especially the mines has been minimal in terms of tax revenue employment creation foreign exchange earnings forward and backward linkages technology and skills transfer and community social benefits through corporate social responsibility it is time that zambia pressed a reset button regarding fdi by recalibrating its policies incentives and generally revisits the current development model which is dysfunctional natural resources smuggling the other channel that zambia is losing billions of dollars which is currently being ignored is the smuggling of the country s natural resources there is no doubt that there is illicit exploitation of natural resources such as gold cobalt uranium timber emeralds diamonds manganese and other precious metals and wildlife which is being exported abroad illegally these activities are being carried out by criminal gangs and some big multinational companies some who are involved in the exportation of soil as the late president michael sata once put it the question one would ask is if canada s barrick gold s subsidiary in tanzania acacia mining was caught red handed with containers containing concentrates more than 10 times the amount they declared at the port of dar es salaam what could prevent multinationals in zambia doing the same the recent revelation by the news diggers newspaper that china imported 20 times more mukula timber from zambia than was declared gives credence to the assertion that there is so much revenue being lost through smuggling high volumes of mukula continue to be exported as logs despite regulations prohibiting it recent mukula production in zambia could have amounted to about 110 000 per annum with revenue losses of about us 3 2 million and bribes paid to state officials of about us 1 7 million while official statistics remain incomplete and unclear comparing zambia and chinese customs data reveals significant differences the centre for international forest research cifor regional scientist and chief researcher dr davison gumbo was quoted as saying by the paper according to the president of the gemstone and allied workers union of zambia sifuniso nyumbu as quoted the mast newspaper zambia lost an estimated 7 billion due to illegal mining and sale of gemstones the illegal activities are dotted around all parts of the country and as of 2017 we are talking of about 7billion which was being lost through illegal mining and exports of gemstones he said zambia has the best emeralds and amethyst in the world but there is very little being done to realize revenue by government external borrowing and money laundering fueled capital flight although the writer has not come across evidence suggesting that zambia is losing money through the third channel of illicit financial flow according to james k boyce of the department of economics political economy research institute university of massachusetts amherst in the usa extensive research has found out that most of the highly indebted african countries lose money through external debt fuelled capital flight external borrowing can lead to capital flight and capital flight can lead to external borrowing understanding these linkages is important for the formulation of appropriate policy responses in debt fuelled capital flight external borrowing finances private wealth accumulation outside the borrowing country the borrowing government contracts loans in the name of the public officials and other politically connected individuals then siphon part or all of the money into their own pockets via kickbacks padded procurements contracts and diversion of funds and stash part or all of the proceeds abroad for safekeeping he said when addressing the united nations on illicit financial flows in africa according to james k boyce some of the borrowings by most african governments are odious borrowings which are defined as loans contracted by government without the consent of the people and from which the people will not benefit and the lenders are also aware of this but still they lend the countries suggested solutions there is no argument whatsoever that zambia is losing billions through sophisticated multinational machinations smuggling corruption and money laundering the african union the africa development bank the g20 the world bank and the united nations have all agreed and confirmed this although the challenge of fighting illicit financial flows is a mammoth one and no one country can fight it alone there are still some measures that can minimise the scourge as the evidence of international studies have shown that countries like botswana have the lowest illicit financial outflows in africa whereas zambia and nigeria have the highest there is therefore something that zambia can do the fight against corruption is a starting point as there appears a positive correlation between corruption and illicit financial flows the zambian government can also seriously look at building and strengthening the capacity of zambia revenue authority zra as it is currently not well resourced with technology and specialized staff with sufficient qualifications and experience to handle the sophisticated machinations of mines and mnes there is also need to research the structures value chain characteristics and processes of the mining industry in their home countries in order to fight and limit smuggling of resources simple security measures can be a deterrent there is need to put in measures of monitoring small aerodromes in rural zambia especially north western province and inspections of light aircraft and drones bound for foreign countries the army and air force could be useful in the enforcement of zambia s economic security by limiting smuggling conclusion zambia has no problem with finance for development it has a problem with finance mobilisation and enforcement of laws and regulations we are endowed with resources and if domestic resources were mobilised so that we benefit from our natural resources like botswana has done we would not borrow so much the zambian government s current business development model in practice is based on two pillars one the lope sided promotion of foreign investment without joint venture arrangements while paying lip service to indigenous high value entrepreneurs two the raising of development finance through excessive borrowing rather than mobilization of domestic revenue this is a flawed business model and will not bring development as it only promotes billions of dollars flowing out of the country with little retained in the country for multiplier effects no country has ever developed from excessive borrowings and foreign direct investments alone ask china south korea vietnam and others south east asia countries domestic revenue mobilisation and aggressive promotion of indigenous and local investors and providing incentives to joint venture with foreigners is the key and only way for zambia to develop foreigners never developed any country but merely complemented locals there are thousands of zambians including the writer with multi million dollar viable projects in mining banking transport manufacturing tourism which are rotting because government through zda have no such database and have not aggressively tried to find them and matched them with foreigners with cash like the chinese but just allow 100 owned foreign investors to set up shop china does not do that learn from them

to 21 percent u s president donald trump and republicans have expected the move to boost corporate investment and hiring and keep companies from leaving the united states while democrats have criticized the law as a giveaway to the wealthy a recent study from the new york based conference board finds that the u s expansion will likely peak in the next few months as the effects of tax cuts and fiscal spending wane during the course of 2019 an annual economic forecast released in november by the university of michigan showed effects of tax cuts on u s economy will start to diminish in 2019 before fading out in 2020 meanwhile an october survey conducted by the national association for business economics indicated that u s firms saw improved profit margins in the third quarter of 2018 but the tax reform has not broadly impacted hiring and investment plans others even alarmed tax cuts could pose economic risks in the medium term these risks include higher public debt an inflation surprise international spillover future recession and increased global imbalances the international monetary fund imf said in july a newly released report by the u s treasury department showed u s federal budget deficit spiked to a record 204 9 billion u s dollars in november the second month of the government s fiscal year 2019 due to the tax cut and increased government spending the congressional budget office warned that growing budget deficits would boost u s public debt sharply over the next 30 years if current laws generally remain unchanged earlier report from the treasury department showed that federal budget deficit registered 779 billion dollars in the fiscal year 2018 ending sept 30 tightening monetary policy economists hold that a mistaken faster or tighter than expected monetary policy may pose threat to the economy the fed has raised the key short term rate four times in 2018 and indicated two more hikes in 2019 it generally increased rates to keep growth in check and prevent annual inflation from rising much above 2 percent if the central bank were to miscalculate and raise rates too high or too fast it could trigger the very downturn that fed officials have been trying to avoid experts noted bridgewater the world s largest hedge fund warned that the u s economy faces a looming deceleration as tighter monetary policy starts to weigh on growth and ratchets up pressure on financial markets we are at a potential inflection point where the economy is moving from hot to mediocre bob prince co chief investment officer at bridgewater said in a note as long as the fed continues to raise rates the grim reality of an overhanging recession risk will be there and the prudent trade will be away from risk assets said chris low chief economist at ftn financial over the past year the fed s rate hikes have tightened global financial conditions and brought spillover effects for emerging markets some of which have faced strong pressure in capital outflows and currency devaluations bofa merrill lynch forecast global monetary policy to become less friendly in 2019 a divided government means that additional fiscal stimulus in the u s seems unlikely europe is largely frozen in place by its budget rules and japan appears ready to implement yet another ill timed consumption tax hike said its researchers the conference board projected a continuous tightening monetary policy but probably at a moderate pace unless inflation emerges much faster than anticipated global risks the world economy is showing clear signs of a downshift with both developed and emerging economies expected to expand at a slower speed their deflating growth can in turn weigh on the u s economy bofa merrill lynch said in its 2019 outlook that global growth is expected to dip from 3 8 percent in 2018 to 3 6 percent in 2019 amid potential risks adding that the slowing growth is likely a benign slowdown instead of a recession a less friendly policy environment suggests a significant slowing in growth globally and risks including uncertainties caused by lingering global trade tensions and brexit are skewed to the downside according to analysts moreover a poll of economists by reuters in october cautioned that an escalation of global trade actions could lead to substantial slowdown in u s economy by 2019 there would be no winners from a global trade war all countries would ultimately be worse off compared to the status quo noted neil shearing group chief economist at capital economics it would inflict lasting damage to growth and cause a permanent loss of output he added looking beyond 2019 the main concerns are slower growth of labor supply and modest projections of productivity growth said bart van ark executive vice president and chief economist at the conference board the research institute projected global growth to be 3 1 percent in 2019 down from 3 2 percent in 2018 economist positive or pessimistic about the future agreed that 2019 is likely to be challenging for both investors and policymakers

it has been a little bit of a lonely effort ashoka mody an economics professor at princeton university and the former deputy director of the international monetary fund s european department is talking about eurotragedy a drama in nine acts his brilliant magisterial history of the eu and the development of the eurozone the vast majority of the european establishment mody continues has either tried to ignore or to contest what it seems to me are very basic economic principles and facts one can see why the european establishment might be inclined to do so eurotragedy is an indictment of the whole postwar european project a meticulous excoriating takedown of that which the european establishment holds dear and it is also an attack on the european establishment itself on its members groupthink their delusion their technocratic arrogance what s more it comes from the imf s chief representative to ireland during its bailout from the post 2008 banking crisis someone that is with an inside track on the eu s fiscal workings spiked spoke to mody to find out more about his critical overview of the european project the fatal flaws of the eurozone and why integration is driving european peoples apart spiked do you think you found working on eurotragedy a lonely effort because after brexit and the other populist movements the eu establishment is very defensive at the moment ashoka mody i m sure it plays a role but i think that the nature of the entire project is very defensive think back to robert schuman s declaration on 9 may 1950 which laid the ground for the european coal and steel community two years later he said that a common source of economic development must become the foundation of a european federation this idea of the european federation was discredited very quickly but european leaders have continued to flirt with it in different guises ever closer union unity in diversity and this particularly meaningless phrase that french president emmanuel macron uses called european sovereignty the whole language is problematic and mystifying but most serious of all is the notion of common economic development as a basis for europe it was briefly true after the treaty of rome in 1957 which opened up the borders but the momentum ran out within two decades you open borders but once they re open there s not a lot more you can do even the gains from the so called single market are very limited beyond a certain point every economist understands that on the euro there was never any question that it was a bad idea nicholas kaldor an economist at cambridge university wrote in march 1971 that a single currency was a terrible idea both as economics and as politics and kaldor has been proven right time and again but the entire european establishment just ignores every subsequent warning from well regarded economists and produces defensive counternarratives for example i often hear that europe needs fixed exchange rates in order to have a single market why germany is trading a lot with poland hungary and the czech republic which are in the single market but have different currencies these fluctuate but the trade continues apace you don t need a single currency for a single market spiked when did your critique of the european project emerge was it during your involvement in the irish bailout mody when i finished at the imf i planned to write a book on the euro crisis and i began writing it as an imf economist would what happened before the crash the bubble the bubble bursting the panic the fact it wasn t well managed and so on but i soon realised that something wasn t right here and so i spent two years tracing the history of the euro and asking the question what brought the euro into existence in its current form you see it is not just that there is a euro there is a euro which is a single currency in an incomplete monetary union with a set of fiscal rules that are evidently economically illiterate and nobody questions the fact that they are economically illiterate that they lack a necessary fiscal backstop and the necessary fiscal union so why does it exist that is when i started writing what is in effect a postwar european history a companion if you will to tony judt s postwar a history of europe since 1945 that is when i realised the euro was not only a bad economic idea it was also a bad political idea not only was it clear it would cause political divisions there was also no plan on how to heal those divisions to counteract them so these mythologies grew around the euro transfiguring it as an instrument for peace a means to bring europeans together a necessity for the single market all these strands of mythology grew up and around the european project to sustain what is effectively a mindless idea spiked you talk about it almost as a triumph of political delusion what drove its architects on what allowed them to push forward with a project that many economists deemed a folly mody i learnt two things about history from doing the book one that there are critical moments in history when an individual becomes unusually powerful and acquires an executive power disproportionate to his or her abilities and two such an individual has within his or her power an ability to create a narrative a story a mythology and it is the combination of the two that created the euro this is why helmut kohl is so important not only because he shepherded this project to the end he left us with a legacy of language that justifies it even to this day i think if kohl hadn t existed or hadn t survived as chancellor in the 1990s it wouldn t have happened there would have been no euro spiked what s striking is that rarely during this decades long process of integration did those leading the charge engage with national electorates if they did engage they would just ignore the answer given as they did as far back as 1992 with the danish and french referenda on the maastricht treaty do you think that this is one of the fatal flaws of european project that it goes onwards in spite of citizens mody it is absolutely a fatal flaw up until 1992 and the maastricht treaty there was this concept of permissive consensus this idea said that european leaders were to take benign decisions on behalf of the peoples of europe who cannot possibly understand the complexities of governing they trust the leaders because they know the right way to move forward and ultimately they will be validated and legitimised by the fruits they will deliver yet this permissive consensus was breaking down even as the maastricht treaty was being signed as you say we had the danish referendum and especially the french referendum in 1992 the french referendum in particular is an historically important one because the people 49 per cent who voted against maastricht are the same as those protesting in the yellow vest movement today just think about it for a period of about 30 years a consistent group of people have been calling out saying there is a problem over here they are saying that the real problems lie at home that we are being left behind and you the government seem to have no clue what we want the question of whether european citizens want more europe has never been really deliberated in any meaningful way it was never clear what the point of the euro was it certainly didn t deliver more prosperity and the lack of consultation with the people has created a simmering anxiety of opposing kinds in different nations in germany that anxiety plays on the possibility that germans may have to pay the bills for other countries in much of southern europe people are anxious that germany has become too dominant and that in periods of crisis the german chancellor may become de facto european chancellor there is no electoral mechanism for accountability and legitimacy so the whole process is inherently undemocratic the people who are affected by decisions cannot vote out those making the decisions spiked there are some who claim the eurozone has created a degree of prosperity certainly from the late 1990s until the mid 2000s do you think this was an illusion of prosperity sustained by in europe s case the banking bubble mody yes absolutely it is very unfortunate because that whole decade was completely misinterpreted in two ways one is that when the yields on government bonds came down that was still celebrated as financial integration whereas it was in fact a problem because the countries that were benefiting from these very low interest rates were allowing a debt bubble to form
with what naomi klein calls galloping momentum the green new deal promoted by newly elected rep alexandria ocasio cortez d ny appears to be forging a political pathway for solving all of the ills of society and the planet in one fell swoop it would give a house select committee a mandate that connects the dots between energy transportation housing as well as healthcare living wages a jobs guarantee and more but to critics even on the left it is just political theater since everyone knows a program of that scope cannot be funded without a massive redistribution of wealth and slashing of other programs notably the military which is not politically feasible perhaps but ocasio cortez and the 22 representatives joining her in calling for a select committee are also proposing a novel way to fund the program one which could actually work the resolution says funding will primarily come from the federal government using a combination of the federal reserve a new public bank or system of regional and specialized public banks public venture funds and such other vehicles or structures that the select committee deems appropriate in order to ensure that interest and other investment returns generated from public investments made in connection with the plan will be returned to the treasury reduce taxpayer burden and allow for more investment a network of public banks could fund the green new deal in the same way president franklin roosevelt funded the original new deal at a time when the banks were bankrupt he used the publicly owned reconstruction finance corporation as a public infrastructure bank the federal reserve could also fund any program congress wanted if mandated to do it congress wrote the federal reserve act and can amend it or the treasury itself could do it without the need even to change any laws the constitution authorizes congress to coin money and regulate the value thereof and that power has been delegated to the treasury it could mint a few trillion dollar platinum coins put them in its bank account and start writing checks against them what stops legislators from exercising those constitutional powers is simply that everyone knows zimbabwe style hyperinflation will result but will it compelling historical precedent shows that this need not be the case michael hudson professor of economics at the university of missouri kansas city has studied the hyperinflation question extensively he writes that those disasters were not due to government money printing to stimulate the economy rather every hyperinflation in history has been caused by foreign debt service collapsing the exchange rate the problem almost always has resulted from wartime foreign currency strains not domestic spending as long as workers and materials are available and the money is added in a way that reaches consumers adding money will create the demand necessary to prompt producers to create more supply supply and demand will rise together and prices will remain stable the reverse is also true if demand money is not increased supply and gdp will not go up new demand needs to precede new supply the public bank option the precedent of roosevelt s new deal infrastructure projects of the sort proposed in the green new deal are self funding generating resources and fees that can repay the loans for these loans advancing funds through a network of publicly owned banks will not require taxpayer money and can actually generate a profit for the government that was how the original new deal rebuilt the country in the 1930s at a time when the economy was desperately short of money the publicly owned reconstruction finance corporation rfc was a remarkable publicly owned cedit machine that allowed the government to finance the new deal and world war ii without turning to congress or the taxpayers for appropriations first instituted in 1932 by president herbert hoover the rfc was not called an infrastructure bank and was not even a bank but it served the same basic functions it was continually enlarged and modified by president roosevelt to meet the crisis of the times until it became america s largest corporation and the world s largest financial organization its semi independent status let it work quickly allowing new deal agencies to be financed as the need arose the rfc act of 1932 provided the rfc with capital stock of 500 million and the authority to extend credit up to 1 5 billion subsequently increased several times the initial capital came from a stock sale to the us treasury with those resources from 1932 to 1957 the rfc loaned or invested more than 40 billion a small part of this came from its initial capitalization the rest was borrowed chiefly from the government itself bonds were sold to the treasury some of which were then sold to the public but most were held by the treasury the rfc ended up borrowing a total of 51 3 billion from the treasury and 3 1 billion from the public thus the treasury was the lender not the borrower in this arrangement as the self funding loans were repaid so were the bonds that were sold to the treasury leaving the rfc with a net profit the rfc was the lender for thousands of infrastructure and small business projects that revitalized the economy and these loans produced a total net income of 690 017 232 on the rfc s normal lending functions omitting such things as extraordinary grants for wartime the rfc financed roads bridges dams post offices universities electrical power mortgages farms and much more and it funded all this while generating income for the government the central bank option how japan is funding abenomics with quantitative easing the federal reserve is another funding option before the green new deal the fed showed what it can do with quantitative easing when it created the funds to buy 2 46 trillion in federal debt and 1 77 trillion in mortgage backed securities all without inflating consumer prices the fed could use the same tool to buy bonds ear marked for a green new deal and since it returns its profits to the treasury after deducting its costs the bonds would be nearly interest free if they were rolled over from year to year the government would in effect be issuing new money this is not just theory japan is actually doing it without creating even the modest 2 percent inflation the government is aiming for abenomics the economic agenda of japan s prime minister shinzo abe combines central bank quantitative easing with fiscal stimulus large scale increases in government spending since abe came into power in 2012 japan has seen steady economic growth and its unemployment rate has fallen by nearly half yet inflation remains very low at 0 7 percent social security related expenses accounted for 55 percent of general expenditure in the 2018 federal budget and a universal healthcare insurance system is maintained for all citizens nominal gdp is up 11 percent since the end of the first quarter of 2013 a much better record than during the prior two decades of japanese stagnation and the nikkei stock market is at levels not seen since the early 1990s driven by improved company earnings growth remains below targeted levels but according to the financial times in may 2018 this is because fiscal stimulus has actually been too small while spending with the left hand the government has been taking the money back with the right increasing the sales tax from 5 percent to 8 percent abenomics has been declared a success even by the once critical international monetary fund after prime minister shinzo abe crushed his opponents in october 2017 noah smith wrote in bloomberg japan s long ruling liberal democratic party has figured out a novel and interesting way to stay in power govern pragmatically focus on the economy and give people what they want he said everyone who wanted a job had one small and midsized businesses were doing well and the boj s unprecedented program of monetary easing had provided easy credit for corporate restructuring without generating inflation abe had also vowed to make both preschool and college free not that all is idyllic in japan forty percent of japanese workers lack secure full time employment and adequate pensions but the point underscored here is that large scale digital money printing by the central bank to buy back the government s debt combined with fiscal stimulus by the government spending on what the people want has not inflated japanese prices the alleged concern preventing other countries from doing it abe s novel economic program has achieved more than just stimulating growth by selling its debt to its own central bank which returns the interest to the government the japanese government has in effect been canceling its debt and until recently it was doing this at the rate of a whopping 720 billion 80tn per year according to fund manager eric lonergan in a february 2017 article the bank of japan is in the process of owning most of the outstanding government debt of japan it currently owns around 40 boj holdings are part of the consolidated government balance sheet so its holdings are in fact the accounting equivalent of a debt cancellation if i buy back my own mortgage i don t have a mortgage if the federal reserve followed suit and bought 40 percent of the us national debt it would be holding 8 trillion in federal securities three times its current holdings from its quantitative easing programs yet liquidating a full 40 percent of japan s government debt has not triggered price inflation filling the gap between wages debt and gdp rather than stepping up its bond buying the federal reserve is now bent on quantitative tightening raising interest rates and reducing the money supply by selling its bonds into the market in anticipation of full employment driving up prices full employment is considered to be 4 7 percent unemployment taking into account the natural rate of unemployment of people between jobs or voluntarily out of work but the economy has now hit that level and prices are not in the danger zone despite nearly 10 years of accommodative monetary policy in fact the economy is not near either true full employment or full productive capacity with gross domestic product remaining well below both the long run trend and the level predicted by forecasters a decade ago in 2016 real per capita gdp was 10 percent below the 2006 forecast of the congressional budget office and it shows no signs of returning to the predicted level in 2017 us gross domestic product was 19 4 trillion assuming that sum is 10 percent below full productive capacity the money circulating in the economy needs to be increased by another 2 trillion to create the demand to bring it up to full capacity that means 2 trillion could be injected into the economy every year without creating price inflation new supply would just be generated to meet the new demand bringing gdp to full capacity while keeping prices stable this annual injection of new money not only can be done without creating price inflation it actually needs to be done to reverse the massive debt bubble now threatening to propel the economy into another great recession moreover the money can be added in such a way that the net effect will not be to increase the money supply virtually our entire money supply is created by banks as loans and any money used to pay down those loans will be extinguished along with the debt other money will be extinguished when it returns to the government in the form

the velvet revolution was built on an uncontroversial three pronged reform agenda stamping out corruption facilitating democratisation and spearheading national economic development a previous article examined the first two points in depth addressing the need for democratisation and governance to be substantiated with ideological consistency this analysis will focus on the economic aspects of pashinyan s reform agenda pashinyan identified four broad economic priorities for armenia the first is addressing mass depopulation the second was breaking down oligopoly in armenia related to his government s anti corruption campaign the third is armenia s integration into the global economy and the fourth is attracting international investment but thus far the government has been largely inactive in addressing these priorities in fact much of what has been said or done either doesn t necessarily align with the priorities or at worst appear counterproductive this is symptomatic of a lack of clear direction in national development strategy so what do the proposed solutions to these challenges look like and perhaps more importantly what are their consequences naturally these issues are highly intertwined and can t be approached as if they were in a vacuum depopulation and brain drain are tied to the issues of poverty alleviation economic opportunity and employment but as pashinyan has made clear it also entails re population or more specifically repatriation with a refreshed ministry of diaspora headed by a young pashinyan loyalist in mkhitar hayrapetyan repatriation has become a centrepiece of the administration s development policy its flagship initiative neruzh is designed to accelerate armenia s developing technology industry by incentivising repatriation through training and grants but while the tech sector has seen significant growth in recent years profits in the industry are not necessarily redistributed in a way that translates into poverty alleviation niche specialised industries with low employment rates driven largely by both diaspora investment and manpower will have a limited impact on reducing the country s 18 percent unemployment rate and 30 percent poverty rate without dismissing the value of sectors such as technology in an assessment of need it is impossible to look past the agricultural sector one that employs over 30 percent of the country s workforce and accounts for between 20 to 25 percent of the country s gdp moreover the agricultural industry has the potential to promote development in rural armenia another target area needs to be urban centres outside of yerevan former industrial regions which suffered with the collapse of the soviet union contributing to the highest poverty rates across the country secondary sector development including energy production chemical manufacturing and resource processing were once significant components of this urban economy private sector solutions particularly in the renewable energy space have remained as of yet untouched emerging sector investment is another means of mitigating and preventing oligopoly the second major economic challenge armenia is in many ways a victim of its geography and a hostage to its neighbours on this front even if robust competition laws and market regulations were introduced to protect against market monopolies armenia would have to grapple with the fact that its major import and export partners russia iran and china are rife with them meaning the country would still be highly susceptible to price fixing this could be offset by import substitution particularly on the energy front where armenia has the capacity to reach self sufficiency but another route would be greater international market integration the third point diversifying import sources can offset the influence of foreign oligarchies and monopolies over armenian markets the most obvious alternative is the european union however this comes with its own challenges being a member of the eurasian economic union eeu places armenia at an advantage in some regards as a conduit between european and eurasian markets but presents severe political challenges the free trade agreements between armenia and russia as a result of its eeu membership inhibits armenia s ability to integrate further with the european union at an economic level due to the sanctions regime currently enforced against russia if armenia were to have any preferential import arrangements such as subsidies free trade zones or tariff relief russia and eu member states would be able to bypass trade restrictions by using armenia as a middle man further integration with europe would also involve exposing armenia to a new regulatory environment which may prove prohibitive for emerging markets and sectors by increasing costs of labour decreasing armenian competitiveness exposing the country to new market volatilities and accelerating foreign corporate market entry this is not to suggest armenia shouldn t pursue european integration but that it must be managed in a way that ensures armenian interests are upheld and its sovereignty protected armenia s promising hydro electricity industry is almost entirely foreign owned calling into question energy security and major foreign owned mining companies and their international institutional investors have shown consistent disregard for environmental regulations and local industry without regulation on foreign ownership nor rigid sector specific restrictions armenia will remain susceptible to reckless foreign corporate adventurism particularly as china turns its eye towards the region this last issue ties into the fourth economic target international investment outside of this question of foreign ownership however is the diaspora direct investment market in armenia international investment has been largely diaspora driven and almost exclusively by a wealthy diaspora elite however over the past decade there has been a steady decline in gross foreign direct investment fdi in armenia russian armenians contribute the largest share although the volatility of the russian economy has precipitated significant declines in russian origin investment the ministry of diaspora has sought to capitalise on the diaspora s potential through the proposed introduction of a diaspora bond system the bonds would offer a stable return on investment and provide the government with a source of external liquidity to finance development initiatives similar to the israel bonds program which regularly raises in excess of a billion usd per annum however such a system is not risk free much of the diaspora s direct investment has been directed towards the tourism sector the total contribution of which accounts for 15 percent of national employment and 15 percent of gdp with one of the highest growth rates in the world leading projects in the tourism sectors have included the tatev revival project undertaken by idea a development organization founded by russian armenian billionaire ruben vardanyan as with other emerging fdi initiatives in the tourism sector idea has proven highly effective in generating income employment and a global profile for armenia through projects such as the aurora initiative and the uwc world college in dilijan as such there is no guarantee existing foreign investors will become bond holders when their current initiatives and investment networks are proving both lucrative and developmentally effective initiatives aimed at attracting diaspora direct investment also need to consider their target market in the case of israel national bonds were first issued in 1951 soon after the foundation of the state there was an immediate impetus to invest to support the fledgling state but significant traction for the bond program did not occur until the six day war and the yom kippur war with bond sales not only doubling over the previous years but sustaining themselves at the new rate the israel bonds program was also largely based out of the united states with the development corporation of israel dci the main bond issuer headquartered in new york and leveraging local community networks to sustain direct engagement in israeli development armenia lacks the same conditions remittances are a key indication of an interest in investment but armenia s largest remittance market is armenian labour migrants based in russia these communities are in no position to invest and an attempt to convert remitters into investors would likely prove more costly for the government as it would take away a valuable security net for the hundreds of thousands of armenian families reliant on remittances so supplement income the largest remittance market in terms of economic potential the united states only contributes 10 percent of total remittances despite estimates that place the net worth of the community there well in excess of 10 times the gdp of the armenian state furthermore even those contributions have been in overall decline many of these communities tend to participate in development through third parties namely diaspora based community organisations and charities convincing these communities to adopt low yield bonds with significant patriotic discount is far from a guaranteed outcome unlike israel the armenian diaspora particularly in the early years of independence has been at best alienated and at worst vilified by armenian governments of the day even with the spectre of corruption in decline and a renewed sense of confidence in the direction of an armenia with pashinyan at the helm the task of changing the behaviour of an established diaspora and redefining its relationship with the homeland is monumental israel s experience with diaspora bonds may be more an exception than a model to illustrate one comparable state greece was unable to utilise its sizeable diaspora of seven million to relieve the pressures of the national debt crisis only india has been able to achieve modest success through diaspora bond issuance but well below its capacity given the size of its expat community ultimately bonds are more of a gamble than sound investment policy and much of its success hinges on factors well out of a government s control summarised pashinyan has thus far been unable to demonstrate the economic management he has promised largely because the challenges he s identified require more than short term policy items repatriation will not abate the cumulative losses associated with depopulation emigration can only be reversed when employment opportunities emerge and standards of living improve however with the largest sector of the armenian economy by both gdp and employment share agriculture falling by double digits in the last quarter pashinyan s vague budgetary announcements have done little by way of promising relief for the industry outside of band aid solutions like subsidies to farmers the overall message is that the country is looking to transition away from the agricultural sector towards an industrial tech based economy however the international investment and expertise this would necessitate has not proceeded from discussions concerning the protection of armenian industry from predatory foreign practices particularly in terms of regulatory compliance one area neglected thus far in this analysis has been the time factor the expectations fostered by pashinyan during the velvet revolution has placed the government on a clock the public is impatient and structural economic reform is not a fast moving process it could take years for policies aimed at attracting international investment encouraging emerging sector development developing trade agreements and attacking poverty and depopulation to become noticeable over the past 6 months pashinyan has been able to use mass mobilisation in the forms of protests and rallies symbolic arrests and political scapegoating to divert attention from the ticking clock the decision to bring elections forward in many ways was a recognition of the fact that the government needed to secure its parliamentary mandate quickly in order to avoid the electoral costs of public impatience and the dissipation of widespread revolutionary enthusiasm economic reform is not a hard sell to people who have suffered from economic disenfranchisement under a corrupt system for the past 27 years but pashinyan s economic platform is fraught with inconsistencies torn between a utopian vision of socio economic empowerment coupled with a capitalistic urge to expedite foreign investment and expertise the division became most apparent recently when pashinyan s proposal to drastically increase the minimum wage was opposed by deputy prime minister tigran avinyan in favour of facilitating a business environment that would produce a market based increase in wages both are inadequate increased wages without increased productive output will only drive up the rate of inflation as demand outpaces supply whereas while investing in business may increase wages in yerevan s service sectors other urban centres and rural populations would not only continue to experience stagnant wage growth but feel additional pressures in the form of a deepening economic disparity these inconsistencies have lent credence to the arguments surrounding the young administration s hostility to armenian traditionalism the internationalist agenda of the government has been perceived not only as an attempt to supplant armenian values with progressive european ideals but a pro business agenda that places the interests of foreign investors over the armenian worker comments by avinyan coupled with the administration s refusal to introduce a system of progressive taxation and a tax free threshold for those below the poverty line instead of the proposed flat tax have contributed to this perception if economic development is a core objective of government economic strategy needs to be targeted it is possible to pursue both social development goals and private sector growth but not if resources are being divided inefficiently the growth of the technology has never been contingent on government financing foreign investment from the diaspora international organisations and foreign states aid budgets have been largely responsible for that in an environment where private capital is succeeding other economic sectors can be prioritised in the budget basic infrastructure such as road and rail improvements could vastly increase the country s value as a regional conduit the failure of the previous government to take this sector seriously led to the collapse of the armenia iran railway concession hindering the viability of armenia s role as a node in russia s north south transport corridor china s belt and road initiative and europe s warming relations with iran infrastructure development could revitalize armenia s free falling construction sector which in the mid 2000s constituted one of the largest industries in the country at 15 to 20 percent of gdp much of the construction boom came at the behest of the country s elite northern avenue s residential and retail district for example and was marred by corruption much of the growth in the sector was squandered an uncompetitive tender process allowed profits generated through boom to go untaxed and accumulate in the hands of the oligarchy at the same time the boom was doomed to bust the increasing inaccessibility of the residential market to the average citizen prevented expansion this became a driving factor in depopulation over 50 percent of armenian labor migrants in russia are employed in the construction sector strategic investments also need to be made in the agricultural sectors to improve yields to maximise efficiency in land use to ensure greater predictability in output and to expand use of technological developments in greenhouses and irrigation systems that could prove both cost efficient and more economically sustainable armenia s energy sector is another area of potential growth particularly in the renewable space which already accounts for approximately 40 percent of electricity production further development would not only decrease dependency on imported russian gas reducing overall costs but catalyse growth in tertiary and quaternary sectors supporting industrial expansion these three sectors are particularly important because their impact on the armenian economy is multifaceted infrastructure projects in and of themselves are of net benefit to the economy in terms of employment but when those projects promise continued return on investment and enhance the overall economic capacity of a country their value increases exponentially residential and retail spaces are short term projects power plants agricultural facilities roads and rail will future proof armenia in addition to both the employment and investment potential these sectors would promise they also work towards a guarantee of food security despite the size of the sector armenia is still a net importer of basic foodstuffs including meat and wheat energy security to decrease dependence on russia and human security through mitigating and ideally reversing depopulation this is by no means a comprehensive blueprint for economic development but it does work towards demonstrating how an integrated economic strategy can affect multi sector development outcomes but this has not been part of the transition government s approach similar to the previous administration sectors with limited development impact have been prioritized in order to produce short term gains that are marketable to the broader public what armenia needs is structural economic reform not superficial outcomes that suit a political agenda even in the presence of untamed populism and the absence of a viable opposition the economy doesn t lie and that may make it the single greatest tool of not only holding the government to account but ensuring democracy takes root in armenia
then came trump s trade wars with china and other key us trade partners market worries about the administration s protectionist policies have waxed and waned throughout the year but they are now reaching a new peak the latest us actions against china seem to augur a broader trade economic and geopolitical cold war multiple risks an additional worry is that trump s other policies will have stagflationary effects reduced growth alongside higher inflation after all trump is planning to limit inward foreign direct investment and has already implemented broad restrictions on immigration which will reduce labour supply growth at a time when workforce ageing and skills mismatches are already a growing problem moreover the administration has yet to propose an infrastructure plan to spur private sector productivity or hasten the transition to a green economy and on twitter and elsewhere trump has continued to bash corporations for their hiring production investment and pricing practices singling out tech firms just when they are already facing a wider backlash and increased competition from their chinese counterparts emerging markets have also been shaken by us policies fiscal stimulus and monetary policy tightening have pushed up short and long term interest rates and strengthened the us dollar as a result emerging economies have experienced capital flight and rising dollar denominated debt those that rely heavily on exports have suffered the effects of lower commodity prices and all that trade even indirectly with china have felt the effects of the trade war advertisement even trump s oil policies have created volatility after the resumption of us sanctions against iran pushed up oil prices the administration s efforts to carve out exemptions and bully saudi arabia into increasing its own production led to a sharp price drop though us consumers benefit from lower oil prices us energy firms stock prices do not besides excessive oil price volatility is bad for producers and consumers alike because it hinders sensible investment and consumption decisions making matters worse it is now clear that the benefits of last year s tax cuts have accrued almost entirely to the corporate sector rather than to households in the form of higher real inflation adjusted wages that means household consumption could soon slow down further undercutting the economy threat of a new cold war more than anything else though the sharp fall in us and global equities during the last quarter is a response to trump s own utterances and actions even worse than the heightened risk of a full scale trade war with china despite the recent truce agreed with chinese president xi jinping are trump s public attacks on the us federal reserve which began as early as the spring of 2018 when the us economy was growing at more than 4 per cent given these earlier attacks markets were spooked this month when the fed correctly decided to hike interest rates while also signalling a more gradual pace of rate increases in 2019 most likely the fed s relative hawkishness is a reaction to trump s threats against it in the face of hostile presidential tweets fed chairman jerome powell needed to signal that the central bank remains politically independent advertisement but then came trump s decision to shut down large segments of the federal government over congress refusal to fund his useless mexican border wall that sent markets into a near panic and the government shutdown was soon followed by reports that trump wants to fire powell a move that could turn a correction into a crash just before the christmas holiday us treasury secretary steven mnuchin was forced to issue a public statement to placate the markets he announced that trump was not planning to fire powell after all and that us banks finances are sound effectively highlighting the question of whether they really are recent changes within the administration that do not necessarily affect economic policymaking are also rattling the markets the impending departure of white house chief of staff john kelly and secretary of defense james mattis will leave the room devoid of adults the coterie of economic nationalists and foreign policy hawks who remain will cater to trump s every whim as matters stand the risk of a full scale geopolitical conflagration with china cannot be ruled out a new cold war would effectively lead to de globalisation disrupting supply chains everywhere but particularly in the tech sector as the recent zte and huawei cases signal at the same time trump seems to be hell bent on undermining the cohesion of the european union and nato at a time when europe is economically and politically fragile and special counsel robert mueller s investigation into trump s 2016 election campaign s ties to russia hangs like a sword of damocles over his presidency trump is now the dr strangelove of financial markets like the paranoid madman in stanley kubrick s

by yu yongding china s economic performance in 2018 was rather disappointing according to official statistics the country s growth rate up to the end of the third quarter was 6 7 the lowest since the

monetary tightening might not even be called for though many argue that the pboc s past liquidity injections especially its large stimulus in response to the 2008 global economic crisis caused the

probably significantly higher if one accounts for contingent liabilities especially the debts owned by local government financing vehicles but even then china s fiscal position is rather strong compared to most countries especially bearing in mind that not all local government debts are bad debts this means that china still has room to pursue expansionary fiscal policy with a focus on reversing the investment slowdown that fueled the decline in gdp growth in 2018 in the first three quarters of 2018 fixed investment grew by just 5 4 year on year compared to 7 5 in 2017 largely

canadian oil benchmark western canada select and its global counterparts and trade concerns in the run up to the u s mexico canada agreement that replaced nafta admittedly this may be a case of

however sentiment for the u s economy is approaching levels not seen since the recession a similar story is true in the euro zone where sentiment is approaching levels last seen during the sovereign

already priced in luc vallée chief strategist and dominique lapointe economist laurentian bank securities excess pessimism is likely to mark the beginning of 2019 and linger until real progress is made on the global trade front incidentally central banks communication related to future monetary tightening have become more dovish in recent weeks to allow such repositioning if it were to become necessary we expect these negative sentiments to persist until market participants fears are assuaged only then will central banks become less accommodative as they become less concerned with the economic outlook at this point we expect markets to recover strongly from their current depressed levels it remains difficult to pinpoint the exact timing of such a change in sentiment but we think it

of local governments in particular rather than permit local governments to borrow from commercial banks to fund infrastructure investments the central government should foot the bill the combination of higher expenditures and lower revenues resulting from tax cuts and fee reductions may cause china s budget deficit to gdp ratio to exceed 3 but like the cn 7 threshold for the us dollar exchange rate that threshold should not be considered sacred as long as interest rates for government bonds can be kept low the government should not be afraid to issue more of them expansionary macroeconomic policy alone will not resolve all of china s problems in the long term and it undoubtedly carries significant risks but given the paramount importance of stabilising growth the chinese authorities need to use all of the tools at their disposal yu yongding a former president of the china society of world economics and director of the institute of world economics and politics at the chinese academy of social sciences served on the monetary policy committee of the people s bank of china from 2004 to 2006 copyright project syndicate 2019 and published here with permission
currently the prospects of china s one belt one road initiative hereinafter referred to as obor are dim an article published in the financial times in july this year pointed out that 234 out of 1 674 chinese invested infrastructure projects announced in 66 belt and road countries since 2013 have encountered difficulties the most recent and striking problem occurred in malaysia newly elected prime minister mahathir mohamad canceled the us 20 billion east coast rail link project right after his official visit to beijing although it is very likely that mahathir mohamad s primary aim is to force china to make more concessions rather than to withdraw from obor his talk about a new version of colonialism does echo the concerns of ordinary people in the belt and road countries huge debt unregulated multinational corporations backdoor deals exploitation of resources and the environment displacement of local communities etc these issues have been criticized by progressive forces around the world the people s forum on obor and bricsheld in hong kong last year discussed many of them however criticisms about obor often focus on the adverse effects it has created in foreign countries and neglect its domestic consequences corruption domestic financial deficiency the rise of xenophobia etc unlike the previous colonialist or imperialist countries it seems as though the ordinary people of china generally do not benefit from the expansionist strategy of the state moreover some of them are also the victims of the chinese ruling class global ambition but first let s discuss the communist party of china cpc s motives for obor the unavoidable route of chinese capitalism capital must generate profits this is the golden rule of capitalism after three decades of high speed economic growth in china both state and the private capitalists have accumulated incredible amounts of capital for example china s foreign exchange reserves were only us 2 262 million in december 1980 but in june 2014 they had reached an all time high of us 3 993 212 72 million at the approach of the new millennium the limited size of its domestic market profit profit the positive gain yielded from a company s activity net profit is profit after tax distributable profit is the part of the net profit which can be distributed to the shareholders rate and other factors such as securing energy and resources supplies started pushing china to invest its capital globally in 1999 the government initiated the go out policy also referred to as the going global strategy to promote chinese investments abroad the effort was remarkable according to statistics published by the united nations conference on trade and development unctad united nations conference on trade and development this was established in 1964 after pressure from the developing countries to offset the gatt effects unctad mainland china s outbound foreign direct investment ofdi in 2000 was only us 915 8 million but in 2013 the year when china announced obor this figure had increased dramatically to reach us 107 843 7 million and last year s figure was us 124 630 million these figures do not include financial investments it is worth mentioning that hong kong where the ofdi is counted separately from mainland china also serves as a tunnel for chinese investments and its ofdi had unprecedentedly reached us 124 092 5 million in 2014 in his classical work imperialism and world economy nikolai bukharin argues that capitalism has two tendencies first it produces a tendency toward internationalization that drives capital to seek new investments markets resources and cheap labor throughout the world second it produces a tendency toward statification capital seeks help and protection from home states in global competition and even to become state capitalist firms until recently the majority of ofdi was from the state owned enterprises soes in 2012 the share of ofdi from china s private firms only accounted for 9 5 thus a state led strategy to integrate china s huge amount of ofdi was inevitable officially china claims that obor has five major goals policy coordination facilities connectivity unimpeded trade financial integration and people to people bonds straightforwardly speaking china wants to sign economic agreements with the belt and road countries to access new markets to promote chinese investment to secure its supplies of food resources and energy to export chinese products and services to enhance the yuan s role as a global currency and to increase its soft power such goals are not unreasonable ambitions all the big nations in the world strive to achieve them however as i will show later in this article the methods used to achieve them result in unwanted consequences a mutated agenda nevertheless the launch of obor was a hasty and reckless move in 2013 the two obor initiatives were first mentioned by xi jinping during his visits to kazakhstan in september the silk road economic belt and indonesia in october the 21st century maritime silk road then a month later obor was officially announced as a national strategy during a cpc central committee plenary session it s doubtful that this significant strategy could have been widely discussed within the party and government during such a short time let alone for meticulous studies to have been conducted about its negative impacts on ordinary people in the belt and road countries and potential resistance before becoming general secretary in november 2012 xi was quite a mediocre figure in the party and this probably was one of the reasons that induced the party elders to pick him thus xi and his followers needed sound political and economic accomplishments to consolidate their power actually some of the major projects of obor had been negotiated or started before its announcement in 2013 for instance planning for the china pakistan economic corridor started during musharraf s regime the agreement on the construction of gwadar port was signed as early as 2001 by then premier zhu rongji and phase one of construction was completed in 2006 packaging all the existing overseas projects into a shiny new box under xi s name was a quick way to gain credit with the expansion of xi s power and authority obor has absorbed more and more resources the china development bank and the export import bank of china are major sources of money last year the former promised that it would grant a special obor loan of 250 billion yuan in three years and the latter s obor related outstanding loans had reached 830 billion yuan by the end of the first quarter of 2018 there are also other sources in december 2014 the chinese government pledged us 40 billion for the creation of the state owned silk road fund to provide investment to obor projects in may 2017 xi pledged an additional us 14 5 billion into it the asian infrastructure investment bank aiib is also expected to provide funds for obor as well its articles of agreement were signed in 2014 and went into force in december 2015 and the bank started out with an initial capital of us 100 billion the bank of china has also issued four rounds of international bonds for obor with a total value of more than us 10 billion one cannot help but doubt the profitability and effectiveness of china s fast growing overseas investment in fact in 2017 the government had to take a series of measures to enhance regulation an improved and more rigorous system was introduced for auditing overseas investment by soes and the finance ministry issued guidelines on the overseas investment of soes amid a campaign to tighten controls on outbound investment and financial risks an important cause of this dilemma is that just like the other great plans proposed during the last six years the chinese dream millennium strategy of xiong an and made in china 2025 obor has been closely integrated with xi s personal accomplishments in 2017 the cpc even incorporated obor into its constitutionduring its 19th national congress actually during the first few years of obor there were still such as huang yiping from the china center for economic research of peking university and zhang yunling from the chinese academy of social sciences while a cult of personality around xi has been constructed by his followers doubts and challenges against obor have become taboos and obor projects have easily been given the green light from financial and government institutions a hotbed of corruption the corruption scandals of obor projects have been exposed in a range of countries such as malaysia and kyrgyzstan at home the easily obtained greenlight and a huge amount of money give the chinese officials great opportunities to enrich themselves according to a website run by the supreme people s procuratorate of china corruption occurs in the processes of decision making examination and approval land acquisition and material procurement of the obor projects in 2017 an official announcement declared that the former director of the fourth bureau of the international liaison department of the cpc cao baiyu had been expelled from the party and was investigated by the central commission for discipline inspection cao had participated in china s agricultural cooperation with african countries which was later integrated into obor and played an important role of contacting high rank officials of the relevant governments the announcement stated that he had participated in for profit activities related to his position and earned remuneration but did not give details there is also a rumor saying that sun zhengcai who was a former member of the political bureau and party committee secretary of the chongqing municipal transferred 1 billion yuan from the obor funds to his mistress s shell company in hong kong which became one of the accusations his political enemies in the party used to down him due to the untransparent nature of china s anti corruption campaign and the authority s efforts to protect the image of obor it is very hard to acquire the details of obor related corruption or prove rumors however 170 senior executives of china s state owned enterprises soes have been prosecuted by the authorities since 2013 and many of these soes have been involved in obor projects an article published by foreign policy describes how corruption is conducted within china s soes after terms are reached with a host country funds are transferred directly into the beijing based bank accounts of china s state owned enterprises which build the project often with chinese materials this is a model beijing has employed extensively in africa once beijing s political blessing for a project is communicated via funding from its policy banks china s national or provincial level state owned enterprises build it often with little or no political or financial risk assessment or market research although most of the cash will never leave china the sheer quantity of equipment and materials such as steel concrete and timber needed to produce so many projects will provide ample opportunity for pilferage and other types of on site malfeasance indeed chinese firms operating in systemically corrupt business and regulatory environments may find it impossible to gain the necessary local support without greasing palms corruption could also come via kickbacks or bribes to loan officers from self interested firms or officials padding purchase orders or cut rate building materials inadequacy at home even if individual corruption is not considered so far obor is making the state lose money rather than bringing back profits this is understandable because most infrastructure projects are long term investments although steel concrete and machinery made in china are now sold to obor countries they are paid for with loans provided by china moreover in some cases the cpc would rather gain the control of the roads railways or ports china builds in the obor countries than get the money and interest interest an amount paid in remuneration of an investment or received by a lender interest is calculated on the amount of the capital invested or borrowed the duration of the operation and the rate that has been set back hambantota port in sri lanka is a perfect example some political dissidents also argue that members of the chinese ruling class are using obor as a mean of money laundering or even to secretly transfer national wealth overseasin preparation for their lives after the collapse of the cpc regime again there is no concrete evidence to prove these conspiracy theories however the chinese government did censure some private companies that were taking the opportunity to transfer assets abroad the most notable example is wanda group which was established by the former richest man in china wang jianlin during the last several years wang sold 80 of wanda s domestic assets and spent more than 250 billion yuan buying overseas assets this strategy eventually irritated the chinese government in 2017 wang had to make the decision to put the main investment in china and by the beginning of 2018 wanda had sold 200 billion yuan worth of overseas assets anyhow investing too heavily overseas would inevitably exacerbate inadequacy at home in the first week of september this year a protest organized by parents of primary school students in an inland city called leiyang broke out and the heartbreaking video of a little girl crying for her arrested father quickly shocked china s social media the direct trigger of this protest was the provincial order to cut class sizes however due to the lack of resources in leiyang s public schools the local government had to transfer around 10 000 pupils to a private school with much more expensive fees and problematic dormitories images from the leiyang protest source youtube this incident is a miniature of china s domestic economic hardship according to a recent wall street journal article leiyang had racked up 2 464 billion yuan of outstanding debt at the end of 2017 or 111 of revenue government spending on areas such as education medical care and social welfare were inevitably affected another article pointed out in june that the city s educational resources were insufficient and the phenomenon of oversized classes was worsening the incident in leiyang is just the tip of the iceberg the pension insurance deficit in heilongjiang province and the pla veterans dissatisfaction with their scanty allowances from government reflect china s domestic financial deficiency as well besides in order to contain the social unrest caused by these dissatisfactions beijing has to spend more and more on internal security in 2017 it accounted for 6 1 of government spending which translates into us 196 billion obviously protests like the one in leiyang will not happen in the first place if beijing had used some of the money invested overseas for building public schools and hiring teachers it would also save money from paying cops to repress the protesters military build up and wolf warriors the mega construction and infrastructure projects china invests in overseas require the chinese state to make considerable efforts to protect its assets and personnel from various direct threats such as pirates local warlords and china s rivals in order to contain china the obama administration planned the so called pivot to asia strategy as early as in 2012 which included redeploying 60 percent of the us navy to the region thus military build up especially for a modernized blue water navy has become necessary for china s capitalist development the result is the second largest navy in terms of tonnage in the world china has built more than 100 warships and submarinesin the last decade which means it now has a total of 317 warships and submarines in active service outnumbering the 283 of the u s navy and this is an on going trend at least two aircraft carriers and eight type 055 super destroyers which are as big as the cruisers of the u s navy were under construction at the time of writing this article the formation of the liaoning china s first aircraft carrier at sea in april 2018 source the new york times agence france presse getty images although the overall technology level and combat experience of the plan are still behind the u s navy its stupendous size still gives beijing confidence to act in a high profile way in the disputed waters one example is the construction of artificial islands in the south china sea and the relevant naval frictions around them china s military build up and aggressiveness have inevitably exacerbated the arms race in this region in 2017 south korea increased its defense spending by 4 hitting a record of us 36 5 billion japan also signed an unprecedented defense budget of us 43 6 billion while prime minister abe has set a 2020 deadline for revising article 9 of the constitution the other regional playerswho are vigorously sharpening their gears include india taiwan australia and vietnam nevertheless the strongest response comes from the united states in may 2018 america renamed the u s pacific command as the u s indo pacific command something which has been interpreted by analysts as a change to counter china s influence in this region now nearly 60 per centof the us surface ships and over 60 per cent of us submarines have been deployed in this region as the biggest imperialist power in this region and in the world america must be the first to be blamed for this round of arms race however we also have to recognize that china s enthusiastic military expansion for challenging and even replacing the former s dominance has increased the risk of war if beijing continues the expansionist strategy it would have to spend more on the military build up to protect its overseas interests especially after the recent unyielding speech given by us vice president mike pence however in the current economic situation further increasing military spending means cuts to education social welfare or other public spending which will eventually cause more mass incidents like the one in leiyang on the other hand china s overseas expansion is a crucial part of the propaganda that is boosting the party s authority and popularity two recent popular movies wolf warrior 2 2017 and operation red sea 2018 both tell stories of chinese soldiers safeguarding china s national interests in africa wolf warrior 2 includes a scene where in order to protect its citizens a destroyer of the chinese navy fires cruise missiles to attack targets located in the territory of a sovereign state that is not at war with china in the other movie a special force squad of the chinese navy is sent into a country where a coup d état is occurring the official newspaper of the cpc the people s daily praised wolf warrior 2 for showing chinese style superhero to the world and for how it arouses the patriotic enthusiasm of many people companies government departments and even schools organized for their employees or students to watch this movie in some cases attendance was even compulsory the result was that this movie was the seventh highest grossing film of 2017 at us 874 million picture above people post on china s social media saying that their department gave free movie tickets for wolf warrior 2 to its employees and demanded compulsory attendance as an internet phenomenon in china people who dislike nationalist fanaticism also call the pro government nationalists wolf warriors in an ironic way the reporter from china central television who interrupted a criticof the chinese government at the british conservative party s annual conference and slapped a volunteer for instance was satirized by some chinese netizens as a wolf warrior type journalist however some online speeches by unofficial wolf warriors are very extreme such as advocating a nuclear attack against japan and contrary to the peaceful image of obor that the cpc is trying to create besides if xi s government could not adhere to the nationalistic and tough stance he has promised the anger of wolf warriors might backfire on their masters the rise of xenophobia reflects this dilemma faced by the party in order to achieve the soft power building goal of obor china now hosts a large number of international students from obor countries in 2017 they numbered 317 2 thousand or 64 85 of the overall international students in china they enjoy much better government benefits than china s domestic students such as higher scholarships better dorm rooms and more studying resources the inadequacy at home and of the way that this seems to oppose china first has made wolf warriors become xenophobic against people from obor countries for example a lot of online speeches blame international students from africa for having caused a large increase in aids cases in china purge instead of prosperity as the frontier and hub of the silk road economic belt one belt beijing has promised to bring prosperity and stabilityto xinjiang uyghur autonomous region xuar in some ways this is being achieved xuar s average annual gdp gdp gross domestic product gross domestic product is an aggregate measure of total production within a given territory equal to the sum of the gross values added the measure is notoriously incomplete for example it does not take into account any activity that does not enter into a commercial exchange the gdp takes into account both the production of goods and the production of services economic growth is defined as the variation of the gdp from one period to another growth from 2012 to 2016 was 9 3 percent higher than the national level in 2017 investment in fixed assets in xuar was the highest in china and more than 50 000 companies had been established or had branches set up there however for the national minorities in this region the story is quite different recently the office of the united nations high commissioner for human rights ohchr examined a report about xuar submitted by human rights organizations and accused china of holding as many as a million muslims in concentration camps according to this report the government has implemented militarized security measures invasive policing and community surveillance including through big data analytics forced hundreds of thousands of people into re education camps and drastically restricted ethnic language culture and religion these discriminatory security measures in xinjiang are dictated from the top chinese communist party ccp general secretary and the chinese president xi jinping declared in may 2014 that the government would embark on a nationwide counter terrorism campaign but largely focused on china s western regions xi jinping stated that china must construct walls built with copper and iron knit nets reaching the heavens and earth by strongly boosting police readiness through mass surveillance and mass management in order to harshly battle against violent terrorist activities regional stability and state control in xinjiang is critically important for the success of xi s belt road initiative for which the xuar is the primary land route for trade and investment in central and south asia europe and the middle east construction of a pervasive security infrastructure in xinjiang which began as early as 2009 has greatly accelerated since 2016 after xi appointed chen quanguo as the new communist party secretary for the region in response to this report and the consecutive international criticism the cpc launched a pr campaign to whitewash the re education camps in september the chinese foreign minister wang yi said in new york that the 20 million people in xuar support the measures taken by their government because they now feel safe and secure and they can have a good sleep at night hu xijin who is the chief editor of the global times and infamous for his servile speeches also posted the happy life of a uighur woman in one of the re education camps on his social media account another article of the global times describes more benefits of the camp life jobs decent income poverty alleviation tidy accommodation etc however chinese netizens ironically connect this story to the well known slogan on the entrance of auschwitz arbeit macht frei which means work sets you free in english it s true that incidents of violence and terrorism have increased in xuar in recent years but they are largely caused by the displacement of muslim communities and the aggressive attempts to assimilate uyghurs into han culture through targeted educational and work programs that incentivize the learning of mandarin and integration into the chinese state s vision of modernization just like the resistances against land grabbing and forced demolitions carried out by ordinary han chinese in other parts of china national minorities in xuar also fight back to defend their home and often in more intense and determined manners so beijing has to repress them more brutally however xuar is also the experimental field of china s 21st century authoritarianism many of the security measures that have been used there first big data facial recognition iris recognition and mobile phone checking machines have also been implemented in other parts of china thus it won t be a surprise if re education camps are constructed in other provinces in the future xuar s story shows that in the eyes of the rulers of china ordinary people are sacrificable for the great goals of obor any person with a conscience must admit that no economic achievement or national ambition can justify these atrocities conclusion last year the xinhua news agency said that obor has already made 76 major achievements and had more than 270 specific results which included all sorts of international treaties cooperation projects funds and aids this year is the fifth anniversary of obor and the propaganda machine of the cpc has produced a lot of articles to praise its greatness however they hardly ever mention any benefit brought back to the chinese people no figure about any relevant increases in terms of jobs foreign exchange reserves or domestic living standards has been found maybe it s too slapdash to conclude that there are no significant positive domestic consequences but the reality in today s china economic slowdown social instability and intensified repression shows that obor has not been able to push the country in a bright direction source globalization monitor hong kong
many investors are concerned by recent economic signs in the us but there s a different view too some key indicators suggest slower but still positive growth the real question may be how the government navigates the months ahead the us stock market got close to bear market levels just before the christmas holiday with the s p 500 index down almost 20 percent from its september peak does that mean the economy is headed toward recession forecasters generally are predicting slower growth not an outright contraction for the economy the very near term looks ok to me says joel prakken of the research firm ihs markit employment s still growing wages are picking up retail sales are strong he says interest rates remain low and the global economy is growing albeit at a cooling pace economists say it s possible something could trigger a recession but some of the risks are within the grasp of policymakers to avoid the us and china are negotiating to avoid a damaging trade war and the federal reserve needs to watch against raising short term interest rates too high in 2019 for now the stock market has moved up a bit since dec 24 we re careful not to get too carried away by these moves in stock prices even though they re fairly substantial mr prakken says it may be hard to believe with all the gyrations on wall street but the outlook for main street is surprisingly upbeat at least for the first half of 2019 the economy has so much momentum that a sudden u turn seems remote economists say employment s still growing wages are picking up retail sales are strong there s still some policy stimulus in the pipeline says joel prakken chief us economist at research firm ihs markit the very near term looks ok to me but there are some storm clouds on the horizon the divergence between the performance of the real economy and a jittery wall street is striking the us economy as measured by gross domestic product gdp probably grew 3 percent in 2018 economists say which would be its strongest performance since 2005 wall street by contrast had its worst year since 2008 why we wrote this many investors are concerned by recent economic signs in the us but there s a different view too some key indicators suggest slower but still positive growth the real question may be how the government navigates the months ahead why might main street s optimism continue well into the new year economists point to several factors among them the global economy continues to expand although it has cut its 2019 forecast a touch the organization for economic cooperation and development forecasts world gdp growing 3 5 percent almost as strong as the estimated 3 7 percent for 2018 trump tax cuts plus expanded federal spending helped juice the economy in 2018 though not expected to be as strong the fiscal stimulus is poised to continue this year interest rates remain low although the federal reserve has been raising short term interest rates to ensure inflation does not get out of hand it is still relatively inexpensive for companies and individuals to finance new business ventures the us and china have so far avoided an all out trade war they are currently working on a deal wherein the us reportedly would bring down its tariffs on chinese goods in exchange for beijing opening up its financial and other sectors to foreign firms reducing or eliminating the practice of forcing western companies to share technology with chinese partners and buying more goods from the us hope for a us china deal both sides have signaled flexibility china has already temporarily lifted tariffs on imports of us autos and purchased american soybeans for its part the trump administration has delayed by 90 days a jan 1 plan to increase tariffs from 10 percent to 25 percent on 200 billion in chinese imports deal is moving along very well president trump tweeted dec 29 after a phone call with chinese president xi jinping if made it will be very comprehensive covering all subjects areas and points of dispute expansions have never gone on forever and this one nearly a decade old and the second longest in us history looks vulnerable as early as the second half of 2019 we basically lose all the positive stimulus from the tax cuts and the bipartisan budget deal by the second half of this year says joseph song senior us economist with bank of america merrill lynch so you re probably looking at trend growth somewhere around 1 7 1 8 and when you re closer to zero percent growth even a modest shock to the economy could push it down into negative territory not everyone sees the effect of tax cuts fading supply side economists argue that corporate tax cuts will continue to boost business investment which will keep the economy humming the idea that we re on a sugar high for one year and then it s all going to go back to where it was next year is just not consistent with literature kevin hassett chairman of the white house council of economic advisers told reporters in an on the record briefing two weeks ago survey data suggests that the capital spending plans over the next year are very strong recessions need a trigger many forecasters are calling for slower but still positive growth in key economies notably the us where worries include a cooling housing market and china where sagging factory activity was a factor as some global stock markets fell on the first trading day of 2019 and recessions don t just happen something has to trigger an erosion of demand or confidence among businesses and consumers sometimes it s an investment bubble that pops such as dot com stocks in 2000 or the housing market starting in 2007 this time government moves could be the trigger for example if the government shutdown continues for the next three months it will run into the deadline for the debt limit to be reimposed failure to authorize more spending in the months ahead could spook markets and rattle consumer confidence economists say a more likely flashpoint is trade despite mr trump s upbeat tone the united states and china remain far apart because they have different strategic aims analysts say the administration wants to bring down the us trade deficit with china while president xi wants to use trade to spur china s technological development which may mean shutting out the very goods that the us excels at the more tariffs get applied the higher the drag on the economy if trump extends the trade dispute with china to other major trading partners they would retaliate and a trade war would ensue dramatically slowing economic growth for all the nations involved if the white house takes it another step and starts to put tariffs on autos i think that s when you begin to worry about recession says mr song risks from the fed s tightening a third trigger could be a mistake by the federal reserve the odds of a misstep are higher this time some economists say because the fed is trying to tamp down the inflationary effects of the government stimulus in the first half of the year while worrying about a slowdown in the second half this is not our baseline outlook but i do worry that stimulus is masking a greater underlying tightening in financial conditions than many think says michael gapen head economist at barclays investment bank in a recorded interview for investors that could lead the fed to raise interest rates at the wrong time he adds increasing the odds of recession it might seem surprising that a downturn could occur when employment is so strong alas jobs are a lagging indicator if one counts the 1980 and 1981 recessions as a single downturn then every recession since world war ii has begun when unemployment was at lows similar to today points out mr prakken of ihs markit the best predictor of a coming recession is the stock market but its wild gyrations can make it difficult to read on dec 24 the s p 500 index fell to nearly 20 percent below its sept 20 peak a line that if breached might signal the start of a bear market and a likely recession ahead but since then the index has moved back up to about 14 percent below its peak get stories that empower and

ever point gain on the day after christmas we re careful not to get too carried away by these moves in stock prices even though they re fairly substantial prakken says such volatility may slow growth by increasing uncertainty but it s unlikely to trigger a recession by itself he adds
this year opens with what now seems the perennial gift of uncertainty for exporters plying their trade across world markets that are increasingly sanctions hit and politically ostracised writes john whelan in recent years businesses have come to accept the oxymoronic qualities of the unpredictable and the unexpected and 2019 s variant looks like being a real stinker without dwelling too much on it the brexit debacle comes top of the list of uncharted waters as well as bringing unpredictable and uncertain issues for exporters and importers alike it will create a hole in the eu market one that will not be easily filled european markets look set to become more uncertain in 2019 as angela merkel s influence wains through her long farewell as german chancellor and prime influencer in eu politics there is always uncertainty when a new political leader steps up but when that means a new head of state within the largest market in europe the vibrations tend to push off the richter scale in france the unexpected emergence of the riotous gilets jaunes and the plummeting of president emmanuel macron s authority will not help the rising instability in europe managing trade relationships and sanctions are likely to be sporadic at best the old question from henry kissinger who do i call if i want to speak to europe will become more relevant this year chinese us and canadian relations which post the g20 meeting in argentina had improved have been dragged to an all time low by the arrest in canada of huawei chief financial officer meng wanzhou for her role in alleged iran sanctions violations in the us the investigation into russian interference in the 2016 presidential election appears to be reaching a crucial phase which may fatally damage the trump administration whatever else may be its fallout further trade sanctions are certainly a likelihood despite the trade wars with the us the wider asian market is expected to expand by around 5 5 accounting for nearly two thirds of global growth and holding its position as the world s most dynamic region latin america looks somewhat more stable following the election of jair bolsonaro the right wing candidate in brazil however nicaraguan politicians now join their venezuela counterparts on us sanctions lists north african markets are showing stable growth again as is the sub saharan region especially nigeria an overview from economists at the world trade organisation the oecd and the imf all point to a slowdown in global economic growth in the year ahead however the slowdown is estimated to be in the region of 0 2 which still leaves a healthy global growth rate of 3 6 the global economy is becoming increasingly digitalised and some of the emerging technologies have the potential to be truly transformative even as they pose new challenges so what should irish businesses watch for in 2019 first the cost of trade seems certain to increase this year why because interest rates are rising wages are also on the rise in ireland and are expected to accelerate during the year oil prices are slowly but surely rising secondly protectionism is disrupting established trading partners and their transport routes this has fuelled the push to local market buying or near shoring as some multinationals close down overseas facilities in favour of local production on the one hand this could assist indigenous irish companies but on the other hand it may lead to a decrease in foreign direct investment particularly among us corporates which face death by tweet from donald trump as well as fewer reasons to invest funds abroad under the new regime of lower corporate taxation thirdly currency volatility arising from brexit decisions but also from concerns that europe is not yet stable and individual countries are still capable of creating economic shocks adding to this the trade tension between the eu and us and we have the conditions for high volatility there are positives however the current low value of the euro against the dollar makes exports to the us and many asian countries which trade in dollars more competitive lastly swotting up on tariffs and strategic means of getting round their impact will be a key management activity for the year ahead a little inventiveness can enable high tariffs to be circumvented this is sometimes called tariff engineering by restructuring your products to try to get favourable duty treatment for this to work businesses need to allow enough time for their product development and design teams to re invent their new product specifications

china s experiences in the last 40 years have told us that all the problems will worsen if we can t maintain economic growth rate at a certain level yu a senior research fellow at the chinese academy of social sciences was quoted by the china business news as saying on tuesday yu yongding believes beijing needs to take every possible measure including increasing money supply and boosting fiscal spending to prevent the world s second largest economy from tanking arresting a deepening economic slowdown not making baseless deep rooted structural reforms should be the top priority for china s economy in 2019 a senior economist said without a certain level of economic growth speed structural adjustments or economic system reform will be baseless the comments by yu a former member of the central bank s monetary policy committee who has been advising chinese policymakers for years came at a time when growth is quickly losing steam amid the trade war with the united states reflecting growing concerns among researchers about a sharp deceleration yu yongding is a senior research fellow at the chinese academy of social sciences photo bloomberg the caixin purchasing managers index which tracks the activities of small and medium sized enterprises dipped below 50 0 for the first time since may 2017 when december s figures were released on wednesday showing manufacturing activities are contracting it s right to say that we should care about economic growth quality instead of speed but such reforms and adjustments can t be done in short period of time the water from afar can t quench the immediate thirst yu said the chinese government should not worry too much about the property bubble worsening of debt issue or a weakening chinese yuan while attempting to bolster growth yu added his words were the first from a renowned domestic economist on protecting the economic growth rate in 2019 when facing a potential narrowing trade surplus or even deficit and hesitant private investment after president xi jinping warned of the challenges ahead in the next 12 months in his new year s message without specifically mentioning the trade war with the us the chinese leadership highlighted the importance of promoting high quality economic growth in 2019 at the central economic work conference last month and many economists and analysts have called for beijing to show more tolerance toward a slower growth rate and focus on structural reform which has become a demand of the white house during the trade war and is necessary for sustainable development of the chinese economy china s president xi jinping did not specifically mention the trade war with the united states in his new year s address photo afp economists have warned that the us 12 trillion chinese economy will face a weaker and tougher beginning to 2019 as the growth rate is likely to drop below the psychologically important threshold of 6 per cent in the first half of the year chen gong chief researcher at independent beijing based think tank anbound consulting wrote in a research note that china must now face the truth of its economy and defending a 6 per cent growth rate would be the most urgent task figures suggest a further slowing of chinese growth in the fourth quarter from the 6 5 per cent posted in the third quarter if the official statistics show that chinese economic growth is already below 6 per cent everything will be too late he wrote it will expose various troubles and problems a large number of policies will have to be halted halfway the policy direction will have to be changed again and the government officers will be at a loss yu also called on beijing to implement expansionary fiscal policy this year increasing infrastructure investment and allowing the budget deficit to be higher than 3 per cent of gross domestic product gdp a slowing economic growth and a merely 2 per cent of the consumer price index are likely to push the central bank to adopt an expansionary monetary policy to achieve a higher nominal gdp growth rate yu said yu suggested that the people s bank of china has too many objectives in conducting monetary policy including maintaining the exchange rate and property price stability as well as some other structural goals while other central banks generally only focus on inflation it is very reasonable to think that a rising housing price has led to an increase of money supply rather than the opposite way yu said the chinese central bank should not cut money supply due to worries about the property bubble this article appeared in the south china morning post print edition as act fast to maintain growth beijing urged

while congress and the president fight over funding a border wall they continue to ignore the coming economic tsunami caused by the approximately 22 trillion dollars and rapidly increasing federal debt president trump may not be troubled by the debt s effect on the economy because he believes he will be out of office before it becomes a major problem however the crisis may come sooner than he or most people in dc expects the constituency for limited government while growing is still far outnumbered by those wanting government to provide economic and personal security from lower income americans who rely on food stamps public housing and other government programs to middle class americans who live in homes they could not afford without assistance from federal agencies like fannies mae and freddie mac to college students reliant on government subsidized student loans to senior citizens reliant on social security and medicare to billionaire ceos whose companies rely on bailouts subsidies laws and regulations written to benefit politically powerful businesses and government contracts most americans are reliant on at least one federal program many programs are designed to force individuals to accept government aid for example it is almost impossible for a senior citizen to obtain health insurance outside of medicare swords into plowshares paul ron best price 4 00 buy new 15 99 as of 11 36 utc details the welfare state is fueled by the federal reserve s easy money policies which are also responsible for the boom and bust cycle that plagues our economy the federal reserve s policies do not just distort our economy they also distort our values as the fed s dollar depreciation causes individuals to forgo savings and hard work in favor of immediate gratification this has helped create an explosion of business and individual debt there has been a proliferation of bubbles including in credit card debt auto loans and student loans there is even a new housing bubble an economy built on fiat currency and public and private debt is unsustainable eventually the bubbles will burst the most likely outcome will be the rejection of the dollar s world reserve currency status due to government debt and the federal reserve s monetization of debt when the bubbles pop the result will be an economic crisis that will likely dwarf the great depression the fall of the dollar and the accompanying economic downturn will make it impossible for the government to continue running up huge debts to finance a massive welfare warfare state thus congress will be forced to raise taxes and cut benefits cowardly politicians will likely outsource the job of raising taxes and cutting benefits to the federal reserve this will cause a dramatic increase in the most insidious of taxes the inflation tax as the federal reserve erodes the value of the dollar thus reducing the value of both earned paychecks and government provided welfare benefits a large number of americans who believe they are entitled to economic security will react by engaging in acts of violence politicians will use this violence to further crack down on civil liberties the resulting economic and civil unrest will further the growth of authoritarian political movements fortunately the liberty movement confuses to grow this movement counters the authoritarian lies with the truths of austrian economics and the non aggression principle while the years ahead may be tough if those of us who know the truth work hard to educate others the cause of liberty can prevail the best of ron paul md

pressures such as demographics slowing cyclical growth and other environmental debt and real estate market issues overall such deceleration is normal after years of rapid industrialisation and growth acceleration however decelerating growth but rising incomes if chinese government would ignore its commitment to poverty eradication higher living standards and sustainability it could achieve more rapid growth but only at the cost of people s livelihood living standards and environment on the other hand policymakers cannot accept too much deceleration either while the country s economic growth is decelerating chinese living standards should continue to rise the effort to double average incomes as measured by gdp per capita with purchasing power parity between 2010 and 2020 requires growth to remain around 6 1 percent in 2019 2020 in international comparison chinese growth rate is currently positioned to decelerate from 9 6 percent to 5 6 percent between 2008 and 2023 sign up for

slowing growth which is perceived as disruptive finally china s potential growth continues to indicate that a growth rate that exceeds 6 0 percent is achievable and viable though certainly not an easy task in the current international environment fiscal monetary accommodation and rebalancing the government is likely to prefer supportive fiscal policy as the primary tool to ensure stable growth in this quest fixed investment particularly infrastructure is expected to play a key role as consumption and export growth are likely to slow the former due to increasing consumer caution the latter due to the trade wars china s monetary stance is likely to remain accommodative which implies mild but manageable rise in inflation closer to 2 5 percent rather than 2 2 percent in 2018 consequently chinese yuan is likely to soften against the us dollar up to 7 0 as long as the current tensions overshadow the bilateral us sino relations while washington is pushing for abrupt changes in chinese economic policies beijing will stay the course as president xi jinping said in the recent 40 year anniversary of chinese economic reforms in practice policy focus will continue to shift from cyclical stimulus and debt fuelled growth toward structural reforms higher quality growth and the rebalancing of chinese economy from investment and exports toward consumption and innovation by 2030 elusive

rt com 2 jan 2019 the past year was full of events that inevitably split the global geopolitical space into two camps those who still support using us currency as a universal financial tool and those who are turning their back on the greenback global tensions caused by economic sanctions and trade conflicts triggered by washington have forced targeted countries to take a fresh look at alternative payment systems currently dominated by the us dollar rt has taken a deeper look into the recent phenomena of de dollarization summing up which countries have taken steps towards eliminating their reliance on the greenback and the reasons behind their decision china the ongoing trade conflict between the united states and china as well as sanctions against beijing s biggest trading partners have forced china to take steps towards relieving the dollar dependence of the world s second largest economy in beijing s signature soft power style the government hasn t made any loud announcements on the issue however the people s bank of china has been regularly reducing the country s share of us treasuries still the number one foreign holder of the us sovereign debt china has cut its share to the lowest level since may 2017 moreover instead of promptly dumping the greenback china is trying to internationalize its own currency the yuan which was included in the imf basket alongside the us dollar the japanese yen the euro and the british pound beijing has recently made several steps towards strengthening the yuan including accumulating gold reserves launching yuan priced crude futures and using the currency in trade with international partners as part of its ambitious belt and road initiative china is planning to introduce swap facilities in participating countries to promote the use of the yuan moreover the country is actively pushing for a free trade agreement called the regional comprehensive economic partnership rcep which will include the countries of southeast asia the trade pact could easily replace the trans pacific partnership tpp the proposed multi national trade deal which was torn up by us president donald trump shortly after he took office rcep includes 16 country signatories and the potential pact is expected to form a union of nearly 3 4 billion people based on a combined 49 5 trillion economy which accounts for nearly 40 percent of the world s gdp india ranked the world s sixth largest economy india is one of the biggest merchandise importers it s not surprising that the country is directly affected by most global geopolitical conflicts and is significantly impacted by sanctions applied to its trading partners the rest here

national treasury director general budget fiscal and economic affairs geofrey mwau right and imf expert richard allen during a session in which the lender published a fiscal transparency evaluation report for kenya in nairobi when central bank of kenya governor patrick njoroge recently told off the international monetary fund imf over the latter s remarks that the shilling was overvalued it was to cap off what had been the frosty relations between kenya and the global lender for the better of 2018 things started going south in february last year when it became apparent that the country had lost access to a precautionary credit facility this is after it failed to keep its side of the bargain in the 989 million sh100 billion stand by arrangement sba programme the move led to the insurance cover being yanked away from kenya s reach although kenya had never drawn from this facility its absence left the country exposed in case of external shocks despite kenya losing access to the facility cbk in most of the monetary policy committee briefings continued to cite the sh100 billion sba as one of the safeguards the country had against short term shocks in the foreign exchange market complete review that was not true and a media article sensationally called out the cbk for this dishonesty access to the money and programme was lost due to the failure to complete that review said imf s resident representative jan mikkelsen when he appeared before the national assembly s budget committee kenya and imf staff never reached an agreement for the second review of the programme due to fiscal slippages the disagreement was also aggravated by a law that put a ceiling on the rate that banks charged loans imf insisted that the ceiling had curtailed the flow of money into some sections of the economy fiscal deficit the difference between what the country mobilised in revenues and its expenditure had widened to 8 8 per cent of the gross domestic product gdp this exceeded the programme s target by two per cent of gdp a widening of the fiscal deficit meant that the country had to borrow more to bridge the gap a trend that the washington based institution feared would have some unfortunate ending if not checked without corrective action staff expects public debt to reach nearly 60 per cent of gdp this year 2018 said imf in a statement the debt levels that we see now are still manageable in terms of the level what we are concerned about is the flow of new debts and we see that the trajectory is going to a place where it will not be sustainable anymore and you will get into trouble eventually mikkelsen told mps a loud mouthed un professorial imf is not what kenyan authorities expected for long even as the media kept up the ante on kenya s binge borrowing the imf had always insisted that things were not that bad treasury always directed naysayers to the imf this camaraderie would be heavily tested in 2018 it was found to be wanting treasury and cbk officials eventually requested for more time to put in place policies that would return it into imf s good books they got six months on march 12 2018 the executive board of the imf approved kenyan authorities request for a six month extension of the country s sba to allow additional time to complete the outstanding reviews said the global lender the reviews are expected to be completed by september 2018 completion of the reviews will enable the kenyan authorities to have access to funds available under the precautionary sba the kenyan authorities committed to reduce the fiscal deficit and substantially modify interest controls between march and september treasury tried to play by imf s guidebook by the end of financial year 2017 18 in june it had compressed its fiscal deficit to 7 1 per cent of gdp well within its commitment to imf the narrowing was largely due to its decision to freeze most of the development projects during the period under review as part of his policy changes for the financial year 2018 national treasury cabinet secretary henry rotich brought to parliament a raft of policies including a proposal to repeal a provision in the banking amendment act 2016 that put a ceiling on interest rates charged by lenders on loans and a floor on interest rate they would give depositors but saddled with debts themselves mps resoundingly rejected rotich s bid to remove the ceiling on the interest rate charged on loans by lenders instead they opted to remove the floor on interest rate banks would give to depositors a move that is likely to discourage saving treasury had also committed to getting rid of tax exemptions to vat and income tax as part of this petroleum products would start attracting 16 per cent vat from september but this tax measure was also resisted with president uhuru kenyatta proposing to slash it by half the clock kept ticking and treasury s commitment to imf remained unfulfilled it soon became apparent that kenya wouldn t keep its side of the bargain although treasury and cbk insisted that kenya s external position was impressive and the country did not need imf s insurance it became apparent that it would be tough going into the debt market without imf s cover already bondholders for the two eurobonds that kenya had issued had placed a premium on the existence of an imf facility but relations with the imf continued to get from bad to worse kenya vetoed the publishing of a report by an imf mission which most observers had rightly suspected was due to its damning conclusion on kenya s debt the imf is in town and they are reviewing our performance we are confident in terms of our objectives but at this point we don t need the money from that perspective we have 5 9 months of import cover we are pretty comfortable in that sense said cbk governor increase taxes and when the programme lapsed there is nothing unique about any programme ending i think what s important is that we did have a very successful two year programme which is now coming to an end rotich told reporters as a country that is entering into the medium and developed countries we should be relying less and less on imf facilities especially if you have come of age in our macroeconomic management and then on october 23 came imf s damning report whose publication treasury had vetoed the report said that kenya is two steps away from experiencing difficulties in repaying her debts according to imf the country s risk of defaulting on debt repayment had increased from low to moderate as a huge repayment burden put pressure on the country s meagre revenues but that was not all the stability of the shilling for the better of 2018 which gave cbk and treasury officials the audacity to tell off imf might as well be artificial according to the report reflecting limited movement of the shilling relative to the us dollar mcm s monetary and capital markets department 2018 report on exchange rate arrangement to be published in february 2018 will reclassify kenya s shilling from floating to other managed arrangement said imf and that is why dr njoroge a former imf insider was livid it remains a wait and sees approach this year if treasury goes for another eurobond to pay off another one and then as the year came to a close it became apparent that an imf team had been in the country for 10 days from december 10 their mission to hold discussions on a new imf supported programme said imf in a press release after the visit the findings of the mission will be presented to imf s executive board its highest decision making organ who will discuss it and make a decision and kenya can only hope for the decision to be expedited before it plunges into the market this year
alert warning to america s savviest investors savers and retirees inflation rocket train accelerating fast painful carter era 70s style 500 inflation looming will your savings survive hyperinflation what happens when the banks get wiped out what if taxes soar not only for the rich can you survive if stocks collapse dear valued reader in less than a decade of reckless government expansion the fundamentals of successful investing planning and living have undergone a dramatic and potentially dangerous transformation the ground has literally changed under your feet the number of complex legal regulatory medical and retiree unfriendly tax traps has mushroomed to the point that ignorance is downright dangerous and with president biden s newest multi trillion dollar social safety net tax hike it s about to get worse the upshot is cash hungry bureaucrats are now looking for full control over everything from cash in the bank to private retirement assets held anywhere they can get their hands on it and they want to suppress alternative asset protection and wealth building information that can make people more self reliant like the kind in this letter to prosper in biden s america yes it s still possible and i ll show you how you need to consider some new developments and plan accordingly the information i want to send you is essential to anyone who wants to protect their wealth prepare for their retirement or is already in retirement i am convinced that the u s is now facing some of the most serious economic and political threats in its history after nearly 40 years of unprecedented prosperity the u s economy is now in shambles millions of americans have lost their jobs their life savings and soon it will be their homes while the u s military remains the most powerful force in the world the most immediate threats america now faces are closer to home these include companies forced out of business soaring government spending that will lead to hyperinflation runaway taxes older citizens no longer able to retire and live what used to be known as their golden years and more fortunately you don t have to just sit by and do nothing there are simple easy inexpensive steps you can take right now to protect your family but if you can t answer yes to these questions you may be behind the 8 ball have you packed away every penny you legally can for your retirement if cash hungry federal bureaucrats dilute the value of iras and other retirement accounts would you be affected what is your exposure to and what preparations have you made for the coming housing bubble collapse you deserve to be just as protected against the coming inflation wave as any tech giant or financial titan of wall street that s why i want to send you the inside information and strategies they already know before it s too late as i am about to show you with shocking urgency now is the time to make basic preparations to come out ahead in the collapsing value of dollar denominated assets to not be a victim or a sucker i have no intention of being either and i know you feel the same way at the end of this letter i will tell you how to get the newest most authoritative source of information about hidden inflation how it is ripping you off and what you can do to protect yourself the ultimate hyperinflation defense manual is probably among the most important guides i have ever offered you can t find this information anywhere else and you haven t a moment to lose a dire warning from two past federal reserve board chairs as the editor of the bob livingston letter i pay very close attention to recently resigned or soon to be departed high level u s officials once they are out of office many are remarkably candid even as the mainstream media stop reporting their words in my experience recently retired officials often hint at dangers to come leaving a trail of breadcrumbs in which americans like you and i should pay close attention that s why it s so important to note the departing warning of former federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan a man noted for understatement who flatly told congress serious economic disruptions are in the works due to trillions of dollars in federal obligations that will be visited upon taxpayers and retirees like a gigantic balloon payment and that was well before the trillions in helicopter money started raining down on america now listen to former fed chair paul volker who presided over 70 s era inflation and was even more blunt he warned that the chances of an all out dollar collapse due to runaway spending were greater than 50 50 these former insiders are referring to a level of unfunded liability by the federal government which is so gigantic as to boggle the mind to give you some idea of the scope of this problem the government would have to extract 473 000 from each and every u s household to cover the rapidly approaching national balloon payment on unfunded liabilities obviously something is going to have to give this is why i want to rush you information on how treasury bureaucrats are forming emergency contingency plans to freeze ira and 401 k accounts in the event of a national financial panic similar to the banking holidays used by the franklin roosevelt administration to bilk millions of americans during the great depression you especially need this expanded updated and revised manual because passive retirement planning is a thing of the past to get the most out of your life over 50 you can no longer listen to only one or two paid experts make your house payments and assume the best it s not enough anymore not by a long shot this is true if you re 10 15 years away from retirement and particularly if you are already in retirement the latter group has even more to lose through inaction how to live through hyperinflation in the past few months prices have been skyrocketing lumber prices have almost tripled real estate is soaring prices for some commodities have shot through the roof and let s not even talk about the grocery store but don t be fooled the current temporary period of inflation will soon be followed by even more massive inflation that s because president biden and his allies in congress have embarked on the biggest government spending spree in history this socialistic expansion of government will inevitably lead to a devaluation of the u s dollar hyperinflation that could wipe out your life savings imagine a world of 20 per gallon of gasoline 50 hamburgers and average housing rentals costing 10 000 a month or more the economic stimulus packages of the last few years alone will amount to 6 trillion nearly 7 times what the troubled assets relief program tarp program spent and the stimulus plan is only the tip of the iceberg when you add in the unfunded liabilities that s trillions the government doesn t have over the next few years whether the government borrows it or prints it an increase that big in the money supply is going to do only one thing send inflation through the roof the last time the u s government tried to spend its way out of a recession in the 1970s the inflation rate increased by 500 the ultimate

last year s report from the intergovernmental panel on climate change sounded the alarm the world has until 2030 to implement rapid and far reaching changes to our energy infrastructure and industrial systems to avoid 2 degrees celsius of warming which could be catastrophic but the scale of the challenge can appear so overwhelming that it s hard to know where to start the post asked activists politicians and researchers for climate policy ideas that offer hope radical change from one state or even the whole united states won t address climate change on its own but taking these actions could help start the planet down a path toward a better future 11 policy ideas to protect the planet set local emissions goals by peter buckland and brandi robinson in june 2017 the ferguson township board of supervisors passed a resolution recognizing the risk and threats of failing to draw down carbon emissions as a local government in pennsylvania the third largest greenhouse gas emitter in the united states despite having a right to a clean environment guaranteed in its state constitution we knew we had to act our resolution calls for carbon neutrality as soon as feasible but no later than 2050 peter buckland is the chair of the ferguson township board of supervisors brandi robinson is the chair of the ferguson township climate action committee passing the resolution provided the opportunity and arguably the imperative to integrate emissions impacts into all township decision making by setting such a goal at the local level governments can figure out what solutions fit their community s needs and work within their state s legislative landscape for ferguson township this has meant 100 percent wind power designing a leed gold public works building working on zoning changes

by roni neff when project drawdown ranked the 80 most impactful climate change solutions no 3 was addressing waste of food in the united states we waste up to 40 percent of our food supply enough nutritional value to feed millions the united nations estimates that if wasted food was a country its greenhouse gas emissions would rank third globally that s in part because of the food system s outsize climate impact it accounts for an estimated 19 percent to 29 percent of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions roni neff is an assistant professor at the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health and a program director at the johns hopkins center for a livable future the united states and many states and localities have signed onto a global target of halving wasted food by 2030 so called food waste bans policies restricting food from going to landfills can help get there five states california connecticut massachusetts rhode island and vermont and multiple municipalities and international locations have such bans or mandatory food recycling others incentivize reduced landfilling with pay as you throw approaches these policies can lead to increased food recycling composting or anaerobic digestion and related infrastructure but while preferable to leaving food to release methane in landfills recycling can t make up for the emissions that went into the food s production processing distribution heating and cooling recycling can even be perceived as a justification for discarding good food among food waste mitigation strategies by far the greater climate benefit per ton comes from avoiding unnecessary food production accordingly waste ban policies should be considered incomplete unless they promote waste prevention and donation as the preferred approaches california for instance has passed a bill requiring that by 2025 at least 20 percent of edible food that would otherwise be disposed instead be recovered to eat halving waste of food is an audacious target but it s achievable food waste bans can dramatically ramp up the prevention recovery and recycling of food most ban policies are fairly new and more research is needed but thus far it appears that approached right they can be a win win win win win for waste mitigation jobs economic activity food insecurity and of course the climate incentivize carbon farming by didi barrett the agricultural industry is a leading source of greenhouse gas emissions globally practices that improve soil health will play a critical role in our efforts to combat climate change by reducing the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and states can help by passing legislation that incentivizes carbon farming didi barrett is a democratic member of the new york state assembly carbon farming refers to climate smart agricultural practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions by sequestering or storing carbon in the soil instead of promoting its release into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide carbon farming improves soil health and productivity thereby maximizing crop yields it also increases soil resilience and reduces the need for pesticides carbon farming strategies include planting cover crops that increase water retention and soil nutrients and keep weeds down using no till approaches that limit aeration of surface soils and reduce erosion and planting diverse perennial forages with deeper root systems for grazing animals longer root systems increase organic matter carbon based molecules in the soil these practices could have a huge impact on our emissions project drawdown estimates that widespread adoption of these types of practices could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 23 2 gigatons by 2050 in new york i introduced the carbon farming act a first of its kind bill that would give farmers a financial incentive for implementing climate smart practices this legislation creates a tax credit for farmers to continue these practices and to encourage others to begin them because policies that reward rather than punish through carbon penalties for example will ultimately be more effective and equitable farmers who are responsible for producing the fresh food we put on our tables and depend on weather for their livelihoods could make significant contributions to helping us reach emission reduction goals incentivizing carbon farming practices will ensure that agriculture s future is both economically and environmentally sustainable curb the effects of meat and dairy by juliette majot we must begin regulating the factory farm model of livestock production to step up the fight on climate change a 2018 report from the institute for agriculture trade policy and grain analyzed the greenhouse gas emissions of the world s 35 biggest meat and dairy conglomerates and found that the top 20 emitted more greenhouse gases in 2016 than several organization for economic cooperation and development member countries did juliette majot is executive director of the institute for agriculture trade policy the mass production of ruminant animals produces untenable amounts of climate warming methane the conversion of large swaths of land into feed grain monocultures to raise ever growing numbers of animals emits the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide as synthetic fertilizers leach into soils and water additionally this land use change releases precious carbon stocks from soils into the atmosphere now is the time to call the meat and dairy conglomerates to account let s start by curbing both over production and emissions by securing a moratorium on new factory farms a k a cafos concentrated animal feeding operations predominantly located in low income communities and often communities of color these major polluters of air and water are already facing tenacious public opposition from north carolina to wisconsin and iowa to california and oregon communities are calling on their local and state governments to step up and better regulate these polluters then let s stop funneling taxpayer money to these big corporations through various farm bill programs such as the guaranteed loan program that often backs the construction and expansion of cafos instead we should start investing in a just transition to agricultural systems that lift up rural communities by supporting farmers practicing sustainable grazing practices expanding the infrastructure for the growing grass fed beef and dairy markets and enforcing fair market and fair contract rules for the livestock industry that will improve the quality of our food air soil water and climate adopt a carbon tax by carlos curbelo warming temperatures rising sea levels and more extreme weather caused by greenhouse emissions have the potential to adversely affect the health of every american and the strength of our economy consequently imposing substantial costs on us and future generations carlos curbelo a republican is an outgoing representative for florida s 26th congressional district in the house of representatives we must recognize these costs to our nation and world we have a responsibility to promote policies that reduce greenhouse gases while maintaining economic growth and supporting innovation we will need new ways to produce goods transport ourselves and power our economy across various sectors the best way to inspire such a wide ranging meaningful change at the pace that we need it is putting a price on carbon when carefully crafted a carbon price can strengthen our economy reduce emissions and encourage innovation that was my goal in drafting the market choice act a bill that would repeal the federal gas and aviation fuel taxes and swap them for a tax on carbon emissions at the source revenue raised would then be used to robustly fund our nation s infrastructure help coastal communities adapt to the immediate effects of climate change and give low income americans and displaced workers assistance in the transition analysis from columbia university indicates this legislation would exceed the emissions goals of the paris agreement and president barack obama s clean power plan the plan would also maintain american manufacturing competitiveness and provide regulatory certainty to allow for long term investments in cleaner energy projects so long as emissions goals are being met economic prosperity and being good stewards of our environment are not mutually exclusive by reducing our emissions we ensure the protection of our economy infrastructure and the general welfare of all americans open electric markets to competition by josiah neeley throughout much of the country consumers have no choice when it comes to buying electricity local utilities are given monopoly privileges with oversight from state regulatory bodies this system wasn t set up to keep the nation s electricity system dirty but it often functions that way over the past decade market driven declines in the price of renewable energy and natural gas have led to the closure of many coal power plants but because electric rates in monopoly systems are set based on what s needed for utilities to recover their costs the utility companies have less incentive to retire uneconomical plants josiah neeley is a senior fellow with the r street institute introducing competition to the electric market changes that instead of a centrally planned organization deciding which types of power to use electricity generators must compete with each other to provide reliable power at the lowest cost generators thus have strong incentives to switch to cleaner fuels when they become cheaper it s no mere coincidence that the state with the most wind generation texas also has the most free electric market in the nation competition can even improve the performance of fossil fuel plants between 1991 and 2005 states with electrical competition saw a 6 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from existing coal plants due to improved fuel efficiency electric competition has also made providers more responsive to the growing consumer demand for clean energy the number of green choice customers in states with retail competition increased by 142 percent from 2010 to 2012 introducing more competition into the electric system would help speed the transition to cleaner energy and even where states might not be ready to embrace full restructuring smaller steps can still help some states have considered creating an exemption to the typical monopoly restrictions for customers who want to buy 100 percent renewable electricity on the open market reducing emissions from the power sector is a critical part of the response to climate change and electric competition needs to be a part of that conversation pass a green new deal by varshini prakash we don t have a moment to waste to address the full scope of the climate crisis we need massive government action to overhaul our economy away from fossil fuels to clean energy we need a green new deal a broad and ambitious package of policies and investments that would put millions of americans to work transforming our economy away from fossil fuels by 2030 restoring the american landscape and ensuring that everyone has clean air and water all in ways that prioritize justice and equity and grow the economy varshini prakash is the founder and spokeswoman of the sunrise movement specifically we could transition 100 percent of our electricity generation to renewable sources build a national energy efficient smart grid upgrade every residential and industrial building for state of the art energy efficiency comfort and safety and transition the manufacturing agriculture and transportation industries away from coal oil and gas a green new deal would also invest in projects to capture climate damaging gases already in the atmosphere and make the united states an undisputed global leader in green technology ensuring that the advances we make can be shared with the global community while the green new deal would require a scale of government action not seen since the great depression and world war ii this type of job creating policy is extremely popular and could ensure economic security to millions of americans for the first time in decades especially people of color and poor or middle class americans who have been left out of the economic gains of the past four decades we can solve the biggest challenge humanity has ever faced and protect our air water and land for future generations young people have a right to good jobs and a livable future the green new deal is a winning plan for both editing by anna walsh illustrations by tom toles copy editing by lydia rebac
chris wellisz is on the staff of finance development at the international monetary fund imf washington dc jan 2 2019 ips it happened again and again in a career punctuated by upheavals the peso crisis of 1994 the asian crisis of 1997 and finally the big one the global financial crisis of 2008 each time he started a new government job timothy geithner hoped to find a letter from his predecessor explaining what to do and whom to call if things fell apart the desk drawer was always empty financial crises are probably the most devastating economic events that can happen to a country says geithner who fought the last conflagration as president of the federal reserve bank of new york and later us treasury secretary i d like our successors to have a better base of knowledge so every summer geithner takes time off from his job as president of warburg pincus a private equity firm to help teach a two week crisis management workshop for regulators from around the world it s one part of the yale program on financial stability which also offers a master s degree and is undertaking an ambitious project to create on a very large scale what geithner never found in that desk drawer a manual for crisis managers a lot of times we ve made the same mistakes in fighting financial crises over time simply because there was no body of knowledge that people had jointly studied and debated says andrew metrick a professor of finance at yale who founded and runs the program it s almost like you show up at the emergency room and the doctor says it looks like a broken arm i think i ve seen someone once do something for a broken arm metrick was one of those emergency room financial doctors six months after the collapse of lehman brothers in september 2008 he got a call from the obama administration they desperately needed a financial economist so metrick moved to washington to work for the council of economic advisers there as chief staff economist he helped develop programs to revive housing and financial markets when it came time to propose legislation he discovered that academic research wasn t very useful there was no real great connection between academic knowledge economic intuition and what we actually could put in the law because there just wasn t a good body of research there metrick says i was determined that when i came back to the academy i would try to be part of something that would help to fill that gap that was the genesis of the yale program on financial stability which got off the ground in 2014 with donations from organizations including the alfred p sloan foundation geithner joined soon after teaching raising money and chairing the advisory board which includes former central bankers such as the federal reserve s ben bernanke mexico s agustín carstens and malaysia s zeti akhtar aziz geithner brought a practical focus to what became known as the new bagehot crisis response project named for walter bagehot a 19th century british economist and author of lombard street a description of the money market a bible of sorts for the guardians of financial stability the project s 14 researchers compile case studies of responses to the global financial crisis and the euro crisis that followed it eventually they plan to study manias and panics going back to the south sea bubble in the 18th century while the global crisis spawned countless books articles and memoirs the bagehot project seeks to analyze it in a systematic way and determine what kinds of government actions worked what kinds didn t and why the architects of crisis fighting programs in various countries are consultants on the project our focus is really on the technical details of the interventions metrick says their plan is to create an online tool that crisis managers can turn to in real time in case they need to recapitalize a bank say or set up an emergency liquidity facility they will also learn what to avoid like ireland s decision to guarantee the liabilities of its banks which transformed a bank run into a far more serious sovereign debt crisis because the classic panic happens pretty rarely in the same country even though it happens around the world with pretty appalling frequency there s not actually that much institutional memory and there certainly wasn t at the treasury or the fed about how you deal with a systemic financial crisis geithner says in an interview the summer symposium geithner called it a war college was a two week workshop for central bankers and regulators the central banks of china europe japan and the united states all sent participants along with agencies like the bank for international settlements and the european stability mechanism another piece of the yale program is the two day financial crisis forum where veterans including former treasury secretary henry paulson offer their insights on subjects from capital injections to frozen money markets for the current generation of officials especially the younger ones who attend the conference learning from history is vital says paul tucker deputy governor of the bank of england from 2009 to 2013 going forward current officials also need to learn from the crises that believe it or not were averted or successfully contained finally there is yale s one year master s degree in systemic risk which offers early career professionals a chance to hone their skills and develop new ones a recent graduate is özgü özen çavuşoğlu who returned to her job in the financial stability division of turkey s central bank and is now researching an early warning system for the country s economy just as important she says was the opportunity to forge bonds with colleagues from across the globe we are living in an interconnected world özen çavuşoğlu says that s why the network of people with the same understanding will play an important role in having a stable global economy the link to the original article
last year s report from the intergovernmental panel on climate change sounded the alarm the world has until 2030 to implement rapid and far reaching changes to our energy infrastructure and industrial systems to avoid 2 degrees celsius of warming which could be catastrophic but the scale of the challenge can appear so overwhelming that it s hard to know where to start the post asked activists politicians and researchers for climate policy ideas that offer hope radical change from one state or even the whole united states won t address climate change on its own but taking these actions could help start the planet down a path toward a better future 11 policy ideas to protect the planet set local emissions goals by peter buckland and brandi robinson in june 2017 the ferguson township board of supervisors passed a resolution recognizing the risk and threats of failing to draw down carbon emissions as a local government in pennsylvania the third largest greenhouse gas emitter in the united states despite having a right to a clean environment guaranteed in its state constitution we knew we had to act our resolution calls for carbon neutrality as soon as feasible but no later than 2050 peter buckland is the chair of the ferguson township board of supervisors brandi robinson is the chair of the ferguson township climate action committee passing the resolution provided the opportunity and arguably the imperative to integrate emissions impacts into all township decision making by setting such a goal at the local level governments can figure out what solutions fit their community s needs and work within their state s legislative landscape for ferguson township this has meant 100 percent wind power designing a leed gold public works building working on zoning changes

color these major polluters of air and water are already facing tenacious public opposition from north carolina to wisconsin and iowa to california and oregon communities are calling on their local and state governments to step up and better regulate these polluters then let s stop funneling taxpayer money to these big corporations through various farm bill programs such as the guaranteed loan program that often backs the construction and expansion of cafos instead we should start investing in a just transition to agricultural systems that lift up rural communities by supporting farmers practicing sustainable grazing practices expanding the infrastructure for the growing grass fed beef and dairy markets and enforcing fair market and fair contract rules for the livestock industry that will improve the quality of our food air soil water and climate adopt a carbon tax by carlos curbelo warming temperatures rising sea levels and more extreme weather caused by greenhouse emissions have the potential to adversely affect the health of every american and the strength of our economy consequently imposing substantial costs on us and future generations carlos curbelo a republican is an outgoing representative for florida s 26th congressional district in the house of representatives we must recognize these costs to our nation and world we have a responsibility to promote policies that reduce greenhouse gases while maintaining economic growth and supporting innovation we will need new ways to produce goods transport ourselves and power our economy across various sectors the best way to inspire such a wide ranging meaningful change at the pace that we need it is putting a price on carbon when carefully crafted a carbon price can strengthen our economy reduce emissions and encourage innovation that was my goal in drafting the market choice act a bill that would repeal the federal gas and aviation fuel taxes and swap them for a tax on carbon emissions at the source revenue raised would then be used to robustly fund our nation s infrastructure help coastal communities adapt to the immediate effects of climate change and give low income americans and displaced workers assistance in the transition analysis from columbia university indicates this legislation would exceed the emissions goals of the paris agreement and president barack obama s clean power plan the plan would also maintain american manufacturing competitiveness and provide regulatory certainty to allow for long term investments in cleaner energy projects so long as emissions goals are being met economic prosperity and being good stewards of our environment are not mutually exclusive by reducing our emissions we ensure the protection of our economy infrastructure and the general welfare of all americans open electric markets to competition by josiah neeley throughout much of the country consumers have no choice when it comes to buying electricity local utilities are given monopoly privileges with oversight from state regulatory bodies this system wasn t set up to keep the nation s electricity system dirty but it often functions that way over the past decade market driven declines in the price of renewable energy and natural gas have led to the closure of many coal power plants but because electric rates in monopoly systems are set based on what s needed for utilities to recover their costs the utility companies have less incentive to retire uneconomical plants josiah neeley is a senior fellow with the r street institute introducing competition to the electric market changes that instead of a centrally planned organization deciding which types of power to use electricity generators must compete with each other to provide reliable power at the lowest cost generators thus have strong incentives to switch to cleaner fuels when they become cheaper it s no mere coincidence that the state with the most wind generation texas also has the most free electric market in the nation competition can even improve the performance of fossil fuel plants between 1991 and 2005 states with electrical competition saw a 6 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from existing coal plants due to improved fuel efficiency electric competition has also made providers more responsive to the growing consumer demand for clean energy the number of green choice customers in states with retail competition increased by 142 percent from 2010 to 2012 introducing more competition into the electric system would help speed the transition to cleaner energy and even where states might not be ready to embrace full restructuring smaller steps can still help some states have considered creating an exemption to the typical monopoly restrictions for customers who want to buy 100 percent renewable electricity on the open market reducing emissions from the power sector is a critical part of the response to climate change and electric competition needs to be a part of that conversation pass a green new deal by varshini prakash we don t have a moment to waste to address the full scope of the climate crisis we need massive government action to overhaul our economy away from fossil fuels to clean energy we need a green new deal a broad and ambitious package of policies and investments that would put millions of americans to work transforming our economy away from fossil fuels by 2030 restoring the american landscape and ensuring that everyone has clean air and water all in ways that prioritize justice and equity and grow the economy varshini prakash is the founder and spokeswoman of the sunrise movement specifically we could transition 100 percent of our electricity generation to renewable sources build a national energy efficient smart grid upgrade every residential and industrial building for state of the art energy efficiency comfort and safety and transition the manufacturing agriculture and transportation industries away from coal oil and gas a green new deal would also invest in projects to capture climate damaging gases already in the atmosphere and make the united states an undisputed global leader in green technology ensuring that the advances we make can be shared with the global community while the green new deal would require a scale of government action not seen since the great depression and world war ii this type of job creating policy is extremely popular and could ensure economic security to millions of americans for the first time in decades especially people of color and poor or middle class americans who have been left out of the economic gains of the past four decades we can solve the biggest challenge humanity has ever faced and protect our air water and land for future generations young people have a right to good jobs and a livable future the green new deal is a winning plan for both editing by anna walsh illustrations by tom toles copy editing by lydia rebac

after such a volatile 2018 predicting what the stock market will do in 2019 is like guessing where a single piece of paper will land in a windstorm few saw this year s market mayhem coming after an unusually sanguine and calm 2017 investors have some reasons for optimism in 2019 the economy remains relatively strong companies fundamentals appear robust too and stocks are undervalued compared to their expected earnings yet political turmoil rising protectionism a hawkish fed and slowing earnings and economic growth have sent shivers down investors spines lately those fears caused markets to jolt up and mostly down in dramatic fashion in 2018 so what are the risks for investors in 2019 1 slower earnings growth the stock market responds to many data points but corporate earnings are the most important of them all if companies grow their stocks typically rise wall street analysts expect earnings in 2019 will grow far less than than they did in 2018 corporate profits rose 23 in 2018 because companies were shot with a caffeine injection from the tax cuts at the beginning of the year that buzz has already started to wear off and 2019 s growth won t look nearly as hot by comparison the dollar has also been rising throughout the year the us dollar index is up about 5 this year pinching corporate profits for america s multinational companies a strong dollar makes us products more expensive abroad and can dampen international sales lindsey bell cfra research investment strategist told cnn business she expects earnings to grow 7 in 2019 that s about on par with wall street s 2019 profit growth forecast of less than 10 that s strong but not exactly something investors are thrilled about still the s p 500 is trading at just 14 5 times next year s expected earnings well below its historical average of 16 times earnings that s one reason why stock analysts believe markets are due for a comeback also stocks were so universally battered that the year s best sector health care rose just 5 while the worst sector energy fell 18 5 that tight range between the best and worst sectors is well below average typically a positive omen for stocks the following year should history repeat and there s no guarantee it will this year s lump of coal could metamorphize into an unanticipated gem said sam stovall chief investment strategist at cfra research but even if they do bounce back can stocks sustain a rally sure says tony dwyer analyst at canaccord genuity perhaps for a time but even if stocks bounce back he doubts the enthusiasm will last 2 a global economic slowdown most economists aren t predicting a recession around the corner that alone has some market analysts questioning why stocks have fallen so dramatically in recent months once the market realizes a recession isn t imminent it will find a bottom and slowly climb back to all time highs again said chris zaccarelli chief investment officer at independent advisor alliance but america s economic expansion the second longest in history is under threat boosted by the tax cuts and the lowest unemployment rate in a generation the us economy boomed in the middle of 2018 growing at an annual rate of 4 2 in the second quarter and 3 4 in the third quarter but the federal reserve believes the pace of economic expansion will slow in 2019 to 2 3 after decades of sharp expansion the chinese economy is slowing down too growth in 2018 is set to be the weakest since 1990 and 2019 looks even worse brexit could knock the united kingdom off its feet in 2019 fear of a global economic slowdown has dragged stocks from their all time highs set in late september investors worry about the federal reserve s plans for 2019 if it raises rates too quickly the fed could artificially slow the economy or even bring about a recession inflation is not currently a problem so the central bank has the ability to slow its rate raising pace if it wants if the fed continues to ignore the weakening inflation data and maintains their current projected path it could cause an even bigger disaster said dwyer by contrast if the fed signals it will stop hiking rates dwyer believes stocks could reach new highs in 2019 3 political instability dysfunction in washington and the united kingdom have thrown investors for a loop no one knows what to make of brexit other than it s bad no matter what form it takes and potentially disastrous if march 29 rolls around without a deal the us government shutdown probably won t mean much for the economy in the near term but it has concerned investors that the impasse may portend bad news for a looming debt ceiling showdown american lawmakers must pass a law next year so the treasury department can continue to borrow without any restrictions if they fail the government could default on its debt when that nearly happened in 2011 credit rating agency standard and poor s downgraded america one notch below a perfect aaa another downgrade could make the united states already massive debt load much costlier to pay back trade tensions still loom over the economy and markets too the trump administration is threatening to raise tariffs on billions of dollars worth of chinese goods if china fails to meet us demands on a variety of economic and political issues american companies pay those tariffs and they pass costs onto consumers who account for two thirds of america s gdp and trump s continued threats to undermine the fed chair that he appointed show no signs of abating investors may not love federal reserve chairman jerome powell s hawkish policy but they crave consistency and threatening to unseat a fed chair in the middle of his term could throw the markets into chaos as the market continues to worry about a recession the implications of a trade war with china and unpredictable and adverse political decision making from the white house we are going to continue to see volatility said zaccarelli
credit imf washington dc jan 02 ips chris wellisz is on the staff of finance development at the international monetary fund imf it happened again and again in a career punctuated by upheavals the peso crisis of 1994 the asian crisis of 1997 and finally the big one the global financial crisis of 2008 each time he started a new government job timothy geithner hoped to find a letter from his predecessor explaining what to do and whom to call if things fell apart the desk drawer was always empty financial crises are probably the most devastating economic events that can happen to a country says geithner who fought the last conflagration as president of the federal reserve bank of new york and later us treasury secretary i d like our successors to have a better base of knowledge so every summer geithner takes time off from his job as president of warburg pincus a private equity firm to help teach a two week crisis management workshop for regulators from around the world it s one part of the yale program on financial stability which also offers a master s degree and is undertaking an ambitious project to create on a very large scale what geithner never found in that desk drawer a manual for crisis managers a lot of times we ve made the same mistakes in fighting financial crises over time simply because there was no body of knowledge that people had jointly studied and debated says andrew metrick a professor of finance at yale who founded and runs the program it s almost like you show up at the emergency room and the doctor says it looks like a broken arm i think i ve seen someone once do something for a broken arm metrick was one of those emergency room financial doctors six months after the collapse of lehman brothers in september 2008 he got a call from the obama administration they desperately needed a financial economist so metrick moved to washington to work for the council of economic advisers there as chief staff economist he helped develop programs to revive housing and financial markets when it came time to propose legislation he discovered that academic research wasn t very useful there was no real great connection between academic knowledge economic intuition and what we actually could put in the law because there just wasn t a good body of research there metrick says i was determined that when i came back to the academy i would try to be part of something that would help to fill that gap that was the genesis of the yale program on financial stability which got off the ground in 2014 with donations from organizations including the alfred p sloan foundation geithner joined soon after teaching raising money and chairing the advisory board which includes former central bankers such as the federal reserve s ben bernanke mexico s agustín carstens and malaysia s zeti akhtar aziz geithner brought a practical focus to what became known as the new bagehot crisis response project named for walter bagehot a 19th century british economist and author of lombard street a description of the money market a bible of sorts for the guardians of financial stability the project s 14 researchers compile case studies of responses to the global financial crisis and the euro crisis that followed it eventually they plan to study manias and panics going back to the south sea bubble in the 18th century while the global crisis spawned countless books articles and memoirs the bagehot project seeks to analyze it in a systematic way and determine what kinds of government actions worked what kinds didn t and why the architects of crisis fighting programs in various countries are consultants on the project our focus is really on the technical details of the interventions metrick says their plan is to create an online tool that crisis managers can turn to in real time in case they need to recapitalize a bank say or set up an emergency liquidity facility they will also learn what to avoid like ireland s decision to guarantee the liabilities of its banks which transformed a bank run into a far more serious sovereign debt crisis because the classic panic happens pretty rarely in the same country even though it happens around the world with pretty appalling frequency there s not actually that much institutional memory and there certainly wasn t at the treasury or the fed about how you deal with a systemic financial crisis geithner says in an interview the summer symposium geithner called it a war college was a two week workshop for central bankers and regulators the central banks of china europe japan and the united states all sent participants along with agencies like the bank for international settlements and the european stability mechanism another piece of the yale program is the two day financial crisis forum where veterans including former treasury secretary henry paulson offer their insights on subjects from capital injections to frozen money markets for the current generation of officials especially the younger ones who attend the conference learning from history is vital says paul tucker deputy governor of the bank of england from 2009 to 2013 going forward current officials also need to learn from the crises that believe it or not were averted or successfully contained finally there is yale s one year master s degree in systemic risk which offers early career professionals a chance to hone their skills and develop new ones a recent graduate is özgü özen çavuşoğlu who returned to her job in the financial stability division of turkey s central bank and is now researching an early warning system for the country s economy just as important she says was the opportunity to forge bonds with colleagues from across the globe we are living in an interconnected world özen çavuşoğlu says that s why the network of people with the same understanding will play an important role in having a stable global economy the link to the original article
investors enter 2019 remaining increasingly uncertain about where sovereign bond markets are heading given the confused interplay between interest rates growth and inflation that intensified in q4 2018 the knock on effect from us interest rates will have a material impact on the dollar and equity markets thus it s a necessity that the markets are focused firmly on the fed despite fed officials continuing to express confidence in the u s economy the market remains worried that even though the fed has scaled back its rate raising plans for 2019 higher interest rates still pose a risk to expansion note the fed last month had penciled in two hikes for 2019 rather than the three officials predicted in september however the market sees things differently fixed income dealers have priced out any additional hikes this year with fed fund futures implying no change and a 25 bps cut in 2020 it s not just the fed actions that will have an impact on volatility but it s what they will also say in 2019 investors need to keep an eye on the fed s own messaging chairman jermone powell will have the opportunity to once again lay out the fed s direction for 2019 as he joins janet yellen and ben bernanke for a joint discussion this friday at 10 15am edt officials have signalled they intend to rely more on recent economic data in setting interest rates and coupled with fed chair powell s intention to hold news conferences after every fomc policy meeting will only add to the volatility the new year started on the back foot with global equities under pressure after disappointing chinese data overnight has ruined investors hopes for an upbeat start to 2019 safe havens including gold euro bonds and the yen have benefited in early trading with all this in mind here are five things the

at 53 19 per barrel down 1 1 percent from their final close of 2018 west texas intermediate wti futures were down 1 percent at 44 95 per barrel a number of factors are expected to provide heightened volatility in the commodity space in q1 2019 geopolitically there is the markets uncertainty on sino us trade brexit and conflict in the middle east there is also the matter of us shale output numbers and opec s and russia s supply discipline all factors that are expected to have a meaningful impact on energy price in h1 3 sovereign yields buckle a disappointing chinese pmi print overnight is keeping the demand for safety going especially for german bunds overnight german government bund yields dropped to its lowest in 20 months as investors piled into one of the safest assets in the world on the back of widening stock market weakness and a gloomy global growth outlook the yield on germany s 10 year debt briefly dropped to 0 17 percent it s lowest since april 2017 before edging up to 0 183 percent down 6 bps the german 2 10 spread is at its tightest in over two years at 79 90 bps on the horizon supply will be an important factor for eurozone bond markets this month as countries

cips manufacturing purchasing managers index pmi rose to 54 2 from an upwardly revised 53 6 in november the highest reading in six months and stronger than all forecasts markit said the improvement did not herald a big change in the outlook for britain s stuttering economy and was caused in large part by manufacturers stockpiling inputs and finished goods both of which were near record highs it s worth noting that in december the bank of england boe cut its forecasts for quarterly growth to just 0 2 percent in q4 of 2018 and q1 of 2019 it has warned that a worst case brexit could push

published wednesday 2 january 2019 print disqus graceland updates by stewart thomson jan 1 2019 1 as the new year begins gold continues to gain respect as the ultimate investment asset unfortunately the same cannot be said for the us dollar 2 most investors tend to view the dollar as a safe haven but the big bank forex traders that really move the currency market view the dollar as a risk on asset class 3 they view gold and the japanese yen as the main risk off assets so when the dollar falls against the yen and gold as the us stock market rises all may not be quite as well as investors think it is 4 please click here now double click to enlarge after building an immense sloping h s top pattern the dollar has collapsed against the yen and is now almost in free fall 5 that top pattern is technically a head and shoulders top bear consolidation pattern and its implications are ominous 6 at my www guswinger com swing trade service where i personally take all the trades myself i m

the spectacularly bullish price action taking place on the long term gold chart 9 india s government is launching a new pro gold policy within a few weeks that will see gold become endorsed as a respected investment asset class by the government a significant chop in the import duty will likely follow and discussions are already underway with russian entities about duty free imports 10 in america the current collapse in the dollar comes late in the business cycle the big bank forex departments are almost universally negative on the dollar and rightly so 11 please click here now double click to enlarge the dollar melt down against the yen is happening as the us stock market trades lower on ramped up quantitative tightening that fed chair powell now says is on auto pilot investors who ignore quantitative tightening in the late stage of the us business cycle are making as big a mistake as ignoring quantitative easing at the 2009 trough of the cycle 12 also a dow theory sell signal could take place in 2019 if both the transports and the industrials cannot make new daily closing highs and then break the current lows 13 i m long the dow now via udow but that s just a technical swing trade albeit a winner already in the big picture investors need to think about only one thing in 2019 and that is gold 14 while the job market is officially very tight a lot of that tightness can be explained by the large number of part time jobs the labour department counts one worker working two part time jobs as two people working that s arguably fraudulent accounting regardless the huge number of part time jobs is the main cause of the slow growth in wage inflation 15 having said that as the full time jobs market tightens significantly in 2019 much more wage inflation will appear and it will do so as corporate earnings fade towards the single digits growth range 16 in a nutshell welcome america to the rebirth of stagflation 17 i ve predicted that investors are making a mistake if they sit around and wait for trump to make things great while the us government debt rises ever higher in the late stage of the business cycle it s an understandable mistake that comes from frustration with the hideous socialist and war mongering policies of past us administrations the murderous war mongering has been financed with gargantuan debt making it even more vile 18 regardless the much wiser plan of action is to use trump s incredible work ethic and business acumen as personal inspiration to take professional action in the gold and silver market 19 on that note please click here now double click to enlarge this awesome silver chart i wanted to see a three day close over 15 20 a friday close over that same price and i also hoped to see that cake iced with a 2018 year end close above 15 20 20 all three technical events occurred while the short term target is the decent price area at 16 i am projecting much higher prices over the 2019 2022 time frame it s important that all precious metals investors understand that while gold soared above its 1980 high in 2010 2011 silver barely made it back to its 1980 high of about 50 that s because the world has been in a general deflationary lower rates cycle since about 1980 21 now stagflation and higher rates over the long term like occurred in america in 1966 1980 is beginning when silver barely made it back to its 1980 high after 30 years the price action was not parabolic like it was in the late 1970s it was more of a modest blip related to gold dragging silver modestly higher in an overall risk off play what s coming for silver now is much different than what happened in 2011 it will be parabolic as stagflation reaches a crescendo years from now but it s only barely beginning 22 please click here now double click to enlarge i ve boldly referred to gdx as prince of assets gdx and called the entire 23 18 price zone the most important investor accumulation zone in the history of markets 23 with maverick money managers like ray dalio calling for a us inflationary depression while amateur investors try to gamble on the late stage of the stock market cycle i predict there s a 90 chance that i m proven correct 24 on this gdx chart i d like investors to note the bullish action the enormous volume and also take a close look at the 21 67 resistance area that gdx has already closed above repeatedly since arriving there all the price action is positive and it s poised to become much more positive as january trading gets underway perhaps i should let queen gold and king

the trump administration and china are facing growing pressure to blink in their six month stare down over trade because of jittery markets and portents of economic weakness the import taxes the two sides have imposed on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of each other s goods and the threat of more to come have heightened anxiety on each side of the pacific the longer their trade war lasts the longer companies and consumers will feel the pain of higher priced imports and exports their conflict is occurring against the backdrop of a slowdown in china and an expected u s slump that a prolonged trade war could worsen a fear that s weighing on financial markets yet those very pressures analysts say give the two countries a stronger incentive to make peace the u s and china now have a strong shared interest in striking a deal in order to halt the downward spiral in business and investor confidence which have taken a beating in both their economies said eswar prasad professor of trade policy at cornell university in ithaca n y the economic threats agreed wang yong an international relations specialist at peking university might be conducive to negotiations by nudging beijing toward market oriented changes long sought by the united states still it will hardly be easy to bridge the complex differences between the world s top two economies they range from president donald trump s insistence that china buy more u s products to widespread assertions that beijing steals trade secrets from foreign companies operating in china negotiations between the two nations are expected to resume next week gao feng a spokesman for china s commerce ministry said last week that the two sides have made specific arrangements for face to face meetings and are talking by phone gao offered no details and the office of the u s trade representative declined to confirm the talks the world is watching anxiously china and the united states are the main engines of the world noted song lifang an economist at renmin university in beijing that makes their dispute a matter not only for the two countries but for the world globally significant the dispute is a major factor in a slowdown in global growth song said and a settlement would help in arresting the decline of the economies of the two countries and of the world trump has long complained about america s gaping trade deficit with china the gap between what americans sold and what they bought from china in 2017 amounted to 336 billion and will likely be higher in 2018 but the dispute goes far deeper than lopsided exports and imports it s fundamentally a high stakes conflict over the economy of the future the u s accuses china of deploying predatory tactics in a drive to surpass america s technological supremacy a report in march by the u s trade representative accused china of hacking into u s companies computer networks to steal secrets and coercing american companies to hand over technology as the price of admission to the chinese market to try to compel china to reform its ways washington has imposed tariffs on 250 billion in chinese imports beijing has counterpunched by taxing 110 billion in u s goods trump had been set to raise the tariffs on most of the chinese goods on jan 1 but he and president xi jinping agreed to a 90 day cease fire to try to resolve their differences since then the case for peace has strengthened as economic risks in the u s and china have grown and financial markets have reeled for 2018 the dow jones industrial average america s highest profile stock market benchmark fell nearly 6 percent its worst performance since 2008 china s shanghai composite index sank nearly 25 percent on top of concerns about collateral damage from the u s china trade war investors in the u s markets are worrying about rising interest rates and a wobbly u s real estate market fears are growing that the second longest economic expansion in u s history could slide to a halt next year or in 2020 cutting a deal with beijing could help at least reduce the threat china s economy has been decelerating since the government pulled back on bank lending a year ago to try to curb a run up in debt the international monetary fund estimates that china s economy grew about 6 6 percent in 2018 down from 6 9 percent in 2017 but heavy government spending masked weakness in private sector activity in december factory activity shrank for the first time in more than two years auto sales in china plunged 16 percent in november from a year earlier it was the fourth month of contraction and it put annual sales in the world s biggest auto market on track to contract for the first time in three decades despite its softening economy china will most likely find it difficult to comply with u s demands to slow its economic ambitions those ambitions cut to the heart of china s drive to become the world s 21st century economic superpower u s demands it is difficult to solve the trade dispute immediately because the u s demands are too high especially demands for changes in china s economic and social systems which are difficult for china to accept said song the economist at renmin university wendy cutler a former u s trade negotiator said the u s most likely can t realistically settle for anything less than an agreement by beijing to reform how it does business there are certainly compelling reasons for both sides to reach a deal and avoid further tariff increases said cutler now vice president at the asia society policy institute however these reasons can only take you so far without a strong deal that addresses structural issues it sets the administration up for critics to say you took us into a trade war for this
the failure of arab development is multifaceted in nature and manifests itself at all levels economic political and geopolitical over the last three decades three profound shifts have marked the landscape of global political economy while these have opened new economic and political possibilities for the developing world the middle east has remained insulated from these winds of change and their transformative impact the first shift is political in nature often dubbed the third wave of democratisation and defined by a gradual opening of the political system to more representative forms of government the second shift represents successful economic diversification in several emerging economies of asia africa and latin america a third trend is represented by the growing prominence of intra regional trade in developing countries through their active participation in regional trade initiatives all of these shifts have bypassed the middle east judged by any of the above metrics the region has either stagnated regressed or severely lagged behind with the largest proportion of autocracies it is one of the few regions in the world that remains an outlier to the third wave of democratisation on the economic front the region continues to be mired in primary commodity dependence while many of its comparators have succeeded in diversifying their export structures and while the middle east has hosted numerous platforms for regional trade promotion mutual arab trade remains hopelessly inadequate over the last four decades for example intra regional trade as a share of total trade has hovered at around nine to 10 percent this stands in sharp contrast to the dramatic growth and significance of regional trade in emerging economies the region s failure in these three overlapping domains reveals the paradox of arab underdevelopment and deserves an explanation that combines the economic political and geo political aspects of development consider the region s failed attempts at economic diversification every resource rich country in the region has faithfully adhered to tall promises of diversifying their economic structure away from an excessive dependence on oil and gas revenues yet if anything the region s overall reliance on hydrocarbons has increased over time what explains this gap between intentions and outcomes to understand this one must first acknowledge that the core challenge of economic diversification is not technical but political clearly the challenge of diversification is deeper than simply learning the right lessons from successful experiences in norway malaysia or botswana after all if the recipes for diversification are so widely known why have arab countries not seriously pursued them to diversify their economies resource rich countries need to develop the non oil sector which entails among other things producing a greater number and variety of goods including those at the higher end of the value chain that involve more complex forms of production the problem is that the effects of doing so are rarely politically neutral political scientists have long recognised that structural change in the economy is usually accompanied by new forms of political contestation new sources of income breed new constituencies since economic power can easily translate into political power for this one needs to look no further than turkey whose recent political transition is undergirded by fundamental economic changes on the ground the appeal of turkey s justice and development party akp is based not just on its populist narrative but the material interests of a constituency empowered by turkey s vibrant economy in the arab milieu where the overriding concern of rulers is to separate the economy from polity a concerted drive towards economic diversification carries genuine political risks with a prolonged legacy of centralised rule dating back to the mamluk era arab regimes rest on two pillars patronage and control such a political order runs counter to the logic of a dynamic economy that requires cultivating dense economic linkages among various parts of the supply chain there is a clear danger that such vibrant linkages in the economy can serve as the basis for horizontal cooperation in this context it is hardly surprising that resource rich arab economies have consistently failed to rise up to the challenge of diversification these economies are doubly deprived in this regard suffering both from the burden of history and oil whatever weak constituency of private production was inherited by these countries was further emaciated after the discovery of oil even where rulers were more dependent on merchants prior to the discovery of oil such as kuwait oil tied down the merchant class in state contracts and other forms of patronage while the private sector has shown greater dynamism in gulf countries it still remains structurally dependent on the state diversification is further hindered by macroeconomic challenges that oil rich economies face by virtue of their exposure to commodity price cycles the pro cyclicality of fiscal policy which is a universal feature of arab resource rich economies means that oil cycles are accompanied by budgetary cycles that make planning for long term investment more difficult counter cyclical fiscal policies which require that countries spend less in periods of higher oil prices are politically difficult to implement the underlying political settlement in these countries gives rise to extensive and sticky distributive claims in the form of salaries subsidies and defence spending as is widely recognised resource rich economies also find it particularly difficult to build a productive regime for competitive diversification since the dominance of the oil sector is likely to lead to exchange rate appreciation which prices their non oil exports out of global markets but the absence of a competitive exchange rate regime is not just the consequence of a dominant oil sector an overvalued exchange is also favoured by lobbies representing the non tradeable sector which are strong and pervasive throughout the region historically economic exchange in the middle east has stayed in the hands of importers and distributors who depend on simple arbitrage opportunities and prefer a fixed and overvalued exchange rate this adverse politics of diversification is difficult to bypass in the midst of multiple development traps while the region s resource rich economies are exposed to global price shocks there are few institutional shock absorbers to mitigate the effect of such events herein lies the problem for oil rich countries the same factors that are needed to cope with oil price volatility are also needed for diversification this does not mean that diversification is impossible to achieve in these economies it is simply that diversification attempts are selective and often take forms that are politically more acceptable to local elites in the uae bahrain oman and parts of north africa liberalisation of the financial sector has provided such a politically safe avenue for diversification financial sector liberalisation has offered lucrative brokerage opportunities for state elites who through carefully brokered partnership opportunities with foreign banks have derived additional rents two additional factors make financial liberalisation a politically palatable form of diversification first the bulk of private sector credit extended by the financial sector is earmarked for real estate projects second land is principally owned by the state together this means that even when the financial sector enhances its lending to the private sector it is unlikely to give rise to independent forms of accumulation that might threaten the political order but the political challenges of diversification are by no means limited to the region s oil exporting nations even resource scarce countries are afflicted with similar constraints at varying levels of intensity consider morocco and tunisia the two countries that have had some success in developing the private sector although export structures in both countries are less concentrated than their other mena counterparts exports have expanded mostly along the intensive rather than extensive margin effectively this means that these countries have mostly relied on existing export relationships rather than establishing new products and trading partners additionally in tunisia policy regimes have traditionally segmented the offshore sector which is mainly export oriented from the onshore sector oriented towards the domestic markets furthermore economic activity remains confined to a closed circle that protects its privilege by virtue of its proximity to state elites such systematic undermining of market competition serves a larger political purpose since it provides much needed rents in countries where oil rents are either absent or scarce but where rents are nevertheless needed to solidify elite coalitions but while these market generated rents support the prevailing authoritarian order the resulting crony capitalism undermines productive capacity it militates genuine economic diversification which requires a level playing field that reduces barriers to entry and mobility this pattern of economic control is shared by other states in the region including lebanon where concessions to monopolies have long been used as a principal means of distributing privilege when pressed for reform mena countries have been reluctant to take the leap resulting in the partial reform syndrome where trade liberalisation is selectively pursued to protect elite interests in egypt for example average tariffs have fallen since the mid 1990s but their dispersion has increased at the same time this is because despite the general reduction in tariff barriers sectors dominated by connected actors continue to benefit from relatively higher protectionism thus a sector is more likely to benefit from higher trade protection if a political or army crony is active in the sector similar patterns are revealed through an analysis of non tariff barriers in tunisia the greater presence of political cronies in a sector increases the likelihood of that sector bring protected through non tariff measures which are more discretionary and non transparent in spite of the plethora of excuses used to justify flagging economies if middle eastern countries have difficulty diversifying their economies despite their tall promises and grandiose plans it is probably more to do with politics than the mere absence of good policy informed strategy or weak implementation
gold traded highly bearish during 2018 however when looking from perspective of financial year gold is currently in neutral state despite a year filled with high impact news driven trading activity much of which was owing to major geo political and economical issues gold failed to see any bullish price action as the yellow metal lost its status as preferred safe haven asset among investors to us greenback us greenback was highly bearish for first three quarters supported by multiple rate hikes from us federal reserve which greatly boosted its value in broad market and painted a positive long

scale us political economic woes hurt dollar boosting demand for yellow metal despite majority of geo political and economical issues being initiated by usa the us dollar basked in all its glory as a safe haven asset backed by strong fundamentals in form of positive us macro data multiple fed rate hikes and positive price action in us bond market the major issues which created high demand for safe

of saudi journalist resulting tensions between usa saudi sino u s trade war us tariff on european markets with main focus on automotive products crude oil price decline following us tariff on iranian crude while few other issues that inspired safe haven demand are not mentioned in the list above mentioned events had greater long term impact on price action of yellow metal since yellow metal traded in international market and us markets are denominated in us dollar investing in bullion was deemed as a costly act with no possible profit owing to gold being non interest yielding asset price action surrounding gold was further hampered as broad based firm dollar which continued to grow made it costly investment owing to higher exchange rate leading to lesser participating from china india and other emerging markets which was were majority of action surrounding yellow metal came from owing to said markets viewing gold as a back up against inflation story continues alt at close of third quarter of fy 2018 19 gold is viewed to be in neutral level as political and economic issues in us market greatly affected greenback s value in broad market this combined with unfavorable proceedings in geo political issues and concerns of slowdown in global economy helped yellow metal reclaim losses from first two quarters ending december 2018 on neutral levels gold started regaining upper hand when us mid term elections saw democrats take control of the house divided results in election weakened outlook of greenback as president trump was expected to face difficulties moving ahead with his plans on divided congress following this first week of december saw gold move range bound owing to positive headlines from g 20 summit which saw us president trump chinese premier xi jing ping agree to delay tariff s by 90 days greatly boosting risk appetite however gold retained gains from previous month on investors worries over economic slowdown in global markets and us treasury yield curve inversion the remaining three week s of december saw gold price climb steadily second week saw gold price climb on increased safe haven demand owing to french yellow vest protest causing damage worth hundreds of millions of dollars and brexit deal being pulled out of parliamentary approval which resulted in eu initiating no deal scenario proceedings across major markets this was further supported by concerns of global economic slowdown which caused bearish rout in equity market the third week saw gold gain further on back of subdued usd over weak us macro data and fed forward guidance which was highly in contrast to investors expectations with fed signalling two rate hikes in 2019 despite signs of slowdown in us economy while analysts and traders believed fed would put a pause to rate hike gold to remain fundamentally supported across january this move caused greenback to fall so hard resulting in exchange rate falling significantly in emerging markets bringing in flood of cash flow from china india other emerging markets the gains made were further supported by spike in demand for bullion on last week of december amid increased uncertainties and volatility in holiday season which combined with falling demand for greenback owing to partial shutdown of us government on trump tantrums over finance for border wall and investors seeking protection of safe haven asset amid thin trading volumes helped gold gain significantly with proper fundamental support moving forward market is set to resume normal trading activity post holiday season and gold is expected to remain supported across the month much of issues mentioned above remain unresolved and this is expected to keep safe haven assets in significant demand across january us greenback is expected to continue trading bearish owing to ongoing political crisis in usa which will help boost participation from emerging markets gold will also see increased demand owing to brexit proceedings which suggests yellow

investors enter 2019 remaining increasingly uncertain about where sovereign bond markets are heading given the confused interplay between interest rates growth and inflation that intensified in q4

david matthews is a lecturer in sociology and social policy at coleg llandrillo wales and the leader of its degree program in health and social care a mental health crisis is sweeping the globe recent estimates by the world health organization suggest that more than three hundred million people suffer from depression worldwide furthermore twenty three million are said to experience symptoms of schizophrenia while approximately eight hundred thousand individuals commit suicide each year 1 within the monopoly capitalist nations mental health disorders are the leading cause of life expectancy decline behind cardiovascular disease and cancer 2 in the european union 27 0 percent of the adult population between the ages of eighteen and sixty five are said to have experienced mental health complications 3 moreover in england alone the predominance of poor mental health has gradually increased over the last two decades the most recent national health service adult psychiatric morbidity survey illustrates that in 2014 17 5 percent of the population over the age of sixteen suffered from varying forms of depression or anxiety compared to 14 1 percent in 1993 additionally the number of individuals whose experiences were severe enough to warrant intervention rose from 6 9 percent to 9 3 percent 4 in capitalist society biological explanations dominate understandings of mental health infusing professional practice and public awareness emblematic of this is the theory of chemical imbalances in the brain focusing on the operation of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine which has gripped popular and academic consciousness despite remaining largely unsupported 5 moreover reflecting the popularity of genetic reductionism within the biological sciences there has been an effort to identify genetic abnormalities as another cause of mental health disorders 6 nonetheless explanations based on genomics have also failed to generate conclusive evidence 7 while potentially offering illuminating insights into poor mental well being in specific cases biological interpretations are far from sufficient on their own what is abundantly clear is the existence of significant social patterns that elucidate the impossibility of reducing poor mental health to biological determinism 8 the intimate relationship between mental health and social conditions has largely been obscured with societal causes interpreted within a bio medical framework and shrouded with scientific terminology diagnoses frequently begin and end with the individual identifying bioessentialist causes at the expense of examining social factors however the social political and economic organization of society must be recognized as a significant contributor to people s mental health with certain social structures being more advantageous to the emergence of mental well being than others as the basis on which society s superstructural formation is erected capitalism is a major determinant of poor mental health as the marxist professor of social work and social policy iain ferguson has argued it is the economic and political system under which we live capitalism which is responsible for the enormously high levels of mental health problems which we see in the world today the alleviation of mental distress is only possible in a society without exploitation and oppression 9 in what follows i briefly sketch the state of mental health in advanced capitalism using britain as an example and utilizing the psychoanalytical framework of marxist erich fromm which emphasizes that all humans have certain needs that must be fulfilled in order to ensure optimal mental health supporting ferguson s assertion i argue that capitalism is crucial to determining the experience and prevalence of mental well being as its operations are incompatible with true human need this sketch will include a depiction of the politically conscious movement of users of mental health services that has emerged in britain in recent years to challenge biological explanations of poor mental health and to call for locating inequality and capitalism at the heart of the problem mental health and monopoly capitalism in the final chapters of monopoly capital paul baran and paul sweezy made explicit the consequences of monopoly capitalism for psychological well being arguing that the system fails to provide the foundations of a society capable of promoting the healthy and happy development of its members 10 exemplifying the widespread irrationality of monopoly capitalism they illustrated its degrading nature it is only for a fortunate minority that work can be considered pleasurable while for the majority it is a thoroughly unsatisfactory experience attempting to avoid work at all costs leisure frequently fails to offer any consolation as it is also rendered meaningless rather than being an opportunity to fulfill passions baran and sweezy argued that leisure has become largely synonymous with idleness the desire to do nothing is reflected in popular culture with books television and films inducing a state of passive enjoyment rather than demanding intellectual energies 11 the purpose of both work and leisure they claimed largely coalesces around increasing consumption no longer consumed for their use consumer goods have become established markers of social prestige with consumption as a means to express an individual s social position consumerism however ultimately breeds dissatisfaction as the desire to substitute old products for new ones turns maintaining one s position in society into a relentless pursuit of an unobtainable standard while fulfilling the basic needs of survival baran and sweezy argued both work and consumption increasingly lose their inner content and meaning 12 the result is a society characterized by emptiness and degradation with little likelihood of the working class instigating revolutionary action the potential reality is a continuation of the present process of decay with the contradictions between the compulsions of the system and the elementary needs of human nature becoming ever more insupportable resulting in the spread of increasingly severe psychic disorders 13 in the current era of monopoly capitalism this contradiction remains as salient as ever modern monopoly capitalist society continues to be characterized by an incompatibility between on the one hand capitalism s ruthless pursuit of profit and on the other the essential needs of people as a result the conditions required for optimum mental health are violently undermined with monopoly capitalist society plagued by neuroses and more severe mental health problems erich fromm mental health and human nature baran and sweezy s understanding of the relationship between monopoly capitalism and the individual was significantly influenced by psychoanalysis for one they made references to the centrality of latent energies such as libidinous drives and the need for their gratification moreover they accepted the freudian notion that social order requires the repression of libidinal energies and their sublimation for socially acceptable purposes 14 baran himself wrote on psychoanalysis he had been associated with the institute for social research in frankfurt in the early 1930s and was directly influenced by the work of eric fromm and herbert marcuse 15 it is within this broad framework that a theory of mental health can be identified in baran and sweezy s analysis with the contradictions between capitalism and human need expressing themselves chiefly through the repression of human energies it was fromm most notably who was to develop a unique marxist psychoanalytical position that remains relevant to understanding mental health in the current era of monopoly capitalism and it was from this that baran in particular was to draw 16 while making explicit the importance of sigmund freud fromm acknowledged his greater debt to karl marx considering him the preeminent intellectual 17 accepting the freudian premise of the unconscious and the repression and modification of unconscious drives fromm nonetheless recognized the failure of orthodox freudianism to integrate a deeper sociological understanding of the individual into its analysis turning to marxism he constructed a theory of the individual whose consciousness is shaped by the organization of capitalism with unconscious drives repressed or directed toward acceptable social behavior while marx never produced a formal psychology fromm considered that the foundations of one resided in the concept of alienation 18 for marx alienation was an illustration of capitalism s mortifying physical and mental impact on humans 19 at its heart it demonstrates the estrangement people feel from both themselves and the world around them including fellow humans alienation s specific value for understanding mental health lies in illustrating the distinction that emerges under capitalism between human existence and essence for marx capitalism separates individuals from their essence as a consequence of their existence this principle permeated fromm s psychoanalytic framework which maintained that under capitalism humans become divorced from their own nature human nature marx argued consists of dual qualities and we must first deal with human nature in general and then with human nature as modified in each historical epoch 20 there are needs that are fixed such as hunger and sexual desires and then there are relative desires that originate from the historical and cultural organization of society 21 inspired by marx fromm argued that human nature is inherent in all individuals but that its visible manifestation is largely dependent on the social context it is untenable to assume man s mental constitution is a blank piece of paper on which society and culture write their text and which has no intrinsic quality of its own the real problem is to infer the core common to the whole human race from the innumerable manifestations of human nature 22 fromm recognized the importance of basic biological needs such as hunger sleep and sexual desires as constituting aspects of human nature that must be satisfied before all else 23 nonetheless as humans evolved they eventually reached a point of transcendence from the animal to the uniquely human 24 as humans found it increasingly easier to satisfy their basic biological needs largely as a result of their mastery over nature the urgency of their satisfaction gradually became less important with the evolutionary process allowing for the development of more complex intellectual and emotional capacities 25 as such an individual s most significant drives were no longer rooted in biology but in the human condition 26 considering it imperative to construct an understanding of human nature against which mental health could be evaluated fromm identified five central characteristics of the human condition the first is relatedness aware of being alone in the world humans strenuously endeavor to establish ties of unity without this it is intolerable to exist as an individual 27 second the dominance of humans over nature allows for an easier satisfaction of biological needs and for the emergence of human aptitudes contributing to the development of creativity humans developed the ability to express a creative intelligence transforming this into a core human characteristic that requires fulfillment 28 third humans psychologically require rootedness and a sense of belonging with birth severing ties of natural belonging individuals constantly pursue rootedness to feel at one with the world for fromm a genuine sense of belonging could only be achieved in a society built on solidarity 29 fourth humans crucially desire and develop a sense of identity all individuals must establish a sense of self and an awareness of being a specific person 30 fifth it is psychologically necessary for humans to develop a framework through which to make sense of the world and their own experiences 31 representing what fromm argued to be a universal human nature the satisfaction of these drives is essential for optimum mental well being as he contended mental health is achieved if man develops into full maturity according to the characteristics and laws of human nature mental illness consists in the failure of such development 32 rejecting a psychoanalytical understanding that emphasizes the satisfaction of the libido and other biological drives mental health he claimed is inherently associated with the satisfaction of needs considered uniquely human under capitalism however the full satisfaction of the human psyche is thwarted for fromm the origins of poor mental health are located in the mode of production and the corresponding political and social structures whose organization impedes the full satisfaction of innate human desires 33 the effects of this on mental health fromm argued are that if one of the basic necessities has found no fulfillment insanity is the result if it is satisfied but in an unsatisfactory way neurosis is the consequence 34 work and creative repression like marx fromm asserted that the instinctual desire to be creative had the greatest chance of satisfaction through work in the economic and philosophic manuscripts of 1844 marx strenuously argued that labor should be a fulfilling experience allowing individuals to be freely expressive both physically and intellectually workers should be able to relate to the products of their labor as meaningful expressions of their essence and inner creativity labor under capitalism however is an alienating experience that estranges individuals from its process alienated labor marx contended is when labour is external to the worker i e it does not belong to his essential being therefore he does not affirm himself but denies himself does not feel content but unhappy does not develop freely his physical and mental energy but mortifies his body and ruins his mind 35 under capitalism great efforts are made to ensure human energy is channeled into labor even though it is often miserable and tedious 36 rather than satisfying the need to express creativity it frequently represses it through the monotonous and grueling obligation of wage labor 37 in britain there is widespread dissatisfaction with work one recent survey of employees conducted in early 2018 estimated that 47 percent would consider looking for a new job during the coming year of the reasons given a paucity of opportunities for career advancement was prominent along with not enjoying work and employees feeling like they do not make a difference 38 these reasons begin to illustrate an entrenched alienation from the labor process many people experience work as having little meaning and little opportunity for personal fulfillment and expression from such evidence a claim can be made that in britain as in many monopoly capitalist nations a substantial portion of the labor force feels disconnected from their work and does not consider it a creative experience for fromm the realization of creative needs are essential to being mentally healthy having been endowed with reason and imagination humans cannot exist as passive beings but must act as creators 39 nevertheless it is clear that work under capitalism does not achieve this considerable evidence suggests that far from being beneficial to mental health work is actually detrimental to it although the exact figures are likely to remain unknown due to the intangibility of such experiences it can be inferred that for many members of the labor force it is commonplace for work to provoke general unhappiness dissatisfaction and despondency moreover more severe mental health conditions such as stress depression and anxiety are increasingly emerging as the consequences of discontentment at work in 2017 18 such conditions constituted 44 percent of all work related ill health in britain and 57 percent of all workdays lost to ill health 40 an additional study in 2017 estimated that 60 percent of british employees had suffered work related poor mental health in the past year with depression and anxiety being some of the most common manifestations 41 rather than a source of enjoyment the nature and organization of work under capitalism clearly does not act as a satisfactory means to fulfill an individual s creativity as baran and sweezy argued the worker can find no satisfaction in what his efforts accomplish 42 instead work alienates individuals from a fundamental aspect of their nature and in so doing stimulates the emergence of varying negative states of mental health with around half of the labor force in britain having experienced work related mental health issues and many more likely feeling a general sense of despondency there exists what fromm termed a socially patterned defect 43 it is no exaggeration to argue that the deterioration of mental well being is a standard response to wage labor in monopoly capitalist societies negative feelings become commonplace and to varying degrees are acknowledged as normal reactions to work with the exception of severe mental health disorders many forms of mental distress that develop in response are taken for granted and not considered legitimate problems as such the degradation of mental well being is normalized meaningful association and loneliness for fromm there existed an inherent relationship between positive mental health meaningful personal relationships in the form of both love and friendship and expressions of solidarity acutely aware of their aloneness in the world individuals attempt to escape the psychological prison of isolation 44 nonetheless the operation of capitalism is such that it frequently prevents the satisfactory fulfillment of this need the inadequacy of social relationships within monopoly capitalist societies was identified by baran and sweezy they argued a frivolity had descended over much social interaction as it became typified by superficial conversation and a falsity of pleasantness the emotional commitments required for friendship and the intellectual efforts needed for conversation were made largely absent as social interaction became increasingly about acquaintances and small talk 45 contemporary monopoly capitalism is no exception while difficulties in measuring its existence and nature abound arguably one the most widespread neuroses to plague present day capitalism is loneliness it is increasingly considered a major public health concern perhaps most symbolically evident with the establishment of a minister for loneliness in 2018 by the british government as a neurosis loneliness has debilitating consequences individuals may resort to alcohol and drug abuse to numb their misery while persistent experience increases blood pressure and stress as well as negatively impacts cardiovascular and immune system functioning 46 a mental health condition in its own right loneliness exacerbates additional mental health problems and is often the root cause of depression 47 in 2017 it was estimated that 13 percent of individuals in britain had no close friends with a further 17 percent having average to poor quality friendships moreover 45 percent claimed to have felt lonely at least once in the previous two weeks with 18 percent frequently feeling lonely although a close loving relationship acts as a barrier to loneliness 47 percent of people living with a partner reported feeling lonely at least some of the time and 16 percent often 48 reflecting the dominant scientific constructs of mental health recent efforts have been made to identify genetic causes of loneliness with environmental conditions said to exacerbate an individual s predisposition to it 49 however even the most biologically deterministic analyses concede that social circumstances are important to its development nonetheless few studies attempt to seriously illustrate the extent to which capitalism is a contributing factor individualism has always reigned supreme as a principle upon which the ideal capitalist society is constructed individual effort self reliance and independence are endorsed as the hallmarks of capitalism as understood today the notion of the individual has its origins in the feudal mode of production and its emphasis on greater collectivist methods of labor such as within the family or village being surrendered to the compulsion of individuals who have to be free to sell their labor power on the market prior to capitalism life was conducted more as part of a wider social group while the transition to capitalism developed and allowed for the emergence of the isolated private individual and the nuclear increasingly privatized family 50 fromm contended that the promotion and celebration of the virtues of the individual means that members of society feel more alone under capitalism than under previous modes of production 51 capitalism s exaltation of the individual is made further apparent by its potent opposition to the ideals of collectivism and solidarity and preference and incentive for competition individuals it is said must compete with each other on a general basis to enhance their personal development more specifically competition is economically one of the bases on which the market operates and ideologically corresponds to the widespread belief that to be successful one must compete with others for scarce resources the consequence of competition is that it divides and isolates individuals other members of society are not considered as sources of support but rather obstacles to personal advancement ties of social unity are therefore greatly weakened thus loneliness is embedded within the structure of any capitalist society as an inevitable outcome of its value system not only is loneliness integral to capitalist ideology it is also exacerbated by the very functioning of capitalism as a system as a result of capitalism s inexorable drive for self expansion the growth of production is one of its elementary characteristics having become an axiomatic notion rarely is the idea of expanded production challenged the human cost of this is crippling as work takes precedence over investing in social relationships furthermore neoliberal reforms have left many workers with progressively more precarious jobs and less protections guaranteed benefits and hours of employment all of which have only aggravated loneliness amplifying the proletarianization of the labor force with ever more workers existing in a state of insecurity and experiencing increased exploitation the centrality of work has become greater as the threat of not having a job or being unable to secure an adequate standard of living has become a reality for many in a flexible labor market 52 individuals have no choice but to devote more time to work at the expense of establishing meaningful relationships the growing attention given to work can be illustrated in relation to working practices despite the fact that the average length of the working week increased in britain following the financial crisis of 2007 09 the broader picture over the last two decades has officially been one of decline part time workers however have witnessed the number of hours they work increase along with the number of part time jobs additionally between 2010 and 2015 there was a 15 percent rise in the number of full time members of the labor force working more than forty eight hours per week the legal limit additional hours must be agreed upon by employer and employee 53 furthermore in 2016 one employee survey illustrated that 27 percent worked longer than they would like negatively impacting their physical and mental health and 31 percent felt that their work interfered with their personal life 54 significantly loneliness is not just a feature of life outside of work but a common experience during work in 2014 it was estimated that 42 percent of british employees did not consider any coworker to be a close friend and many felt isolated in the workplace greater engagement in productive activities at the expense of personal relationships has been labeled the cult of busyness by psychiatrists jacqueline olds and richard schwartz 55 while they accurately identify this trend they nonetheless evaluate it in terms of workers freely choosing such a life this elides any serious criticisms of capitalism and the reality that the cult of busyness has largely been an outcome of the economic system s inherent need for self expansion furthermore olds and schwartz fail to accept the trend as a reflection of the structural organization of the labor market which makes more work a necessity instead of a choice the avoidance of loneliness and the search for meaningful relationships are fundamental human desires but capitalism suppresses their satisfactory fulfillment along with the opportunities to form common bonds of love and friendship and to work and live in solidarity in response as baran and sweezy argued the fear of being alone drives people to seek some of the least fulfilling social relationships which ultimately result in feelings of greater dissatisfaction 56 materialism and the search for identity and creativity for monopoly capitalism consumption is a vital method of surplus absorption in the era of competitive capitalism marx could not foresee how the sales effort would evolve both quantitatively and qualitatively to become as important for economic growth as it has 57 advertising product differentiation planned obsolescence and consumer credit are all essential means of stimulating consumer demand at the same time there is no shortage of individuals willing to consume alongside the acceptance of work fromm identified the desire to consume as an integral characteristic of life under capitalism arguing it was a significant example of the uses to which human energies are directed to support the economy 58 with consumer goods valued for their conspicuity rather than their intended function people have gone from consuming use values to symbolic values the decision to engage in popular culture and purchase a type of automobile brand of clothing or technological equipment among other goods is frequently based on what the product is supposed to convey about the consumer frequently consumerism constitutes the principal method through which individuals can construct a personal identity people are emotionally invested in the meanings associated with consumer goods in the hope that whatever intangible qualities items are said to possess will be passed on to them through ownership under monopoly capitalism consumerism is more about consuming ideas and less about satisfying inherent biological and psychological needs fromm contended that consumption should be a concrete human act in which our senses bodily needs our aesthetic taste are involved the act of consumption should be a meaningful experience in our culture there is little of that consuming is essentially the satisfaction of artificially stimulated phantasies 59 the need for identity and creative fulfillment encourages an insatiable appetite to consume each purchase however regularly fails to live up to its promise rarely is satisfaction truly achieved through consumption because what is being consumed is an artificial idea rather than a product that imbues our existence with meaning in this process consumerism as a form of alienation becomes evident instead of consuming a product designed to satisfy inherent needs consumer goods exemplify their synthetic nature via their manufactured meanings and symbolisms which are designed to stimulate and satisfy a preplanned response and need 60 any identity a person may desire or feel they have obtained from consuming a product as well as any form of creativity invoked by a consumer good or item of popular culture is false rather than cultivating joy the affluence of the monopoly capitalist nations has bred a general widespread dissatisfaction as high value is placed on amassing possessions while consumerism as a value exists in all capitalist societies in those of greater inequality with britain displaying wider wealth disparities than most the desire to consume and acquire greatly contributes to the emergence of neuroses as the effort to maintain social status and emulate those at the top of society becomes an immense strain the impact of this has been demonstrated within british families in recent years in 2007 unicef identified britain as having the lowest level of child well being out of twenty one of the most affluent organisation for economic co operation and development nations in response an analysis of british families was conducted in 2011 comparing them to those in spain and sweden countries that ranked in the top five for child well being 61 of the three nations the culture of consumerism was greatest in britain as it was prevalent among all families regardless of affluence british parents were considered more materialistic than their spanish and swedish counterparts and behaved accordingly toward their children they purchased the most up to date branded consumer goods largely because they thought it would ensure their child s status among their peers this was a value shared by the children themselves with many accepting that social prestige was based on ownership of branded consumer goods which evidence suggests contributed to arising worry and anxiety especially for children from poorer households who recognized their disadvantage while a compulsion to purchase new goods continuously for themselves and their children was identified among british parents many nonetheless also felt the psychological strain of attempting to maintain a materialistic lifestyle and caved to such pressures across all three countries children identified the needs for their own well being as consisting of quality time spent with parents and friends and opportunities to indulge their creativity especially through outdoor activities despite this the research showed that in britain many were not having such needs satisfied parents struggled to spend enough time with their children due to work commitments and often prevented them from participating in outdoor activities due to safety concerns subsequently parents compensated for this with consumer goods which largely failed to meet their children s needs as such the needs of british children to form and partake in meaningful relationships and act creatively were repressed and efforts to satisfy these needs through consumerism failed to bring them happiness resistance as class struggle while not denying the existence of biological causes the structural organization of society must be recognized as having serious repercussions on people s mental health monopoly capitalism functions to prevent many from experiencing mental well being yet despite this the medical model continues to dominate reinforcing an individualistic conception of mental health and obscuring the detrimental effects of the present mode of production this oppresses users of mental health services by subordinating them to the judgment of medical professionals the medical model also encourages the suspension and curtailment of individuals civil rights if they experience mental distress including by legitimizing the infringement of their voluntary action and excluding them from decision making for those who suffer mental distress life under capitalism is frequently characterized by oppression and discrimination aware of their oppressed status users and survivors of mental health services are now challenging the ideological dominance of the medical model and its obfuscation of capitalism s psychological impact furthermore they are increasingly coalescing around and putting forward as an alternative the need to accept the marxist inspired social model of mental health the social model of disability identifies capitalism as instrumental to the construction of the category of disability defined as impairments that exclude people from the labor market adopting a broadly materialist perspective a social model of mental health addresses material disadvantage oppression and political exclusion as significant causes of mental illness in 2017 in britain the mental health action group national survivor user network unequivocally rejected the medical model and planted social justice at the heart of its campaign as part of its call for a social approach to mental health the group explicitly denounces neoliberalism arguing that austerity and cuts to social security have contributed to the increasing prevalence of individuals who suffer from poor mental health as well as to the exacerbation of existing mental health issues among the population recognizing social inequality as a contributor to the emergence of poor mental health national survivor user network proposes that the challenge posed by mental health service users should be part of a wider indictment of the general inequality in society arguing that austerity measures damaging economic policies social discrimination and structural inequalities are causing harm to people we need to challenge this as part of a broader social justice agenda 62 furthermore the action group recovery in the bin positions itself and the wider mental health movement within the class struggle pushing for a social model that recognizes capitalism as a significant determinant of poor mental health moreover representing ethnic minorities kindred minds vigorously campaigns on an understanding that mental distress is less a result of biological characteristics and more a consequence of social problems such as racism sexism and economic inequality pathologised as mental illness 63 for kindred minds the catalyst for deteriorating mental health is oppression and discrimination with ethnic minorities having to suffer greater levels of social and economic inequality and prejudice capitalism can never offer the conditions most conducive to achieving mental health oppression exploitation and inequality greatly repress the true realization of what it means to be human opposing the brutality of capitalism s impact on mental well being must be central to the class struggle as the fight for socialism is never just one for increased material equality but also for humanity and a society in which all human needs including psychological ones are satisfied all members of society are affected by the inhumane nature of capitalism but slowly and determinedly the fight is being led most explicitly by the most oppressed and exploited the challenge posed must be viewed as part of the wider class struggle as being one front of many in the fight for social justice economic equality dignity and respect notes

holiday parties are fun for economists when the stock market is up and calm then we are regaled with stories of savvy picks and personal triumphs like the ones discussed on articles such as the motley fool stock advisor review when equities head south along the pattern of a rat seeking out of a maze folks irritably ask professor what s wrong my answer is not much two facts should color assessments of the recent market correction stocks are undervalued and the outlook for the u s economy remains solid when stocks similar to fx structured products peaked in early october the average price earnings ratio the price we pay for company profits for the s p 500 index it captures about 80 percent of publicly traded enterprises was 21 that was well below the quarter century moving average of 25 stocks are really inexpensive with average price earnings ratio even lower as company earnings continue to rise if you are looking for stocks with good return khan resources can be a profitable investment option the economy is decelerating the nearly 4 percent growth accomplished during the second and third quarters is not sustainable but the economy will continue to grow close to 3 percent and is creating more jobs than pessimists thought possible factoring in inflation at 2 percent corporate profits should continue to rise in the high single digits and support increasing stock prices still the market is in a cyclical funk for several reasons but those are more like a kidney stone that will pass albeit painfully than a terminal illness growth prospects abroad are not good and that has driven investors from equities across the globe into treasuries driving down stock prices and longer term interest rates if you re thinking about investing today you d be better off investing in pink diamonds for a higher roi it is fashionable in left leaning financial media to blame china s slowing economy on president trump s trade war but his tariffs have not had a lot of grip most of those are at 10 percent and since april the yuan has dropped about that much to erase their pricing effects for years china has been in a credit bubble with state banks and a shadow lending system on steroids papering over fraudulent bookkeeping now the bill is coming due europe s funk is not new the european union eu has no credible immigration policy or border defenses about 1 6 percent of germany s population are recent refugees mostly lacking language skills and capable of little more than loitering in railway stations and menial work eurozone restrictions on deficit spending make it virtually impossible for italy and france to restructure labor market and business policies for the age of artificial intelligence robotics and small tech startups sensing folly the u k voted for brexit but prime minister theresa may has conspired with other eu leaders to indefinitely shackle her countrymen to the eu corpse it s important to remember that the imminent drivers of growth and stock market value artificial intelligence robotics and small startups that create and exploit those technologies can happen anywhere and entrepreneurs will find homes in america southern and eastern asia and the u k if it manages to unshackle itself from moribund european statism more details in america much of the trump rally was powered by the faang stocks facebook apple amazon netflix and google apple is approaching market saturation with iphones and is in the painful process of developing new business lines to redeploy its substantial capital google amazon and facebook face tough antitrust challenges facebook and google must address privacy and fake news issues and have employees in rebellion against their leadership netflix faces a host of new direct over the internet competitors flogging movies and original content generally the faangs have been more volatile in recent months and declined more than the market in general the good news is that most of the rest of the market is a downright bargain with price eaarnings significantly under 20 the trade war with china has rattled ceos and investors but the one thing i know about major trade talks is that if national leaders believe markets will tank if they fail they will likely find some kind of face saving agreement to sign declare victory and go home and gullible wall street will break out into euphoria in the short run the stock market is not the economy if that were so the recent market correction would imply unemployment at 7 3 percent not its current 3 7 percent in the long run the economy drives the stock market in the end solid economic growth cannot be denied that is likely where we are headed and then stock prices will recover peter morici is an economist and business professor at the university of maryland and a national columnist copyright c 2019 news world communications inc this content is published through a licensing agreement with acquire media using its newsedge technology
democrats are coming into control of the house and entering the 2020 presidential primary unified in their opposition to president donald trump but split on almost everything else expanding access to health care is a clear priority but there is no consensus on how to do it progressives are pushing for a green new deal a comprehensive package that would reimagine the us economy and the government s place in it that has been met with skepticism and a few notes of hostility by party centrists other fights are brewing over raising the national minimum wage trade and middle east policy these internal disputes will play out on two stages over the coming year the floor of the newly democratic controlled house and in the 2020 primary debates which begin in june party angst over how to beat trump in 2020 will fuel these fights with establishment forces worried about alienating the suburban moderates who powered the party s 2018 wave while the insurgent progressives make the case that only bold new initiatives can renew and turn out its working class base here is a look ahead at some of the debates that will animate the coming year getting real about medicare for all medicare for all a form of single payer health care is the party s most popular big ticket proposal for delivering on its promise of universal health care a solution to the ongoing challenges facing the affordable care act that even former president barack obama seemed to endorse in a speech this past fall lawmakers and liberal think tanks began to sketch out the narrower terms of the debate in 2018 rolling out a variety of plans that would either chart a path to universal government backed care or expand coverage by allowing americans to buy in to programs like medicare or medicaid the push for a buy in offer which would effectively create some form of the public option scuppered by congressional democrats during the obamacare negotiations in 2009 was given a boost during the party s leadership scramble after new york rep brian higgins secured an assurance last month from nancy pelosi to prioritize a plan to allow people 50 and older to buy into medicare but with democrats still in the senate minority and shut out of the white house proponents of more comprehensive reform are unlikely to accept compromise terms last year independent vermont sen bernie sanders a likely 2020 candidate who caucuses with the democrats secured 16 cosponsors to his latest and most detailed legislation which introduced a four year plan for gradually moving millions of americans onto the rolls of a beefed up version of medicare at least five of the names on the bill in addition to sanders are considering runs in 2020 new york sen kirsten gillibrand who helped write the transition plan new jersey sen cory booker massachusetts sen elizabeth warren california sen kamala harris and oregon sen jeff merkley there s going to be a question if any of those other potential presidential candidates take power do they actually want to create a single payer program or is it just a messaging strategy to win people over with big ideas waleed shahid a spokesman for the progressive group justice democrats told cnn do they support the end of private health insurance in the united states of america because that is what the bill is proposing to do we re going to get way more into the specifics than we did in 2016 raising worker wages since democrats last held the house in 2010 a movement for higher minimum wages has swept through the states making 15 an hour the new benchmark for a livable income a bill to move the national minimum wage to that level by 2024 is on the democratic to do list but already some on the left think that s too timid the proposals attracting the most attention if not votes are those that super size the federal safety net and provide a public option for employment meant to raise wages by creating more competition for workers harris lift act would expand the earned income tax credit to so many people that it resembles a universal basic income an idea that has gained momentum over the past year alternatively sanders and gillibrand have proposed a federal job guarantee which would provide employment on public works projects to whomever wants to work but the bulk of the caucus probably won t go that far members of the moderate new democrat coalition are coalescing behind a proposal from alabama rep terri sewell that would create regional minimum wages pegged to the variable costs of living from midtown manhattan to beckley west virginia according to a framework devised by the centrist think tank third way wage floors would range from 9 80 in the cheapest places to 13 25 in the most expensive the debate is playing out against a difference of opinion around the root causes of stagnant wage growth centrists see the problem as a failure to help workers adapt to the trends of automation and globalization which demands fixes such as more job training apprenticeships and vocational programs to equip them for high demand careers like nursing advanced manufacturing and data science on the progressive left however a consensus is emerging that the real challenge is the rise of corporate consolidation and the decline of worker bargaining power that in turn has allowed businesses to funnel excess profits to shareholders rather than higher wages which would incentivize workers to pursue the type of education that made the most sense for them financially in order to take aim at that issue democrats like booker and wisconsin sen tammy baldwin have introduced bills that would restrict companies ability to buy back their own stock as well as direct federal regulators to scrutinize corporate mergers more carefully we think what s really important is that policymakers are articulating a diagnosis of the economy that really centers the role of outsized corporate power and the role of government to curb that power says stephanie sterling vice president for advocacy and policy at the roosevelt institute we re not going to upskill our way to an economy where working people are getting a fair share hooking infrastructure money to the end of fossil fuels pretty much everybody in washington agrees that america s deteriorating roads bridges train tracks transit networks and utilities need a surge of investment but some democrats argue those fixes should be wrapped into a plan to phase out fossil fuels entirely and massively scale up capacity for renewable energy generation in an effort to address global warming and lingering joblessness in one fell swoop an energized grassroots coalition led by freshman new york rep alexandria ocasio cortez waged a campaign against house leadership to set up a select committee focused on crafting a green new deal which would decarbonize the economy and provide universal employment the campaign for a committee failed and there are still parts of the democratic party such as transportation and building trade unions whose members currently depend on continuing investment in highway construction and natural gas pipelines who remain skeptical but activists have vowed to keep fighting for the proposal as infrastructure plans surface in the next session and they already have the support of 43 current or incoming members of congress the more momentum there is for a green new deal the more that pulls the entire infrastructure debate in a bold direction says adam green co director of a left wing advocacy group called the progressive change campaign committee it s not crazy to think that we could leave this year with 100 or even 150 200 members who believe the green new deal is a north star for when we have more power in 2021 a delicate line on trade in 2016 the democratic establishment was blindsided by how much anger trump channeled by invoking the harsh legacy of trade deals in the industrial midwest now they have to figure out how to heed that anger while also avoiding trump s chest thumping rhetoric on tariffs which turns off voters in both agricultural and urban districts i think there s a danger with agreeing too much with donald trump on trade said third way policy vice president jim kessler we ve seen the price that we re paying for tariffs there s a difference between getting tough on china and igniting a trade war the new congress will be forced to confront trade issues by way of a vote on the update to the north american free trade agreement few democrats are completely happy with the re branded u s mexico canada agreement but enough of them view it as a step in the right direction curtailing corporations right to sue nations over restrictions on investments for example that it has a chance of passing with some tweaks the problem is the changes demanded by trade skeptical democrats may lose votes among more conservative democrats not to mention republicans a band of progressives led by rep rosa delauro of connecticut have demanded stronger enforcement mechanisms for the new labor and environmental standards as well as a rollback of the intellectual property protections that grant pharmaceutical companies years long monopolies on drugs what happens in this fight will matter in 2020 as democrats try to avoid letting trump claim victory on trade while also dropping the established position that globalization creates more winners than losers a new direction for the middle east democratic leaders have rushed to embrace their historically diverse slate of nominees but as those newly elected voices enter congress a vexing question hangs on the horizon when it comes to israel the palestinians and the middle east does the party establishment really want to hear what they have to say trump s own renewed focus on the middle east including his withdrawal from syria his reaction to the killing of saudi dissident journalist jamal khashoggi and the ongoing war in yemen have returned focus to the region generally at a time when peace negotiations between the israelis and the palestinians have collapsed incoming lawmakers like michigan s rashida tlaib and minnesota s ilhan omar are all challenging mainstream democratic orthodoxy over the us relationship with israel the first two muslim women elected to congress tlaib and omar have expressed support for the movement to boycott israel over its activities in the west bank and gaza bds which stands for boycott divestment sanctions is a controversial program that has been met with harsh opposition by israel and its supporters particularly elected officials in the american government a senate bill called the israel anti boycott act which would ban us companies from taking part in international boycotts like bds pits sponsors from both parties against progressive rivals and groups like the american civil liberties union which opposes it on free speech grounds the bill remains in limbo for now stalled after sanders and caifornia sen dianne feinstein stated their opposition in a letter addressed to majority leader mitch mcconnell and minority leader chuck schumer while we do not support the boycott divestment and sanctions bds movement we remain resolved to our constitutional oath to defend the right of every american to express their views peacefully without fear of or actual punishment by the government feinstein and sanders wrote straight up the party is not ready for the debate that is coming one senior democratic senate aide told cnn it is an overdue debate and my strong sense is that no the party is not ready to have it look who the foreign policy leaders are but that doesn t matter because it s coming
after an unexpectedly bad year for the us stock market investors are looking for clues about what 2019 will bring the hope on wall street is that the underlying economy of the united states is sound that the recent selling will burn itself out and that stocks will resume their record setting climb but the risk is that the plunge the worst annual decline in a decade could be the start of something more sinister the forces that pushed the s p 500 index down 6 2 per cent in 2018 are still in place the economy is still doing well but it does not appear to be as strong as it once was president donald trump is lashing out at the federal reserve and the central bank s interest rate increases pose a risk to corporate profits and investors appetite for stocks america s trade war with china continues and the technology giants that dominate the us stock market face heightened scrutiny about their business practices source new york times as investors try to gauge the seriousness of these risks stocks could lurch in different directions at each new event a meeting of the fed later this month an earnings report in february or a trade negotiation deadline in march could all prove to be catalysts for a big rise or fall but wall street s top stock pickers are still expecting gains even if they re not quite as boisterous in their predictions as they once were it could get more frightening before it gets better said james paulsen chief investment strategist at the research firm leuthold group but i think we survive for another run last year was a reminder of how unpredictable stock markets can be in january with corporate tax cuts in place the outlook for the market in the united states was great and stocks did hit a record high in september with apple and amazon becoming the first publicly traded american companies to be valued at more than 1 trillion but 2018 was also turbulent with markets falling sharply in february and again at the end of the year here are the factors that will help determine whether that happens this year borrowing costs could hurt rising interest rates and expectations about where those rates are headed may have weighed on stock prices more than anything else in 2018 with the us economy humming the fed increased its target rate four times in 2018 pushing up borrowing costs across the economy the yield on the 10 year treasury note which is the basis for debt like home mortgages and corporate loans climbed to its highest level since 2011 before falling back when borrowing costs rise too much they can be restrictive companies and consumers pull back and the economy suffers source new york times in the worst case a recession could occur stocks tumbled as investors became increasingly concerned that the fed under a new chairman jerome powell would raise interest rates too far and send a chill through the us economy only more data on the state of the economy will ease the concerns about growth if investors see the economy growing steadily jitters over the fed s intentions and the recession fears that gripped stocks could fade trump is a factor heading into 2018 in the days after mr trump s tax cuts were enacted investors were mostly buoyant about his presidency and tolerant of his unpredictable declarations on twitter i am a tariff man when people or countries come in to raid the great wealth of our nation i want them to pay for the privilege of doing so it will always be the best way to max out our economic power we are right now taking in billions in tariffs make america rich again donald j trump realdonaldtrump 4 december 2018 that bullishness persisted even after it became clear that mr trump was serious about imposing restrictions on trading partners as a way of gaining concessions from them but as the trade war continued unresolved tensions with china started to become a concern and mr trump s proclamations started to make investors jumpy when mr trump referred to himself on twitter as tariff man the message helped spur a drop of more than 3 per cent in the s p 500 when it comes to mr trump investors have a lot to consider they will have to weigh whether a partial government shutdown will dampen the economy what a house of representatives controlled by democrats or staff turnover at the white house could mean and what might happen if the us and china can t reach a trade deal by a march 2 deadline the only problem our economy has is the fed they don t have a feel for the market they don t understand necessary trade wars or strong dollars or even democrat shutdowns over borders the fed is like a powerful golfer who can t score because he has no touch he can t putt donald j trump realdonaldtrump 24 december 2018 global growth has already been slowing the trade war s most evident impact so far has been in large overseas economies which appear to be taking a turn for the worse china japan and the european union showed signs of slowing down late in 2018 and reliable indicators of global growth like the price of oil and copper are flashing warnings source new york times growth may accelerate if trade agreements are forged in 2019 but the problems could be deeper china s methods for pulling its economy out of a rut probably are not as effective as they once were and the battle between italy s populist government and the european union over the country s spending plans may heat up again the european economy could also be hit hard if britain crashes out of the european union without an agreement that keeps trade flowing freely that could be avoided if parliament approves a withdrawal deal prime minister theresa may has struck with the union technology stocks have unique challenges the us market s fate also depends on whether investors fall back in love with large technology companies last year companies like facebook apple amazon and netflix helped push key stock benchmarks like the s p 500 and nasdaq composite to records and then dragged those indexes down when the companies went into freefall the tech giants shares plunged in part because they were deemed to be too expensive put another way investors went from being optimistic that the companies future earnings would be terrific to worried that they wouldn t source new york times some analysts say that large tech companies are now in a position similar to what big banks confronted after the financial crisis of 2008 the tech companies are a heck of a lot better run than the financial companies were in 2007 said savita subramanian equity strategist at bank of america merrill lynch but their incentives may not be aligned with the best interests of employees and shareholders what has to go right for stocks to recover in 2019 the us economy has to grow at a strong enough pace to deliver the corporate earnings that investors are hoping for but if the economy grows quickly investors may return to worrying about higher interest rates if the fed can tread a delicate middle ground the trade war winds down and the economies of europe and china stabilise a recovery in stock prices could hold i am not sure the upside for market is higher than where we ve already been mr paulsen the strategist said but 2019 could still be a good year new york times

stare down over trade because of jittery markets and portents of economic weakness the import taxes the two sides have imposed on hundreds of billions of each other s goods and the threat of more to come have heightened anxiety on each side of the pacific the longer their trade war lasts the longer companies and consumers will feel the pain of higher priced imports and exports their conflict is occurring against the backdrop of a slowdown in china and an expected u s slump that a prolonged trade war could worsen a fear that s weighing on financial markets yet those very pressures analysts say give the two countries a stronger incentive to make peace the u s and china now have a strong shared interest in striking a deal in order to halt the downward spiral in business and investor confidence which have taken a beating in both their economies said eswar prasad professor of trade policy at cornell university the economic threats agreed wang yong an international relations specialist at peking university might be conducive to negotiations by nudging beijing toward market oriented changes long sought by the united states still it will hardly be easy to bridge the complex differences between the world s top two economies they range from president donald trump s insistence that china buy more u s products to widespread assertions that beijing steals trade secrets from foreign companies operating in china negotiations between the two nations are expected to resume next week gao feng a spokesman for china s commerce ministry said last week that the two sides have made specific arrangements for face to face meetings and are talking by phone gao offered no details and the office of the u s trade representative declined to confirm the talks the world is watching anxiously china and the united states the two largest economies are the main engines of the world noted song lifang an economist at renmin university in beijing that makes their dispute a matter not only for the two countries but for the world he added the dispute is a major factor in a slowdown in global growth song said and a settlement would help in arresting the decline of the economies of the two countries and of the world trump has long complained about america s gaping trade deficit with china the gap between what americans sold and what they bought from china in 2017 amounted to 336 billion and will likely be higher in 2018 but the dispute goes far deeper than lopsided exports and imports it s fundamentally a high stakes conflict over the economy of the future the u s accuses china of deploying predatory tactics in a drive to surpass america s technological supremacy a report in march by the u s trade representative accused china of hacking into u s companies computer

china s economy grew about 6 6 percent in 2018 down from 6 9 percent in 2017 but heavy government spending masked weakness in private sector activity in december factory activity shrank for the first

track to contract for the first time in three decades report long trade war would hurt us more than china a fierce global trade war would hurt the united states economy significantly making households poorer and destroying jobs while china would not suffer as much according to a simulation carried out by economists at the european central bank despite its softening economy china will likely find it difficult to comply with u s demands to slow its economic ambitions those ambitions cut to the heart to china s drive to become the world s 21st century economic superpower it is difficult to solve the trade dispute immediately because the u s demands are too high especially demands for changes in china s economic and social systems which it is difficult for china to accept said song the economist at renmin university wendy cutler a former u s trade negotiator said the u s likely can t realistically settle for anything less than an agreement by beijing to reform how it does business there are certainly compelling reasons for both sides to reach a deal and avoid further tariff increases said cutler now vice president at the asia society policy institute however these reasons can only take you so far without a strong deal that addresses structural issues it sets the administration up for critics to say you took us into a trade war for this ____ mcdonald reported from beijing

wednesday january 2 five things the markets are talking about investors enter 2019 remaining increasingly uncertain about where sovereign bond markets are heading given the confused interplay between interest rates growth and inflation that intensified in q4 2018 the knock on effect from u s interest rates will have a material impact on the mighty u s dollar and equity markets thus it s a necessity that the markets are focused firmly on the fed despite fed officials continuing to express confidence in the u s economy the market remains worried that even though the fed has scaled back its rate raising plans for 2019 higher interest rates still pose a risk to expansion note the fed last month had penciled in two hikes for 2019 rather than the three officials predicted in september however the market sees things differently fixed income dealers have priced out any additional hikes this year with fed fund futures implying no change and a 25 bps cut in 2020 it s not just the fed actions that will have an impact on volatility but it s what they will also say in 2019 investors need to keep an eye on the fed s own messaging note fed chair powell will have the opportunity to once again lay out the fed s direction for 2019 as he joins former fed chairs janet yellen and ben bernanke for a joint discussion this friday jan 5 10 15 am edt officials have signalled they intend to

washington cnn business clifton broumand has started noticing something is off at the trade shows since 1982 he s been selling medical grade keyboards and mice produced at his facility in landover maryland and he s been through a few recessions each time he gets the feeling one s coming when foot traffic seems to be down at the exhibitions he visits to attract new clients this year he only got half the usual number of leads at an industry conference in chicago he knows what happens next when you start seeing these things it s like death by a thousand cuts broumand says you see a cut here a cut there and all of a sudden it adds up most economic indicators aren t pointing to a downturn on the near horizon but with seemingly constant chaos in washington recent turmoil in the markets and an expansion that s about to be the longest on record businesses are getting nervous it s notably hard to predict recessions which are only officially declared well after they ve already begun eight months into the so called great recession in 2008 many economists were still debating whether the economy was in fact in a recession the fact that the economy is strong right now is no shield against a recession in fact recessions typically start when the economy is at its peak and has nowhere to go but down most economists expect slower growth in 2019 but the big question is whether that will morph into a full blown recession or if the federal reserve can successfully guide the us economy into a soft landing in which the economy slows but doesn t shift into reverse every economist has their favorite advance warning system business confidence one indicator that tends to run well in advance of recessions the national federation of independent business measure of members own subjective well being known as the small business optimism index it peaked in the third quarter of 2004 while the american economy was growing faster than it is now and then started falling until it bottomed out in early 2009 more recently the index spiked after president donald trump was elected reached its highest reading ever in august and has been sagging since small business confidence is important because it can determine if those businesses will hire new workers and invest to grow the business or if they ll start to pull back and small businesses account for roughly half of the nation s economic activity car sales bill dunkelberg chief economist of the nfib keeps an eye on intermediary businesses anyone who takes orders directly from consumers and could pick up on any hesitance in the sector responsible for 70 of gross domestic product car dealers are the ones who start to notice dunkelberg says when the car dealer isn t selling he sends the message up to gm i don t need the cars motor vehicle sales typically take a turn for the worse at least a few months before recessions officially begin but recently announced layoffs at gm notwithstanding car sales have been hovering near historically high levels since early 2015 workers in the auto industry and other supply chain roles see the signs of a slowdown becoming a downturn even earlier worker hours a recession may get rolling with a few seemingly anomalous events like the recently announced gm plant closures there can also be warning signs in large scale buyouts such as those offered to 10 400 verizon employees a few weeks ago or fedex buyouts due to a slowdown in trade amid global trade disputes but the more common first step is not being asked to stay late and come in on saturdays when manufacturing weakens the firms wouldn t lay workers off they would cut back their overtime hours says economist ed leamer who directs the ucla anderson business forecast project so far manufacturing workweeks remain very long by historical standards after reaching their longest point since world war ii in the spring of 2018 surprisingly the low unemployment rate can help accelerate a slide the united states is at what economists consider full employment with more job openings than workers seeking jobs but employers unable to find the workers they want are more likely to turn to automation to do the work that they need done rising wages either because of market conditions or increases in minimum wage laws in many states also makes increased use of automation more attractive another factor is the 2017 tax reform which allows businesses a bigger tax cut on capital spending such as robots and computer kiosks that can be used by customers than on new hiring the trouble comes when the economy starts to slow and it s the workers who are let go not the machines that s why it can be just a matter of months for a labor market to go from very low unemployment to job losses and a recession as happened in 2000 and 2001 the housing market housing has historically been a harbinger of recession most dramatically in the financial collapse of 2008 which was caused by a real estate bubble fueled by too easy credit this time may be different home sales and residential investment have started to sag over the past couple of quarters but there was no building boom post recession mortgage underwriting has been much more solid and any drop off in the housing market has been blamed on rising interest rates as well as high home prices still home building and real estate accounts for a significant portion of the us economy and a slowdown in housing for whatever reason amounts to a slowdown in economic activity even if it s not the catastrophe of the last recession growing deficits michael stritch chief investment officer with bmo wealth management says his clients are mostly concerned that ballooning government deficits may eventually force painful cuts in other areas and lead to political turmoil even at a time of record corporate profits and low unemployment we don t think it s going to be an acute problem unless people lose faith in the full faith and credit of the u s government stritch says it s likely to just eat away at potential gdp growth over time the rising federal deficits about to crack 1 trillion for the first time can result in higher interest rates as the treasury has to pay more to sell the bonds needed to fund the government rising corporate debt can have a similar impact on rates and the higher bond rates coupled with the fed setting its rates higher can raise the cost of doing business and the cost of living for households that in turn serve as a brake on economic growth especially if deficits are only used to finance tax cuts rather than priorities like infrastructure and education that would generate a return on the investment over time other pieces of the economy seem more likely to cause a slow drag than to suddenly crater and take the rest of the country with them tariffs for example have only started to increase prices in a few industries which may eventually lead to lower orders even though most analysts don t see major imbalances or bubbles in the real economy that would internally bring on a recession every recession is a little different and this time it s been long enough since the united states went through a serious downturn that a whole generation of business owners hasn t necessarily experienced one for clifton broumand who s learned through hard experience how to prepare contingency plans as soon as it seems that business might disappear the fading memories are cause for worry a lot of people haven t lived through a recession before broumand says and this is the dangerous part it s been

world economy to grow by 3 5 per cent the world economy will see annual growth of 3 5 percent in 2019 according to a forecast by economists of the chinese academy of social sciences they attributed the slowdown to the expected weakening of the us economy the world s largest after its elevated growth this year as well as financial market turbulence the limited policy tools of major economies to handle an easing as well as trade frictions among major trading powers the predictions are contained in the yellow book of world economy 2019 published by the social sciences academic press china in the united states the authors posited major economic indicators such as gdp and employment have registered levels close to historic highs that means 2018 may be a peak for the us economy said sun jie an author of the book and economist at the institute of world economics and politics of the cass the conference board a new york based economics research institution also said that the us economy may peak at the end of this year for 2019 many organizations such as the world bank and the international monetary fund have forecast that the gdp growth of the us will weaken compared with this year the world bank said us growth could ease to 2 5 percent in 2019 from 2 7 per cent this year the weakening will make the us federal reserve more cautious in raising interest rates sun said world economic growth may also be affected by possible financial market turbulence caused by expected us interest rate hikes which could lead to currency depreciation and monetary crisis in other countries debt defaults in some high debt level countries and possible asset price slumps in other countries as a result of the slowing us economy the book said meanwhile compared with 10 years ago the world s economies have less policy room to cope next year with any crisis the book said in the us the federal funds rate was 5 25 percent before the global financial crisis in 2008 making it possible for the us federal reserve to continually cut interest rates in response to the crisis now however the rate is only 2 25 percent the trade disputes between china and the us and those involving other countries if they escalate could spill over to affect global trade growth reduce investment confidence and even lead to financial military and political conflicts in a worst case scenario which would prove disastrous to the world economy the book said china should stick to its policy of reform and opening up to cope with the impact from changes in the global economy said zhang yuyan director of the cass institut

tensions between united states and china as well as the us federal reserve s fed monetary policy normalization although the fed has signaled a slightly more dovish stance on rate hikes in the new year the united kingdom s divorce from the european union a process expected to be completed by march 29 could add uncertainty to global markets the government s pro stability stance reflects in its growth target which was set at 5 3 percent in the 2019 state budget lower than the 5 4 percent target in 2018 as well as the planned fiscal deficit which was trimmed to 1 84 percent to the gross domestic

bawono kristiaji tax research partner at the danny darussalam tax center ddtc said external factors such as monetary tightening by the us fed the us china trade tensions and commodity price volatility

sentiment from the global environment with many analysts expecting the fed to be less aggressive in increasing its policy rate in the new year amid signs of softening in the us economy should the fed

corporate business plans rbb submitted to the ojk many indonesian banks are expecting double digit credit growth in 2019 in addition the regulator forecasts that banks dpk would increase by 11 percent in 2019 despite the fact that the dpk slowed down in 2018 while banks liquidity tightened in 2019 banks will focus on optimizing their digital channels to ensure higher dpk next year apart from digitalization banks will also benefit from the government regulation requiring exporters to repatriate their export earnings and place them in domestic banks which is part of the government s latest economic policy package nevertheless the ojk predicts the gross non performing loans npl ratio this year to decline to 2 2 percent from 2 6 percent in november 2018 because some banks have

by rfa by michael lelyveld have foreign investors lost interest in china based on the latest official figures it appears that investors may be holding back until the outcome of the trade war with the united states becomes known as with much of the official data in china the evidence is clouded fragmented and inconclusive yet despite the uncertainties over chinese statistics it seems clear that foreign investment growth has fallen far below the double digit rates of a decade ago some reports have been quick to cite a sharp deterioration in business confidence among china investors following a steep drop in november s foreign direct investment fdi reported by the ministry of commerce moc fdi for the month plunged 26 3 percent from a year earlier to 92 1 billion yuan the moc said in december the november decline looked even worse in dollar terms as u s 13 6 billion of fdi fell 27 6 percent year on year the official xinhua news agency said investors in china were spooked by fears of more tariff increases at a time of high uncertainty about the impact the dispute was having on china s economy the south china morning post reported on dec 13 given the prospect of additional tariffs foreign companies are afraid to invest in china now the paper quoted shen jianguang chief economist at jd finance in beijing as saying as evidence of the cooling trend the report cited a recent decision by california based camera maker gopro inc to move some production out of china and a reported plan by south korea s samsung group to close a smartphone factory in the northeastern city of tianjin base effect argument the fdi results were perhaps the worst of the economic figures released for the month which was generally marked by a slowdown of growth rather than absolute declines the moc had a ready explanation for the poor monthly showing on fdi noting the high base of comparison with a surge of investment recorded in november 2017 a check of the record appears to support the base effect argument since the moc reported a 90 7 percent jump in fdi a year earlier although there has been no explanation for the sudden increase fdi for the full year rose at a much milder 7 9 percent rate in yuan terms boosting the total to a record high but 11 month fdi numbers for 2018 are significantly lower dropping 1 3 percent from a year earlier to 793 3 billion yuan and rising only 1 1 percent in dollar terms to u s 121 3 billion the moc said xinhua called the fdi inflows for the 11 month period basically stable loss of confidence in china may be one explanation for the falloff investors may also be waiting to see what new opportunities emerge from negotiations with the united states before making commitments if that is the case fdi growth could rebound in 2019 reasons for caution derek scissors an asia economist and resident scholar at the american enterprise institute in washington noted several likely causes of the apparent slump but also reasons for caution in drawing conclusions changes in monthly fdi numbers can be driven by a single disbursal no repeat a year later and there s a crash he said by email warning against over interpreting the results fdi numbers are often a product of chinese money sent overseas coming back said scissors in that case there may be variable effects from government policies and capital controls the moc report suggests that fdi totals are the result of many smaller investments rather than big headline deals in the 11 month period the agency recorded 54 703 new overseas funded ventures an increase of 77 5 percent but scissors believes that true foreign money is declining faster than 1 1 percent why because china s economy has been slowing he said official statements from the government and the chinese communist party ccp have stressed resilience in the face of economic pressures but growth rates were already on a steady decline before the trade war with washington accelerated the slide many economists say the slowdown is the worst since the global financial crisis a decade ago the new york times reported on dec 14 it may be too soon to see an impact from shifts in u s tariff policy or the mild market access concessions that china has announced so far said scissors my guess is that new or existing potential investors are inactive and waiting for clarity he said over the past year china has outlined plans to ease investment curbs for a limited number of sectors last april the government took the first step in the auto sector ending foreign share limits for manufacturers of new energy vehicles nevs and gradually allowing majority ownership of joint ventures for other car makers in the next several years in june the government announced more opening up measures with a long awaited revision of its negative list trimming the number of sectors off limits to foreign investors from 63 to 48 the new list offered 22 measures to phase out prohibitions in finance transportation professional services infrastructure energy resources and agriculture state media said the government has promised that more access for foreign investment is on the way on dec 23 an moc official told xinhua that the negative list is likely to be shortened further in 2019 in the past week the standing committee of the national people s congress took steps to unify china s legislation on foreign investment which is currently covered by three separate laws under the new draft law foreign companies would receive pre established national treatment and have equal rights to participate in activities including issuing stock and government procurement xinhua said on dec 23 and in an apparent scramble to signal concessions before expected tariff talks in january the government announced new deletions from its separate market access negative list on dec 25 the new list for market access would cut 177 items leaving 151 restrictions and eliminate 288 specific rules while 581 remain in place xinhua said response from investors but the response from investors until now has been underwhelming there have been few takers for the breaks in the automotive sector so far despite initial enthusiasm most foreign automakers have decided to stand pat with their local partners after investing heavily in their existing arrangements in any case the changes for passenger car joint ventures would not be allowed until 2022 a further complication is that the investment break comes just in time for a downturn in the auto market some recently opened factories are already standing idle the wall street journal reported this week the government also plans to open the financial sector with eased limits for banks asset managers investment firms and insurers under new rules announced in may this week the official english language china daily reported that international firms are rushing to apply for business licenses to take advantage of the asset management opportunities one reported investment in financial services follows the recent approval for swiss based ubs group ag to raise its share in its chinese brokerage joint venture from 24 99 percent to 51 percent the decision is notable in light of the company s reported warning in october to some of its bankers not to travel to china after a singapore based employee was detained and prevented from leaving the country ubs has not commented on the matter according to news agencies in a statement carried by xinhua on dec 1 ceo sergio ermotti stressed the company s long term commitment to the chinese market the further opening up of china s financial sector represents great opportunities for our wealth management investment bank and asset management businesses ermotti said risk will continue while the attractions for foreign investment are likely to continue so will the risks china s tit for tat detentions of three canadian citizens followed the detention of huawei technologies cfo meng wanzhou in vancouver at the request of u s prosecutors further complicating prospects for international business scissors said it is too soon to tell whether the cases will affect investment decisions there s not enough of a detention pattern for it to matter yet he said economic growth rates and opportunities may be the biggest factors for fdi recovery in the coming year but far more significant market opening may be needed to reverse long term trends a look back at fdi data shows that growth has been falling steadily for well over a decade after hitting an average annual rate of over 26 percent in 2004 2008 according to world bank statistics china last recorded double digit fdi growth in 2010 scissors said that if trade war tensions continue in the coming year the effect on foreign investment may not show up in the official reporting the signal of a major downward move will not be official numbers of course but multinationals independently reporting disinvestment he said

with the average worker s pay barely rising and inflation hovering just above zero it is easy to overlook the resilience of japan s economic growth streak which is currently on track to become the longest in the postwar era yet both internal headwinds such as the upcoming consumption tax hike slated for this coming october alongside slowing global growth and stock market downturns around the world indicate that the party may finally be coming to a close while it is highly uncertain as to which looming events will hold back global commerce professional economic soothsayers appear in agreement on one theme for 2019 growing risks and subsequent uncertainty will significantly slow japan s economic growth over the next few years
via daniel lacalle with the 10th anniversary of the lehman brothers bankruptcy having just passed and the recent stock market drop the fear of a new financial crisis is palpable and those fears are justified the question is not whether there will be a crisis but when in the past 50 years we have seen more than eight global crises and many more local ones so the likelihood of another one is quite high not just because of the years passed since the 2007 crisis but because the factors that typically lead to a global crisis are all lining up what leads to a financial crisis there are primarily three factors first demand side policies that lead investors and citizens to believe that there is no risk complacency and excess risk taking cannot happen without the existence of a widespread belief that there is a safety net a government or central bank cushion that will support risky assets terms like search for yield and financial repression come precisely from artificial demand signals created from monetary and political forces second excessive risk taking in assets that are perceived as risk free or bullet proof it is impossible to build a bubble on an asset where investors and companies see an extraordinary risk it must happen under the belief that there is no risk attached to rising valuations because this time is different fundamentals have changed or there is a new paradigm sentences we have all heard more times than we should in the past years and the third factor the realization that this time is different bubbles do not burst because of one catalyst as we are taught to believe the 2007 2008 crisis did not start because of lehman it was just a symptom of a much wider problem that had started to cause small bursts months before excess leverage to a growth cycle that fails to materialize as the consensus expected what are immediate triggers of the next financial crisis sovereign debt the riskiest asset today is sovereign bonds at abnormally low yields compressed by central bank policies with 6 5 trillion in negative yielding bonds the nominal and real losses in pension funds will likely be added to the losses in other asset classes the incorrect perception of liquidity and value at risk years of high asset correlation and synchronized bubble spearheaded by sovereign debt have led investors to believe that there is always a massive amount of liquidity waiting to buy the dips to catch the rally this is simply a myth that massive liquidity is just leverage and when margin calls and losses start to appear in different areas emerging markets european equities u s tech stocks the liquidity that most investors count on to continue to fuel the rally simply vanishes why because value at risk is also incorrectly calculated we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us when assets reach an abnormal level of correlation and volatility is dampened due to massive central bank asset purchases the analysis of risk and probable losses is simply ineffective when markets fall they fall in tandem as we are seeing lately the historical analysis of losses is contaminated by the massive impact of monetary policy actions in those years when the biggest driver of asset price inflation central banks starts to unwind or simply becomes part of the expected liquidity like in japan the placebo effect of monetary policy on risky assets vanishes and losses pile up the fallacy of synchronized growth triggered the beginning of what could lead to the next recession a generalized belief that monetary policy had been very effective growth was robust and generalized and debt increases were just collateral damage but not a global concern with the fallacy of synchronized growth came excess complacency and acceleration of imbalances the 2007 crisis erupted because in 2005 and 2006 even the most prudent investors gave up and surrendered to the rising market beta chase in 2017 it was accelerated by the incorrect belief that emerging markets were fine because their stocks and bonds were soaring despite the federal reserve interest rate normalization what will the next financial crisis look like nothing like the last one in my opinion contagion is much more difficult because there have been some lessons learned from the lehman crisis there are stronger mechanisms to avoid a widespread domino effect in the banking system when the biggest bubble is sovereign debt the crisis we face is not one of the massive financial market losses and real economy contagion but a slow fall in asset prices as we are seeing and global stagnation the next crisis is not likely to be another lehman but another japan a widespread zombification of global economies to avoid the pain of a large repricing of sovereign bonds which leads to massive tax hikes to pay the rising interests economic recession and unemployment future risks the risks are obviously difficult to analyze because the world entered into the biggest monetary experiment in history with no understanding of the side effects and real risks attached governments and central banks saw rising markets above fundamental levels and record levels of debt as small but acceptable problems in the quest for a synchronized growth that was never going to happen the next crisis like 2007 2008 will be blamed on a symptom lehman in that case not the real cause aggressive monetary policy incentivising risk taking and penalizing prudence the next crisis however will find central banks with almost no real tools to disguise structural problems with liquidity and no fiscal space in a world where most economies are running fiscal deficits for the 10th consecutive year and global debt is at all time highs when will it happen we do not know but if the warning signs of 2018 are not taken seriously it will likely occur earlier than expected however the governments and central banks will not blame themselves they will present themselves again

notwithstanding rumored unconstitutional threats from the president fed should be congratulated for its steadfast commitment to policy normalization new haven i have not been a fan of the policies of the us federal reserve for many years despite great personal fondness for my first employer and appreciation of all that working there gave me in terms of professional training and intellectual stimulation the fed had lost its way from bubble to bubble from crisis to crisis there were increasingly compelling reasons to question the fed s stewardship of the us economy that now appears to be changing notwithstanding howls of protest from market participants and rumored unconstitutional threats from an unhinged us president the fed should be congratulated for its steadfast commitment to policy normalization it is finally confronting the beast that former fed chairman alan greenspan unleashed over 30 years ago the greenspan put that provided asymmetric support to financial markets by easing policy aggressively during periods of market distress while condoning froth during upswings since the october 19 1987 stock market crash investors have learned to count on the fed s unfailing support which was justified as being consistent with what is widely viewed as the anchor of its dual mandate price stability with inflation as measured by the consumer price index averaging a mandate compliant 2 1 percent in the 20 year period ending in 2017 the fed was in effect liberated to go for growth and so it did but the problem with the growth gambit is that it was built on the quicksand of an increasingly asset dependent and ultimately bubble and crisis prone us economy greenspan as a market focused disciple of ayn rand set this trap drawing comfort from his tactical successes in addressing the 1987 crash he upped the ante in the late 1990s arguing that the dot com bubble reflected a new paradigm of productivity led growth in the us then in the early 2000s he committed a far more serious blunder insisting that a credit fueled housing bubble inflated by innovative financial products posed no threat to the us economy s fundamentals as one error compounded the other the asset dependent economy took on a life of its own as the fed s leadership passed to ben bernanke in 2006 market friendly monetary policy entered an even braver new era the bursting of the greenspan housing bubble triggered a financial crisis and recession the likes of which had not been seen since the 1930s as an academic expert on the great depression bernanke had argued that the fed was to blame back then as fed chair he quickly put his theories to the test as america stared into another abyss alas there was a serious complication with interest rates already low the fed had little leeway to ease monetary policy with traditional tools so it had to invent a new tool liquidity injections from its balance sheet through unprecedented asset purchases the experiment now known as quantitative easing was a success or so we thought but the fed mistakenly believed that what worked for markets in distress would also spur meaningful recovery in the real economy it raised the stakes with additional rounds of quantitative easing qe2 and qe3 but real gdp growth remained stuck at around two percent from 2010 through 2017 half the norm of past recoveries moreover just as it did when the dot com bubble burst in 2000 the fed kept monetary policy highly accommodative well into the post crisis expansion in both cases when the fed finally began to normalize it did so slowly thereby continuing to fuel market froth here too the fed s tactics owe their origins to bernanke s academic work with his colleague mark gertler of nyu he argued that while monetary policy was far too blunt an instrument to prevent asset bubbles the fed s tools were far more effective in cleaning up the mess after they burst and what a mess there was as fed governor in the early 2000s bernanke maintained that this approach was needed to avoid the pitfalls of japanese like deflation greenspan concurred with his famous mission accomplished speech in 2004 and as fed chair in the late 2000s bernanke doubled down on this strategy for financial markets this was nirvana the fed had investors backs on the downside and with inflation under control would do little to constrain the upside the resulting wealth effects of asset appreciation became an important source of growth in the real economy not only was there the psychological boost that comes from feeling richer but also the realization of capital gains from an equity bubble and the direct extraction of wealth from the housing bubble through a profusion of secondary mortgages and home equity loans and of course in the early 2000s the fed s easy money bias spawned a monstrous credit bubble which subsidized the leveraged monetization of housing market froth and so it went from bubble to bubble the more the real economy became dependent on the asset economy the tougher it became for the fed to break the daisy chain until now predictably the current equity market rout has left many aghast that the fed would dare continue its current normalization campaign that criticism is ill founded it s not that the fed is simply replenishing its arsenal for the next downturn the subtext of normalization is that economic fundamentals not market friendly monetary policy will finally determine asset values the fed it is to be hoped is finally coming clean on the perils of asset dependent growth and the long string of financial bubbles that has done great damage to the us economy over the past 20 years just as paul volcker had the courage to tackle the great inflation jerome powell may well be remembered for taking an equally courageous stand against the insidious perils of the asset economy it is great to be a fan of the fed again stephen s roach a faculty member at yale university and former chairman of morgan
