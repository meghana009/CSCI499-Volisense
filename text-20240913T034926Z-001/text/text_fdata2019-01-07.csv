nafta renewed now what economy january 7 2019 sam gindin on september 30 2018 a month after the u s and mexico moved toward replacing the north american free trade agreement nafta canada joined to produce a new continental trade agreement the new pact as highlighted in the article below written just after canada signed on focused especially on securing automotive jobs in the u s and canada the two governments celebrated the agreement joined especially by the leadership of unifor representing canadian autoworkers the american autoworker s union the uaw was more cautious and the mexican government was relieved that the pressures to limit production in mexico were restrained within weeks general motors gm dramatically confirmed the limits of the agreement announcing the closure of four plants in the u s and the remaining gm facility in oshawa autoworkers in canada and u s were furious with gm yet the solutions proposed focused on identifying mexico with its low wages as the problem when nafta was being negotiated in the mid 1990s the great promise to mexico was that it would bring pervasive economic development with rising wages and incomes that brought workers and farmers into the middle class mexico did receive a great deal of u s investment in certain sectors as a result of nafta but as in the u s and canada the promises of free trade were overwhelmingly not fulfilled like working people to the north neither the investments of private corporations nor free trade pacts which have been more about corporate freedoms and guarantees nor the cynical policies and assurances of governments brought mexican workers richer lives and hopeful futures for their children the point for workers in all three countries is to escape the repeated false promises of recent decades and keep our eye on the failures of our own economic and political elites the challenge is to learn from the experience of worsening insecurity and class inequality and finally to start addressing the larger radical changes we will need to make at home and in our relationship to international capital if we want better lives when donald trump declared the north american free trade agreement nafta to be the worst deal in american history and the worst deal ever signed by any country those who had themselves long opposed nafta found themselves in a bind they could hardly side with trump and be identified with the imperial nationalism of america first and trump s thinly disguised racism concerns in canada and mexico that any new deal would surely be worse than nafta for their countries didn t justify defending the trade deal they had earlier so roundly condemned the position that any free trade agreement should be opposed had some appeal as resistance always does but that in itself would still leave untouched the twin realities shaping our lives the dominance of corporate economic and financial power within canada and canada s extreme economic dependence on the usa stymied by the limited options the broad left unions social movements those concerned with social justice equality and a substantive democracy ended up being sidelined in this crucial debate this stood in sharp contrast to the impressive mobilizations that had occurred in the lead up to the 1989 canada u s free trade agreement the precursor to nafta yet even then the response of the left was too modest to deal with the new aggressiveness they faced the ideological and organizational weakening of unions and social movements since then and the lowering of expectations that followed makes it all the harder to build an effective counter movement today how to make sense of the present moment was the push to renegotiate nafta only about trump playing to his base was trump reacting to an alleged decline in the american empire was it about moving away from multilateral to bilateral agreements where u s strength weighs heavier is the narrowing of options that the renegotiation of nafta exposed just about free trade agreements or does it point to a more general characteristic of capitalism today it s useful to begin by briefly reviewing what the renegotiation of nafta did and didn t change we then step back to consider some of the larger issues that any oppositional movement will have to address we conclude with some observations on what an alternative orientation might entail trumping nafta trumpeting the usmca after trashing nafta trump predictably proclaimed that its replacement the usmca u s mexico canada agreement was a wonderful new deal a historic transaction trudeau chimed in that it would create jobs and grow the middle class what did the usmca actually change the focus on renegotiating nafta emerged out of trump s obsession with trade deficits when nafta was first negotiated mexico had a small overall trade deficit with the u s this was transformed into the largest trade surplus with the u s of any country other than china that surplus is almost entirely driven by mexico s emergence as a major global site of automotive production of mexico s 71 billion surplus with the u s in 2017 63 billion was in auto over and above automotive parts mexico has since the start of nafta received some 90 of new automotive capacity canada has actually seen its capacity decrease the flow of automotive products was consequently central to the renegotiation of nafta the usmca led to the following changes in automotive sector trade 1 the rules of origin how much of an automobile s content must be manufactured within north america to qualify for duty free flow of vehicles and parts between the three countries were increased from 62 5 to 75 the u s had called for 85 but settled on 75 most of the assembly plants that operate under nafta now usmca are close to the 75 target and though this may increase parts purchases in north america somewhat it will not dramatically change industry employment numbers moreover the additional content under this rule doesn t have to be in the u s it can locate in mexico or canada the u s wanted but did not get a special provision that it alone should have a specific national content rule 2 to qualify for usmca at least 40 45 of the content varying for assembly and parts must originate in facilities with average wages of over 16 per hour intriguing as this is it too will have minimal impact in general the vehicles mexico ships to the u s already comply with 40 of the content being sourced in the u s and canada and thus already paying wages above that average moreover no company is going to triple or more the wages they pay in mexico when the penalty on cars coming into the u s is only 2 5 they ll just accept the penalty instead and if they re paying the penalty anyway they may even reduce overall content in north america the penalty on trucks 25 is another matter but by far most of mexico s vehicle exports are cars and the amount of u s canadian content in mexican truck exports is generally significantly higher than cars and exceeds the 40 condition all this leaves aside the hypocrisy of the u s calling for stronger mexican labour standards even as it oversees the profound weakening of its own working class and while on the canadian side the new ontario premier seems about to roll back even the minimal gains workers were about to get after decades of shameful mistreatment 3 if the u s imposes restrictions on exports on grounds of national security 2 6 million in annual car exports from canada as well as mexico would be excluded and so would certain levels of parts exports from each country for canada this ceiling will not be biting trucks are excluded from any limit and canadian car exports could increase by some 45 relative to 2017 before the ceiling is reached i e it is unlikely ever to happen the ceiling on parts imports is also far above what canada currently ships to the u s that ceiling is however relevant for mexico and may encourage a cap on new assembly plants there the point is that after mexico s great auto boom its main fear was that some of the past gains would be rolled back so escaping that fate is considered by mexico as a clear win note that this clause legitimates the right of the u s to use the reason of national security to impose any trade restrictions it desires this was also reinforced by the agreement not doing away with the national security tariffs imposed on steel and aluminum trump had earlier indicated that if a replacement to nafta was reached those tariffs could end but this went the way of other trump declarations while auto was the defining issue there were other noteworthy changes chapter 19 this called for independent adjudicators to deal with conflicts of interpretation the u s wanted to do away with this and leave adjudication to domestic laws for canada to accept a continuing vulnerability to american law would plainly mock the very idea of a supposedly international agreement the u s eventually dropped this demand nevertheless trump s arbitrariness with regard to trade serves as a warning that the u s always can when it deems it necessary renegotiate the rules this suggests that corporations particularly in the tightly integrated auto sector may have a future defensive bias toward locating new investments in the u s rather than with its partners chapter 11 this chapter applied an expanded version of the u s regulatory takings doctrine to all of north america it essentially allowed corporations the authority to sue states that introduced measures which not only directly but indirectly impacted on corporate property rights including intangible property rights such as future profits identifying this as a form of taking or expropriation this crass placing of private interests against the policies of elected governments was surprisingly removed from the new agreement in the u s canada talks this was however not so much at the initiative of canada but of the u s which though very much concerned with the needs of capital in general did not itself want to be beholden to any particular corporation notably for mexico chapter 11 remains in force in energy and telecommunications constraining mexican policy in those sectors dairy market the u s administration was adamant about opening up canada s dairy market canada had already made concessions on this through the trans pacific partnership which the u s ended up stepping away from and it was largely a foregone conclusion that canada would make the same or as it turned out very slightly higher concessions in the usmca trudeau has promised to find ways to compensate farmers for this drug patents nafta had protected pharmaceutical patents for eight years this was increased to ten years meaning that generic drug makers can t step in as early as before this adds significant additional costs to individuals and puts greater pressure on negotiated drug plans and the healthcare system in spite of the characterization of free trade agreements as opening up competition this change demonstrates the extent to which a higher priority has been protecting property rights new side agreements on labour and the environment free trade agreements are based on minimizing the impact of non trade social issues like labour and environmental standards the erosion since the nafta side agreements of labour rights and environmental conditions should give us proof enough of how empty such clauses are the china clause article 32 10 of the agreement provides that if a party to the agreement intends to negotiate a free trade agreement with a non market country a designation any of the partners can make it must first notify and gain the approval of the other parties this clause is clearly intended to reference china and highlights what may seem obvious the u s right to veto any such discussions nafta had contingencies for such cases so this article wasn t technically necessary but its imperial attitude toward both china and canada carries important symbolic significance energy proportionality nafta and its precursor had put limits on canada s right during an energy crisis to divert oil exports normally going to the u s to other parts of canada this scandalous clause was removed but in light of canada s strong desire for u s markets for its oil and its political sensitivities to u s counter reactions this may not mean anything in practical terms even the petroleum industry which had earlier been instrumental in bringing this clause into existence now declared that the clause had no impact that it was never invoked and was never really needed the usmca added some other bells and whistles but is far from being a game changer in terms of dramatically shifting trade benefits to the u s this is not surprising to truly fix the problem with mexico would have meant radical steps that could overflow into undermining globalization something trump was loath to do the u s deficit will persist and there will not be a significant upsurge in the manufacturing jobs that trump promised the american midwest in short the canadian and mexican governments are basically relieved that trump didn t carry through with his more extreme protectionist threats the continental auto industry is pleased that its supply chains and assembly plants in mexico will not be interrupted canadian autoworkers considered the agreement a victory because the most threatening u s proposals faded away u s workers saw some positives but hardly a solution to their job concerns mexican workers had virtually no voice in the process u s dairy farmers are marginally happier at the expense of their canadian counterparts and the drug companies are smiling the wall to keep mexican immigrants out of the u s was not mentioned the bigger context ten observations there are a number of broader issues that must be taken on board in thinking about and responding to free trade agreements we can t elaborate on them here but may present some summary observations first the main issue in these misnamed trade agreements has become the free flow of capital and the protection of business property rights these agreements essentially give corporations internationally sanctioned constitutional guarantees against the possible actions of future elected governments this of course includes access to supplies and markets for their investments but as for tariffs these have already fallen dramatically over the years the trade weighted average of u s tariffs is now in the order of 2 a level dwarfed by shifts in exchange rates the canadian dollar for example has fallen by 12 from where it was a decade ago second repeated discoveries that the u s economy and u s empire are in decline are simply wrong working people may be suffering but that is distinct from how american capitalism is doing it s not just that the u s economy is outperforming other developed countries and that u s corporations are doing incredibly well in terms of profits and continuing to extend their reach globally though the u s economy has certainly seen a great many jobs and sometimes entire economic sectors and regions laid waste it has demonstrated a capacity to move upstream to dominate strategic high tech manufacturing aerospace health sciences pharma nanotechnology computer and communication systems as well as the services so critical to the global economy finance engineering accounting legal consulting computer software communication and culture moreover the u s remains in spite of very significant setbacks by far the prime military power in the world while the u s state continues to act as the world s central bank and the dollar remains the world s principal currency third supporters of the thesis of inter imperial rivalry have since the 1960s looked to japan as the new rival of the american empire later turning to germany and europe and now identify china as the new challenger of american dominance but both the profound global integration of capitalism and the resilience of the u s economy and state suggest powerfully that the contradictions in capitalism are not to be found in inter imperial rivalry fourth china has neither the interest nor capacity to replace the role the u s plays in superintending global capitalism its concern is rather with renegotiating its status within the hierarchy of global capitalism like other states it is anxious that the u s act as a responsible global leader yet the trump administration seems to have shifted american geopolitical concerns from russia toward a new economic cold war with china it will be interesting to see whether trump s aggressive imposition of high tariffs against china are a negotiating tactic to leverage china to open up its financial and high tech sectors thereby strengthening globalization or part of a longer drive to push key u s companies out of china and thereby limit china s technological expansion in any case those u s subsidiaries would in large part more likely move elsewhere in asia rather than return those supply chains to the usa fifth the most relevant contradictions lie within the u s itself though the u s of course derives great benefit from its international position it also comes with burdens those burdens range from diverting critical resources from welfare state expenditures to the military to absorbing a disproportionate share of world exports when markets abroad falter to losing jobs to asia as corporations restructure globally and include workers facing competitive pressures from low wage competitors abroad it is such burdens particularly in periods of domestic austerity that create the frustrations that were so instrumental to the rise of trump and a committed far right base these internal contradictions have international repercussions some of which may be unintended sixth there is a degree of relative independence behind the actions of the american president trump has given corporations massive tax breaks and delivered on deregulation but is not necessarily following their bidding on trade on the other hand there are also limits on what an american president can do his her power is relative as a columnist for the wall street journal noted the new deal shows the limits to mr trump s america first agenda and an underlying resilience to the existing order the resistance mr trump encountered from congress business his own advisers and u s trading partners circumscribed his leverage seventh we need a more nuanced understanding of notions such as neoliberalism nationalism and protectionism neoliberalism is not about reducing the role of the state but rather of the state deepening capitalist discipline and strengthening the weight of markets by shifting the balance of class forces toward increasing corporate profits think of the state s leading role in free trade privatization weakening unions adolph reed has succinctly captured this notion by characterizing neoliberalism as capitalism without an effective working class opposition as for nationalism there is the nationalism of reproducing u s economic dominance but there is also a left nationalism that challenges u s penetration and the restrictions on the capacity to pursue national goals of economic development and solidarity the same goes for protectionism somehow protecting the rights and property of corporations is called free trade while protecting workers from the compulsion to compete for their jobs with lower wage jurisdictions brings accusations of an unjustified and anti social protectionism eighth we must be careful in supporting sovereignty in the abstract it has after all been states themselves as leo panitch has argued that have been the main authors rather than victims of trade agreements like nafta the loss of sovereignty we need to be worried about is not that of states per se but of the popular ability to democratically improve our lives in the face of the introduction of unchallengeable rules ninth globalization also involves the movement of people in this case some argue that the free borders offered to corporations should be extended to free borders for people this is not necessarily a good thing for one immigration is increasingly biased toward those with high education and assets more than half of canadian immigration is now directed to bringing in high tech talent from asia as opposed to desperate workers from latin america this means that immigration may involve a brain drain and resource shift from the global south to the richer countries that is it may aggravate inequalities between countries second u s foreign policy in which our own government is often complicit has contributed to people being pushed out of their home communities rather than simply wanting to move abroad shouldn t we therefore put as much energy into challenging those foreign policies as dealing with their consequences can we ignore concerns about the impact of immigration on our social services without questioning why even as the wealth of our country increases social programs like health and education are cut independent of immigration can we really win the battle for completely open immigration which tends to cause a backlash even from sympathetic canadians as opposed to regulating immigration in a way that is sympathetic to desperate refugees and supports a higher but planned level of immigration as well as providing the services they need tenth justice is international as must also be for strategic reasons the struggle this demands having the base at home to make international solidarity more than a well meaning slogan the painful truth is that we haven t even built solidarity in our own countries between autoworkers and steelworkers public and private sector workers low wage workers and those still lucky enough to have relatively decent full time jobs conclusion the outcome of the trump moment is likely for all its protectionist rhetoric to end up further legitimating free trade already many of those opposed to trump have jumped on the bandwagon of free trade as the progressive alternative this perversion has a lot to do with the inability of the left to place free trade into a larger context that larger framework involves twin constraints emphasized earlier as barriers to a fuller life and greater solidarity our domestic dependence on the undemocratic decisions of private corporations and financial institutions and our deep integration into the american empire the latest free trade agreement like the earlier ones consolidates both those dependencies we can t simply reject free trade agreements unless it is also part of a larger strategy what we confront and what must shape how we respond is both capitalism and canada s place within capitalism taking this on is certainly pie in the sky as an imminent goal but if we see it as a long term necessity one that we must start building toward now it can give us new political life this requires speaking confidently about an orientation that sees our collective needs especially but not only those linked to the fundamental threat to the environment as only achievable through democratic planning not markets it means thinking in terms of production for use not profits and in terms of a society based on solidarity not competition and it involves replacing the fetish of exporting as much as we can with a bias as greg albo has emphasized for inward development but with a place for planned international economic relations we live in an era of polarized options the sober truth is that anything short of a truly radical agenda condemns us to floundering through defeats the radical in this sense is not something beyond the realm but something that has in fact become the only approach that is now practical originally published in canadian dimension volume 52 issue 3 fall 2018

undemocratic decisions of private corporations and financial institutions and our deep integration into the american empire the latest free trade agreement like the earlier ones consolidates both those dependencies we can t simply reject free trade agreements unless it is also part of a larger strategy what we confront and what must shape how we respond is both capitalism and canada s place within capitalism taking this on is certainly pie inthe sky as an imminent goal but if we see it as a long term necessity one that we must start building toward now it can give us new political life this requires speaking confidently about an orientation that sees our collective needs especially but not only those linked to the fundamental threat to the environment as only achievable through democratic planning not markets it means thinking in terms of production for use not profits and in terms of a society based on solidarity not competition and it involves replacing the fetish of exporting as much as we can with a bias as greg albo has emphasized for inward development but with a place for planned international economic relations we live in an era of polarized options the sober truth is that anything short of a truly radical agenda condemns us to floundering through defeats the radical in this sense is not something beyond the realm but something that has in fact

two major fault lines for 2019 by victor hill 07 january 2019 24 mins to read in the november 2018 issue of master investor magazine i wrote in this column that there are three dimensions of global analysis global financial markets underlying economic fundamentals gdp growth etc and geopolitics i wrote about the first two last month this month i want to flag two major geopolitical fault lines that could experience tectonic re adjustments aka earthquakes as early as 2019 they concern america s relationship with the rising rival superpower china and its relationship with its up until now friends in europe each of these fault lines delineates opposing parties with competing interests even minor dislocations can be of potentially high economic risk as they can impede world trade and therefore growth moderate dislocations cause political turbulence and therefore increased volatility in the global financial markets major dislocations could cause let s be frank war we have lived in an era of prevailing peace between the great powers since 1945 give or take a few dozen relatively minor wars some of them have been internecine like the vietnam war 1955 75 or the balkan wars pursuant to the break up of yugoslavia 1991 1999 they have all taken place in marginal or peripheral countries butwe should not assume that world peace is a natural state despite the mutually assured destruction of nuclear war on the contrary history teaches us that the moment when rising nations challenge established hegemons is the most dangerous here i just want to consider how the escalating trade war between america and china is actually becoming a new cold war also i want to examine how america s evolving a polite word for deteriorating relationship with europe may even accelerate the risks of a us china clash the challenge to the post 1945 states system we are currently in a transition to a new global states system this is replacing the post 1945 settlement the principle architect of which paradoxically was the united states of america liberals may not like this very much but it is happening the post 1945 states architecture was based on multi national institutions with the united nations un at its centre the new states system is based on the return of powerfully assertive nation states mostly led by a new breed of popular i do not say populist strongmen increasingly these 21stcentury strongmen rule not just for years but for decades most commentators date the post cold war era in which we live from the breach of the berlin wall by protestors on 9th november 1989 some 29 years ago then it was clear that the cold war was over the west had won and state socialism especially as exemplified by the soviet union had been defeated as an economic model for good just over a year after the fall of the berlin wall and the self liberation of the countries of eastern europe from communist tyranny the soviet union itself dissolved on christmas day 1991 the world seemed to be careering on a new trajectory one in which capitalism was triumphant and the usa emerged as hegemon or sole superpower but there is another key event from which we can date the age in which we live particularly if we re focus away from europe towards asia that date is 4th june 1989 that was the day that the top leadership of the communist party of the people s republic of china ccp lost patience with a brief experiment in relative democracy the two month student protest which had brought tiananmen square to gridlock was halted the protestors were massacred having reasserted its absolute authority the ccp did a tacit deal with the chinese people you stay out of politics which will remain our sole domain but you are free to set up businesses and get rich to get rich is glorious said deng xiaoping the chinese who are amongst the most naturally entrepreneurial people on planet earth took up the offer with gusto western observers inured with the idea that capitalism and democracy are the horse and carriage of the modern world looked on expecting that sooner or later china would adapt to its growing prosperity by aping the western model of liberal democracy that didn t happen instead if anything china became even more autocratic using modern technology to enhance the big brother surveillance machines used to supress all dissent in the first digital autocracy the end of multilateralism in the time of trump putin erdogan xi duterte and mohammed bin sultan bolsonaro not to mention brexit multinational cooperation now seems so last century but what about the collaborative europeans macron merkel juncker and tusk it turns out that they are trying to construct another state in federal form to challenge america it was the united states supported by britain which propelled the foundation of the united nations on 24th october 1945 at a moment when much of the world lay in ruins then it had 51 members today it has 193 the un was underpinned by the un charter and by the universal declaration of human rights udhr 1948 all states that joined the un would therefore have at least to pay lip service to the values of western liberal democracy and a panoply of supra national or internationalist institutions then began to proliferate the world bank 1945 the imf also 1945 unesco 1946 the world health organisation 1948 and so on within this ideology of collaborative association and collective security the proto eu emerged with the treaty of rome 1958 the flowering of this was the birth of the euro in the late 1990s which as i have explained before in these pages was the french solution to the german problem which arose from the re unification of germany in 1990 paradoxically however the same forces that gave rise to international financial cross fertilisation also resulted in the catastrophe of the financial crisis of 2008 more than that the elimination of trade barriers and commercial borders gave rise to the form of stateless capitalism that we now call globalism a small mountain resort in the swiss alps became the nexus of the champagne fuelled globalist conspiracy davos a name that now rings with infamy in the post globalist age of economic nationalism then as if on cue mass migration came to the top of the political agenda on both sides of the atlantic at the more or less same time the over filled boats travelling from lawless libya to southern italy or from morocco to spain mirror the caravans heading from central america to the us mexican border for american republicans and european populists the globalist liberal elites who have encouraged the mass immigration of people of alternative culture some of whom support the doctrines of islamicist terrorism are now responsible for the sabotage of national culture and life anti immigration sentiment especially on the part of indigenous working class communities whose incomes were most vulnerable to an influx of low skilled workers who dragged wage rates down gave rise to the political movement which people on the left call populism i have argued before that populists are not neo fascists but are actually traditional conservatives established conservative parties like the uk political party of that name having become both globalist and liberal alternative fur deutschland afd is now the official opposition in germany it is ironic that the populists have gained strength in europe at a moment when the american president whose views they share in many respects has signalled that the nato alliance may be out of time the culture war reaction against mass immigration multiculturalism and globalism occurred at a moment when western society was riven by a social revolution which threatens to transform society in ways that traditional conservatives fear conventional feminism has been superseded by the metoo movement which for many men looks like an attack on masculinity the gay rights movement now happily successful in the west has been superseded by something that many find difficult to understand namely militant transsexuals and indeed intersex the precise definition of which eludes me activists being aggressive about conventional bathroom arrangements all this is now called the culture war which overlays the widening gulf between conventional left and right interventionism in the aftermath of the collapse of the soviet union the us became more assertive and adopted a strategy of active interventionism much egged on by for example uk prime minister blair first nato attacked serbia and detached kosovo as a separate state in total violation of the un charter by the way and to the horror of a much weakened russian federation then the western alliance invaded iraq in 2003 on the spurious pretext that it had weapons of mass destruction the same mr blair was instrumental in propagating this false prospectus the aftermath of the iraq war having smashed all the power structures of that country and several of its neighbours was to create a massive power vacuum across the entire region into which iran syria and turkey were ineluctably drawn with horrific consequences after 9 11 11th september 2001 america acted in its self proclaimed war on terror as if its nato allies did not matter the 2003 invasion of iraq was spurned by france and germany though old europe poland et al signed up peter hitchens thinks that the disastrous liberal interventionism of george walker bush and tony blair and the post war ideal of internationalism are uncomfortably connected the idea that states should intervene just because they disapprove of the morality of other governments has proved extremely destabilising in contrast the chinese stance that they wish only to do business with and have no desire to criticise african governments for their human rights record has won them many friends across that continent at the same time by re embodying the russian threat and by changing european borders by decree president putin has given new life to the need to create a new military front against russia yet president trump has been the most unfavourably inclined potus towards nato since its inception nato was always an alliance conceived to counter russia but as far as he is concerned is russia the problem there is a much larger and more powerful country that directly now challenges american supremacy and that is of course china this is the single most potent reason why a president was elected in the usa in 2016 who was himself a challenger to the international status quo this president is not only opposed to the post war order he is hostile to it welcome to the new world disorder the usa versus china there was a bust up in the south pacific last month it might be seen in future as the moment a new cold war began such was the furore around brexit that many british readers might have overlooked a very important incident which was little reported by british media the event demonstrated beyond doubt that the trade war between the us and china is only tangentially about trade on 17th november us vice president mike pence and chinese president xi jinping exchanged barbed comments at the annual asia pacific economic cooperation apec summit in papua new guinea apec is a forum of 21 countries which have coastlines on the pacific ocean which has held annual meetings since the late 1980s the summit ended the next day in unprecedented disarray with no joint communiqué for the first time in its history at this summit proceedings were overshadowed by the regional and global rivalry between the united states and china of which the escalating trade war is just one manifestation apologists for the trump administration will say that the us has at last formulated a response to china s belt and road new silk road programme china s strategy of rolling out huge infrastructure projects executed by chinese contractors at favourable rates across southern asia and africa launched in 2013 with a projected budget of nearly one trillion dollars the idea is a blatant attempt to drag developing nations and their abundant resources into china s orbit as more states are pulled into that orbit so fewer states will adhere to the established pax americana so for americans of a strategic bent the new silk road is a kind of post modern marshall plan designed to promote not just chinese trade but chinese values too a 5 000 mile four lane motorway linking beijing to st petersburg opened last month the road runs from western china xinxiang where the native uighur population is in latent revolt and then crosses kazakhstan into russia russia might seem like a threat if you live in estonia but russia is itself now within china s gravitational field one diplomat told reuters that tensions between the us and china erupted when the chinese government s top diplomat wang yi objected to two paragraphs in a draft document one referenced unfair trade practices and the reforming of the wto while another concerned sustainable development chinese delegates were outraged saying the references were barbs against china chinese delegates attempted to bully papua new guinea officials into issuing a statement that conformed to beijing s outlook according to afp police were called by officials at the papua new guinea ministry of foreign affairs to eject chinese officials the chinese vigorously denied these claims instead of issuing a document that all 21 participants could agree upon papua new guinea prime minister peter o neill announced that he would issue a summary statement the prime minister said the main area of disagreement was the insistence by one country evidently the us that the communiqué would endorse the reform of the world trade organization wto mr o neill added apec has got no charter over the world trade organisation china benefits from the wto under the current dispensation and therefore does not back reform european union proposals to reform the institution are expected to be tabled at the g 20 summit in buenos aires argentina scheduled for 30th november 2018 the us is increasingly hostile to the wto because it believes that it is soft on china especially with regard to the theft of intellectual property vice president pence admitted that there had been major differences between the us and china citing tariffs quotas and forced technology transfer aka the theft of intellectual property he added that the us had concerns over freedom of navigation on the high seas a reference to chinese military activity in the south china sea and human rights after the summit vice president pence warned developing nations to avoid loans that would leave them indebted to beijing he said the us was not in a rush to end the current trade war and would not change course until china changes its ways while the usa can depend on allies like japan australia and taiwan nations such as south korea and the philippines that have defence arrangements with america will become fence sitters according to minxin pei professor of government at claremont mckenna college in california these states don t want to make themselves an enemy of china i wrote earlier this year about the relentless chinese penetration of australia s economy many australians thinks that their elite have been complacent in letting this happen while in asia vice president pence also tried to pull more nations away from china s sphere of influence saying the us provides a better option for nations in the region he announced a plan along with key pacific allies to build a 1 7 billion electricity grid in papua new guinea the us also joined with australia to redevelop a naval base a show of force which will infuriate beijing and held a meeting of the quad a group that also includes india and japan to discuss china s rising economic and military strength in the pacific there have been rumours that the chinese are trying to establish a military base on the pacific island state of vanuatu as a result of this rising geopolitical tension the us is threatening to raise tariffs on chinese imports further as early as january 2019 as i write nobody is expecting presidents trump and xi will reach a trade deal when they meet at the g 20 summit in argentina in late november president trump has previously threatened to pull out of apec claiming that its rules unfairly favoured china for now it is just another forum in which to joust most economists would argue that no one wins a trade war in the long run free trade creates a level playing field for producers of goods wherever they may be and this always lowers costs for consumers and businesses but as we know productive capacity tends to be located where labour costs are cheaper causing job losses in the manufacturing heartlands of more developed economies this prompts claims of unfair competition something that mr trump tapped into during his 2016 presidential election campaign in my view the us china trade war has only just begun it might turn out in decades to come to be the harbinger of a more lethal kind of war the evolution of the european union the european union as it has been called since the treaty of lisbon 2011 or the european economic community eec as it was originally called came about a decade or so after the foundation of the un at a time when it seemed that states needed to coalesce in order to progress britain was not a signatory to the treaty of rome 25 march 1957 which brought the eec into existence the original six were france west germany italy the netherlands belgium and luxembourg for five of those nations the logic was compelling they no longer had to worry about german expansionism britain ireland and denmark joined the eec in 1973 greece in 1981 spain and portugal in 1986 sweden finland and austria in 1995 ten eastern european and mediterranean countries joined on 1stmay 2004 and then bulgaria and romania in 2007 croatia was the most recent recruit in 2013 europe fault lines north south and east west there are two major fault lines within the eu of which one in particular within the 18 state eurozone itself essentially the eurozone rift runs north south it reflects the disparity between the surplus countries such as germany and the netherlands and the deficit countries which aboard the mediterranean these are sometimes referred to somewhat disparagingly in my view as the olive belt then there is an even deeper fissure on cultural lines which runs east west the western eu states are liberal and relatively amenable to mass immigration the eastern eu states are socially conservative like catholic poland and find the prospect of the obligatory imposition of migrant quotas totally unacceptable let s look at the north south rift within the eurozone first i call this brussels versus rome but you might also want to call it frankfurt the home of the ecb versus athens or even berlin versus the south brussels versus rome the stand off between rome and brussels over italy s 2019 budget claimed its first casualty on 12th november italy s major banks were forced to club together to support an emergency bond issue by banca carige spa bit crg after the rise in italian government bond yields triggered by the brussels rome budget battle eroded the second tier bank s capital base pushing it to the brink of collapse that intervention averted a failure and the contagion that would inevitably have followed but the need for a rescue emphasises that the doom loop the term used by the world bank between italian government debt and italy s banks is an accident waiting to happen this is a problem both for the country s banks and for the italian government since 2008 italy s banks have more than doubled their holdings of italian government debt from 165 billion to 387 billion this has largely occurred since 2011 when the ecb introduced its programme of making preferential loans to eurozone banks in order to stimulate lending these allowed italy s banks to borrow from the ecb at fixed rates as low as minus 0 4 percent and to invest the proceeds in italian government debt which carries a zero risk weighting under the basel iii capital adequacy framework such a trade made for a handsome carry as a result today italy s banks own 20 percent of all outstanding italian sovereign bonds 10 percent of their asset base up from less than 5 percent before the crisis now the budget plans of italy s new populist government have turned the size of that holding into a major issue for the markets after rome tabled budget proposals that will push italy s 2019 deficit up to 2 9 percent of gdp according to brussels the yield on 10 year italian government bonds has climbed from 1 71 percent after april s election to 3 27 percent as i write that implies a major fall in the value of government bonds on banks balance sheets eroding their capital bases it seems that the european mandarins now believe that the italians could bring the euro crashing down the germans versus the rest in his book brexit the road to freedom will podmore explains that the eu was conceived as means to achieve free trade within europe much to germany s advantage but was never a free trade enterprise the founders of the eu frenchmen and germans never embraced the goal of international free trade on the contrary their goal was to protect the eu against foreign competition by imposing tariffs on goods imported from its industrial rivals in america and elsewhere when the eu talked about free trade it meant protecting itself by means of treaties against other trade blocs like nafta and the trans pacific partnership the single currency was largely a successful means by which german exporters could eliminate exchange risk on the part of their major export markets the outcome is a system which is inherently flawed and which may not be able to withstand another europe wide recession america versus europe just before the centennial commemoration of the 1918 armistice president macron announced that europe needed to build its own army in order to protect europe against its prospective adversaries the usa china and russia that was a strange thing to announce in front of a visiting us president especially the donald monsieur macron s oration prompted a tirade from mr trump whose bromance with the french president is clearly over but on 13th november frau merkel in a speech to the european parliament in strasbourg unequivocally spoke in support of president macron in favour of the establishment of a european army she said that an eu army would counter unreliable allies by which french and german listeners would have understood america and britain as if to underline the east west split in europe the poles were celebrating the 100th anniversary of the re establishment of their nation at an independence day event in warsaw polish president duda addressed the multitude polish soldiers stood side by side with members of a right wing group comparable perhaps to the english defence league which is vociferously opposed to muslim immigration as well as representatives of forza nuova an italian right wing movement monsieur macron s attempt to re configure the western security apparatus supported by the out going and increasingly enfeebled german chancellor makes him a much more dangerous figure than mr trump it is now clear that the franco german alliance is trying to push europe and particularly the 18 eurozone countries in the direction of fiscal harmonisation that means a common budget and identical taxes and political union all with a common defence identity as usual the french and the germans are out on a limb who will pay for this shiny new european army as president trump is keen to remind europeans most nato members do not even meet the alliance s aspiration to spend just two percent of their gdp on defence most eurozone states have debt to gdp levels at record highs their welfare states are expanding and the cost of healthcare is rising where is the money for this new defence arrangement going to come from moreover not all eurozone states are nato members even now the republic of ireland sweden austria and finland were resolutely neutral states during the cold war the first two by choice the latter two by virtue of treaties they benefitted from the collapse of the soviet union but contributed nothing towards the defence of europe from what ronald reagan called the evil empire it is funny that the eu negotiating team has taken such a supportive stance to the irish on the matter of the uk ireland border when ireland unlike britain contributed nothing to their current freedom but the real point is that monsieur macron s proposal has fundamentally shifted us opinion in the direction of mr trump s outlook not only does the us subsidise european defence costs to the extent that the germans can run a massive trade surplus with the usa but now macron co are potentially going to point france s force de frappe missiles at washington that would be a very big mistake i now think that mr trump will campaign in the 2020 presidential election on a platform of the us leaving nato altogether europe is actually a distraction for the us from its main focus which is of course the containment of china most americans are now tiring of europe s combination of penny pinching and arrogance if mr putin were to decide to quash estonia as he quashed georgia in 2008 i suspect that most americans would conclude that monsieur macron and frau merkel if she is still around should sort it out with their own threadbare army so president obama s pivot towards asia will actually accelerate under mr trump europe is making a huge mistake in its liberalist globalist contempt for mr trump and its peoples may very well live to regret it conclusion action what should investors make of this re configuration of the global geopolitical landscape we are living at a time of rapid technological change which offers huge opportunities but also of a revolution of the states system that has obtained for nearly 75 years the peace of 1815 which was sealed at the congress of vienna and which drew a line under the era that we now call the napoleonic wars lasted 99 years until 1914 will the period of peace between great powers which began in 1945 last that long investors can t really prepare for a major shock that will most probably occur at an indeterminate time over the medium to long term but they can position themselves for fundamental shifts that are likely to occur over the short term one prospective outcome of a us china cold war even more than a hot war is that the countries that have most invested in the internet the world wide web may start to want to fragment that web into mutually impenetrable silos the day of reckoning for the internet giants is coming especially for the titans of social media facebook nasdaq fb and twitter nasdaq twtr as europe and the usa begin to regulate that sector more pro actively chinese influence now stretches well beyond south and central asia as far as central europe and even greece and the chinese media giants are a part of the chinese power play just as chinese construction companies are instrumental in the roll out of the new silk road in my opinion the second phase of mr trump s cold war against china will be that as well as tariffs the administration will take measures to staunch the flow of american capital into china that will inevitably impact the chinese stock market but especially its tech sector which is widely held outside china china s social media giants baidu nasdaq bidu andalibaba nyse baba in particular will suffer a similar fall from grace as their us analogues there will be other consequences which i would like to explore in 2019 in europe the risk of a major crisis has thus far been underestimated by the markets the eurozone economy is already slowing down at a time of increasing risk of economic shock whether from an italian default or from a major recession which would reveal the huge economic imbalances on which the single currency is sustained i ll be shining a laser beam into that dark pit very soon speaking to bridget kendall in the death of the post war settlement available at see
gold golden long term opportunity as global jitters are escalating with economic uncertainty and market volatility gold looks more attractive but there s a big difference between its short and longer term prospects those analysts who believe that fear has made a comeback argue that gold is benefiting as equities slide and investors are increasingly concerned about the economic prospects of the u s china europe and japan yet even at 1 290 gold still remains more than 30 behind its all time high of 1 898 in september 2011 amid the u s debt limit crisis although u s dollar has not strengthened as much as anticipated the fed s rising rates have contributed to the fall in gold prices in this view a reversal may be unlikely because the investor assumption is that the fed will continue to normalize though perhaps slower than anticipated in the postwar era such tightening meant a strengthening u s economy and a stronger dollar but at the time american economy was not haunted by budget and trade deficits or a debt burden today it suffers from both twin deficits and a massive 22 trillion sovereign debt burden in this view the fed s normalization may not herald increasing stability but contribute to instability and mixed signals in the u s economy in that case rising international uncertainty and volatility is likely to support an upward gold trajectory in the longer term uneasy markets and gold following the burst of the asset bubble in the u s 2008 europe s debt crisis 2010 and the u s debt limit crisis 2011 markets plunged and gold soared until it peaked at almost 1 900 in september 2011 in the course of the past eight years these fundamentals have not improved as central bankers in major advanced economies resorted to ultra low interest rates and rounds of quantitative easing markets tanked along with the oil prices whereas gold soared that period prevailed as long as central banks pushed cheap money and bought their multibillion dollar assets while major advanced economies supported their ailing economies with large fiscal stimulus packages it was great for gold but bad for equities the great reversal began with the fed s tightening in 2015 which boosted markets and strengthened the dollar but penalized gold and oil which both tanked this phase accelerated significantly even before the trump era with the expectation of the new administration s deregulation privatization and liberalization markets soared gold lingered however as trump s agenda became constrained by the mueller investigation and investors grew concerned about tariff threats that became effective last summer the mood became more volatile and the sentiment more uncertain today dow jones remains more than 13 below its october peak figure figure the post crisis decade gold and equities 2008 present market forces behind upward trajectory after its all time high gold has been seen largely as a weak asset until 2016 when it began to bounce along with the fed rate hikes while it has advanced to 1 290 lingering uncertainty has resulted in fluctuations which have effectively penalized further gains yet prevented new plunges market consensus tends to offer habitual reasons for gold s upward trajectory first market volatility and economic uncertainty are back even trump s erratic tweets favor gold as a hedge against volatility which boosts gold prices and equity market volatility as measured by the vix has tripled in just two months after a long period of perceived calm second when a solid asset loses almost a third of its value as gold did between 2011 and 2016 it becomes more cost efficient gold s average return is now more attractive third there s the dollar story historically a rapidly strengthening dollar typically boosted by rate hikes has undermined gold s gains however as the dollar has stabilized since early summer downward constraints do not work as much against gold finally gold tends to be constrained by rising real rates interest rates minus inflation since rising rates raise the opportunity costs of an asset that does not generate income gold was expected to languish as the fed would hike rates but if real 10 year yields have peaked as some argue real rates may no longer pose a critical constraint to gold s advances secular strength in long term in the long term the picture may look different however it is the thriving u s economy and markets that keeps gold down but have american fundamentals improved since 2011 debt limit crisis after all today u s sovereign debt is twice as large as in 2011 and according to cape cyclically adjusted pe ratio equity valuations are almost twice as high as the historical norm even amid the government shutdown moreover u s economy is no longer the key driver of global growth prospects china and other large emerging economies are in long term secular stagnation is set to broaden across the major advanced economies which cannot be disguised by hyper aggressive monetary policies such as ultra low rates quantitative easing or overpriced markets that s one reason why several large emerging economies which today fuel most of global growth prospects and major oil exporters are intrigued by the idea of re coupling gold with a multilateral currency basket to avoid excessive exposure to u s denominated energy and commodity markets as china supported one belt one road obor initiatives advance u s dollar is being effectively sidelined by the yuan and other emerging country currencies moreover over time the obor is also likely to have a substantial impact on the gold market as it takes place in regions rich in mining resources and accounts for a vital share of global gold supply and demand furthermore there have been interesting shifts in gold reserves while advanced economies such as the u s and germany still own most global gold reserves the u s has increased its gold holdings in the past decade only marginally while germany has been forced to cut its reserves in contrast china has tripled its reserves while russia has nearly quintupled its gold after dumping billions of u s treasuries despite rounds of sanctions as some 90 percent of the physical demand for gold comes from outside the u s mainly from large emerging economies that are also fueling global growth prospects gold is on the right side of the future based on an investor briefing on

a truth about movements is they move they morph evolve and move around a country or even around the globe this occurs over months and often over years the us occupy encampment era occurred ten months after the arab spring and six months after the spanish indignado movement early versions of occupy it started in new york and then spread across the united states and to other countries it was a global revolt against the 1 that changed politics in the united states and continues to have impacts today the yellow vest gilets jaunes movement in france is having a major impact and gaining international attention already spreading to other nations with some nations like egypt banning the sale of yellow vests to prevent the protest from spreading there the movement is showing that disrupting business as usual gets results will it come to the united states what form would it take here what could spark the equivalent of the yellow vests in the us social movements create global waves of protest it is common for a protest to develop in one part of the world and move to another country this is even more common in modern times as the economy has become globalized and communication across different countries has become easier the us revolution against great britain was part of the age of enlightenment which questioned traditional authority and emphasized natural rights of life liberty and equality as well as sought self government and religious freedom the french revolution followed 13 years after the us in 1789 it led to political changes in the uk germany and across europe this coincided with the great liberator simon bolivar freeing colonies from the spanish empire including venezuela colombia panama ecuador and peru they became independent and briefly united as a single nation the democratic revolutions of 1848 known as the springtime of peoples were part of a widespread revolutionary period that impacted 50 nations in europe beginning in france and spreading without any evident coordination the issues were about democratic and worker rights as well as human rights and freedom of the press it led to the abolition of serfdom in some nations and ended monarchy in denmark the french monarchy was replaced by a republic constitutions were created and empires were threatened by countries seeking sovereignty in the era of decolonization of africa and asia 1945 and 1960 three dozen new states achieved autonomy or outright independence from their european colonial rulers in africa a pan african congress in 1945 demanded an end to colonization there were widespread unrest and organized revolts in both northern and sub saharan colonies protests revolutions and sometimes peaceful transition ended the era of colonization the 1960s were an era of protest that peaked in 1968 around the world multiple issues came to the forefront including for labor rights and socialism the feminist movement protests against war and militarism and against racism and environmental degradation protests occurred in the united states europe the soviet bloc asia and latin america more recently economic globalization and the internet have accelerated global protests an example of this is the anti globalization movement itself as corporations took control of trade agreements and began to write trade for transnational corporate profits people around the world saw how this impacted their communities and fought back the zapatista uprising in chiapas mexico on january 1 1994 was an uprising that coincided with the beginning of the north american free trade agreement nafta the zapatista army of national liberation was an uprising by the indigenous local population against being exploited by global trade their action was an inspiration to others and an anti nafta movement developed in the united states growing into an anti globalization movement the 1997 financial crisis in southeast asia followed by the international monetary fund restructuring the debt in ways that brought austerity led to protests across the region in korea indonesia and thailand against economic globalization and the undue influence of transnational capital these combined into the battle for seattle in 1999 at the world trade organization meetings where 50 000 people from the us and around the world protested on the streets of seattle for four days shutting down the meetings this was a movement of movements moment that united many single issue groups into a force too powerful for the elites to overcome wto meetings since then have been met with mass protests as have imf and other economic meetings this evolved into making it very difficult to pass corporate trade agreements in the united states e g the people stopped the trans pacific partnership and trump will have difficulty getting nafta 2 approved join the campaign to stop trump trade s nafta 2 the yellow vest movement the french yellow vest movement is made up of working people who are protesting the unfair economy every saturday the 8th act held this saturday was larger than expected as the government and media were claiming the movement was dying down over the holidays despite the movement saying they were not over and were just getting started the movement began as a protest against a gasoline tax but it quickly became evident that this was just the final straw against a series of policies that have made people economically insecure president macron has aggressively pursued a neoliberal agenda on behalf of the wealthy lowering their taxes while cutting social services macron has responded with the elimination of the fuel tax raising the minimum wage and cutting taxes on pensioners but they continue to call for the president of the rich to step down macron s popularity is down into the twenties in polls while a majority of french people want the yellow vest protests to continue the movement is exposing contradictions in france that cannot be solved by the current economic and political systems macron while making concessions has also called the protesters thugs and agitators police tactics have been aggressive and violent in the face of mostly nonviolent protests they arrested a yellow vest participant eric drouet who the media has labeled a leader on flimsy charges of protesting without a permit stoking more outrage the media calls him a leader while saying the leaderless movement will fail because it lacks a leader this reminds us of similar treatment during occupy the movement has blown up political divides because there are people from the extreme left extreme right and everywhere in between participating it includes young and old male and female it shows people uniting in a revolt over the unfair economic system and its impact on workers they are also calling for participatory democracy by demanding citizen initiatives where people can vote on legislation firing political appointees or even changing the constitution if they gather enough signatures the yellow vests are showing system wide problems that require both the economic and political systems to change will yellow vest protests come to the united states many of the problems the french people suffer are also felt in the united states the us economy has been designed for the wealthy for decades and billionaire president trump era policies have made that reality worse people never fully recovered from the 2008 economic collapse when millions lost houses and jobs got lower income and higher debt the globalized economy that has been designed for transnational corporations has not served the people in the united states well the fly over states of the midwest have been left hollowed out rural hospitals are closing as the economy disappears in urban areas across the country decades of neglect and lack of investment have created impoverished conditions racist and violent policing have been used to prevent rebellion and contain the unrest people are struggling addiction and suicide rates are up there is vast hopelessness and despair an economic collapse is on the horizon as alan woods writes in new year new crisis the question is not if it will happen only when the us economy is dominated by wall street which ended the year in crisis citigroup s share price declined 30 percent from where it started the year goldman sachs declined 35 percent morgan stanley 24 percent bank of america 18 percent and jpmorgan had a 10 loss woods points to china s economy slowing as is germany s and problems in other european nations all point to a global slow down which those in power do not have tools to respond to as interest rates are already low and government debt is already high when the recession hits the economic insecurity of the people will worsen like the people in france the rich are getting obscenely richer and avoiding taxes by hiding billions offshore and the government is doing the opposite of what is needed e g reducing taxes on the wealthy when there should be a millionaire s tax of 70 and blocking the green new deal and when the economic crisis hits people will blame trump many voters supported him because he promised to break from a system that is designed to favor the wealthy they will know from their own experience that he did the opposite stop trumpism will become an even louder rallying cry and a president whose popularity always hovered around 40 will find himself in polls at 30 or lower as a presidential campaign kicks into high gear the economy is often the trigger event as it was for occupy and we already know there are going to be mass teacher strikes in 2019 indeed plans to strike in la are expected to escalate more broadly the gm workers who lose their jobs when four us factories close could be facing losing their homes and have other economic stresses causing them to revolt congress refusing to take national improved medicare for allseriously when tens of thousands of people are dying every year simply because they are uninsured could light the spark people in the us might not be wearing yellow vests but we know from other recent protest movements people are willing to shut down streets and highways and stop business as usual more may participate if a radicalizing moment ensues now that they have seen the model work in france there are many triggers that are likely to spark aggressive mass protests in 2019 get ready
with bastien inzaurralde the ticker the super rich won t be paying a 70 percent top marginal tax rate anytime soon but rising star rep alexandria ocasio cortez s proposal to ensure they do fired the

the major u s index futures are pointing to a roughly flat opening on monday following the roller coaster ride seen over the past few sessions traders may be reluctant to make significant moves as they keep a close eye on high level trade talks between the u s and china in beijing deputy u s trade representative jeffrey gerrish is leading the u s team at the two day meeting with a spokesman for china s foreign ministry predicting positive and constructive discussions news on the merger and acquisition front may generate some buying interest although traders are likely to remain cautious amid the ongoing u s government shutdown weekend meetings reportedly made little progress toward ending the impasse over funding for president donald trump s controversial border wall stocks showed a substantial move to the upside over the course of the trading day on friday more than offsetting the sharp pullback seen in the previous session the major averages all moved significantly higher with the tech heavy nasdaq leading the way the major averages moved roughly sideways going into the close holding on to strong gains the dow surged up 746 94 points or 3 3 percent to 23 433 16 the nasdaq soared 275 35 points or 4 3 percent to 6 738 86 and the s p 500 spiked 84 05 points or 3 4 percent to 2 531 94 with the rally on the day the major averages also moved notably higher for the week while the dow jumped by 1 6 percent the nasdaq and the s p 500 shot up by 2 3 percent and 1 9 percent respectively the rebound on wall street partly reflected a positive reaction to a labor department report showing much stronger than expected job growth in the month of december the labor department said non farm payroll employment soared by 312 000 jobs in december after climbing by an upwardly revised 176 000 jobs in november economists had expected employment to increase by about 177 000 jobs compared to the addition of 155 000 jobs originally reported for the previous month paul ashworth chief u s economist at capital economics suggested the substantial job growth in december would seem to make a mockery of market fears of an impending recession admittedly employment is a coincident indicator whereas the ism manufacturing index which we learned yesterday fell sharply in december is a leading indicator ashworth said he added but even allowing for that distinction this employment report suggests the u s still has considerable forward momentum the report also said the unemployment rate rose to 3 9 percent in december from 3 7 percent in november while economists had expected the unemployment rate to come in unchanged however the unexpected uptick by the unemployment rate came as the labor force jumped by 419 000 people compared to a much more modest 142 000 person increase in the household survey measure of employment the labor department said average hourly employee earnings payrolls climbed by 11 cents to 27 48 in december reflecting a 3 2 percent increase compared to the same month a year ago the annual rate of growth in average hourly employee earnings in december accelerated from the 3 1 percent increase seen in november reaching its highest level since april of 2009 even as the jobs data offset recent concerns about the u s economy federal reserve chairman jerome powell noted the central bank will be patient with monetary policy as it watches the economy evolve powell stressed that monetary policy is not on a preset path after the fed raised interest rates four times in 2018 and forecast two rate hikes in the new year particularly with muted inflation readings that we ve seen coming in we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves powell said the fed chief said the central bank is always prepared to significantly shift the stance of monetary policy if incoming economic data does not meet expectations powell s comments came as part of a joint discussion with former fed chairs janet yellen and ben bernanke at the american economic association and allied social science association annual meeting in atlanta the rally on wall street also came after china s commerce ministry said china and the u s would hold vice ministerial level trade talks in beijing this week partly reflecting optimism about trade talks between the u s and china steel stocks turned in some of the market s best performances reflecting the strength in the sector the nyse arca steel index surged up by 6 4 percent considerable strength was also visible among biotechnology stocks as reflected by the 5 3 percent jump by the nyse arca biotechnology index regeneron pharmaceuticals regn posted a standout gain after guggenheim partners upgraded its rating on the biotech company s stock to buy from neutral oil service stocks also showed a substantial move to the upside on the day driving the philadelphia oil service index up by 4 6 percent the strength in the sector came amid a notable increase by the price of crude oil software semiconductor and computer hardware stocks also saw significant strength contributing to the rally by the tech heavy nasdaq most of the other major sectors also moved higher amid broad based

trading on friday against the euro the dollar is valued at 1 1452 compared to last friday s 1 1395 asia asian ended on an upbeat note on monday with investors indulging in hectic buying amid rising optimism a fresh round of talks between the u s and china will help resolve trade disputes between the two countries strong u s jobs data and the federal reserve chairman jerome powell s remarks last week that the fed would be patient and flexible in policy decisions also contributed to the gains chinese stocks ended the day firmly in positive territory the shanghai composite index climbed 0 7

with the us labour market at its tightest in 50 years and the federal reserve having raised interest rates from 0 25 per cent to 2 5 per cent to head off inflation the economic headwinds are fiercer than in years ominously in december the ism index of us manufacturing activity registered its steepest monthly fall since october 2008 the month after the collapse of lehman brothers to many observers such a major programme looks ever more necessary almost 10 years after the last recession ended the us economic cycle is looking increasingly long in the tooth but although china rode to the rescue in 2009 and again in 2015 16 rolling out stimulus measures that boosted demand both at home and abroad things are different this time around while beijing will loosen its policies to stabilise china s domestic economy anyone hoping for the kind of all out stimulus effort big enough to provide a shot in the arm for growth and markets around the world is going to be disappointed as 2019 gets under way and it becomes more clear that activity in the world s three biggest economies the united states the euro zone and china is weakening businesspeople and investors are increasingly looking to policymakers in beijing to unveil a stimulus package they hope will support growth and financial markets not just in china but around the world last year growth was supported by donald trump s tax cuts which went into force at the beginning of 2018 but with the house of representatives back under democratic control since last thursday no further such fiscal stimulus is on the cards for 2019 as a result us growth is set to slow this year activity is also softening in europe but with interest rates in the euro zone already negative and the european central bank no longer printing money there is little prospect of any boost from monetary policy meanwhile the european union s budget rules prevent any significant fiscal stimulus so it is little surprise that people are looking to china for a policy stimulus lifeline especially after local industrial profits fell in november and two closely followed indices of manufacturing activity turned negative in december indicating a contraction for the first time in two years beijing is not likely to unveil major stimulus this year photo bloomberg in recent weeks observers have been getting excited at the prospect of major stimulative tax cuts from beijing in october the authorities lopped some 500 billion yuan us 72 8 billion off individual income taxes now following a high level economic policy meeting in late december china watchers expect cuts in both value added tax and corporate income tax rates over the next couple of months that together could be worth an additional 1 5 trillion yuan us 218 5 billion combined these tax cuts would push the government s budget deficit from roughly 3 per cent of china s gross domestic product to more than 5 per cent such extensive cuts say enthusiasts would be even bigger in absolute terms than last year s us tax cuts supporting growth both in china and in the rest of the world through increased chinese demand for imports especially of commodities it s a pretty story but unfortunately it misreads how government finances in china actually work it is true that these tax cuts would substantially widen beijing s headline deficit but the government s official fiscal balance is largely meaningless it only captures the central government s budget and a small proportion of local government deficits most government borrowing and spending especially capital investment on infrastructure happens off balance sheet at the local government level factor this in and china s true budget balance has been running at a deficit of around 10 per cent of gdp for years recently this spending has come under pressure as beijing has moved to reduce risk in china s shadow banking market the source of much of the funding for local government infrastructure investment as a result overall credit growth in the economy has slowed from an annual rate of 15 per cent in early 2017 to less than 10 per cent in november this decline in credit growth has been unaffected by beijing s efforts last year to inject liquidity into the banking system by cutting the proportion of deposits that banks are required to set aside as reserves together the decline in credit growth and fears of a deepening tariff war with the us have squeezed economic activity pushing economic growth down to its lowest since early 2009 in the depths of the global crisis whether the trade war escalates from here depends largely on the political whims of the us president however beijing is already moving to stabilise domestic credit growth for example by bringing forward and increasing quotas for local government bond issues to fund infrastructure investment but there is little chance of a credit binge of the sort seen in 2009 when credit growth leapt from 16 per cent to 33 per cent or even of the scale of 2015 16 when it climbed from 12 per cent to 16 per cent there are several reasons for this firstly beijing continues to pursue the reduction of financial sector risk as the government made clear following last month s economic policy meeting a general credit binge would undo much of that good work china is trying to move toward a consumption led growth model photo handout secondly rapid and widespread credit growth would risk re inflating bubbles in china s property markets which remain overheated in many cities instead beijing will allow city governments to relax their targeted administrative measures to manage local prices thirdly the government is trying to engineer a structural transformation away from growth powered by investment towards an economy driven primarily by consumption an investment boom now would be setting back that goal as a result policy easing this year will be aimed at stabilising credit growth and maintaining economic growth at above the 6 per cent level not at procuring the sort of pick up in activity seen in 2009 and should the trade war with the us worsen beijing is likely to absorb much of the shock by allowing the yuan to weaken in the foreign exchange market together these measures should support activity in china s domestic economy but they will not lead to the sort of upsurge in chinese demand for capital goods and commodity imports that foreign businesspeople and investors are hoping will boost economic growth in the rest of the world in 2019 unlike 2009 beijing is not about to throw the global economy a lifeline
the major u s index futures are pointing to a roughly flat opening on monday following the roller coaster ride seen over the past few sessions traders may be reluctant to make significant moves as they keep a close eye on high level trade talks between the u s and china in beijing deputy u s trade representative jeffrey gerrish is leading the u s team at the two day meeting with a spokesman for china s foreign ministry predicting positive and constructive discussions news on the merger and acquisition front may generate some buying interest although traders are likely to remain cautious amid the ongoing u s government shutdown weekend meetings reportedly made little progress toward ending the impasse over funding for president donald trump s controversial border wall stocks showed a substantial move to the upside over the course of the trading day on friday more than offsetting the sharp pullback seen in the previous session the major averages all moved significantly higher with the tech heavy nasdaq leading the way the major averages moved roughly sideways going into the close holding on to strong gains the dow surged up 746 94 points or 3 3 percent to 23 433 16 the nasdaq soared 275 35 points or 4 3 percent to 6 738 86 and the s p 500 spiked 84 05 points or 3 4 percent to 2 531 94 with the rally on the day the major averages also moved notably higher for the week while the dow jumped by 1 6 percent the nasdaq and the s p 500 shot up by 2 3 percent and 1 9 percent respectively the rebound on wall street partly reflected a positive reaction to a labor department report showing much stronger than expected job growth in the month of december the labor department said non farm payroll employment soared by 312 000 jobs in december after climbing by an upwardly revised 176 000 jobs in november economists had expected employment to increase by about 177 000 jobs compared to the addition of 155 000 jobs originally reported for the previous month paul ashworth chief u s economist at capital economics suggested the substantial job growth in december would seem to make a mockery of market fears of an impending recession admittedly employment is a coincident indicator whereas the ism manufacturing index which we learned yesterday fell sharply in december is a leading indicator ashworth said he added but even allowing for that distinction this employment report suggests the u s still has considerable forward momentum the report also said the unemployment rate rose to 3 9 percent in december from 3 7 percent in november while economists had expected the unemployment rate to come in unchanged however the unexpected uptick by the unemployment rate came as the labor force jumped by 419 000 people compared to a much more modest 142 000 person increase in the household survey measure of employment the labor department said average hourly employee earnings payrolls climbed by 11 cents to 27 48 in december reflecting a 3 2 percent increase compared to the same month a year ago the annual rate of growth in average hourly employee earnings in december accelerated from the 3 1 percent increase seen in november reaching its highest level since april of 2009 even as the jobs data offset recent concerns about the u s economy federal reserve chairman jerome powell noted the central bank will be patient with monetary policy as it watches the economy evolve powell stressed that monetary policy is not on a preset path after the fed raised interest rates four times in 2018 and forecast two rate hikes in the new year particularly with muted inflation readings that we ve seen coming in we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves powell said the fed chief said the central bank is always prepared to significantly shift the stance of monetary policy if incoming economic data does not meet expectations powell s comments came as part of a joint discussion with former fed chairs janet yellen and ben bernanke at the american economic association and allied social science association annual meeting in atlanta the rally on wall street also came after china s commerce ministry said china and the u s would hold vice ministerial level trade talks in beijing this week partly reflecting optimism about trade talks between the u s and china steel stocks turned in some of the market s best performances reflecting

optimism a fresh round of talks between the u s and china will help resolve trade disputes between the two countries strong u s jobs data and the federal reserve chairman jerome powell s remarks last

investment banks global economics report sent to clients on friday showed the federal funds overnight lending rate starting to rise again in the second quarter instead of the first and hitting 2 75 to 3 in the third quarter of 2019 if so the u s would have the highest interest rates within the advanced economies canada s overnight lending rate is around 1 8 the u k benchmark lending rate is 0 75 and european rates are still zero or negative the bank of japan is in the same boat making the u s treasury market the best carry trade in the developed world on friday investors breathed a sigh of relief when jerome powell signaled to the market that his fed would be more flexible in its monetary policy investors took that to mean that weaker economic data here and abroad may cause powell to stop raising interest rates ever since the advent of quantitative easing investors have grown accustomed to near zero borrowing costs for the big banks powell a critic of qe thinks the u s has to return to a normal policy rate which many in the market have put closer to 5 higher rates would likely gut the red hot labor market and kill a decade long economic expansion the longest in history should it last beyond 2019 moreover higher rates are seen as potentially zeroing out republican tax cuts in 2017 2018 powell said again that he is going to be data reliant and a little bit market reliant on monetary policy but if things are going as well as he is seeing things then we will see two more hikes for sure this year says craig birk cio of personal capital in san francisco if the market keeps declining he will put things on hold and no one will be upset with him if he does that photo alex wong getty images see only the fed can destroy this redhot job market forbes data points are getting weaker other than the job market which surprised everyone last week manufacturing data is slowing the ism manufacturing index slid around five points to 54 1 in december reflecting intensifying pressures on domestic production from tariffs a strong dollar slowing foreign demand and moderating local demand as well u s manufacturing accounts for just 12 of overall domestic production so the surge in labor markets will trump those numbers barclays capital economist mike gapen said gapen also made note of the recent government shut down he estimated that every week the shutdown is in effect reduces growth in the quarter by about 0 1 percentage points longer government shutdowns like the 1995 1996 newt gingrich led episode can generate more economic side effects often triggering lower business and investor confidence although powell is unlikely to pay too much attention to the outside world it is in worse shape than we are the german south korean and chinese stock markets are down over 20 in the last 12 months manufacturing outside of the u s worsened over the course of last year most manufacturers seemed content to work through backlogs and maintain production at reasonable levels but the trade war has led to a weaker outlook for exports there is also a spillover effect throughout europe from all of the business uncertainties resulting from the ongoing brexit fiasco lower expectations in europe were already starting in november because of brexit add italian debt and its new government s fight with brussels over austerity and the new anti austerity anti macron protests taking place in france and europe started 2019 exactly as it ended 2018 boiling over as a result economists are pointing out lackluster export orders in germany france

month low and the first sub 50 reading since june 2016 it is hard to know how much of it was due to trade tariffs and how much is due to beijing s crackdown on credit if china is to truly stimulate its economy in order to help it fight the trade war the government will need to once again turn to its big government banks to lend to large building projects investors are also waiting for clues

washington ap feeling the pressure of investigations and a partial government shutdown president donald trump is playing loose with the facts regarding hush payments made by his former attorney michael cohen to two women and is changing his story on his promise to build a concrete border wall paid for by mexico in comments over the weekend trump said he did not commit any campaign violation and suggests anything improper would be minor compared with infractions of democrats such as former president barack obama the reality is not so cut and dried federal prosecutors in new york have implicated trump in a crime linking him to the hush money scheme the obama campaign s infractions were civil not criminal on the border wall trump insists he never promised a concrete barrier even though he did and asserts that much of it has been built it hasn t the dubious statements capped an expansive week of assertions by the president on top of the usual twitter flow trump opened a cabinet meeting with 90 minutes of opining to the press touching on immigration drug prices the soviet history in afghanistan his approval ratings syria oil prices the attractiveness of his generals better looking than tom cruise and much more a few days later he spoke for an hour at a rose garden news conference a sampling of his claims trump investigations trump many people currently a part of my opposition including president obama the dems have had campaign violations in some cases for very large sums of money these are civil cases they paid a fine settled while no big deal i did not commit a campaign violation tweet saturday the facts trump has been tied to but not charged with a crime at issue is not a routine campaign violation prosecutors court filings last month said trump directed cohen to make payments to buy the silence of porn actress stormy daniels and former playboy model karen mcdougal during the 2016 presidential campaign both women alleged they had extramarital affairs with trump which the white house denies cohen who pleaded guilty in august to campaign finance crimes in connection with those payments had previously implicated trump now the justice department is backing up cohen s claims in particular the justice department says the hush money payments were unreported campaign contributions meant to influence the outcome of the election that assertion makes the payments subject to campaign finance laws which restrict how much people can donate to a campaign and bar corporations from making direct contributions it s unclear whether trump will actually be charged with illegal activity because justice department legal memos from 1973 and 2000 have suggested that a sitting president is immune from indictment house speaker nancy pelosi d calif told nbc this past week that trump isn t necessarily immune calling an indictment of a sitting president an open discussion in terms of the law there s a big difference between obama s campaign violation and cohen s case a federal election commission audit found that the 2008 obama campaign failed to file 48 hour contribution reports in a timely manner for more than 1 200 donations totaling 1 9 million the commission also found the campaign was late refunding some contributions that exceeded legal limits and discovered some other reporting errors regarding contribution dates the commission fined the obama campaign 375 000 for the violations the campaign was not found to have willfully violated the law making it a civil infraction in cohen s case he admitted he knew he was breaking the law by making the payments cohen told abc last month that of course trump knew it was wrong to make the hush money payments though he did not provide any specific evidence in the interview unlike the obama case where the issue was timely reporting the hush money payments were never disclosed at all on trump s campaign filings andrew herman a lawyer specializing in campaign finance at law firm miller chevalier said the two cases are completely different species one is a paperwork error he said and the other is a conscious attempt to obscure payments made to affect an election ___ the wall trump as far as concrete i said i was going to build a wall i never said i m going to build a concrete i said i m going to build a wall rose garden news conference friday the facts actually he did say he would build a concrete wall trump even repeated that promise last week rejecting the claim of his departing white house chief of staff john kelly that trump had abandoned the notion of a solid concrete wall early on in the administration an all concrete wall was never abandoned trump tweeted on dec 31 some areas will be all concrete but the experts at border patrol prefer a wall that is see through during the 2016 campaign trump pledged to build a big beautiful wall made of concrete rebar and steel across the length of the southern border with mexico back then he lashed out at the suggestion that what he was proposing had anything in common with mere fencing jeb bush just talked about my border proposal to build a fence he tweeted in 2015 it s not a fence jeb it s a wall and there s a big difference he now often refers to the wall as steel slats steel is stronger than concrete he said friday if i build a steel wall rather than a concrete wall it will actually be stronger than a concrete wall ___ trump when they say build the wall i don t say that any more i say finish the wall remarks to reporters sunday trump we ve already built a lot of the wall rose garden news conference friday the facts he hasn t built much of the wall at all trump s claim is only supported when counting work done under past presidents and ignoring the fact that fences from prior administrations are not the towering walls he promised the 2006 secure fence act has resulted in about 650 miles 1 050 kilometers of border barrier money approved by congress in march 2018 is to pay for 84 miles 135 km but that work is not done trump has achieved some renovation of existing barrier ___ trump the drugs are pouring into this country they don t go through the ports of entry when they do they sometimes get caught rose garden news conference the facts he s wrong in saying drug smugglers don t or only rarely use official border crossings for their trafficking land ports of entry are their primary means for getting drugs into the country not stretches of the border without barriers says the u s drug enforcement administration the agency said in a november report that the most common trafficking technique by transnational criminal organizations is to hide drugs in passenger vehicles or tractor trailers as they drive into the u s though entry ports where they are stopped and subject to inspection they also employ buses cargo trains and tunnels the report says citing smuggling methods that would not be choked off by a border wall ___ trump the new trade deal we have with mexico and canada what we save on that just with mexico will pay for the wall many times over just in a period of a year two years or three years so i view that as absolutely mexico is paying for the wall rose garden news conference the facts mexico is not paying for the wall and nothing in the trade agreement would cover or refund the construction cost trump is assuming a wide variety of economic benefits will come from the agreement but they can t be quantified or counted on for example he said the deal will dissuade some u s companies from moving operations to mexico and he credits that possibility as a payment by mexico for his wall the deal updates the north american free trade agreement in the main preserving nafta s liberalized environment of low or no tariffs among the u s mexico and canada while making certain improvements for each country trump stated inaccurately that it s brand new it s totally different moreover it s not in effect the deal has yet to be ratified in any member country and its chances of winning legislative approval are not assured trump has argued repeatedly that mexico is footing the bill even while insisting on 5 6 billion from the u s treasury to go toward wall construction his demand and the refusal of democrats to satisfy it are behind the budget standoff that has closed parts of the government ___ syria trump we are pulling back in syria we re going to be removing our troops i never said we re doing it that quickly remarks to reporters sunday trump we re bringing the troops back home over a period of time i never said so quickly but over a period of time cabinet meeting wednesday the facts he s wrong about his past statements regarding the pace of withdrawal in a video posted to his twitter account on dec 19 for instance trump said of the roughly 2 000 troops in syria they re all coming back and they re coming back now ___ trump i read when we pull out oh russia is thrilled russia is not happy you know why they re not happy because they like it when we re killing isis because we re killing them for them and we re killing them for assad and we re killing isis also for iran cabinet meeting the facts russia says it s happy a u s withdrawal opens opportunities for moscow and tehran to increase their influence and may help the syrian government survive as a kurdish led opposition force loses its military ally on the ground russian president vladimir putin says the u s has done the right thing in planning to pull out ___ afghanistan trump the reason russia was in afghanistan was because terrorists were going into russia they the soviets were right to be there cabinet meeting the facts his assertion that the soviet union was experiencing a terrorist influx from afghanistan when it invaded in 1979 is out of step with history and his belief that the soviets were right to invade is a stark departure from u s and world opinion the soviets were trying to bolster communists in afghanistan and possibly expand their influence against the united states and the west world condemnation was swift the u n general assembly voted 104 18 to deplore the soviet intervention in afghanistan the u s supported the anti communist rebels giving them shoulder fired rockets to down soviet aircraft the soviets withdrew in 1989 ___ trump russia used to be the soviet union afghanistan made it russia because they went bankrupt fighting in afghanistan cabinet meeting the facts afghanistan was far from the sole reason for the breakup of the soviet union in 1991 the dissolution occurred in a time of ethnic and political troubles economic woes and a series of revolutions that led soviet republics to seek their independence the soviet demise was accelerated by the heavy cost of competing with the west to wield influence around the world including in afghanistan ___ oil prices trump do you think it s just luck that gas prices are so low and falling low gas prices are like another tax cut tweet tuesday trump it s not luck it s not luck i called up certain people and i said let that damn oil and gasoline you let it flow the oil it was going up to 125 if that would ve happened then you would ve had a recession depression cabinet meeting wednesday the facts it s not all about him or even mostly about him while americans may end up paying somewhat less for gasoline this year trump s suggestion that he deserves all the credit and averted a u s economic depression is an exaggeration oil prices which peaked oct 3 have been generally falling on the realization that u s sanctions against iran would not create a shortage and on fear that a global oversupply of oil will spill into 2019 if slower international economic growth depresses energy demand the president s supposed let it flow edict did not stop opec and its russia led allies from agreeing last month to cut oil production that initially failed to stop oil prices from sliding further they have since rebounded a few dollars in the past week continued opec production cuts would push prices higher trump has pointed to his positive relations with saudi arabia which remains the biggest oil exporter as a so called swing producer with the ability to adjust production up or down relatively quickly it can indeed influence the price of crude but the market is complex canada for example is actually the top source of u s oil imports with saudi arabia second ___ tariffs trump the united states treasury has taken in many billions of dollars from the tariffs we are charging china and other countries that have not treated us fairly in the meantime we are doing well in various trade negotiations currently going on tweet thursday the facts trump is off on two major issues first tariffs are taxes paid largely by u s business and consumers not foreign countries and while trump s many billions might sound like a lot it s doing little to nothing to improve the federal balance sheet the u s government spent 4 1 trillion last fiscal year and the budget deficit shot up according to trump s own treasury department customs and duties generated 41 3 billion in revenues last year up from 34 6 billion in 2017 that 6 7 billion increase occurred in part because of the president s tariffs but it amounted to just 0 16 percent of federal spending ___ mattis trump on jim mattis i wish him well i hope he does well but as you know president barack obama fired him and essentially so did i i want results cabinet meeting wednesday the facts actually mattis resigned as defense secretary in protest over trump s decision to pull u s troops from syria the retired marine general announced on dec 20 in a resignation letter that he was stepping down after trump s decision to withdraw 2 000 u s troops from syria mattis said he would stay on the job until the end of february three days later trump said he was replacing mattis with the second ranking defense official pat shanahan on jan 1 as to the tenure under obama mattis served as commander of the military s central command he departed a few months earlier than expected in 2013 in part because of disagreements over iran ___ drug prices trump i think you re going to see a tremendous reduction in drug prices cabinet meeting wednesday the facts prices continue to rise administration policies announced last year and currently being completed don t seem to have shifted that trend figures on u s prescription drug price changes compiled by health data company elsevier show that from dec 20 through jan 2 there were 1 179 product price changes of those 30 were price cuts and the remaining 1 149 were price increases with 328 of them between 9 percent and 10 percent all but one of the rest were by lower percentages elsevier spokesman chris capot said more companies will be announcing price increases this month separately a data firm whose software can help patients find the most cost effective medications says its information shows price increases on many commonly used drugs for conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes in the first two days of january prices have increased on more than 250 different products said michael rea ceo of rx savings solutions the average increase is about 6 percent he added ___ immigration trump on the number of immigrants living in the u s illegally i used to hear 11 million all the time it would always stay right at 11 i said does it ever increase or go down no it s 11 nobody knows it s probably 30 35 million people they would flow in mostly from the southern border they d come in and nobody would talk about it nobody would do anything about it cabinet meeting wednesday the facts it s nowhere close to 30 million to 35 million according to his own homeland security secretary as well as independent estimates the nonpartisan pew research center estimates there were 10 7 million immigrants in the u s illegally in 2016 the most recent data available advocacy groups on both sides of the immigration issue have similar estimates at a house hearing last month homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen acknowledged the number was somewhere between 11 million and 22 million significantly lower than trump s claim of 35 million according to pew the number of immigrants in the u s illegally had reached a height of 12 2 million in 2007 representing about 4 percent of the u s population before declining in part because of a weakening u s economy ___ trump the coyotes are using children to gain access into this country they re using these children they re not with families they re using the children they re taking the children and then they dispose of the children after they re done this has been going on for years this isn t unique to us but we want to stop it cabinet

briefing highlights canadian auto sales winded markets at a glance investors eye u s china trade talks what to expect from bank of canada what else to watch for this week from today s globe and mail whither auto sales still reeling from general motors co s decision to shutter its key oshawa ont operation canada s auto industry has now suffered the second of a heavy one two punch on sales the latest numbers show vehicle sales ending the 2018 calendar year with a nasty december tumble december s 8 per cent year over year decline in canadian vehicle sales on the back of november s plunge dealt a heavy one two punch to the auto selling cycle said bank of montreal senior economist alex koustas the year end figures are an emphatic confirmation that auto sales are well and truly winded and the tale of the tape points to a continued decline in 2019 open this photo in gallery source bank of montreal desrosiers automotive consultants inc however pointed to the fact that car and light truck sales came in at about 114 290 units which is still a solid total for what is traditionally a slow month further it capped a year that saw sales at 1 985 million units the market having topped the 2 million mark for the first time only a year earlier before the naysayers shriek out their first calls of doom and gloom it bears mention that 2018 nestled itself comfortably as the year with the second highest sales on record down only 2 6 per cent from the lofty heights achieved in 2017 desrosiers said some momentum carried over from 2017 into early 2018 as january and february sales set new sales records but the industry gradually lost steam during the second half of the year ending with the first year over year decline since 2009 bmo s mr koustas noted light truck sales key to the market of late fell 6 5 per cent in december while sales of luxury vehicles which have mostly glided above the slugfest for market share in the standard segment tumbled 10 per cent over all despite 10 straight months of year over year declines the annual sales tally likely topped 2 million units for only the second time on record if heavy trucks are included a very healthy figure by any measure mr koustas said not bad for dealerships but auto sales are now surely poised to act as a headwind on consumer spending growth for the remainder of the cycle this is key of course because higher interest rates and increases to come will force consumers to juggle their budgets carefully particularly given high household debt levels and that s just one of the reasons royal bank of canada projects fewer visits to the car lot this year even before being pinched by rising interest rates fewer canadians were buying autos in part reflecting a potent combination of technology and demographics rbc s economics department said in its 2019 outlook for those living in urban areas there s been an explosion in ride sharing and car sharing services like uber and zipcar while research has found the number of young people with driver s licenses has been waning the rbc economists added indeed the drop in canada has been steeper than that in the united states now add in the impact of higher interest rates which will eat into household discretionary income and force some consumers to decide just what they can live without rbc said will a new set of wheels be near the top of that list read more markets at a glance read more what to watch for this week call it the big pause having held off raising interest rates in december the bank of canada is again expected to hold its benchmark steady wednesday but of course markets will watch for signals from its statement and accompanying monetary policy report expect governor stephen poloz senior deputy governor carolyn wilkins and their colleagues to keep the overnight rate at 1 75 per cent while trimming forecasts for economic growth given the turmoil in oil markets that doesn t mean they re done raising interest rates from the lows of the crisis era and the subsequent oil shock only that they ll put off the inevitable until march or april before tightening our purse strings again depending on how things play out of course uncertainty abounds on the oil and trade fronts all of which will factor into the central bank s timeline open this photo in gallery bank of canada senior deputy governor carolyn wilkins and governor stephen polozadrian wyld the canadian press we see the tone of the statement being along the lines of we ll get back to you later rather than we re all done here people in terms of further interest rate tightening said cibc world markets chief economist avery shenfeld that would open the door to a rate hike as early as april if oil prices have managed to rebound by then and oil inventories in alberta don t look as bloated alberta has ordered the oil patch to temporarily cut production in an effort to buoy prices and indeed premier rachel notley s intervention in the market narrowed the discount on canadian crude against global benchmarks that in turn will eat into economic growth which should be reflected in wednesday s monetary policy report despite the improvement the sector is going to be a key reason behind expected downgrades to the growth forecast said benjamin reitzes bmo s canadian rates and macro strategist look for 2018q4 gdp to be cut nearly one percentage point to around 1 5 per cent while 2019q1 will be introduced at about 1 per cent he added those figures would cut the annual pace of growth at least a tick with a larger impact if the rest of 2019 isn t upgraded like some forecasters bank of america merrill lynch expects the bank of canada to start raising rates again in march or april followed by another increase in october we believe there is no room for the boc to hike in january carlos capistran bank of america s canada and mexico economist foreign exchange strategist ben randol and rates strategist olivia lima said in a lookahead to wednesday s decision that s because annual inflation is below the central bank s target of 2 per cent oil prices remain under pressure u s economic growth is forecast to slow and the federal reserve is now more dovish meaning its rate increases are expected to be slower than initially expected this year as we adjust our expectations for boc and fed hiking in 2019 we also expect a lower trajectory for canadian rates mr capistran mr randol and ms lima said our u s economics team is now calling for two fed hikes in 2019 and we believe that the boc will continue to hike in line with the fed retaining similar near term policy paths they added however given the boc did not hike in december the average policy rate spread between the boc and the fed has increased to 75 basis points read more

is expected to report the country s trade deficit widened in november the question is by how much economists expect the report to show the gap swelling to somewhere between 1 4 billion and 2 8 billion

oil shipments sent south of the border he added falling global oil prices and widening canadian heavy crude spreads meant that in nominal terms oil exports likely declined moreover the weaker canadian dollar will have made imports in general more costly for domestic purchasers wednesday besides the central bank decision and monetary policy report canada mortgage and housing corp releases its reading of housing starts which economists believe fell about 2 8 per cent to an annual rate of 210 000 or possibly less toronto dominion bank for example expects to see an annual pace of 205 000

china must quickly quench the immediate thirst of a deepening economic slowdown senior economist yu yongding says arresting a deepening economic slowdown not making baseless deep rooted structural reforms should be the top priority for china s economy in 2019 a senior economist said yu yongding believes beijing needs to take every possible measure including increasing money supply and boosting fiscal spending to prevent the world s second largest economy from tanking china s experiences in the last 40 years have told us that all the problems will worsen if we can t maintain economic growth rate at a certain level yu a senior research fellow at the chinese academy of social sciences was quoted by the china business news as saying on tuesday without a certain level of economic growth speed structural adjustments or economic system reform will be baseless the comments by yu a former member of the central bank s monetary policy committee who has been advising chinese policymakers for years came at a time when growth is quickly losing steam amid the trade war with the united states reflecting growing concerns among researchers about a sharp deceleration the caixin purchasing managers index which tracks the activities of small and medium sized enterprises dipped below 50 0 for the first time since may 2017 when december s figures were released on wednesday showing manufacturing activities are contracting it s right to say that we should care about economic growth quality instead of speed but such reforms and adjustments can t be done in short period of time the water from afar can t quench the immediate thirst yu said the chinese government should not worry too much about the property bubble worsening of debt issue or a weakening chinese yuan while attempting to bolster growth yu added his words were the first from a renowned domestic economist on protecting the economic growth rate in 2019 when facing a potential narrowing trade surplus or even deficit and hesitant private investment after president xi jinping warned of the challenges ahead in the next 12 months in his new year s message without specifically mentioning the trade war with the us the chinese leadership highlighted the importance of promoting high quality economic growth in 2019 at the central economic work conference last month and many economists and analysts have called for beijing to show more tolerance toward a slower growth rate and focus on structural reform which has become a demand of the white house during the trade war and is necessary for sustainable development of the chinese economy economists have warned that the us 12 trillion chinese economy will face a weaker and tougher beginning to 2019 as the growth rate is likely to drop below the psychologically important threshold of 6 per cent in the first half of the year chen gong chief researcher at independent beijing based think tank anbound consulting wrote in a research note that china must now face the truth of its economy and defending a 6 per cent growth rate would be the most urgent task figures suggest a further slowing of chinese growth in the fourth quarter from the 6 5 per cent posted in the third quarter if the official statistics show that chinese economic growth is already below 6 per cent everything will be too late he wrote it will expose various troubles and problems a large number of policies will have to be halted halfway the policy direction will have to be changed again and the government officers will be at a loss yu also called on beijing to implement expansionary fiscal policy this year increasing infrastructure investment and allowing the budget deficit to be higher than 3 per cent of gross domestic product gdp a slowing economic growth and a merely 2 per cent of the consumer price index are likely to push the central bank to adopt an expansionary monetary policy to achieve a higher nominal gdp growth rate yu said yu suggested that the people s bank of china has too many objectives in conducting monetary policy including maintaining the exchange rate and property price stability as well as some other structural goals while other central banks generally only focus on inflation it is very reasonable to think that a rising housing price has led to an increase of money supply rather than the opposite way yu said the chinese central bank should not cut money supply due to worries about the property bubble source south china morning post
as this new year of 2019 starts its first full trading week it is worth noting that this is the 20th birthday of the single currency for the most tightly bound countries in the european dream i e the euro eur or getty it is a currency currently used by 19 countries and it has endured a rocky roller coaster of a ride over the past two decades the principle currency pair partner for the euro was of course the u s dollar usd or and in what many observers thought was a sign of arrogance the pair was listed with the euro being written first in the pair i e eurusd the launch rate on monday january 4th 1999 was 1 1800 and yet in just over a decade on friday october 21st 2010 the eurusd rate was quoted as 0 8377 decline of 29 source bank of england foreign exchange desk end of day quotes 16 00 uk time since then the currency has recovered and is trading at eurusd 1 1462 as of 14 34 gmt on monday january 7th 2019 that is a decline of 2 86 from the launch and a recovery of 36 82 from the 2010 low one should be polite to a subject or person why even a currency on its birthday however let us on this occasion be frank the euro has been a disappointment when measured against the key objectives it sought to foster growth and further european consolidation regional annual gdp growth peaked at 4 6 in q1 2000 and has never broken above 4 0 since neither has there has been a gain of cross continental support for european political institutions one only must consider the rise of nationalism and populism in the past two years to observe the failure of that latter objective certainly the principle that was meant to underpin the euro the stability and growth pact which required no national budget deficit over 3 of gdp and no national level of debt to gdp over 60 has been cut to ribbons it has no credibility just look at the leading four economies of the eurozone on those measures germany 1 30 64 10 france 2 60 97 00 italy 2 30 131 80 spain 3 10 98 30 none of the four leading economies have meet both criteria one could say that flexibility was required during the sovereign debt crisis however we are told this has passed greece is out of the bail out programme that in my book is a simple delusion and when one evaluates the past two decades the eurozone could not attract the uk to join indeed we know all too well how poor the uk and europeans are currently getting along compared to the u s the eurozone economy is spluttering along if one measures both regions gdp growth and unemployment rates eurozone 1 60 8 10 u s 3 00 3 90 the coming year does not offer any relief in this regard as gdp growth is forecast at only 1 60 cf 2 60 for the u s there is lingering within the southern members of the eurozone portugal italy greece and spain all of whom detested being known as pigs the imposition of austerity cast a long shadow as many believe the eurozone was set up to suit the needs of the german economy so squeezing the weaker members into deep recessions after the global financial crisis which led to the eurozone sovereign debt crisis their potential prosperity was sacrificed on the altar of austerity the resentment was not limited to the south as anger was also felt in the north wealthier creditor nations most of all germany objected to having to use their hard won wealth to bail out the profligate south so it is fair to say that the eurozone and maybe the wider european union eu is far from being a happy place there is growing concern over brexit the parliament in westminster will not support the prime ministers deal as t stands and the eu are reluctant to give any further concessions so elevating the risk of a hard brexit if this is the case both economies will suffer and therefore one cannot rule out another economic crisis i say this as the uk exports goods and services worth 209 billion 237 billion to the eu and imports from the eu trade worth 342 billion 388 billion the uk accounts for 16 8 of all eu exports trade would continue even if world trade organisation rules and tariffs were applied although the trade flow freedom would be fettered by friction and quite likely held up at ports of entry that is a too big a hit for a bloc the size of the eu to take without a problem rippling through the economy any downturn would leave italy particularly vulnerable as the current coalition need bounding growth to find a way to service their high debt levels what a far cry from the early heady days of 1999 when debt levels and yields were converging as there was widespread belief that the discipline required to be the euro club would ensure that many weaker economies would reform by finding new efficiency gains and return many state owned enterprises to the private sector this led to a booming debt market as new bond issues found many yield hungry investors looking to take what they saw as a risk yield premium over the skinny yields available from germany as we know from 10 years ago the happy market of solid spanish real estate prices and demand for periphery debt soon came to an end in the aftermath the u s sub prime mortgage crisis loans were suddenly not being rolled over as lenders pulled credit lines and property prices collapsed ten years ago i advocated in this magazine that greece should have left the eurozone and returned to the drachma being able to use the freedom of a devalued currency to escape the trauma of being caught in the grip of the euro i called the single currency a lobster pot as one could get in but not get out in the end i suppose the benefits of the single currency was deemed to be greater than the pain of a multitude of legal political operational and moral issues the european central bank ecb which under its second president jean claude trichet had derided the process of quantitative easing qe finally saw the light under the third leader mario draghi and to save the euro he steered the ecb to acquire eur 2 6 trillion usd3 0 trillion worth of bonds the ecb s qe programme ended last month but the banking system is fragile and southern economies are far from stable the month of may will see a surge of support for the populist parties in the european parliament elections despite the gloomy scenario i have painted i can say with genuine conviction that the euro will survive this year however the chinese economy is looking somewhat troubled and the u s could easily slide into a recession if there is no trade deal with trump s america or the organs of the u s government remain closed for much longer maybe the congress will impeach donald trump uncertainty is everywhere what i do harbour are long term concerns about the european economy as france appears incapable of reform germany has an effective vacuum of leadership and does spain and italy is on a collision course with a capital catastrophe and as such i do not see the euro surviving intact for another five let alone 20 years stephen pope marketmind

slowdown in sight for u s economy in 2019 as uncertainty intensifies experts u s economic growth is expected to slow down in 2019 due to factors including the diminishing effect of fiscal stimulus further tightening of financial conditions rising market volatility and trade uncertainty experts have said with annualized growth rates of 2 2 percent 4 2 percent and 3 4 percent for the first three quarters of 2018 respectively and a 2 percent range expected for the fourth quarter the federal reserve estimated that the u s economy would wrap up the year with a 3 percent expansion much higher than the average 2 2 percent annual rate between 2010 and 2017 however economists warned that the boom is by and large led by the u s government s tax cuts and spending increases and that there are signs that the dividends of those measures are diminishing while the fed s monetary tightening will weigh more on u s growth fiscal boost becoming a fiscal drag and more tightening in financial conditions are going to mean that the growth is going to decelerate jeremie cohen setton research fellow at the peterson institute for international economics a washington think tank told xinhua in a recent interview he expected the u s economy to expand at around 2 5 percent in 2019 the slack is diminishing therefore you re going to have more wage pressures he said adding the fed would continue tightening monetary policy as u s inflation is going to overshoot the target of 2 percent a little bit the fed raised interest rates for four times in 2018 and most fed officials envisioned two rate hikes in 2019 it is more likely that the economy will grow in a way that will call for two interest rate increases over the course of next year fed chairman jerome powell told a press conference on dec 19 the fed anticipated that u s economic growth would decelerate to 2 3 percent in 2019 powell also emphasized at the press conference that the fed s policy decisions are not on a preset course there s a fairly high degree of uncertainty about both the path and the destination of any further increases he said but some experts argued that the fed s latest rate hike in december amid market volatility was questionable and an error it felt like a model driven decision occurred despite market turmoil that had continued too long to be ignored tim duy of the university of oregon wrote recently in his fed watch column duy noted that there was no pressing reason for a rate hike other than fed officials insist on defining policy on the back of long run forecasts and feel compelled to follow through with that policy what will add to the downside risks analysts said is the prospect of a protracted stalemate over government budget which has paralyzed a quarter of the federal government for more than a week now leaving some 800 000 federal workers furloughed or working without pay although the impact of the partial government shutdown on the overall economy remains limited for the time being it will no longer be negligible if the closure were to persist especially in a time of market volatility concerns about a loss of growth momentum in asia and europe would also likely weigh on u s growth for the rest of the world there seems to be some air coming out of the balloon that will come back and also affect the u s the international monetary fund s outgoing chief economist maurice obstfeld told reporters in early december meanwhile u s president donald trump s alleged displeasure with powell the stock market turbulence and ongoing trade disputes are all stoking uncertainties in the u s economy heading into 2019 following the imposition of steel and aluminum tariffs worldwide on the ground of national security it is not yet clear whether the u s government will slap new duties on imported cars and car parts in 2019 the european commission warned in a written document sent to the u s commerce department in june that some 300 billion u s dollars worth of u s exports will likely be hit by retaliatory measures from other economies subject to the potential auto tariffs in addition whether the u s government is capable enough to respond to a slowing economy or other contingencies and stabilize the market remains to be seen investors fear that a lack of experience coupled with personnel shortage may lead the u s government to miscalculation and policy failure further unsettling the market the u s treasury department had been blamed by market participants for sending at times muddled and confusing signals according to u s media in a move to quell market volatility treasury secretary steven mnuchin on dec 23 convened individual calls to chief executive officers of six major u s banks the banks all confirmed ample liquidity is available for lending to consumer and business markets the treasury department said in a statement mnuchin s effort to reach out to the private banking sector was not only rare for a senior government official but also of no avail as the dow the s p 500 and the nasdaq all tumbled more than 2 percent on the first trading day following the treasury department s statement the new york times said that mnuchin conducted the type of discussions usually reserved for moments of crisis thomas simons a senior economist at jefferies llc in new york pointed out that technical factors including sell orders driven by tax considerations and low year end volume could exaggerate the plunge in the stock market the first couple weeks of january will be telling as to whether this selling in december was technically related or actually fundamentally based he was quoted by bloomberg as saying despite a lift in major indices on monday u s stocks ended 2018 with the steepest annual declines since the 2008 financial crisis and many have cautioned the coming of a bear market after almost a decade of bull run source xinhua

of the many infrastructure projects included in the broad sweep of china s belt and road initiative bri surely none is as controversial as sri lanka s hambantota port for critics of the bri here surely was incontrovertible proof of a premeditated programme of trapping smaller fragile states in debt to make them financially dependent on china on the surface these voices had a point when sri lanka started rebuilding the country in 2009 after 26 years of bloody civil war it had few international allies at first only china answered the call its development banks were flush with cash and many were only too willing to lend the introduction of the bri president xi jinping s flagship plan to rewrite the global trade map in china s image accelerated the flow of capital into the south asian state long seen as one of beijing s staunchest regional allies at first the focal point of mainland lending was in the south of the island around hambantota the stronghold of then president mahinda rajapaksa widely seen in the west as being pro china and keen to borrow from beijing at any cost
the world bank group is a family of five multilateral institutions focused on economic development whose overarching mission is global poverty reduction established by western powers in 1944 the world bank was originally tasked with rebuilding the economies of postwar europe almost eighty years later it has funded more than twelve thousand projects and expanded its reach into nearly all of the world s developing countries since june 2023 the bank has been led by former mastercard ceo ajay banga the first indian american to lead the institution but the long standing tradition of u s leadership of the world bank has led some observers to argue that the bank is too dominated by the west particularly given the bank s primary focus on the developing world and the rise of alternative institutions others suggest the bank has outlived its usefulness altogether citing the increase in private capital flows available to developing countries supporters of the bank contend that it contributes to global economic development as an arbiter of best practices when was the world bank founded the world bank along with its sister organization the international monetary fund imf was created at the bretton woods conference in new hampshire in 1944 the allied powers led by the united states and the united kingdom sought to restore european prosperity and prevent a recurrence of the economic malaise of the 1920s and 1930s which helped fuel the rise of totalitarianism the imf which by tacit agreement would be led by a european was charged with managing the global regime of exchange rates and balance of payments the world bank to be led by an american would provide member countries with postwar reconstruction loans while the imf would focus on firefighting immediate macroeconomic problems the world bank would concentrate on the longer task of development in recent decades the bank s primary focus has shifted from partnering with middle income nations on growth related programs and trade liberalization toward global poverty alleviation these efforts take place in the world s poorest countries particularly those in africa and in middle income countries such as china and india where the majority of the world s poor reside in 2013 the bank set a goal to end extreme poverty experienced by people living on 2 15 or less per day by 2030 world bank officials have since said that the lender will not succeed in that timeframe in 2022 senior bank officials wrote that it is now clear that the global goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030 will not be achieved absent a history defying rate of progress over the next eight years other priorities for the bank include transnational issues such as climate change and recovery from the covid 19 pandemic as well as reconstruction in postconflict nations what does the world bank do the world bank group is composed of five separate institutions the international bank for reconstruction and development ibrd the international development association ida the international finance corporation the multilateral investment guarantee agency and the international center for settlement of investment disputes each of these agencies is owned and operated as a cooperative by its member countries together the ibrd and the ida are commonly referred to as the world bank as of 2023 the bank s 6 largest shareholders out of its 189 members are the united states japan china germany france and the united kingdom ultimate policymaking authority at the bank rests with the board of governors mostly made up of senior finance or development officials from member countries the board of governors in turn delegates certain powers to the board of directors which is composed of twenty five executives and the world bank s president the international bank for reconstruction and development delegates at bretton woods established the ibrd in 1944 as the world bank s charter institution through loans guarantees and other services the ibrd works with middle income and creditworthy low income nations to fight poverty projects span the globe and include digitizing health systems in belarus reducing air pollution in colombia and generating solar power in pakistan the international development association as a complement to the ibrd the ida was established in 1960 to promote broad based development work in the world s poorest countries by offering interest free credits and grants the ida currently considers seventy five countries including thirty nine in africa eligible for its programs which focus on education health and sustainable environmental practices what do the world bank s proponents say the world bank has been revered by many as the preeminent brain trust in development economics you could certainly find brilliant development economists outside the bank writes cfr s sebastian mallaby in his book the world s banker but nobody could match the bank s concentration of talent as a

economy in 1995 to becoming an upper middle income economy today the world bank also provided almost half of the public funding of south korea in the high growth years of the 1970s and 1980s paving the way for the country to become the eleventh largest economy by gross domestic product gdp today up from the thirtieth largest in 1975 most recently the world bank introduced several initiatives to keep low income economies from collapsing during the pandemic including measures to increase lending and defer payments on existing external debt after the russian invasion of ukraine in 2022 the bank formed a fund to finance the country s recovery though experts note that an end to the war could still be years away what do critics say about the world bank the plan to end world poverty shows all the pretensions of utopian social engineering william easterly the bank s perceived shortcomings have come under scrutiny for decades including from former bank officials the plan to end world poverty shows all the pretensions of utopian social engineering former world bank economist william easterly wrote in 2006 and since resigning from the world bank in 1999 former chief economist joseph stiglitz has argued that the economic reforms the imf and world bank frequently require as conditions for their lending have often been counterproductive for recipient economies and devastating for those countries populations the economic consequences of the covid 19 pandemic and the war in ukraine have battered many developing economies reinvigorating criticism of the bank and other western lenders some experts say the global nature of these crises has laid bare the bank s limitations and its obsolete rules while rich countries issued stimulus packages to fight deteriorating economic conditions during the pandemic low income countries had to borrow vast sums of money to stay afloat yet even with historic levels of lending from the world bank low income countries could afford to mobilize just a small fraction of their economies toward pandemic response compared to over a quarter of gdp in the united states and after the war in ukraine sparked skyrocketing inflation poverty and hunger increased around the world global education and health outcomes also suffered in 2023 the world bank warned of a lost decade projecting average global economic output through 2030 would fall to a thirty year low worsening climate change could deepen those challenges the world bank estimated in 2021 that a warming planet could push an additional 132 million people into poverty that same year a senior un official said the world bank was fiddling while the developing world burns citing its underperformance on climate action the world bank is the largest source of financing for climate change mitigation and adaptation projects in developing countries yet the 31 7 billion it spent on such programs in fiscal year 2022 fy 2022 fell far short of estimates of the funding required a report published by economists at the london school of economics and political science estimated in 2022 that emerging markets and developing countries excluding china will need to collectively spend 1 3 1 7 trillion per year on climate needs by 2030 these include investments in renewable energy upgrades to already strained power grids and the phaseout of coal plants still other critics argue that geopolitical considerations have made development finance more challenging after russia invaded ukraine in 2022 the world bank cut ties with both russia and its ally belarus pausing all programs in the two countries meanwhile rival investment programs such as those affiliated with china s belt and road initiative have gained popularity as a way of financing infrastructure projects it is increasingly difficult for the bank to fund large infrastructure projects without becoming embroiled in geopolitical rivalry nor can it compete with massive infrastructure loans subsidized by governments motivated by geopolitical objectives writes scott m moore a china expert and former world bank analyst are there alternatives skeptics question whether there is still a niche for the world bank in the modern architecture of global finance particularly given the availability of private lending and the growth of emerging economies over the past two decades some economists have argued that the increasingly global nature of private capital flows and the ascendance of large emerging economies such as the brics brazil russia india china and south africa diminish the world bank s influence these dynamics have led some to recommend that the bank narrow its focus to countries that lack access to private markets if the world bank wants to have a significant role on the lending side it s going to have to be in the poorest of the poor countries or war torn countries where the private sector has been effectively scared off cfr s benn steil said the brics s new development bank and the china led asian infrastructure investment bank aiib have presented developing countries with alternatives to the bretton woods institutions rebecca liao a china analyst writes that the aiib was born from developing world grievances with what poor countries see as the bank s onerous terms emerging markets including china which the world bank classifies as an upper middle income country even though it is the world s second largest economy have also been frustrated with their relative lack of influence at the world bank and the imf but giving china in particular a greater voice in the bretton woods institutions is not without risks china is not seen any more in congress as being a responsible player in the international financial community steil said at a cfr media briefing the last thing u s officials want to see he argued is the world bank turned into a global belt and road pursuing china s geostrategic gain to this point some experts say the bank should reform its voting structure to be more competitive including for its presidential elections the united states has double the voting share of japan the country with the next most votes having an american at the helm of the bank partly served to reassure wall street originally the main supplier of the bank s capital cfr s thomas j bollyky wrote in 2012 with the globalization of capital markets this justification is long outdated he recommends a voting system that requires leaders to win over a majority of countries not simply the primary shareholders the bank s board of governors considered non u s candidates in 2012 when u s citizen jim yong kim ultimately defeated candidates from colombia and nigeria however it considered only americans in the two subsequent nomination periods kim s successor david malpass drew criticism for his position on climate change and resigned one year before his term ended other experts go farther arguing that the united states should relinquish its presidency of the world bank especially as the u s share of global economic output diminishes by allowing someone else to lead the bank washington would neutralize assertions from beijing that alternative development institutions such as its own creation the asian infrastructure investment bank are necessary to overcome unreasoned u s resistance to governance reform writes cfr s steil such reforms would ensure the united states picks a world bank president based on its policy priorities and without the restriction of nationality while still maintaining a veto over major institutional changes what lies ahead for the world bank despite its challenges most economists say the world bank still serves an important role in global development the bank itself argues that it has a number of comparative advantages over other institutions a global presence a repository of best practices financial acumen leadership in global public goods and an established role as an international development catalyst several experts have proposed reforms to reorient the bank s mission in the age of climate change in 2022 prime minister of barbados mia mottley proposed the bridgetown initiative an overhaul of the world bank and other financial institutions that calls on wealthy countries to provide 100 billion per year in foreign exchange guarantees to low income countries for decarbonization efforts the plan drew support from the head of the imf in 2022 and high level u s officials including secretary of the treasury janet yellen endorsed the need for world bank reforms mottley says she has discussed the initiative with world bank president banga but he has not officially backed it for his part banga has proposed plans to expand the world bank s lending by 100 billion over the next decade his reforms would allow bank shareholders including the united states and other wealthy countries to guarantee loans if countries cannot repay them at a cfr meeting in september 2023 banga said he intends to stretch the bank s balance sheet with all the financial engineering i can do the bank has previously said such maneuvers could increase lending sixfold over a ten year period still steil says that china and other rapidly growing economies at some point will need to assume responsibility for their own people given their economic growth he argues that rather than loaning large sums of money the world bank s primary role in the years ahead could instead lie in the advisory assistance it provides
lebanon must eradicate corruption and improve transparency to address its economic problems leading economists demanded that in the wake of a damning report by the american consulting firm mckinsey the 1 200 page report released by the country s ministry of economy last wednesday warns of a crippling political stalemate in government and says the country is facing economic collapse one of the damaging figures reveals that lebanon s residents spend 50 percent more time than needed on congested roads only 15 percent of which are in good condition it also discloses that lebanon s infrastructure ranks 113th out of 137 countries these numbers come from a variety of sources like the world bank and others so these have been assessed by various international parties dr nasser saidi former chief economist and head of external relations at the dubai international financial center what s more important is the cost of this in terms of productivity and income because when you spend time on the road you aren t producing anything so congestion costs are very large in terms of both loss of business opportunities lost income and lost productivity lebanon was found to have the world s fourth worst quality of electricity behind haiti nigeria and yemen electricity in lebanon is just more expensive but everyone has 24 hour electricity if they can afford it nadim shehadi an associate fellow at chatham house if you measure electricity supply by state provision then it s the worst in the world but if you measure it by what s available to people it s not so bad there are sometimes indicators that have to take into account the fact that lebanon is a mixture of private sector illegal activity and government sector and sometimes illegal activity compensates for the government sector he said the government is failing but will not change the law to allow people to supply electricity so the only alternative is illegality which supplements the government he said illegality is not necessarily totally negative in this case lebanon s perceived corruption was shown to have increased by 26 points since 2012 to 146 out of 180 in terms of governance it has been deteriorating over the past five to six years on a continuous basis saidi said it s corruption bribery and nepotism in all reports on transparency and corruption lebanon is unfortunately one of the most corrupt places in the world and the importance of it is not only that we want to be able to fight corruption but that it has become a cancer and it is so pervasive he emphasized the issue as it is a major contributor to public finance and the budget deficit corruption is directly related to government procurement and government contracts as well as government revenue he said so there is widespread tax evasion and corruption is at the core of lebanon s large budget deficit which was close to 11 percent in 2018 and likely to be the same or higher in 2019 the economic and fiscal impacts are extremely important the report further outlined that the country s gross domestic product gdp per capita today is only 30 percent higher than it was in 1980 which was five years into the lebanese civil war shehadi said prior to 1975 lebanon s standard of living and gdp per capita were on par with some european countries such as spain ireland and portugal if you want to measure the real damage that the civil war and the israeli occupation have done to the country it s where lebanon stands vis a vis countries that were equivalent to it before the war he added so it has regressed a lot by that measure shehadi said the poor quality of statistics in the country needs to be improved as the central statistics office lacks resources and figures on key areas including gdp and investment he said the lack of field productivity growth and investment means it is unsurprising that there has not been much of an increase in per capita income or real gdp the mckinsey report highlighted the country s education system deeming it to be of low quality and in decline it said many skills are not being taught to suit labor force needs partially because the curriculum has not been upgraded since 1997 experts however said this is only the case for public sector schools and universities

washington ap feeling the pressure of investigations and a partial government shutdown president donald trump is playing loose with the facts regarding hush payments made by his former attorney michael cohen to two women and is changing his story on his promise to build a concrete border wall paid for by mexico in comments over the weekend trump said he did not commit any campaign violation and suggests anything improper would be minor compared with infractions of democrats such as former president barack obama the reality is not so cut and dried federal prosecutors in new york have implicated trump in a crime linking him to the hush money scheme the obama campaign s infractions were civil not criminal on the border wall trump insists he never promised a concrete barrier even though he did and asserts that much of it has been built it hasn t the dubious statements capped an expansive week of assertions by the president on top of the usual twitter flow trump opened a cabinet meeting with 90 minutes of opining to the press touching on immigration drug prices the soviet history in afghanistan his approval ratings syria oil prices the attractiveness of his generals better looking than tom cruise and much more a few days later he spoke for an hour at a rose garden news conference a sampling of his claims trump investigations advertisement advertisement trump many people currently a part of my opposition including president obama the dems have had campaign violations in some cases for very large sums of money these are civil cases they paid a fine settled while no big deal i did not commit a campaign violation tweet saturday the facts trump has been tied to but not charged with a crime at issue is not a routine campaign violation prosecutors court filings last month said trump directed cohen to make payments to buy the silence of porn actress stormy daniels and former playboy model karen mcdougal during the 2016 presidential campaign both women alleged they had extramarital affairs with trump which the white house denies cohen who pleaded guilty in august to campaign finance crimes in connection with those payments had previously implicated trump now the justice department is backing up cohen s claims advertisement advertisement in particular the justice department says the hush money payments were unreported campaign contributions meant to influence the outcome of the election that assertion makes the payments subject to campaign finance laws which restrict how much people can donate to a campaign and bar corporations from making direct contributions it s unclear whether trump will actually be charged with illegal activity because justice department legal memos from 1973 and 2000 have suggested that a sitting president is immune from indictment house speaker nancy pelosi d calif told nbc this past week that trump isn t necessarily immune calling an indictment of a sitting president an open discussion in terms of the law there s a big difference between obama s campaign violation and cohen s case a federal election commission audit found that the 2008 obama campaign failed to file 48 hour contribution reports in a timely manner for more than 1 200 donations totaling 1 9 million the commission also found the campaign was late refunding some contributions that exceeded legal limits and discovered some other reporting errors regarding contribution dates advertisement advertisement the commission fined the obama campaign 375 000 for the violations the campaign was not found to have willfully violated the law making it a civil infraction in cohen s case he admitted he knew he was breaking the law by making the payments cohen told abc last month that of course trump knew it was wrong to make the hush money payments though he did not provide any specific evidence in the interview unlike the obama case where the issue was timely reporting the hush money payments were never disclosed at all on trump s campaign filings andrew herman a lawyer specializing in campaign finance at law firm miller chevalier said the two cases are completely different species one is a paperwork error he said and the other is a conscious attempt to obscure payments made to affect an election advertisement advertisement ___ the wall trump as far as concrete i said i was going to build a wall i never said i m going to build a concrete i said i m going to build a wall rose garden news conference friday the facts actually he did say he would build a concrete wall trump even repeated that promise last week rejecting the claim of his departing white house chief of staff john kelly that trump had abandoned the notion of a solid concrete wall early on in the administration an all concrete wall was never abandoned trump tweeted on dec 31 some areas will be all concrete but the experts at border patrol prefer a wall that is see through advertisement advertisement during the 2016 campaign trump pledged to build a big beautiful wall made of concrete rebar and steel across the length of the southern border with mexico back then he lashed out at the suggestion that what he was proposing had anything in common with mere fencing jeb bush just talked about my border proposal to build a fence he tweeted in 2015 it s not a fence jeb it s a wall and there s a big difference he now often refers to the wall as steel slats steel is stronger than concrete he said friday if i build a steel wall rather than a concrete wall it will actually be stronger than a concrete wall advertisement advertisement ___ trump when they say build the wall i don t say that any more i say finish the wall remarks to reporters sunday trump we ve already built a lot of the wall rose garden news conference friday the facts he hasn t built much of the wall at all trump s claim is only supported when counting work done under past presidents and ignoring the fact that fences from prior administrations are not the towering walls he promised the 2006 secure fence act has resulted in about 650 miles 1 050 kilometers of border barrier money approved by congress in march 2018 is to pay for 84 miles 135 km but that work is not done trump has achieved some renovation of existing barrier advertisement advertisement ___ trump the drugs are pouring into this country they don t go through the ports of entry when they do they sometimes get caught rose garden news conference the facts he s wrong in saying drug smugglers don t or only rarely use official border crossings for their trafficking land ports of entry are their primary means for getting drugs into the country not stretches of the border without barriers says the u s drug enforcement administration the agency said in a november report that the most common trafficking technique by transnational criminal organizations is to hide drugs in passenger vehicles or tractor trailers as they drive into the u s though entry ports where they are stopped and subject to inspection they also employ buses cargo trains and tunnels the report says citing smuggling methods that would not be choked off by a border wall advertisement advertisement ___ trump the new trade deal we have with mexico and canada what we save on that just with mexico will pay for the wall many times over just in a period of a year two years or three years so i view that as absolutely mexico is paying for the wall rose garden news conference the facts mexico is not paying for the wall and nothing in the trade agreement would cover or refund the construction cost trump is assuming a wide variety of economic benefits will come from the agreement but they can t be quantified or counted on for example he said the deal will dissuade some u s companies from moving operations to mexico and he credits that possibility as a payment by mexico for his wall advertisement advertisement the deal updates the north american free trade agreement in the main preserving nafta s liberalized environment of low or no tariffs among the u s mexico and canada while making certain improvements for each country trump stated inaccurately that it s brand new it s totally different moreover it s not in effect the deal has yet to be ratified in any member country and its chances of winning legislative approval are not assured trump has argued repeatedly that mexico is footing the bill even while insisting on 5 6 billion from the u s treasury to go toward wall construction his demand and the refusal of democrats to satisfy it are behind the budget standoff that has closed parts of the government ___ syria trump we are pulling back in syria we re going to be removing our troops i never said we re doing it that quickly remarks to reporters sunday trump we re bringing the troops back home over a period of time i never said so quickly but over a period of time cabinet meeting wednesday the facts he s wrong about his past statements regarding the pace of withdrawal in a video posted to his twitter account on dec 19 for instance trump said of the roughly 2 000 troops in syria they re all coming back and they re coming back now ___ trump i read when we pull out oh russia is thrilled russia is not happy you know why they re not happy because they like it when we re killing isis because we re killing them for them and we re killing them for assad and we re killing isis also for iran cabinet meeting the facts russia says it s happy a u s withdrawal opens opportunities for moscow and tehran to increase their influence and may help the syrian government survive as a kurdish led opposition force loses its military ally on the ground russian president vladimir putin says the u s has done the right thing in planning to pull out ___ afghanistan trump the reason russia was in afghanistan was because terrorists were going into russia they the soviets were right to be there cabinet meeting the facts his assertion that the soviet union was experiencing a terrorist influx from afghanistan when it invaded in 1979 is out of step with history and his belief that the soviets were right to invade is a stark departure from u s and world opinion the soviets were trying to bolster communists in afghanistan and possibly expand their influence against the united states and the west world condemnation was swift the u n general assembly voted 104 18 to deplore the soviet intervention in afghanistan the u s supported the anti communist rebels giving them shoulder fired rockets to down soviet aircraft the soviets withdrew in 1989 ___ trump russia used to be the soviet union afghanistan made it russia because they went bankrupt fighting in afghanistan cabinet meeting the facts afghanistan was far from the sole reason for the breakup of the soviet union in 1991 the dissolution occurred in a time of ethnic and political troubles economic woes and a series of revolutions that led soviet republics to seek their independence the soviet demise was accelerated by the heavy cost of competing with the west to wield influence around the world including in afghanistan ___ oil prices trump do you think it s just luck that gas prices are so low and falling low gas prices are like another tax cut tweet tuesday trump it s not luck it s not luck i called up certain people and i said let that damn oil and gasoline you let it flow the oil it was going up to 125 if that would ve happened then you would ve had a recession depression cabinet meeting wednesday the facts it s not all about him or even mostly about him while americans may end up paying somewhat less for gasoline this year trump s suggestion that he deserves all the credit and averted a u s economic depression is an exaggeration oil prices which peaked oct 3 have been generally falling on the realization that u s sanctions against iran would not create a shortage and on fear that a global oversupply of oil will spill into 2019 if slower international economic growth depresses energy demand the president s supposed let it flow edict did not stop opec and its russia led allies from agreeing last month to cut oil production that initially failed to stop oil prices from sliding further they have since rebounded a few dollars in the past week continued opec production cuts would push prices higher trump has pointed to his positive relations with saudi arabia which remains the biggest oil exporter as a so called swing producer with the ability to adjust production up or down relatively quickly it can indeed influence the price of crude but the market is complex canada for example is actually the top source of u s oil imports with saudi arabia second ___ tariffs trump the united states treasury has taken in many billions of dollars from the tariffs we are charging china and other countries that have not treated us fairly in the meantime we are doing well in various trade negotiations currently going on tweet thursday the facts trump is off on two major issues first tariffs are taxes paid largely by u s business and consumers not foreign countries and while trump s many billions might sound like a lot it s doing little to nothing to improve the federal balance sheet the u s government spent 4 1 trillion last fiscal year and the budget deficit shot up according to trump s own treasury department customs and duties generated 41 3 billion in revenues last year up from 34 6 billion in 2017 that 6 7 billion increase occurred in part because of the president s tariffs but it amounted to just 0 16 percent of federal spending ___ mattis trump on jim mattis i wish him well i hope he does well but as you know president barack obama fired him and essentially so did i i want results cabinet meeting wednesday the facts actually mattis resigned as defense secretary in protest over trump s decision to pull u s troops from syria the retired marine general announced on dec 20 in a resignation letter that he was stepping down after trump s decision to withdraw 2 000 u s troops from syria mattis said he would stay on the job until the end of february three days later trump said he was replacing mattis with the second ranking defense official pat shanahan on jan 1 as to the tenure under obama mattis served as commander of the military s central command he departed a few months earlier than expected in 2013 in part because of disagreements over iran ___ drug prices trump i think you re going to see a tremendous reduction in drug prices cabinet meeting wednesday the facts prices continue to rise administration policies announced last year and currently being completed don t seem to have shifted that trend figures on u s prescription drug price changes compiled by health data company elsevier show that from dec 20 through jan 2 there were 1 179 product price changes of those 30 were price cuts and the remaining 1 149 were price increases with 328 of them between 9 percent and 10 percent all but one of the rest were by lower percentages elsevier spokesman chris capot said more companies will be announcing price increases this month separately a data firm whose software can help patients find the most cost effective medications says its information shows price increases on many commonly used drugs for conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes in the first two days of january prices have increased on more than 250 different products said michael rea ceo of rx savings solutions the average increase is about 6 percent he added ___ immigration trump on the number of immigrants living in the u s illegally i used to hear 11 million all the time it would always stay right at 11 i said does it ever increase or go down no it s 11 nobody knows it s probably 30 35 million people they would flow in mostly from the southern border they d come in and nobody would talk about it nobody would do anything about it cabinet meeting wednesday the facts it s nowhere close to 30 million to 35 million according to his own homeland security secretary as well as independent estimates the nonpartisan pew research center estimates there were 10 7 million immigrants in the u s illegally in 2016 the most recent data available advocacy groups on both sides of the immigration issue have similar estimates at a house hearing last month homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen acknowledged the number was somewhere between 11 million and 22 million significantly lower than trump s claim of 35 million according to pew the number of immigrants in the u s illegally had reached a height of 12 2 million in 2007 representing about 4 percent of the u s population before declining in part because of a weakening u s economy ___ trump the coyotes are using children to gain access into this country they re using these children they re not with families they re using the children they re taking the children and then they dispose of the children after they re done this has been going on for years this isn t unique to us but we want to stop it cabinet meeting wednesday the facts this does happen though it s not as common as trump suggests by talking about it so often he is referring to adults who come with children they falsely claim to be theirs so that they won t be detained under a no child separation policy but such cases of fraud are rare according to the homeland security department about 500 immigrants were found to be not a legitimate family unit and thus separated upon detention from april 19 to sept 30 of last year that s a small fraction of the 107 000 families apprehended in the last budget year which ended sept 30 ___ associated press writers eric tucker chad day josh boak michael balsamo colleen long jill colvin ricardo

cuts started late last year by opec opec oil supply fell last month by 460k bpd to 2 68m bpd led by cuts from top exporter saudi arabia because of record us crude oil production eia of 11 7m bpd us

with those payments had previously implicated trump now the justice department is backing up cohen s claims in particular the justice department says the hush money payments were unreported campaign contributions meant to influence the outcome of the election that assertion makes the payments subject to campaign finance laws which restrict how much people can donate to a campaign and bar corporations from making direct contributions it s unclear whether trump will actually be charged with illegal activity because justice department legal memos from 1973 and 2000 have suggested that a sitting president is immune from indictment house speaker nancy pelosi d calif told nbc this past week that trump isn t necessarily immune calling an indictment of a sitting president an open discussion in terms of the law there s a big difference between obama s campaign violation and cohen s case a federal election commission audit found that the 2008 obama campaign failed to file 48

though he did not provide any specific evidence in the interview unlike the obama case where the issue was timely reporting the hush money payments were never disclosed at all on trump s campaign filings andrew herman a lawyer specializing in campaign finance at law firm miller chevalier said the two cases are completely different species one is a paperwork error he said and the other is a

most thai exporters are worried about the baht appreciating against the us dollar fearing it will hit exports and farm incomes amid the slowing of both local and global economies a stronger baht will hurt our rice price competitiveness amid weaker currencies in the region such as india thai rice exporters association president charoen laothammatas told the nation on thursday this will then be passed on to the price of paddy rice thus adversely affecting farmers he warned asked whether rice exporters will discuss the issue with the bank of thailand bot charoen said exporters have raised this issue with the central bank many times but the baht remains stronger compared to other competitors currencies such as india s rupee and china s yuan the association predicts this year s rice experts to be around 10 million tonnes less than the 11 million tonnes forecast last year according to the bot the baht stood at 32 205 against the us dollar on thursday the year s second day of trading up from 32 417 to the greenback on december 28 the last trading day of last year weakening dollar the baht rose to 32 032 per dollar in the spot market at about 2pm on thursday as the yen rose sharply to 107 08 per dollar said kasikornbank capital markets research head kobsidthi silpachai it was risk off mode selling the dollar against safe havens and low yielding currencies like the japanese yen and thai baht he said since thursday was a japanese holiday some people suspected that algorithms were behind the us selling he noted one factor causing the dollar to weaken is the partial us government shutdown resulting from a political gridlock in washington where president donald trump and the democrats who hold a majority in the lower house failed to strike a deal he said the baht was also mostly flat in trading against the us dollar in january and december last year but was highly volatile in between it may be subject to volatile swings this year compared to the indian rupee which was down about nine per cent against the dollar last year he said the indian rupee s weakness is likely to continue this year as the subcontinent is expected to run a current account deficit at 2 6 per cent of gross domestic product compared with thailand s estimated current account surplus of 6 9 per cent he said currencies of emerging markets facing current account deficits will also weaken against the dollar he said however he added that since the us dollar baht trade was very thin over the past few days it did not truly reflect demand and supply in the market currency trading next week should provide a clearer picture as buyers and sellers enter the market again also the upcoming general election could produce split houses with politicians controlling the lower house while the senate will be controlled by the military hence the next government may find it difficult to function much like the situation in washington and that could weaken the baht kobsidthi added thai bond market association president tada phutthitada said capital inflow into the bond market is low over the past few weeks daily inflow has been less than one billion baht 31 28 million compared to between two and three billion baht daily previously he said this suggests that the baht has not been strengthened by foreign capital inflows but rather by a weakening dollar he said meanwhile investors are unsure whether the us federal reserve will continue increasing key policy rates as expected earlier that combined with trump s threat to fire the federal reserve chairman could weaken the dollar further tada said separately cimb bank research office head amornthep chawla said exporters will face two key challenges the impact of the us china trade war and a stronger baht there is a high possibility that exports could turn negative in the first quarter of this year partly due to a slowdown in global economy and also last year s high base of exports he warned the nation thailand ann
vol 43 no 1 friday january 4 2019 ap fact check trump claims innocence in probe wall myths print front page email this story you have entered an invalid email address to required from required message you have entered an invalid email address from email required message required washington ap feeling the pressure of investigations and a partial government shutdown president donald trump is playing loose with the facts regarding hush payments made by his former attorney michael cohen to two women and is changing his story on his promise to build a concrete border wall paid for by mexico in comments over the weekend trump said he did not commit any campaign violation and suggests anything improper would be minor compared with infractions of democrats such as former president barack obama the reality is not so cut and dried federal prosecutors in new york have implicated trump in a crime linking him to the hush money scheme the obama campaign s infractions were civil not criminal on the border wall trump insists he never promised a concrete barrier even though he did and asserts that much of it has been built it hasn t the dubious statements capped an expansive week of assertions by the president on top of the usual twitter flow trump opened a cabinet meeting with 90 minutes of opining to the press touching on immigration drug prices the soviet history in afghanistan his approval ratings syria oil prices the attractiveness of his generals better looking than tom cruise and much more a few days later he spoke for an hour at a rose garden news conference a sampling of his claims trump investigations trump many people currently a part of my opposition including president obama the dems have had campaign violations in some cases for very large sums of money these are civil cases they paid a fine settled while no big deal i did not commit a campaign violation tweet saturday the facts trump has been tied to but not charged with a crime at issue is not a routine campaign violation prosecutors court filings last month said trump directed cohen to make payments to buy the silence of porn actress stormy daniels and former playboy model karen mcdougal during the 2016 presidential campaign both women alleged they had extramarital affairs with trump which the white house denies cohen who pleaded guilty in august to campaign finance crimes in connection with those payments had previously implicated trump now the justice department is backing up cohen s claims in particular the justice department says the hush money payments were unreported campaign contributions meant to influence the outcome of the election that assertion makes the payments subject to campaign finance laws which restrict how much people can donate to a campaign and bar corporations from making direct contributions it s unclear whether trump will actually be charged with illegal activity because justice department legal memos from 1973 and 2000 have suggested that a sitting president is immune from indictment house speaker nancy pelosi d calif told nbc this past week that trump isn t necessarily immune calling an indictment of a sitting president an open discussion in terms of the law there s a big difference between obama s campaign violation and cohen s case a federal election commission audit found that the 2008 obama campaign failed to file 48 hour contribution reports in a timely manner for more than 1 200 donations totaling 1 9 million the commission also found the campaign was late refunding some contributions that exceeded legal limits and discovered some other reporting errors regarding contribution dates the commission fined the obama campaign 375 000 for the violations the campaign was not found to have willfully violated the law making it a civil infraction in cohen s case he admitted he knew he was breaking the law by making the payments cohen told abc last month that of course trump knew it was wrong to make the hush money payments though he did not provide any specific evidence in the interview unlike the obama case where the issue was timely reporting the hush money payments were never disclosed at all on trump s campaign filings andrew herman a lawyer specializing in campaign finance at law firm miller chevalier said the two cases are completely different species one is a paperwork error he said and the other is a conscious attempt to obscure payments made to affect an election ___ the wall trump as far as concrete i said i was going to build a wall i never said i m going to build a concrete i said i m going to build a wall rose garden news conference friday the facts actually he did say he would build a concrete wall trump even repeated that promise last week rejecting the claim of his departing white house chief of staff john kelly that trump had abandoned the notion of a solid concrete wall early on in the administration an all concrete wall was never abandoned trump tweeted on dec 31 some areas will be all concrete but the experts at border patrol prefer a wall that is see through during the 2016 campaign trump pledged to build a big beautiful wall made of concrete rebar and steel across the length of the southern border with mexico back then he lashed out at the suggestion that what he was proposing had anything in common with mere fencing jeb bush just talked about my border proposal to build a fence he tweeted in 2015 it s not a fence jeb it s a wall and there s a big difference he now often refers to the wall as steel slats steel is stronger than concrete he said friday if i build a steel wall rather than a concrete wall it will actually be stronger than a concrete wall ___ trump when they say build the wall i don t say that any more i say finish the wall remarks to reporters sunday trump we ve already built a lot of the wall rose garden news conference friday the facts he hasn t built much of the wall at all trump s claim is only supported when counting work done under past presidents and ignoring the fact that fences from prior administrations are not the towering walls he promised the 2006 secure fence act has resulted in about 650 miles 1 050 kilometers of border barrier money approved by congress in march 2018 is to pay for 84 miles 135 km but that work is not done trump has achieved some renovation of existing barrier ___ trump the drugs are pouring into this country they don t go through the ports of entry when they do they sometimes get caught rose garden news conference the facts he s wrong in saying drug smugglers don t or only rarely use official border crossings for their trafficking land ports of entry are their primary means for getting drugs into the country not stretches of the border without barriers says the u s drug enforcement administration the agency said in a november report that the most common trafficking technique by transnational criminal organizations is to hide drugs in passenger vehicles or tractor trailers as they drive into the u s though entry ports where they are stopped and subject to inspection they also employ buses cargo trains and tunnels the report says citing smuggling methods that would not be choked off by a border wall ___ trump the new trade deal we have with mexico and canada what we save on that just with mexico will pay for the wall many times over just in a period of a year two years or three years so i view that as absolutely mexico is paying for the wall rose garden news conference the facts mexico is not paying for the wall and nothing in the trade agreement would cover or refund the construction cost trump is assuming a wide variety of economic benefits will come from the agreement but they can t be quantified or counted on for example he said the deal will dissuade some u s companies from moving operations to mexico and he credits that possibility as a payment by mexico for his wall the deal updates the north american free trade agreement in the main preserving nafta s liberalized environment of low or no tariffs among the u s mexico and canada while making certain improvements for each country trump stated inaccurately that it s brand new it s totally different moreover it s not in effect the deal has yet to be ratified in any member country and its chances of winning legislative approval are not assured trump has argued repeatedly that mexico is footing the bill even while insisting on 5 6 billion from the u s treasury to go toward wall construction his demand and the refusal of democrats to satisfy it are behind the budget standoff that has closed parts of the government ___ syria trump we are pulling back in syria we re going to be removing our troops i never said we re doing it that quickly remarks to reporters sunday trump we re bringing the troops back home over a period of time i never said so quickly but over a period of time cabinet meeting wednesday the facts he s wrong about his past statements regarding the pace of withdrawal in a video posted to his twitter account on dec 19 for instance trump said of the roughly 2 000 troops in syria they re all coming back and they re coming back now ___ trump i read when we pull out oh russia is thrilled russia is not happy you know why they re not happy because they like it when we re killing isis because we re killing them for them and we re killing them for assad and we re killing isis also for iran cabinet meeting the facts russia says it s happy a u s withdrawal opens opportunities for moscow and tehran to increase their influence and may help the syrian government survive as a kurdish led opposition force loses its military ally on the ground russian president vladimir putin says the u s has done the right thing in planning to pull out ___ afghanistan trump the reason russia was in afghanistan was because terrorists were going into russia they the soviets were right to be there cabinet meeting the facts his assertion that the soviet union was experiencing a terrorist influx from afghanistan when it invaded in 1979 is out of step with history and his belief that the soviets were right to invade is a stark departure from u s and world opinion the soviets were trying to bolster communists in afghanistan and possibly expand their influence against the united states and the west world condemnation was swift the u n general assembly voted 104 18 to deplore the soviet intervention in afghanistan the u s supported the anti communist rebels giving them shoulder fired rockets to down soviet aircraft the soviets withdrew in 1989 ___ trump russia used to be the soviet union afghanistan made it russia because they went bankrupt fighting in afghanistan cabinet meeting the facts afghanistan was far from the sole reason for the breakup of the soviet union in 1991 the dissolution occurred in a time of ethnic and political troubles economic woes and a series of revolutions that led soviet republics to seek their independence the soviet demise was accelerated by the heavy cost of competing with the west to wield influence around the world including in afghanistan ___ oil prices trump do you think it s just luck that gas prices are so low and falling low gas prices are like another tax cut tweet tuesday trump it s not luck it s not luck i called up certain people and i said let that damn oil and gasoline you let it flow the oil it was going up to 125 if that would ve happened then you would ve had a recession depression cabinet meeting wednesday the facts it s not all about him or even mostly about him while americans may end up paying somewhat less for gasoline this year trump s suggestion that he deserves all the credit and averted a u s economic depression is an exaggeration oil prices which peaked oct 3 have been generally falling on the realization that u s sanctions against iran would not create a shortage and on fear that a global oversupply of oil will spill into 2019 if slower international economic growth depresses energy demand the president s supposed let it flow edict did not stop opec and its russia led allies from agreeing last month to cut oil production that initially failed to stop oil prices from sliding further they have since rebounded a few dollars in the past week continued opec production cuts would push prices higher trump has pointed to his positive relations with saudi arabia which remains the biggest oil exporter as a so called swing producer with the ability to adjust production up or down relatively quickly it can indeed influence the price of crude but the market is complex canada for example is actually the top source of u s oil imports with saudi arabia second ___ tariffs trump the united states treasury has taken in many billions of dollars from the tariffs we are charging china and other countries that have not treated us fairly in the meantime we are doing well in various trade negotiations currently going on tweet thursday the facts trump is off on two major issues first tariffs are taxes paid largely by u s business and consumers not foreign countries and while trump s many billions might sound like a lot it s doing little to nothing to improve the federal balance sheet the u s government spent 4 1 trillion last fiscal year and the budget deficit shot up according to trump s own treasury department customs and duties generated 41 3 billion in revenues last year up from 34 6 billion in 2017 that 6 7 billion increase occurred in part because of the president s tariffs but it amounted to just 0 16 percent of federal spending ___ mattis trump on jim mattis i wish him well i hope he does well but as you know president barack obama fired him and essentially so did i i want results cabinet meeting wednesday the facts actually mattis resigned as defense secretary in protest over trump s decision to pull u s troops from syria the retired marine general announced on dec 20 in a resignation letter that he was stepping down after trump s decision to withdraw 2 000 u s troops from syria mattis said he would stay on the job until the end of february three days later trump said he was replacing mattis with the second ranking defense official pat shanahan on jan 1 as to the tenure under obama mattis served as commander of the military s central command he departed a few months earlier than expected in 2013 in part because of disagreements over iran ___ drug prices trump i think you re going to see a tremendous reduction in drug prices cabinet meeting wednesday the facts prices continue to rise administration policies announced last year and currently being completed don t seem to have shifted that trend figures on u s prescription drug price changes compiled by health data company elsevier show that from dec 20 through jan 2 there were 1 179 product price changes of those 30 were price cuts and the remaining 1 149 were price increases with 328 of them between 9 percent and 10 percent all but one of the rest were by lower percentages elsevier spokesman chris capot said more companies will be announcing price increases this month separately a data firm whose software can help patients find the most cost effective medications says its information shows price increases on many commonly used drugs for conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes in the first two days of january prices have increased on more than 250 different products said michael rea ceo of rx savings solutions the average increase is about 6 percent he added ___ immigration trump on the number of immigrants living in the u s illegally i used to hear 11 million all the time it would always stay right at 11 i said does it ever increase or go down no it s 11 nobody knows it s probably 30 35 million people they would flow in mostly from the southern border they d come in and nobody would talk about it nobody would do anything about it cabinet meeting wednesday the facts it s nowhere close to 30 million to 35 million according to his own homeland security secretary as well as independent estimates the nonpartisan pew research center estimates there were 10 7 million immigrants in the u s illegally in 2016 the most recent data available advocacy groups on both sides of the immigration issue have similar estimates at a house hearing last month homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen acknowledged the number was somewhere between 11 million and 22 million significantly lower than trump s claim of 35 million according to pew the number of immigrants in the u s illegally had reached a height of 12 2 million in 2007 representing about 4 percent of the u s population before declining in part because of a weakening u s economy ___ trump the coyotes are using children to gain access into this country they re using these children they re not with families they re using the children they re taking the children and then they dispose of the children after they re done this has been going on for years this isn t unique to us but we want to stop it cabinet meeting wednesday the facts this does happen though it s not as common as trump suggests by talking about it so often he is referring to adults who come with children they falsely claim to be theirs so that they won t be detained under a no child separation policy but such cases of fraud are rare according to the homeland security department about 500 immigrants were found to be not a legitimate family unit and thus separated upon detention from april 19 to sept 30 of last year that s a small fraction of the 107 000 families apprehended in the last budget year which ended sept 30 ___ associated press writers eric tucker chad day josh boak michael balsamo colleen long jill colvin ricardo

if mmt is kosher then anybody especially an indy scotland can eliminate austerity at the stroke of the finance secretary s pen mmt is supported by former us presidential candidate bernie sanders and english academic richard murphy author of the joy of tax indeed murphy and macintyre kemp have gone head to head following gordon s article in the national why does this debate matter first because it gets to the heart of any post indy economic policy secondly because it puts andrew wilson s growth commission report in the firing line the growth commission wants an independent scotland to keep the pound sterling for an indefinite period for mmt believers this would eliminate the possibility of the scottish government being able to fund a deficit sufficient to increase growth instead we would be stuck with austerity for a decade or longer let me begin by defending gordon macintyre kemp s right to criticise mmt but i think he opposes a simplistic straw man version of mmt that is not actually proposed by richard murphy nevertheless gordon s intervention has opened an important public debate as ben wray editor of commonspace commented a whole new economics of independence is needed to adequately replace the growth commission and that economics could be genuinely pathbreaking internationally i can t do justice in a short article to the technical richness of mmt ideas take the following precis as a crude introduction although it has earlier roots mmt is an outgrowth of the work of the english heterodox economist john maynard keynes during the 1930s conservative keynes wanted to save capitalism from collapse or revolution so he opposed the austerity of his day in favour of the government borrowing and spending to create full employment after the second world war keynesian ideas became the status quo however orthodox bourgeois economists continued to fret that keynesian public spending would lead to hyperinflation which seemed to happen in the 1970s enter thatcher with a mission to banish keynesianism and run the economy like a she did her household accounts public debt was branded as enemy number one later new labour and tory governments repeated this mantra meanwhile somebody emerged to provide a theoretical defence for keynesian public borrowing a maverick british economist named abba lerner lerner s work became the basis for modern monetary theory from a working class jewish background lerner was ostracised by the british economics establishment he left for america where he transmuted into a libertarian free marketer and buddy of right wing republican barry goldwater lerner s functional finance theory the basis of mmt says that a government s primary aim is to ensure permanent full employment it should do this by borrowing and spending to create sufficient demand to keep factories at full capacity so no recessions and no austerity but a government must tax away any excess demand over capacity limits to halt inflation in this benign scenario the government does not need to worry about how much it borrows only that it taxes excess demand here is where gordon macintyre kemp gets worried he doesn t believe politicians will take away the punch bowl when the economic party is in full swing mmt supporters such as richard murphy say gordon hasn t read the small print they want to create a system that compels politicians to obey the inflation stop light one way is for an independent central bank to raise interest rates sharply cutting off the government s credit line indeed in mmt the central bank is not responsible for price stability that s the job of the government instead monetary authorities set interest rates near zero to facilitate cheap government borrowing until we reach full employment gordon s objection matters little provided you design the system properly a more important question is can a government max out its credit card to ensure full employment won t it run up huge unsustainable debts no according to abba lerner and mmt theorists the intellectual trick is to grasp that government debt is everyone else s primary financial asset in fact issuing public debt encourages saving and investment in the first place pension and savings funds will always buy government bonds and earn income on them because they are the safest thing to invest in government bonds are safe precisely because the state has monopoly of tax powers and so can always find the wherewithal to pay its debts besides if the economy is running at full capacity thanks to mmt investor confidence will be high ensuring both a ready market for public debt and private debt there s an even more cool aspect to mmt this is where andrew wilson s growth report gets it exponentially wrong if a government has a monopoly over issuing its own currency it can always in extremis create funds to buy its own bonds witness the bank of england s quantitative easing qe programme which created 375 billion out of thin air to buy public bonds boost share purchases and subsidise mortgage lending what objections do i have to mmt they are many as it happens true on a formal basis mmt does work if a government takes political control of the credit mechanism it can boost demand growth and employment without austerity unless it is beholden to foreign lenders which would only be the case if indy scotland used sterling but there s nothing really new in mmt utopian socialists have been offering it as a panacea since proudhon the 19th century french anarchist which begs the obvious question why isn t mmt in use everywhere first mmt ignores the all important fact that in capitalist economies the means of production factories technology are privately owned by a narrow elite whose only rationale is profit competition between these capitalists results in relentless bouts of over production and economic crisis witness apple s current glut of iphones certainly governments can try to mop up over production by borrowing and spending using mmt but this is an economic bandage it does not eliminate the basic instability we can only do the latter via direct public ownership of the means of production plus central planning but surely the capitalist class would benefit from mmt influenced governments maintaining high demand thus guaranteeing super profits no with permanent full employment workers who create all the output feel secure enough to demand higher wages this happened in the keynesian 1970s result a profit squeeze and thatcher ultimately mmt is politically utopian because it ignores class conflict when class conflict intensifies fat cat investment bankers who rake in interest on government debt invariably demand austerity policies to protect their money from the workers and from whatever left wing government is in power conclusion modern monetary theory is a useful tool for an independent scotland to avoid austerity but it is only a temporary bridge to public ownership of the banks and means of production you won t find that in the growth commission
on its 20th birthday the best that can be said of the euro the european currency used by 19 countries is that it has survived two decades after being introduced in 1999 it has not achieved its central goals increasing economic growth and strengthening public support for european political institutions in many ways just the opposite has occurred the economy of the euro zone all of the countries that adopted the euro britain and some others declined to join still lags behind the united states in growth for 2019 growth is forecast at only 1 6 percent compared with 2 6 percent for the united states even worse the contentious negotiations over rescuing the euro zone s weaker members greece spain portugal and italy have left a bitter aftertaste debtor countries feel they were treated badly by the wealthier creditor countries particularly germany meanwhile the creditors resent having to bail out their poorer neighbors animosities remain advertisement all this looms over europe s present political crisis its rising populism its anger over immigration and the conflict over britain s exit from the european union another euro crisis a clear possibility would make things worse italy seems especially vulnerable with little economic growth and government debt at about 130 percent of its gross domestic product notes rebecca patterson in a report for bessemer trust a financial services firm to its advocates the euro s appeal was simple eliminating separate currencies for the e u s member countries would reduce the nuisance of money conversions promote stable exchange rates and stimulate trade faster economic growth would make the case for more centralized control a more powerful e u at first things went well interest rates dropped sharply especially for weaker borrowers in january 1999 rates on italian 10 year government bonds were virtually the same as rates on similar german bonds though the german economy and its repayment prospects were much better than italy s advertisement by contrast italian interest rates had been much higher before the euro the gap or spread between german and italian rates was 5 percentage points in early 1995 other debtor countries got similar relief from higher interest rates the apparent justification for the lower rates was this investors believed that the discipline of a single currency would force many poorer e u countries to improve their economies and less optimistically if they got in trouble they would be bailed out by others so the risk of lending had declined more could be lent the result should have surprised no one there was a credit boom says economist adam posen of the peterson institute for international economics german french dutch and belgian banks lent to greek spanish italian and portuguese borrowers money flooded into greek bonds and spanish real estate advertisement everyone was happy greece spain and other debtors enjoyed the pleasures of easy money germany and other creditor nations benefited from strong exports that in turn were ultimately financed by loans from these countries banks share this article share the trouble was that the creditors overlent and the debtors overborrowed the united states 2007 2009 great recession was fatal its side effects including a steep fall in global trade hurt many european borrowers and lenders some lenders were unwilling or unable to renew their loans there were sudden stops as posen puts it to stay solvent borrowers had to get government credit from central banks and international agencies such as the international monetary fund or cut spending and raise taxes it was here that the toughest negotiations occurred as lenders and borrowers argued over terms advertisement one possible solution was for debtor countries to abandon the euro and revert to national currencies and to do so at conversion rates that favored borrowers this didn t happen though there was much speculation that it might almost everyone agreed that ditching the euro would have involved hugely difficult legal political operational and moral issues still it was a possibility if a few countries had jettisoned the euro what would have happened nothing many countries doing likewise a deep global recession none of this occurred in part because no one could confidently answer these questions another reason is that the euro remains popular at home by one survey 74 percent of euro users support it people favor the euro though not the measures needed to make it workable in the end the european central bank bought 2 6 trillion euros worth of bonds nearly 3 trillion at current exchange rates to prop up the currency after mario draghi president of the ecb pledged in mid 2012 to do whatever it takes to save the euro advertisement the story continues eventually we re going to have another u s recession says patterson who wrote the bessemer trust report then we ll see whether europe s governments banks and businesses can withstand the pressures created by high debt and low economic growth and whether the euro can still survive read more from robert samuelson s archive
washington feeling the pressure of investigations and a partial government shutdown president donald trump is playing loose with the facts regarding hush payments made by his former attorney michael

1 9 million the commission also found the campaign was late refunding some contributions that exceeded legal limits and discovered some other reporting errors regarding contribution dates the commission fined the obama campaign 375 000 for the violations the campaign was not found to have wilfully violated the law making it a civil infraction in cohen s case he admitted he knew he was breaking the law by making the payments cohen told abc last month that of course trump knew it was wrong to make the hush money payments though he did not provide any specific evidence in the

come in and nobody would talk about it nobody would do anything about it cabinet meeting wednesday the facts it s nowhere close to 30 million to 35 million according to his own homeland security secretary as well as independent estimates the nonpartisan pew research center estimates there were 10 7 million immigrants in the u s illegally in 2016 the most recent data available advocacy groups on both sides of the immigration issue have similar estimates at a house hearing last month homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen acknowledged the number was somewhere between 11 million and 22 million significantly lower than trump s claim of 35 million according to pew the number of immigrants in the u s illegally had reached a height of 12 2 million in 2007 representing about 4 per cent

claim to be theirs so that they won t be detained under a no child separation policy but such cases of fraud are rare according to the homeland security department about 500 immigrants were found to

president donald trump is playing loose with the facts regarding hush payments made by his former attorney to two women and is changing his story on his promise to build a border wall paid for by mexico washington ap feeling the pressure of investigations and a partial government shutdown president donald trump is playing loose with the facts regarding hush payments made by his former attorney michael cohen to two women and is changing his story on his promise to build a concrete border wall paid for by mexico in comments over the weekend trump said he did not commit any campaign violation and suggests anything improper would be minor compared with infractions of democrats such as former president barack obama the reality is not so cut and dried federal prosecutors in new york have implicated trump in a crime linking him to the hush money scheme the obama campaign s infractions were civil not criminal on the border wall trump insists he never promised a concrete barrier even though he did and asserts that much of it has been built it hasn t the dubious statements capped an expansive week of assertions by the president on top of the usual twitter flow trump opened a cabinet meeting with 90 minutes of opining to the press touching on immigration drug prices the soviet history in afghanistan his approval ratings syria oil prices the attractiveness of his generals better looking than tom cruise and much more a few days later he spoke for an hour at a rose garden news conference a sampling of his claims trump investigations trump many people currently a part of my opposition including president obama the dems have had campaign violations in some cases for very large sums of money these are civil cases they paid a fine settled while no big deal i did not commit a campaign violation tweet saturday the facts trump has been tied to but not charged with a crime at issue is not a routine campaign violation prosecutors court filings last month said trump directed cohen to make payments to buy the silence of porn actress stormy daniels and former playboy model karen mcdougal during the 2016 presidential campaign both women alleged they had extramarital affairs with trump which the white house denies cohen who pleaded guilty in august to campaign finance crimes in connection with those payments had previously implicated trump now the justice department is backing up cohen s claims in particular the justice department says the hush money payments were unreported campaign contributions meant to influence the outcome of the election that assertion makes the payments subject to campaign finance laws which restrict how much people can donate to a campaign and bar corporations from making direct contributions it s unclear whether trump will actually be charged with illegal activity because justice department legal memos from 1973 and 2000 have suggested that a sitting president is immune from indictment house speaker nancy pelosi d

dollar cycle may be about to turn supporting oil prices the u s dollar has recently appreciated to its highest level in real terms since the start of 2017 and before that september 2003 dollar appreciation weighed on oil prices in 2018 as prices in some non dollar currencies hit record levels earlier in the year and dampened consumption growth yet there are signs that the dollar s rise may be coming to an end as trade tensions with china weigh and pressure to raise rates dissipates lifting prospects for oil prices to recover for now dollar strength has helped hold down u s inflation even as unemployment has fallen to its lowest level in decades but it has contributed to a worsening trade deficit and cut the dollar value of overseas earnings of u s based companies the united states is currently running a mix of expansionary fiscal policy tax cuts and increased spending on the military and a less accommodative or contractionary financial policy rising interest rates the consequence is an improvement in the trade off between employment and inflation internal balance but a deterioration in the trade deficit external balance exchange rate movements have suppressed inflation despite the booming economy but at the cost of declining international competitiveness despite tariffs the strong dollar has posed a dilemma for the federal reserve halting interest rates hikes runs the risk of pushing down the real exchange rate and pushing up inflation tmsnrt rs 2awgzge reagan redux the trump administration and the federal reserve are to some extent re running the policy mix of the reagan administration and the central bank under paul volcker in the 1980s the reagan administration s tax cuts and defence build up coupled with higher interest rates caused the dollar to surge and the trade deficit to soar the reagan administration pressed trading partners to cut exports to the united states especially cars steel and electronics and boost their currencies eventually the white house pushed the fed to adopt a more accommodative policy triggering the departure of the chairman it is worth noting the current u s trade representative robert lighthizer was the deputy trade representative in the reagan administration when it forced japan to accept voluntary export restraints to curb its exports to the united states the administration went on to press the other major economies to appreciate their currencies and depreciate the dollar as part of the plaza accord in 1985 the strong dollar of the early 1980s worsened the demand destruction and oversupply of oil in the early 1980s and contributed to the price crisis of 1985 and 1986 subsequent dollar depreciation likely helped steady oil prices in the second half of the 1980s at least it did once saudi arabia s oil minister ahmed zaki yamani was replaced and the kingdom abandoned netback pricing and its volume warfare strategy just as japan was the target for u s policymakers in the 1980s complaining about unfair trading practices china has become the target in the 2010s the experience of the fiscal expansion strong dollar and trade deficits of the 1980s hold important lessons for the next two years and a possible roadmap trump options the trade war between the united states and china has pushed both economies as well as their trading partners towards a slowdown or even a recession in 2019 as economic growth slows both countries are likely to become increasingly eager for a negotiated solution that kickstarts business activity and raises equity prices the worse the economic news becomes the greater the pressure on both countries particularly the united states which holds a presidential election in 2020 to reach a deal lighthizer s involvement suggests any eventual deal with china and deals with the european union and other trading partners will likely employ some combination of managed trade to reduce the deficit voluntary export restraints purchases of big ticket items such as aircraft and farm products together with selective tariffs and quotas are likely to form part of the eventual deal u s negotiators will also push for structural reforms on intellectual property subsidies and state owned enterprises probably even harder than they did with japan in the 1980s the trump white house has already made its displeasure with the fed over recent interest rate increases very clear signs of a domestic slowdown will give the central bank an opportunity to re examine the case for further rises or even contemplate a cut if policymakers wish to do so without more pressure from the white house the white house has been vigilant over the strength of the dollar pressing other trading partners not to depreciate their currencies further it is not clear whether the administration will try to repeat the plaza accord or include exchange rate conditions in any trade with china even without a formal exchange rate agreement an end to u s interest rate increases could halt the currency s upward move and interest rate cuts would probably send it lower again as they did between 2009 and 2011 in the short term lower oil prices have been an important part of global rebalancing and will support economic activity in consuming countries and ultimately buy back some demand growth in 2019 but a scenario with lower u s interest rates dollar depreciation easing trade tensions and an improving global economic outlook could ultimately help push oil prices higher everything hinges on whether policymakers in the united states and china can find a way to avoid further escalation of their economic war and avert a prolonged global recession source reuters editing by edmund blair

part of my opposition including president obama the dems have had campaign violations in some cases for very large sums of money these are civil cases they paid a fine settled while no big deal i did not commit a campaign violation tweet saturday the facts trump has been tied to but not charged with a crime at issue is not a routine campaign violation prosecutors court filings last month said trump directed cohen to make payments to buy the silence of porn actress stormy daniels and former playboy model karen mcdougal during the 2016 presidential campaign both women alleged they had extramarital affairs with trump which the white house denies advertisement cohen who pleaded guilty in august to campaign finance crimes in connection with those payments had previously implicated trump now the justice department is backing up cohen s claims in particular the justice department says the hush money payments were unreported campaign contributions meant to influence the outcome of the election that assertion makes the payments subject to campaign finance laws which restrict how much people can donate to a campaign and bar corporations from making direct contributions it s unclear whether trump will actually be charged with illegal activity because justice department legal memos from 1973 and 2000 have suggested that a sitting president is immune from indictment house speaker nancy pelosi democrat california told nbc this past week that trump isn t necessarily immune calling an indictment of a sitting president an open discussion in terms of the law there s a big difference between obama s campaign violation and cohen s case a federal election commission audit found that the 2008 obama campaign failed to file 48 hour contribution reports in a timely manner for more than 1 200 donations totaling 1 9 million the commission also found the campaign was late refunding some contributions that exceeded legal limits and discovered some other reporting errors regarding contribution dates the commission fined the obama campaign 375 000 for the violations the campaign was not found to have willfully violated the law making it a civil infraction in cohen s case he admitted he knew he was breaking the law by making the payments cohen told abc last month that of course trump knew it was wrong to make the hush money payments though he did not provide any specific evidence in the interview unlike the obama case where the issue was timely reporting the hush money payments were never disclosed at all on trump s campaign filings andrew herman a lawyer specializing in campaign finance at law firm miller chevalier said the two cases are completely different species one is a paperwork error he said and the other is a conscious attempt to obscure payments made to affect an election the wall trump as far as concrete i said i was going to build a wall i never said i m going to build a concrete i said i m going to build a wall rose garden news conference friday the facts actually he did say he would build a concrete wall trump even repeated that promise last week rejecting the claim of his departing white house chief of staff john kelly that trump had abandoned the notion of a solid concrete wall early on in the administration an all concrete wall was never abandoned trump tweeted on dec 31 some areas will be all concrete but the experts at border patrol prefer a wall that is see through during the 2016 campaign trump pledged to build a big beautiful wall made of concrete rebar and steel across the length of the southern border with mexico back then he lashed out at the suggestion that what he was proposing had anything in common with mere fencing jeb bush just talked about my border proposal to build a fence he tweeted in 2015 it s not a fence jeb it s a wall and there s a big difference he now often refers to the wall as steel slats steel is stronger than concrete he said friday if i build a steel wall rather than a concrete wall it will actually be stronger than a concrete wall trump when they say build the wall i don t say that any more i say finish the wall remarks to reporters sunday trump we ve already built a lot of the wall rose garden news conference friday the facts he hasn t built much of the wall at all trump s claim is only supported when counting work done under past presidents and ignoring the fact that fences from prior administrations are not the towering walls he promised the 2006 secure fence act has resulted in about 650 miles 1 050 kilometers of border barrier money approved by congress in march 2018 is to pay for 84 miles 135 km but that work is not done trump has achieved some renovation of existing barrier trump the drugs are pouring into this country they don t go through the ports of entry when they do they sometimes get caught rose garden news conference the facts he s wrong in saying drug smugglers don t or only rarely use official border crossings for their trafficking land ports of entry are their primary means for getting drugs into the country not stretches of the border without barriers says the u s drug enforcement administration the agency said in a november report that the most common trafficking technique by transnational criminal organizations is to hide drugs in passenger vehicles or tractor trailers as they drive into the u s though entry ports where they are stopped and subject to inspection they also employ buses cargo trains and tunnels the report says citing smuggling methods that would not be choked off by a border wall trump the new trade deal we have with mexico and canada what we save on that just with mexico will pay for the wall many times over just in a period of a year two years or three years so i view that as absolutely mexico is paying for the wall rose garden news conference the facts mexico is not paying for the wall and nothing in the trade agreement would cover or refund the construction cost trump is assuming a wide variety of economic benefits will come from the agreement but they can t be quantified or counted on for example he said the deal will dissuade some u s companies from moving operations to mexico and he credits that possibility as a payment by mexico for his wall the deal updates the north american free trade agreement in the main preserving nafta s liberalized environment of low or no tariffs among the u s mexico and canada while making certain improvements for each country trump stated inaccurately that it s brand new it s totally different moreover it s not in effect the deal has yet to be ratified in any member country and its chances of winning legislative approval are not assured trump has argued repeatedly that mexico is footing the bill even while insisting on 5 6 billion from the u s treasury to go toward wall construction his demand and the refusal of democrats to satisfy it are behind the budget standoff that has closed parts of the government syria trump we are pulling back in syria we re going to be removing our troops i never said we re doing it that quickly remarks to reporters sunday trump we re bringing the troops back home over a period of time i never said so quickly but over a period of time cabinet meeting wednesday the facts he s wrong about his past statements regarding the pace of withdrawal in a video posted to his twitter account on dec 19 for instance trump said of the roughly 2 000 troops in syria they re all coming back and they re coming back now trump i read when we pull out oh russia is thrilled russia is not happy you know why they re not happy because they like it when we re killing isis because we re killing them for them and we re killing them for assad and we re killing isis also for iran cabinet meeting the facts russia says it s happy a u s withdrawal opens opportunities for moscow and tehran to increase their influence and may help the syrian government survive as a kurdish led opposition force loses its military ally on the ground russian president vladimir putin says the u s has done the right thing in planning to pull out afghanistan trump the reason russia was in afghanistan was because terrorists were going into russia they the soviets were right to be there cabinet meeting the facts his assertion that the soviet union was experiencing a terrorist influx from afghanistan when it invaded in 1979 is out of step with history and his belief that the soviets were right to invade is a stark departure from u s and world opinion the soviets were trying to bolster communists in afghanistan and possibly expand their influence against the united states and the west world condemnation was swift the u n general assembly voted 104 18 to deplore the soviet intervention in afghanistan the u s supported the anti communist rebels giving them shoulder fired rockets to down soviet aircraft the soviets withdrew in 1989 trump russia used to be the soviet union afghanistan made it russia because they went bankrupt fighting in afghanistan cabinet meeting the facts afghanistan was far from the sole reason for the breakup of the soviet union in 1991 the dissolution occurred in a time of ethnic and political troubles economic woes and a series of revolutions that led soviet republics to seek their independence the soviet demise was accelerated by the heavy cost of competing with the west to wield influence around the world including in afghanistan oil prices trump do you think it s just luck that gas prices are so low and falling low gas prices are like another tax cut tweet tuesday trump it s not luck it s not luck i called up certain people and i said let that damn oil and gasoline you let it flow the oil it was going up to 125 if that would ve happened then you would ve had a recession depression cabinet meeting wednesday the facts it s not all about him or even mostly about him while americans may end up paying somewhat less for gasoline this year trump s suggestion that he deserves all the credit and averted a u s economic depression is an exaggeration oil prices which peaked oct 3 have been generally falling on the realization that u s sanctions against iran would not create a shortage and on fear that a global oversupply of oil will spill into 2019 if slower international economic growth depresses energy demand the president s supposed let it flow edict did not stop opec and its russia led allies from agreeing last month to cut oil production that initially failed to stop oil prices from sliding further they have since rebounded a few dollars in the past week continued opec production cuts would push prices higher trump has pointed to his positive relations with saudi arabia which remains the biggest oil exporter as a so called swing producer with the ability to adjust production up or down relatively quickly it can indeed influence the price of crude but the market is complex canada for example is actually the top source of u s oil imports with saudi arabia second tariffs trump the united states treasury has taken in many billions of dollars from the tariffs we are charging china and other countries that have not treated us fairly in the meantime we are doing well in various trade negotiations currently going on tweet thursday the facts trump is off on two major issues first tariffs are taxes paid largely by u s business and consumers not foreign countries and while trump s many billions might sound like a lot it s doing little to nothing to improve the federal balance sheet the u s government spent 4 1 trillion last fiscal year and the budget deficit shot up according to trump s own treasury department customs and duties generated 41 3 billion in revenues last year up from 34 6 billion in 2017 that 6 7 billion increase occurred in part because of the president s tariffs but it amounted to just 0 16 percent of federal spending mattis trump on jim mattis i wish him well i hope he does well but as you know president barack obama fired him and essentially so did i i want results cabinet meeting wednesday the facts actually mattis resigned as defense secretary in protest over trump s decision to pull u s troops from syria the retired marine general announced on dec 20 in a resignation letter that he was stepping down after trump s decision to withdraw 2 000 u s troops from syria mattis said he would stay on the job until the end of february three days later trump said he was replacing mattis with the second ranking defense official pat shanahan on jan 1 as to the tenure under obama mattis served as commander of the military s central command he departed a few months earlier than expected in 2013 in part because of disagreements over iran drug prices trump i think you re going to see a tremendous reduction in drug prices cabinet meeting wednesday the facts prices continue to rise administration policies announced last year and currently being completed don t seem to have shifted that trend figures on u s prescription drug price changes compiled by health data company elsevier show that from dec 20 through jan 2 there were 1 179 product price changes of those 30 were price cuts and the remaining 1 149 were price increases with 328 of them between 9 percent and 10 percent all but one of the rest were by lower percentages elsevier spokesman chris capot said more companies will be announcing price increases this month separately a data firm whose software can help patients find the most cost effective medications says its information shows price increases on many commonly used drugs for conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes in the first two days of january prices have increased on more than 250 different products said michael rea ceo of rx savings solutions the average increase is about 6 percent he added immigration trump on the number of immigrants living in the u s illegally i used to hear 11 million all the time it would always stay right at 11 i said does it ever increase or go down no it s 11 nobody knows it s probably 30 35 million people they would flow in mostly from the southern border they d come in and nobody would talk about it nobody would do anything about it cabinet meeting wednesday the facts it s nowhere close to 30 million to 35 million according to his own homeland security secretary as well as independent estimates the nonpartisan pew research center estimates there were 10 7 million immigrants in the u s illegally in 2016 the most recent data available advocacy groups on both sides of the immigration issue have similar estimates at a house hearing last month homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen acknowledged the number was somewhere between 11 million and 22 million significantly lower than trump s claim of 35 million according to pew the number of immigrants in the u s illegally had reached a height of 12 2 million in 2007 representing about 4 percent of the u s population before declining in part because of a weakening u s economy trump the coyotes are using children to gain access into this country they re using these children they re not with families they re using the children they re taking the children and then they dispose of the children after they re done this has been going on for years this isn t unique to us but we want to stop it cabinet meeting wednesday the facts this does happen though it s not as common as trump suggests by talking about it so often he is referring to adults who come with children they falsely claim to be theirs so that they won t be detained under a no child separation policy your subscription could not be saved please try again your subscription has been successful subscribe to our daily newsletter sign me up but such cases of fraud are rare according to the homeland security department about 500 immigrants were found to be not a legitimate family unit and thus separated upon detention from april 19 to

source xinhua 2019 01 08 05 25 26 editor mu xuequan video player close by nathan morley nicosia jan 7 xinhua the centre of frankfurt erupted with fireworks and cheers at the stroke of midnight back on jan 4 1999 as a common european currency was launched now almost a generation later celebrations marking the 20th anniversary of the euro have been largely muted for many young europeans the currencies it replaced like the franc deutschmark guilder and lira are learned about in history classes when introduced the euro was first adopted by just 11 member states and widely considered a political as well as an economic decision european commission president jean claude juncker one of the only signatories of the maastricht treaty still politically active today remembered the hard fought and momentous negotiations on the launch of the economic and monetary union constant turmoil but the fights and battles had only just begun its fiercest critics charged abandoning age old national currencies was a monumental mistake opponents said slapping a common currency on diverse economies with a single interest rate and different levels of productivity disabled national governments from properly managing their own economies but brushing aside reservations new eu member countries adopted the euro including slovenia cyprus malta slovakia estonia latvia and lithuania its growth though in many ways was hamstrung by opposition especially from sweden denmark and britain which all rejected it in favor of their own currencies reservations were fuelled to a certain degree by financial crises in italy cyprus ireland and portugal where the explosive combination of high borrowing costs and moribund growth leading to strict austerity budgets but it was in greece where the fragility of the currency was really demonstrated in 2010 the eu and the international monetary fund were forced to bail out the debt ridden country ironically greece was initially excluded from joining the euro in 1999 because of its weak economy soon after the crisis in greece the euro plunged below 1 20 u s dollars then as if things couldn t get any worse spain s long term interest rate rocketed above 7 6 percent in 2012 causing panic about the possibility of a euro collapse in that short amount of time spectators viewed a continent and currency in perpetual disarray many financial experts remained equally reserved about the success of the currency given that for the best part of the last two decades eurozone gdp growth per capita continued to lag behind britain and the united states troubles didn t end with spain and greece in the summer of 2014 the currency surged to near 1 40 dollars immediately hitting valued export markets but maintaining its unpredictability it then plunged to 1 05 dollars a drop linked to the purchase of assets by the european central bank to prop up the economy the following year athens sucked dry by austerity was granted an unprecedented third bailout a move designed to keep it in the single currency despite some calls in greece for a return to the drachma mixed feelings the financial woes were epitomized by views about the currency which swang from blind allegiance to blind hatred then of course with growing economic disparities within the bloc came the prospect of increasing hostility between member states but despite almost constant challenges the euro has been more resilient than anyone including its proponents could have dreamed still as 2019 opens there are real and legitimate debates about its success and future for juncker the financial foundation of the euro is stable he maintains the currency has matured into a symbol of unity sovereignty and stability whilst it is true that the euro is now a solid reserve currency kept by central banks and the international monetary fund reasons for concern remain arising in no small measure from the looming exit of the united kingdom from the eu then a shaky relationship between italy and the european union has caused jitters and threatening eurozone stability italy which is the third largest economy in the eurozone has a rocketing deficit and has been embroiled in a drawn out battle with brussels over its latest budget there are other areas where the euro has been frustrated the recent u s sanctions slapped on iran highlighted how crude oil prices remain pegged to the dollar meaning any attempt to circumvent the dollar as payment would be fraught with complications the european union which opposed the sanctions on iran has been exasperated with dollar s dominance in the oil trade in fact last september juncker bemoaned the absurdity of europe paying 80 percent of its energy import bill in dollars when only roughly 2 percent of the eu s energy imports come from the united states he also lamented that it was absurd that european companies buy european planes in dollars instead of euro but there is some succour for eu leaders as a recent euro barometer survey suggests that 64 percent europeans believe the introduction of the euro was a good idea surprisingly that figure is up from 51 percent in 2002 nowadays the euro is used by 340 million europeans in 20 eu member states making it the second most used currency in the world but for a currency which is now in adulthood its teething troubles are certain to continue

source imgflip apple nasdaq aapl has long been a darling of wall street owing to its status as a faang stock and in 2018 it became the first publicly traded us company to ever achieve a 1 trillion market cap but when it joined the 13 digits club some investors warned of the market cap curse meaning that in the past when companies achieved record high valuations that tended to signal a top followed by an inevitable slide much lower aapl data by ycharts at least in the short term those bears appear to have been proven right with apple closing down almost 40 from its all time highs on thursday january 3rd the day after management dropped a bombshell one that rocked not just apple but sent numerous tech companies and the entire market crashing lower that day by thursday s close apple s market cap had plummetted 425 billion from its peak that s more than the entire market cap of fellow faang stock facebook s fb as a result apple went from the most valuable us company to the fourth given that i ve long been a fan of apple and recently added it to my new deep value dividend growth portfolio which thus far has beaten the market by 10 6 since inception many readers have been asking me whether now is a good time to be greedy when others are fearful or whether apple s investment thesis just broke making it an ibm ibm style value trap to avoid so let s take a look at four things investors need to know not just about apple s recent bombshell guidance cut but more importantly how that warning affects the company s long term investment thesis most importantly find out why apple s heightened risk profile is likely more than offset by its attractive valuations 15 to 26 undervalued which is why it s still likely to deliver long term total returns of about 16 to 17 over the coming years that s ultimately why i used the latest apple meltdown to double dvdgp s position in the company at about 142 1 why apple s bombshell rocked the market today apple investors are facing the perfect storm of negative factors have combined into a hurricane of negative sentiment that has sent apple s shares plunging that includes the worst market correction since 2009 a 19 8 fall in the s p 500 at its recent lows as well as a general tech meltdown due to fears of slowing global growth apple s bear market began after its latest earnings showed very strong growth in fiscal q4 revenue growth 20 eps growth 41 fcf share growth 51 but the forward looking market instead chose to focus on two things the first was the announcement that apple would no longer be reporting individual unit sales on hardware including the iphone which accounted for 59 of last quarter s sales â the number of units sold in any 90 day period is not necessarily representative of the underlying strength of our businessâ if you look at our revenue during the last three years if you look at our net income during the last three years if you look at our stock price in the last three years there is no correlation to the units sold in any given period â luca maestri cfo while cfo luca maestri s explanation for the change in reporting policy makes sense the market chose to take a more cynical view specifically that apple was anticipating that iphone demand had peaked and would either remain flat over time or possibly even begin declining iphone unit volumes by quarter source statista that s certainly possible because due to improving technology and lengthening upgrade cycles global smartphone sales have slowed to a snail s pace analyst firm idc estimates that from 2017 to 2022 global smartphone volumes will grow 2 8 annually from 1 5 billion to 1 7 billion not helping the typical rumors of peak iphone was a slew of apple supplier guidance cuts in recent weeks have fueled rampant speculation that apple iphone sales were weaker than expected and the company was significantly cutting supply orders that s partially why analyst medium term revenue growth forecasts for apple were recently just 4 that s a far cry from the company s 16 sales growth in 2017 an estimated 16 growth in 2018 and 9 5 year cagr but those much weaker revenue growth forecasts came before the company made its first inter quarter guidance warning in 15 years now analysts expect just 1 6 cagr revenue growth for apple between 2019 and 2021 which has launched a further wave of analyst downgrades what induced this massive cut in apple s forward outlook in january 2nd s letter to investors ceo tim cook slashed the company s fiscal q1 2019 the holiday quarter sales guidance by 8 from an already low 3 growth rate to 5 while we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration particularly in greater china in fact over 100 percent of our year over year worldwide revenue decline occurred in greater china across iphone mac and ipad the government reported gdp growth during the september quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years we believe the economic environment in china has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the united states the effects appeared to reach consumers as well with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in china declining as the quarter progressed and market data has shown that the contraction in greater chinaâ s smartphone market has been particularly sharp tim cook emphasis added as cook pointed out china which represents about 20 of company sales is the principle reason for apple s yoy revenues shrinking in q1 that s likely due to three main factors the first is that china s economy already slowing due to both demographics shrinking labor force since 2014 and the government s attempts to pull back on debt fueled growth now reversed has seen its growth rate slow to the second worst level since 1993 source bloomberg its important manufacturing sector has also started contracting a pmi of 50 is neutral and any number below 50 indicates a manufacturing recession in november china s manufacturing pmi dipped below 50 and has continued falling in december the second big blow to apple from china is in supply chain disruption q1 is when apple typically launches most of its new products for the next year and thanks to the us china trade war semiconductors in particular are being hit with tariffs that are only adding to the usual supply constraints the company typically faces finally there s the one two blow of falling chinese consumer spending and the arrest of huawei s cfo chinese yoy retail sales growth in december chinese retail spending growth fell to a 15 year low likely a combination of declining overall economic growth less hiring slower wage growth and rising uncertainties surrounding the trade war while the us and china are negotiating an end to that given that nafta 2 0 negotiations took 15 months between three close allies the market may be worried that negotiations may either break down entirely or drag on well into 2020 that lower spending is apparently deeply impacting smartphone sales overall but especially at the premium end of the market with apple recently choosing to focus on raising iphone prices to as high as 1 449 for its flagship model it s not surprising that it s facing a sharp drop off in sales what s more as my fellow contributor paul santos recently pointed out the us induced canadian arresting of huawei s cfo and daughter of its founder may have induced nationalistic backlash against apple following a diplomatic incident in 2012 with japan japanese car makers who usually do well in china saw their sales crash toyota tm 49 next quarter s yoy sales decline honda hmc 40 decline nissan otcpk nsany 35 decline this is because the chinese people are intensely proud and often willing to change short term purchasing habits to make a political point many investors are worried that with huawei s latest flagships which offer state of the art features at lower price points this temporary trade fight might potentially result in a permanent loss of market share for apple in china but china is hardly the only growth concern for apple in the q4 conference call tim cook mentioned that apple was seeing weakening sales from key emerging markets â the emerging markets that we are seeing pressure in our markets like turkey india brazil russia these are markets where currencies have weakened over the recent period in some cases that resulted in us raising prices and those markets are not growing the way we would like to see â tim cook the combination of a rising dollar the us is the only major economy with a positive inflation adjusted central bank interest rate and slowing economic growth has caused emerging market sales to disappoint with apple s developed country market share now saturated countries like india brazil and turkey were seen as the key to maintaining strong long term sales growth source bloomberg but with the world s economic growth rate now steadily falling these key markets are proving to be a disappointment at least in the short term the market is likely worried that this slowing growth may continue long enough to trigger a global recession so with apple now confirming the fears of so many bears does that mean that apple s investment thesis is broken is this former darling of wall street poised to fall into an ibm like decline where revenues fall for years on end and the share price languishes in the toilet actually i don t think so and here s why 2 why the 10 one day decline may have been overblown and a great buying opportunity first it s important to remember that while sales are important ultimately the bottom line is what matters most that s not just because stock prices are a function of earnings and cash flow but because dividends are paid out of free cash flow i view apple primarily as a dividend growth investment while analysts have slashed medium term sales forecasts for apple they are still expecting 7 3 eps growth from 2019 to 2021 what s more tim cook said in his letter that thanks to share buybacks we also expect to report a new all time record for appleâ s earnings per share so where it matters most apple is likely to continue delivering growth thanks in large part to the largest net cash position cash minus debt in corporate america in fact management now forecasts that apple s net cash position which it eventually wants to take to zero will hit 130 billion in q1 that s up from 123 billion last quarter and enough to repurchase 18 4 of shares at its current price 148 aapl shares outstanding data by ycharts to put that figure in context since it began its epic buyback program the company has repurchased 239 billion and reduced its share count by 28 and thanks to generating 61 billion in annual free cash flow apple s buybacks are likely to continue at a rapid clip even after its net cash position hits zero but ibm too has spent a fortune on buybacks over the years over 40 billion in fact and that hasn t made that former tech darling a great investment now it s certainly true that financial engineering is no substitute for positive company fundamentals fortunately apple s fundamentals are far from broken for instance while it s true that certain emerging markets like china are currently falling off a cliff others are still doing well and while we saw challenges in some emerging markets others set records including mexico poland malaysia and vietnam tim cook what about the common fear investors have that apple is steadily losing market share to chinese rivals like huawei and xiaomi xi well the data actually shows that apple s aspirational brand strategy premium luxury pricing hasn t been hurting it in that key growth market chinese smartphone market share source counterpoint research yes apple s market share in q4 2018 is going to fall but note that over the past year it has remained stable and apple despite having the most expensive phones in the country has remained china s 5th biggest phone seller by volume and 1 in profits but the biggest reason i don t consider apple s investment thesis broken just mildly impaired is that apple has a rich history of pivoting to new growth opportunities over time it started out as a computer maker then pivoted to ipods then iphones then added ipads now the company is focused on non iphone sales growth and that strategy continues to go well wearables grew by almost 50 percent year over year as apple watch and airpods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers launches of macbook air and mac mini powered the mac to year over year revenue growth and the launch of the new ipad pro drove ipad to year over year double digit revenue growth tim cook emphasis added in total non iphone sales for q1 grew 19 yoy which indicates that apple is unlikely to be facing a nokia ibm style value trap secular decline more importantly we can t forget that apple s biggest growth catalyst isn t hardware at all but monetizing its massive installed base now up to 1 4 billion ios devices according to cook by growing subscription service revenue source motley fool thanks to massive success in its shift from hardware to recurring services subscriptions 50 subscriber growth in the past 12 months apple s goal of doubling its service revenues from 25 billion in 2016 to 50 billion by 2020 continues to run slightly ahead of schedule source earnings releases since 2015 apple s service revenue has grown by an average of 19 and that growth rate has been steadily accelerating note that adjusting for a one time accounting artifact in q3 service revenue growth was 27 according to management s new guidance q1 service revenue will come in at 10 8 billion representing 28 sales growth how is apple s highest margin business managing to accelerate growth off a steadily larger base in the face of all the challenges we just saw our non iphone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets and the vast majority of services revenue is related to the size of the installed base not current period sales tim cook that would be the fact that service revenue is not driven by short term hardware sales but the company s proven ability to monetize its installed base which continues to rise over time unlike ibm whose execution has been terrible apple s execution of its long term strategic growth plans remains on track if apple is able to maintain its long term average service growth rate then its service revenue more stable and higher margin than hardware will grow to massive levels in the coming years year fiscal year services annual revenue 2018 37 2 billion 2019 44 3 billion 2020 52 7 billion 50 billion target 2025 125 7 billion click to enlarge source earnings releases analyst firm macquarie estimates that apple s service gross margins are 75 compared to about 65 for the iphone and 38 at the company level in q1 the company will begin reporting cost of goods allowing us to confirm the profitability of its most important fastest growing and most stable business segment if service revenues are indeed more profitable than iphones then apple s profitability will improve over time making earnings free cash flow and dividend growth easier thus the key to apple s long term success is not in maintaining strong annual growth in iphone volumes but in growing the overall install base that will rely on the company s industry leading brand loyalty and maintaining not necessarily growing market share fortunately according to 451 research customer satisfaction for iphones is 98 literally the best of any smartphone what s more among business users who are the least price sensitive 80 plan to purchase an iphone and according to analyst firm fluent 80 of iphone owners planned to buy another iphone with 70 of survey respondents saying they wouldnâ t even consider another phone while it s always possible that apple s wide moat and sticky ecosystem can degrade over time thus far there is no indication that the company s loyal customers are abandoning its premium products in fact the strong sales growth of the apple watch airpods and homepods indicates that most consumers are happy to become ever more ensnared in its ecosystem ultimately this means that while i ll be monitoring apple s results very closely in 2019 for now i consider the majority of the evidence to point to weak china sales as a temporary event one that is likely to eventually end when the trade war does a sentiment shared by paulo santos and morningstar s abhinav davuluri basically i consider apple s long term thesis not broken but merely slightly impaired that means that apple remains a great long term dividend growth investment at today s beaten down prices 3 dividend profile earnings cut cuts 1 3 off long term growth forecast the most important part of analyzing any dividend stock is the payout profile which consists of three parts yield dividend safety and long term growth potential combined with valuation this is what tends to drive total returns over time company yield simply safe dividend score fcf payout ratio 10 year

enlarge sources morningstar earnings releases gurufocus fast graphs apple s debt levels are actually immaterial since the company only took on that debt to institute its buyback program pre tax reform when most of its cash was overseas and subject to a 35 repatriation tax post tax reform apple is free to bring that cash home at much cheaper tax rates and thus its 130 billion net cash position is what investors need to focus on apple plans to eventually repay all its debt as it matures and get down to zero leverage of course the big question on everyone s mind is what the guidance cut means for apple s long term growth prospects while 2019 is likely to prove a challenging year thanks to ongoing weakness in china trade negotiations might take six to 12 months or even longer thus far the analyst consensus on the company s long term 10 year eps growth has only fallen by 1 3 and remains firmly in the double digits in 2016 tim cook stated that apple plans to grow its dividend every year and in may 2018 its cfo reiterated that guidance specifically luca maestri specifically said the company knows its dividend is very important to our investors who value income and plans for annual dividend increases going forward apple has now raised its dividend for six straight years at an 11 5 cagr 16 in 2018 for context the average and median dividend growth rate for the s p 500 since 1990 has been 6 0 and 6 4 respectively thus while apple s payout may not be superior to the market s its growth rate certainly is what s more even assuming that apple merely maintains its very low payout ratio and chooses to funnel most of its fcf into buybacks to grow eps likely then apple should be able to continue delivering double digit dividend growth for the foreseeable future since 1956 a relatively accurate total return model has been yield long term earnings cash flow dividend growth this is called the gordon dividend growth model and it s what brookfield asset management bam uses for its own long term return targets they also add a valuation adjustment the reason this model works so well is that total returns are driven both by income yield and capital gains stock prices are ultimately a function of earnings free cash flow from which dividends are paid thus assuming a stable payout ratio and valuation changes that cancel out over time yield long term earnings fcf per share growth is a good estimate of total returns the gdgm currently estimates that apple shares will deliver about 14 long term returns assuming no changes in valuation for context the s p 500 s historical cagr total return is 9 2 and the gdgm is currently estimating the market will deliver about 8 5 long term returns adjusting for valuations the s p 500 is likely to deliver 9 to 9 5 returns though vanguard is less optimistic 5 to 8 expected returns over the next few years in either case apple is likely to be a market beater thanks to its safe but fast growing yield and when we consider apple s current valuation even in the context of its challenging short term risk outlook then the company appears capable of delivering even better 16 to 17 long term returns over the next decade or roughly double that of the market 4 valuation apple shares now more than pricing in its elevated risks aapl total return price data by ycharts thanks to its nearly 40 crash apple is now underperforming the s p 500 over the past year however value investors get excited when they see charts like this because it means that this quality blue chip dividend growth stock is now on sale

to enlarge sources simply safe dividends fast graphs benjamin graham apple s forward p e is now just 12 3 far below its five year average note that that average is itself low because slowing growth concerns are nothing new for apple that valuation currently bakes in just 2 5 long term eps growth even if you think analyst growth forecasts are going to fall off a cliff apple s retained annual fcf fcf minus dividend is capable of driving almost three times that eps growth via buybacks in the coming years from its current valuation and that ignores the 130 billion in net cash which could repurchase close to 20 of apple s shares this means that apple s shares are now pricing in all its risks and then some in fact the market s pessimism is so great on apple that the company has to merely maintain stable revenue zero sales growth for 10 years and buybacks alone will likely result in significant multiple expansion and boost total returns above that predicted by the gdgm for the current multiple to be justified apple s revenues would have to decline by 4 3 annually over the next decade or to put it another way apple is still likely to beat the market s total returns on yield and dividend growth even if it becomes the next ibm and its top line stagnates for the next 10 years and if apple is able to achieve even modest top line growth then it will see significant multiple expansion that will drive great returns how much of a valuation boost are we talking about to answer that we have to estimate how undervalued apple currently is my favorite method for this is called dividend yield theory or dyt this is the exclusive valuation investing strategy of asset manager newsletter publisher investment quality trends who has been using it for 52 years to generate 10 market outperformance with 10 lower volatility source investment quality trends dyt simply compares a stock s yield to its historical yield unless a company s thesis breaks yields tend to be mean reverting

that translates into a 15 discount to fair value or 18 upside from the current price over the next decade assuming that apple will be fairly valued in 2029 that means shares should outpace earnings fcf dividends by 1 7 per year add that to the gdgm s total return estimate and you get a 10 year total return potential of 15 5 this is about 70 better than the s p 500 9 to 9 5 is likely to deliver of course dyt is just one of many valuation methods you can use to confirm whether or not apple is as undervalued as dyt suggests let s take a look at morningstar s three stage discounted cash flow analysis morningstar fair value discount to fair value valuation boost valuation adjusted total return 200 26 3 1 16 9 click to enlarge source morningstar morningstar analysts are famous for a pure long term fundamental focus as well as conservative growth estimates that are usually far below that of most analysts or even management guidance morningstar believes the guidance cut and 2019 weakness in china is a temporary event that will disappear when the trade war ends thus it is maintaining its fair value estimate of 200 which implies apple is actually 26 undervalued if morningstar is right then apple is likely to actually generate close to 17 long term total returns or roughly double that of the market over the coming decade the point is that apple s massive sell off has more than priced in its temporarily elevated risk profile in fact shares are now priced as if all its potential worst case scenarios will come to pass and revenues will fall about 4 annually over the next decade if you believe as i do that apple s non iphone businesses will allow it to generate even modest top line growth and double digit buyback fueled eps growth then today apple is a very strong buy bottom line today is a potentially great time for value investors to cash in on a strong market overreaction to apple s guidance cut don t get me wrong i m not a market timer and am not predicting that apple has necessarily bottomed yet it s possible shares still have lower to fall due to the worst growth scare in years but what i do know is that the company s long term investment thesis while slightly dinged has not been shattered as the recent plunge would have you believe apple s long term strategy of achieving modest top line growth through strong non iphone hardware sales and even stronger high margin service revenue growth remains firmly intact and since the company s epic buybacks will be enough to grow its bottom line at a fast rate and likely deliver double digit dividend growth for the foreseeable future i m more than happy to place a strong buy on apple today that s why the deep value dividend growth portfolio took the opportunity to double its position in apple on january 3rd and in mid february if the stock continues to languish in the toilet we ll boost our position by another 25 assuming earnings results on january 29th aren t catastrophic

washington feeling the pressure of investigations and a partial government shutdown president donald trump is playing loose with the facts regarding hush payments made by his former attorney michael cohen to two women and is changing his story on his promise to build a concrete border wall paid for by mexico in comments over the weekend trump said he did not commit any campaign violation and suggests anything improper would be minor compared with infractions of democrats such as former president barack obama the reality is not so cut and dried federal prosecutors in new york have implicated trump in a crime linking him to the hush money scheme the obama campaign s infractions were civil not criminal on the border wall trump insists he never promised a concrete barrier even though he did and asserts that much of it has been built it hasn t the dubious statements capped an expansive week of assertions by the president on top of the usual twitter flow trump opened a cabinet meeting with 90 minutes of opining to the press touching on immigration drug prices the soviet history in afghanistan his approval ratings syria oil prices the attractiveness of his generals better looking than tom cruise and much more a few days later he spoke for an hour at a rose garden news conference a sampling of his claims trump investigations trump many people currently a part of my opposition including president obama the dems have had campaign violations in some cases for very large sums of money these are civil cases they paid a fine settled while no big deal i did not commit a campaign violation tweet saturday the facts trump has been tied to but not charged with a crime at issue is not a routine campaign violation prosecutors court filings last month said trump directed cohen to make payments to buy the silence of porn actress stormy daniels and former playboy model karen mcdougal during the 2016 presidential campaign both women alleged they had extramarital affairs with trump which the white house denies cohen who pleaded guilty in august to campaign finance crimes in connection with those payments had previously implicated trump now the justice department is backing up cohen s claims in particular the justice department says the hush money payments were unreported campaign contributions meant to influence the outcome of the election that assertion makes the payments subject to campaign finance laws which restrict how much people can donate to a campaign and bar corporations from making direct contributions it s unclear whether trump will actually be charged with illegal activity because justice department legal memos from 1973 and 2000 have suggested that a sitting president is immune from indictment house speaker nancy pelosi d calif told nbc this past week that trump isn t necessarily immune calling an indictment of a sitting president an open discussion in terms of the law there s a big difference between obama s campaign violation and cohen s case a federal election commission audit found that the 2008 obama campaign failed to file 48 hour contribution reports in a timely manner for more than 1 200 donations totalling 1 9 million the commission also found the campaign was late refunding some contributions that exceeded legal limits and discovered some other reporting errors regarding contribution dates the commission fined the obama campaign 375 000 for the violations the campaign was not found to have wilfully violated the law making it a civil infraction in cohen s case he admitted he knew he was breaking the law by making the payments cohen told abc last month that of course trump knew it was wrong to make the hush money payments though he did not provide any specific evidence in the interview unlike the obama case where the issue was timely reporting the hush money payments were never disclosed at all on trump s campaign filings andrew herman a lawyer specializing in campaign finance at law firm miller chevalier said the two cases are completely different species one is a paperwork error he said and the other is a conscious attempt to obscure payments made to affect an election ___ the wall trump as far as concrete i said i was going to build a wall i never said i m going to build a concrete i said i m going to build a wall rose garden news conference friday the facts actually he did say he would build a concrete wall trump even repeated that promise last week rejecting the claim of his departing white house chief of staff john kelly that trump had abandoned the notion of a solid concrete wall early on in the administration an all concrete wall was never abandoned trump tweeted on dec 31 some areas will be all concrete but the experts at border patrol prefer a wall that is see through during the 2016 campaign trump pledged to build a big beautiful wall made of concrete rebar and steel across the length of the southern border with mexico back then he lashed out at the suggestion that what he was proposing had anything in common with mere fencing jeb bush just talked about my border proposal to build a fence he tweeted in 2015 it s not a fence jeb it s a wall and there s a big difference he now often refers to the wall as steel slats steel is stronger than concrete he said friday if i build a steel wall rather than a concrete wall it will actually be stronger than a concrete wall ___ trump when they say build the wall i don t say that any more i say finish the wall remarks to reporters sunday trump we ve already built a lot of the wall rose garden news conference friday the facts he hasn t built much of the wall at all trump s claim is only supported when counting work done under past presidents and ignoring the fact that fences from prior administrations are not the towering walls he promised the 2006 secure fence act has resulted in about 650 miles 1 050 kilometres of border barrier money approved by congress in march 2018 is to pay for 84 miles 135 km but that work is not done trump has achieved some renovation of existing barrier ___ trump the drugs are pouring into this country they don t go through the ports of entry when they do they sometimes get caught rose garden news conference the facts he s wrong in saying drug smugglers don t or only rarely use official border crossings for their trafficking land ports of entry are their primary means for getting drugs into the country not stretches of the border without barriers says the u s drug enforcement administration the agency said in a november report that the most common trafficking technique by transnational criminal organizations is to hide drugs in passenger vehicles or tractor trailers as they drive into the u s though entry ports where they are stopped and subject to inspection they also employ buses cargo trains and tunnels the report says citing smuggling methods that would not be choked off by a border wall ___ trump the new trade deal we have with mexico and canada what we save on that just with mexico will pay for the wall many times over just in a period of a year two years or three years so i view that as absolutely mexico is paying for the wall rose garden news conference the facts mexico is not paying for the wall and nothing in the trade agreement would cover or refund the construction cost trump is assuming a wide variety of economic benefits will come from the agreement but they can t be quantified or counted on for example he said the deal will dissuade some u s companies from moving operations to mexico and he credits that possibility as a payment by mexico for his wall the deal updates the north american free trade agreement in the main preserving nafta s liberalized environment of low or no tariffs among the u s mexico and canada while making certain improvements for each country trump stated inaccurately that it s brand new it s totally different moreover it s not in effect the deal has yet to be ratified in any member country and its chances of winning legislative approval are not assured trump has argued repeatedly that mexico is footing the bill even while insisting on 5 6 billion from the u s treasury to go toward wall construction his demand and the refusal of democrats to satisfy it are behind the budget standoff that has closed parts of the government ___ syria trump we are pulling back in syria we re going to be removing our troops i never said we re doing it that quickly remarks to reporters sunday trump we re bringing the troops back home over a period of time i never said so quickly but over a period of time cabinet meeting wednesday the facts he s wrong about his past statements regarding the pace of withdrawal in a video posted to his twitter account on dec 19 for instance trump said of the roughly 2 000 troops in syria they re all coming back and they re coming back now ___ trump i read when we pull out oh russia is thrilled russia is not happy you know why they re not happy because they like it when we re killing isis because we re killing them for them and we re killing them for assad and we re killing isis also for iran cabinet meeting the facts russia says it s happy a u s withdrawal opens opportunities for moscow and tehran to increase their influence and may help the syrian government survive as a kurdish led opposition force loses its military ally on the ground russian president vladimir putin says the u s has done the right thing in planning to pull out ___ afghanistan trump the reason russia was in afghanistan was because terrorists were going into russia they the soviets were right to be there cabinet meeting the facts his assertion that the soviet union was experiencing a terrorist influx from afghanistan when it invaded in 1979 is out of step with history and his belief that the soviets were right to invade is a stark departure from u s and world opinion the soviets were trying to bolster communists in afghanistan and possibly expand their influence against the united states and the west world condemnation was swift the u n general assembly voted 104 18 to deplore the soviet intervention in afghanistan the u s supported the anti communist rebels giving them shoulder fired rockets to down soviet aircraft the soviets withdrew in 1989 ___ trump russia used to be the soviet union afghanistan made it russia because they went bankrupt fighting in afghanistan cabinet meeting the facts afghanistan was far from the sole reason for the breakup of the soviet union in 1991 the dissolution occurred in a time of ethnic and political troubles economic woes and a series of revolutions that led soviet republics to seek their independence the soviet demise was accelerated by the heavy cost of competing with the west to wield influence around the world including in afghanistan ___ oil prices trump do you think it s just luck that gas prices are so low and falling low gas prices are like another tax cut tweet tuesday trump it s not luck it s not luck i called up certain people and i said let that damn oil and gasoline you let it flow the oil it was going up to 125 if that would ve happened then you would ve had a recession depression cabinet meeting wednesday the facts it s not all about him or even mostly about him while americans may end up paying somewhat less for gasoline this year trump s suggestion that he deserves all the credit and averted a u s economic depression is an exaggeration oil prices which peaked oct 3 have been generally falling on the realization that u s sanctions against iran would not create a shortage and on fear that a global oversupply of oil will spill into 2019 if slower international economic growth depresses energy demand the president s supposed let it flow edict did not stop opec and its russia led allies from agreeing last month to cut oil production that initially failed to stop oil prices from sliding further they have since rebounded a few dollars in the past week continued opec production cuts would push prices higher trump has pointed to his positive relations with saudi arabia which remains the biggest oil exporter as a so called swing producer with the ability to adjust production up or down relatively quickly it can indeed influence the price of crude but the market is complex canada for example is actually the top source of u s oil imports with saudi arabia second ___ tariffs trump the united states treasury has taken in many billions of dollars from the tariffs we are charging china and other countries that have not treated us fairly in the meantime we are doing well in various trade negotiations currently going on tweet thursday the facts trump is off on two major issues first tariffs are taxes paid largely by u s business and consumers not foreign countries and while trump s many billions might sound like a lot it s doing little to nothing to improve the federal balance sheet the u s government spent 4 1 trillion last fiscal year and the budget deficit shot up according to trump s own treasury department customs and duties generated 41 3 billion in revenues last year up from 34 6 billion in 2017 that 6 7 billion increase occurred in part because of the president s tariffs but it amounted to just 0 16 per cent of federal spending ___ mattis trump on jim mattis i wish him well i hope he does well but as you know president barack obama fired him and essentially so did i i want results cabinet meeting wednesday the facts actually mattis resigned as defence secretary in protest over trump s decision to pull u s troops from syria the retired marine general announced on dec 20 in a resignation letter that he was stepping down after trump s decision to withdraw 2 000 u s troops from syria mattis said he would stay on the job until the end of february three days later trump said he was replacing mattis with the second ranking defence official pat shanahan on jan 1 as to the tenure under obama mattis served as commander of the military s central command he departed a few months earlier than expected in 2013 in part because of disagreements over iran ___ drug prices trump i think you re going to see a tremendous reduction in drug prices cabinet meeting wednesday the facts prices continue to rise administration policies announced last year and currently being completed don t seem to have shifted that trend figures on u s prescription drug price changes compiled by health data company elsevier show that from dec 20 through jan 2 there were 1 179 product price changes of those 30 were price cuts and the remaining 1 149 were price increases with 328 of them between 9 per cent and 10 per cent all but one of the rest were by lower percentages elsevier spokesman chris capot said more companies will be announcing price increases this month separately a data firm whose software can help patients find the most cost effective medications says its information shows price increases on many commonly used drugs for conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes in the first two days of january prices have increased on more than 250 different products said michael rea ceo of rx savings solutions the average increase is about 6 per cent he added ___ immigration trump on the number of immigrants living in the u s illegally i used to hear 11 million all the time it would always stay right at 11 i said does it ever increase or go down no it s 11 nobody knows it s probably 30 35 million people they would flow in mostly from the southern border they d come in and nobody would talk about it nobody would do anything about it cabinet meeting wednesday the facts it s nowhere close to 30 million to 35 million according to his own homeland security secretary as well as independent estimates the nonpartisan pew research center estimates there were 10 7 million immigrants in the u s illegally in 2016 the most recent data available advocacy groups on both sides of the immigration issue have similar estimates at a house hearing last month homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen acknowledged the number was somewhere between 11 million and 22 million significantly lower than trump s claim of 35 million according to pew the number of immigrants in the u s illegally had reached a height of 12 2 million in 2007 representing about 4 per cent of the u s population before declining in part because of a weakening u s economy ___ trump the coyotes are using children to gain access into this country they re using these children they re not with families they re using the children they re taking the children and then they dispose of the children after they re done this has been going on for years this isn t unique to us but we want to stop it cabinet meeting wednesday the facts this does happen though it s not as common as trump suggests by talking about it so often he is referring to adults who come with children they falsely claim to be theirs so that they won t be detained under a no child separation policy but such cases of fraud are rare according to the homeland security department about 500 immigrants were found to be not a legitimate family unit and thus separated upon detention from april 19 to sept 30 of last year that s a small fraction of the 107 000 families apprehended in the last budget year which ended

falling on the realization that u s sanctions against iran would not create a shortage and on fear that a global oversupply of oil will spill into 2019 if slower international economic growth depresses energy demand the president s supposed let it flow edict did not stop opec and its russia led allies from agreeing last month to cut oil production that initially failed to stop oil prices from sliding further they have since rebounded a few dollars in the past week continued opec production cuts would push prices higher trump has pointed to his positive relations with saudi arabia which remains the biggest oil exporter as a so called swing producer with the ability to adjust production up or down relatively quickly it can indeed influence the price of crude but the market is complex canada for example is actually the top source of u s oil imports with saudi arabia second ___ tariffs trump the united states treasury has taken in many billions of dollars from the tariffs we are charging china and other countries that have not treated us fairly in the meantime we are doing well in various trade negotiations currently going on tweet thursday the facts trump is off on two major issues first tariffs are taxes paid largely by u s business and consumers not foreign countries and while trump s many billions might sound like a lot it s doing little to nothing to improve the federal balance sheet the u s government spent 4 1 trillion last fiscal year and the budget deficit shot up according to trump s own treasury department advertisement customs and duties generated 41 3 billion in revenues last year up from 34 6 billion in 2017 that 6 7 billion increase occurred in part because of the president s tariffs but it amounted to just 0 16 percent of federal spending ___

ranking defense official pat shanahan on jan 1 as to the tenure under obama mattis served as commander of the military s central command he departed a few months earlier than expected in 2013 in part

s illegally in 2016 the most recent data available advocacy groups on both sides of the immigration issue have similar estimates at a house hearing last month homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen acknowledged the number was somewhere between 11 million and 22 million significantly lower than trump s claim of 35 million according to pew the number of immigrants in the u s illegally had reached a height of 12 2 million in 2007 representing about 4 percent of the u s population before declining in part because of a weakening u s economy advertisement ___ trump the coyotes are using

re done this has been going on for years this isn t unique to us but we want to stop it cabinet meeting wednesday the facts this does happen though it s not as common as trump suggests by talking about it so often he is referring to adults who come with children they falsely claim to be theirs so that they won t be detained under a no child separation policy but such cases of fraud are rare according to the homeland security department about 500 immigrants were found to be not a legitimate family unit and thus separated upon detention from april 19 to sept 30 of last year that s a small

on its 20th birthday the best that can be said of the euro the european currency used by 19 countries is that it has survived two decades after being introduced in 1999 it has not achieved its central goals increasing economic growth and strengthening public support for european political institutions in many ways just the opposite has occurred the economy of the eurozone all the countries that adopted the euro great britain and some other nations declined to join still lags the united states in growth for 2019 growth is forecast at only 1 6 compared with 2 6 for the united states even worse the contentious negotiations over rescuing the eurozone s weaker members greece spain portugal and italy have left a bitter aftertaste debtor countries feel they were treated badly by the wealthier creditor countries particularly germany meanwhile the creditors resent having to bail out their poorer neighbors animosities remain all this looms over europe s present political crisis its rising populism its anger over immigration and the conflict over brexit another euro crisis a clear possibility would make things worse italy seems especially vulnerable with little economic growth and government debt at about 130 of its gross domestic product notes rebecca patterson in a report for the bessemer trust a financial services firm the euro s appeal was simple eliminating separate currencies for the european union s member countries would reduce the nuisance of money conversions promote stable exchange rates and stimulate trade faster economic growth would make the case for more centralized control a more powerful eu at first things went well interest rates dropped sharply especially for weaker borrowers in january 1999 rates on italian 10 year government bonds were virtually the same as rates on similar german bonds although the german economy and its repayment prospects were much better than italy s by contrast italian interest rates had been much higher before the euro the gap or spread between german and italian rates was 5 percentage points in early 1995 other debtor countries got similar relief from higher interest rates the apparent justification for the lower rates was this investors believed that the discipline of a single currency would force many poorer eu countries to improve their economies and less optimistically if they got in trouble they would be bailed out by others so the risk of lending had declined more could be lent the result should have surprised no one there was a credit boom says economist adam posen of the peterson institute german french dutch and belgian banks lent to greek spanish italian and portuguese borrowers money flooded into greek bonds and spanish real estate everyone was happy greece spain and other debtors enjoyed the pleasures of easy money germany and other creditor nations benefited from strong exports which in turn were ultimately financed by loans from these countries banks the trouble was that the creditors overlent and the debtors overborrowed america s 2007 09 great recession was fatal its side effects including a steep fall in global trade hurt many european borrowers and lenders some lenders were unwilling or unable to renew their loans there were sudden stops as posen puts it to stay solvent borrowers had to get government credit from central banks and international agencies such as the international monetary fund or cut spending and raise taxes it was here that the toughest negotiations occurred as lenders and borrowers argued over terms one possible solution was for debtor countries to abandon the euro and revert to national currencies and to do so at conversion rates that favored borrowers this didn t happen though there was much speculation that it might almost everyone agreed that ditching the euro would have involved hugely difficult legal political operational and moral issues still it was a possibility if a few countries had jettisoned the euro what would have happened nothing many countries doing likewise a deep global recession none of this occurred in part because no one could confidently answer these questions another reason is that the euro remains popular at home by one survey 74 percent of euro users support it people favor the euro though not the measures needed to make it workable in the end the european central bank bought 2 6 trillion euros worth of bonds nearly 3 trillion at present exchange rates to prop up the currency after mario draghi president of the ecb pledged in mid 2012 to do whatever it takes to save the euro the story continues eventually we re going to have another u s recession says patterson author of the bessemer trust report then we ll see whether europe s governments banks and businesses can withstand the pressures created by high debt and low economic growth and whether the euro can still survive
washington feeling the pressure of investigations and a partial government shutdown president donald trump is playing loose with the facts regarding hush payments made by his former attorney michael cohen to two women and is changing his story on his promise to build a concrete border wall paid for by mexico in comments over the weekend trump said he did not commit any campaign violation and suggests anything improper would be minor compared with infractions of democrats such as former president barack obama the reality is not so cut and dried federal prosecutors in new york have implicated trump in a crime linking him to the hush money scheme the obama campaign s infractions were civil not criminal on the border wall trump insists he never promised a concrete barrier even though he did and asserts that much of it has been built it hasn t the dubious statements capped an expansive week of assertions by the president on top of the usual twitter flow trump opened a cabinet meeting with 90 minutes of opining to the press touching on immigration drug prices the soviet history in afghanistan his approval ratings syria oil prices the attractiveness of his generals better looking than tom cruise and much more a few days later he spoke for an hour at a rose garden news conference a sampling of his claims trump investigations trump many people currently a part of my opposition including president obama the dems have had campaign violations in some cases for very large sums of money these are civil cases they paid a fine settled while no big deal i did not commit a campaign violation tweet saturday the facts trump has been tied to but not charged with a crime at issue is not a routine campaign violation prosecutors court filings last month said trump directed cohen to make payments to buy the silence of porn actress stormy daniels and former playboy model karen mcdougal during the 2016 presidential campaign both women alleged they had extramarital affairs with trump which the white house denies cohen who pleaded guilty in august to campaign finance crimes in connection with those payments had previously implicated trump now the justice department is backing up cohen s claims in particular the justice department says the hush money payments were unreported campaign contributions meant to influence the outcome of the election that assertion makes the payments subject to campaign finance laws which restrict how much people can donate to a campaign and bar corporations from making direct contributions it s unclear whether trump will actually be charged with illegal activity because justice department legal memos from 1973 and 2000 have suggested that a sitting president is immune from indictment house speaker nancy pelosi d calif told nbc this past week that trump isn t necessarily immune calling an indictment of a sitting president an open discussion in terms of the law there s a big difference between obama s campaign violation and cohen s case a federal election commission audit found that the 2008 obama campaign failed to file 48 hour contribution reports in a timely manner for more than 1 200 donations totalling 1 9 million the commission also found the campaign was late refunding some contributions that exceeded legal limits and discovered some other reporting errors regarding contribution dates the commission fined the obama campaign 375 000 for the violations the campaign was not found to have wilfully violated the law making it a civil infraction in cohen s case he admitted he knew he was breaking the law by making the payments cohen told abc last month that of course trump knew it was wrong to make the hush money payments though he did not provide any specific evidence in the interview unlike the obama case where the issue was timely reporting the hush money payments were never disclosed at all on trump s campaign filings andrew herman a lawyer specializing in campaign finance at law firm miller chevalier said the two cases are completely different species one is a paperwork error he said and the other is a conscious attempt to obscure payments made to affect an election ___ the wall trump as far as concrete i said i was going to build a wall i never said i m going to build a concrete i said i m going to build a wall rose garden news conference friday the

prefer a wall that is see through during the 2016 campaign trump pledged to build a big beautiful wall made of concrete rebar and steel across the length of the southern border with mexico back then he lashed out at the suggestion that what he was proposing had anything in common with mere fencing jeb bush just talked about my border proposal to build a fence he tweeted in 2015 it s not a fence jeb it s a wall and there s a big difference he now often refers to the wall as steel slats steel is stronger than concrete he said friday if i build a steel wall rather than a concrete wall it will actually be stronger than a concrete wall ___ trump when they say build the wall i don t say that any more i say finish the wall remarks to reporters sunday trump we ve already built a lot of the wall rose garden news conference friday the facts he hasn t built much of the wall at all trump s claim is only supported when counting work done under past presidents and ignoring the fact that fences from prior administrations are not the towering walls he promised the 2006 secure fence act has resulted in about 650 miles 1 050 kilometres of border barrier money approved by congress in march 2018 is to pay for 84 miles 135 km but that work is not done trump has achieved some renovation of existing barrier ___ trump the drugs are pouring into this country they don t go through the ports of entry when they do they sometimes get caught rose garden news conference the facts he s wrong in saying drug smugglers don t or only rarely use official border crossings for their trafficking land ports of entry are their primary means for getting drugs into the country not stretches of the border without barriers says the u s drug enforcement administration the agency said in a november report that the most common trafficking technique by transnational criminal organizations is to hide drugs in passenger vehicles or tractor trailers as they drive into the u s though entry ports where they are stopped and subject to inspection they also employ buses cargo trains and tunnels the report says citing smuggling methods that would not be choked off by a border wall ___ trump the new trade deal we have with mexico and canada what we save on that just with mexico will pay for the wall many times over just in a period of a year two years or three years so i view that as absolutely mexico is paying for the wall rose garden news conference the facts mexico is not paying for the wall and nothing in the trade agreement would cover or refund the construction cost trump is assuming a wide variety of economic benefits will come from the agreement but they can t be quantified or counted on for example he said the deal will dissuade some u s companies from moving operations to mexico and he credits that possibility as a payment by mexico for his wall the deal updates the north american free trade agreement in the main preserving nafta s liberalized environment of low or no tariffs among the u s mexico and canada while making certain improvements for each country trump stated inaccurately that it s brand new it s totally different moreover it s not in effect the deal has yet to be ratified in any member country and its chances of winning legislative approval are not assured trump has argued repeatedly that mexico is footing the bill even while insisting on 5 6 billion from the u s treasury to go toward wall construction his demand and the refusal of democrats to satisfy it are behind the budget standoff that has closed parts of the government ___ syria trump we are pulling back in syria we re going to be removing our troops i never said we re doing it that quickly remarks to reporters sunday trump we re bringing the troops back home over a period of time i never said so quickly but over a period of time cabinet meeting wednesday the facts he s wrong about his past statements regarding the pace of withdrawal in a video posted to his twitter account on dec 19 for instance trump said of the roughly 2 000 troops in syria they re all coming back and they re coming back now ___ trump i read when we pull out oh russia is thrilled russia is not happy you know why they re not happy because they like it when we re killing isis because we re killing them for them and we re killing them for assad and we re killing isis also for iran cabinet meeting the facts russia says it s happy a u s withdrawal opens opportunities for moscow and tehran to increase their influence and may help the syrian government survive as a kurdish led opposition force loses its military ally on the ground russian president vladimir putin says the u s has done the right thing in planning to pull out ___ afghanistan trump the reason russia was in afghanistan was because terrorists were going into russia they the soviets were right to be there cabinet meeting the facts his assertion that the soviet union was experiencing a terrorist influx from afghanistan when it invaded in 1979 is out of step with history and his belief that the soviets were right to invade is a stark departure from u s and world opinion the soviets were trying to bolster communists in afghanistan and possibly expand their influence against the united states and the west world condemnation was swift the u n general assembly voted 104 18 to deplore the soviet intervention in afghanistan the u s supported the anti communist rebels giving them shoulder fired rockets to down soviet aircraft the soviets withdrew in 1989 ___ trump russia used to be the soviet union afghanistan made it russia because they went bankrupt fighting in afghanistan cabinet meeting the facts afghanistan was far from the sole reason for the breakup of the soviet union in 1991 the dissolution occurred in a time of ethnic and political troubles economic woes and a series of revolutions that led soviet republics to seek their independence the soviet demise was accelerated by the heavy cost of competing with the west to wield influence around the world including in afghanistan ___ oil prices trump do you think it s just luck that gas prices are so low and falling low gas prices are like another tax cut tweet tuesday trump it s not luck it s not luck i called up certain people and i said let that damn oil and gasoline you let it flow the oil it was going up to 125 if that would ve happened then you would ve had a recession depression cabinet meeting wednesday the facts it s not all about him or even mostly about him while americans may end up paying somewhat less for gasoline this year trump s suggestion that he deserves all the credit and averted a u s economic depression is an exaggeration oil prices which peaked oct 3 have been generally falling on the realization that u s sanctions against iran would not create a shortage and on fear that a global oversupply of oil will spill into 2019 if slower international economic growth depresses energy demand the president s supposed let it flow edict did not stop opec and its russia led allies from agreeing last month to cut oil production that initially failed to stop oil prices from sliding further they have since rebounded a few dollars in the past week continued opec production cuts would push prices higher trump has pointed to his positive relations with saudi arabia which remains the biggest oil exporter as a so called swing producer with the ability to adjust production up or down relatively quickly it can indeed influence the price of crude but the market is complex canada for example is actually the top source of u s oil imports with saudi arabia second ___ tariffs trump the united states treasury has taken in many billions of dollars from the tariffs we are charging china and other countries that have not treated us fairly in the meantime we are doing well in various trade negotiations currently going on tweet thursday the facts trump is off on two major issues first tariffs are taxes paid largely by u s business and consumers not foreign countries and while trump s many billions might sound like a lot it s doing little to nothing to improve the federal balance sheet the u s government spent 4 1 trillion last fiscal year and the budget deficit shot up according to trump s own treasury department customs and duties generated 41 3 billion in revenues last year up from 34 6 billion in 2017 that 6 7 billion increase occurred in part because of the president s tariffs but it amounted to just 0 16 per cent of federal spending ___ mattis trump on jim mattis i wish him well i hope he does well but as you know president barack obama fired him and essentially so did i i want results cabinet meeting wednesday the facts actually mattis resigned as defence secretary in protest over trump s decision to pull u s troops from syria the retired marine general announced on dec 20 in a resignation letter that he was stepping down after trump s decision to withdraw 2 000 u s troops from syria mattis said he would stay on the job until the end of february three days later trump said he was replacing mattis with the second ranking defence official pat shanahan on jan 1 as to the tenure under obama mattis served as commander of the military s central command he departed a few months earlier than expected in 2013 in part because of disagreements over iran ___ drug prices trump i think you re going to see a tremendous reduction in drug prices cabinet meeting wednesday the facts prices continue to rise administration policies announced last year and currently being completed don t seem to have shifted that trend figures on u s prescription drug price changes compiled by health data company elsevier show that from dec 20 through jan 2 there were 1 179 product price changes of those 30 were price cuts and the remaining 1 149 were price increases with 328 of them between 9 per cent and 10 per cent all but one of the rest were by lower percentages elsevier spokesman chris capot said more companies will be announcing price increases this month separately a data firm whose software can help patients find the most cost effective medications says its information shows price increases on many commonly used drugs for conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes in the first two days of january prices have increased on more than 250 different products said michael rea ceo of rx savings solutions the average increase is about 6 per cent he added ___ immigration trump on the number of immigrants living in the u s illegally i used to hear 11 million all the time it would always stay right at 11 i said does it ever increase or go down no it s 11 nobody knows it s probably 30 35 million people they would flow in mostly from the southern border they d come in and nobody would talk about it nobody would do anything about it cabinet meeting wednesday the facts it s nowhere close to 30 million to 35 million according to his own homeland security secretary as well as independent estimates the nonpartisan pew research center estimates there were 10 7 million immigrants in the u s illegally in 2016 the most recent data available advocacy groups on both sides of the immigration issue have similar estimates at a house hearing last month homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen acknowledged the number was somewhere between 11 million and 22 million significantly lower than trump s claim of 35 million according to pew the number of immigrants in the u s illegally had reached a height of 12 2 million in 2007 representing about 4 per cent of the u s population before declining in part because of a weakening u s economy ___ trump the coyotes are using children to gain access into this country they re using these children they re not with families they re using the children they re taking the children and then they dispose of the children after they re done this has been going on for years this isn t unique to us but we want to stop it cabinet meeting wednesday the facts this does happen though it s not as common as trump suggests by talking about it so often he is referring to adults who come with children they falsely claim to be theirs so that they won t be detained under a no child separation policy but such cases of fraud are rare according to the homeland security department about 500 immigrants were found to be not a legitimate family unit and thus separated upon detention from april 19 to sept 30 of last year that s a small fraction of the 107 000 families apprehended in the last budget year which ended

the dollar has recently appreciated to its highest level in real terms since the start of 2017 and before that september 2003 dollar appreciation weighed on oil prices in 2018 as prices in some non dollar currencies hit record levels earlier in the year and dampened consumption growth yet there are signs that the dollar s rise may be coming to an end as trade tensions with china weigh and pressure to raise rates dissipates lifting prospects for oil prices to recover everything hinges on whether policymakers in the united states and china can avoid further escalation of their economic war for now dollar strength has helped hold down us inflation even as unemployment has fallen to its lowest level in decades but it has contributed to a worsening trade deficit and cut the dollar value of overseas earnings of us based companies the united states is currently running a mix of expansionary fiscal policy tax cuts and increased spending on the military and a less accommodative or contractionary financial policy rising interest rates the consequence is an improvement in the trade off between employment and inflation internal balance but a deterioration in the trade deficit external balance exchange rate movements have suppressed inflation despite the booming economy but at the cost of declining international competitiveness despite tariffs the strong dollar has posed a dilemma for the federal reserve halting interest rates hikes runs the risk of pushing down the real exchange rate and pushing up inflation the trump administration and the federal reserve are to some extent re running the policy mix of the reagan administration and the central bank under paul volcker in the 1980s the reagan administrations tax cuts and defence build up coupled with higher interest rates caused the dollar to surge and the trade deficit to soar the reagan administration pressed trading partners to cut exports to the united states especially cars steel and electronics and boost their currencies eventually the white house pushed the fed to adopt a more accommodative policy triggering the departure of the chairman it is worth noting the current us trade representative robert lighthizer was the deputy trade representative in the reagan administration when it forced japan to accept voluntary export restraints to curb its exports to the united states the administration went on to press the other major economies to appreciate their currencies and depreciate the dollar as part of the plaza accord in 1985 the strong dollar of the early 1980s worsened the demand destruction and oversupply of oil in the early 1980s and contributed to the price crisis of 1985 and 1986 subsequent dollar depreciation likely helped steady oil prices in the second half of the 1980s at least it did once saudi arabia s oil minister ahmed zaki yamani was replaced and the kingdom abandoned netback pricing and its volume warfare strategy just as japan was the target for us policymakers in the 1980s complaining about unfair trading practices china has become the target in the 2010s the experience of the fiscal expansion strong dollar and trade deficits of the 1980s hold important lessons for the next two years and a possible roadmap the trade war between the united states and china has pushed both economies as well as their trading partners towards a slowdown or even a recession in 2019 as economic growth slows both countries are likely to become increasingly eager for a negotiated solution that kick starts business activity and raises equity prices the worse the economic news becomes the greater the pressure on both countries particularly the united states which holds a presidential election in 2020 to reach a deal lighthizer s involvement suggests any eventual deal with china and deals with the european union and other trading partners will likely employ some combination of managed trade to reduce the deficit voluntary export restraints purchases of big ticket items such as aircraft and farm products together with selective tariffs and quotas are likely to form part of the eventual deal us negotiators will also push for structural reforms on intellectual property subsidies and state owned enterprises probably even harder than they did with japan in the 1980s the trump white house has already made its displeasure with the fed over recent interest rate increases very clear signs of a domestic slowdown will give the central bank an opportunity to re examine the case for further rises or even contemplate a cut if policymakers wish to do so without more pressure from the white house the white house has been vigilant over the strength of the dollar pressing other trading partners not to depreciate their currencies further it is not clear whether the administration will try to repeat the plaza accord or include exchange rate conditions in any trade with china even without a formal exchange rate agreement an end to us interest rate increases could halt the currency s upward move and interest rate cuts would probably send it lower again as they did between 2009 and 2011 in the short term lower oil prices have been an important part of global rebalancing and will support economic activity in consuming countries and ultimately buy back some demand growth in 2019 but a scenario with lower us interest rates dollar depreciation easing trade tensions and an improving global economic outlook could ultimately help push oil prices higher everything hinges on whether policymakers in the united states and china can find a way to avoid further escalation of their economic war and avert a prolonged global recession reuters published in dawn the business and finance weekly january 7th 2019

slashing the rrr is likely to be a key tool for the pboc this year as it is a way of controlling one time additions to market liquidity carefully calibrated to the needs of the economy without having distortional effects elsewhere in the economy chinese banks as with banks in other major countries are required to hold a minimum amount of capital at the central bank to guard against potential losses expressed as a ratio of a bank s outstanding loans by cutting this ratio banks are required to hold less in reserve and in theory have more money to lend this should release cash into the real economy help generate economic activity and in turn boost growth as china continues to grapple with the effects of an economic slowdown domestically and a trade war with the united states externally the rrr is likely to be a key element of its monetary policy this year the order came after chinese premier li keqiang met with top financial regulators to address the need to shelter chinese businesses from external shocks and to stabilise the economy the people s bank of china pboc kicked off the first round of 2019 s policy easing on friday 4 january slashing the required reserve ratio rrr by a full percentage point in a bid to bolster bank lending by 1 5 trillion yuan us 218 billion in theory pboc governor yi gang has significant leeway to cut the ratio which now stands at 13 5 per cent for large state owned banks much higher than in other large economies in the us where the ratio is placed on deposits themselves rather than the banks holding them large savings deposits have an rrr of 10 per cent while small deposits do not have any minimum reserve holding requirement at all in the european union the ratio is 1 per cent while it ranges from 0 05 per cent to 1 2 per cent for banks in japan the market widely expects an additional cumulative cut of 100 to 200 basis points in china this year depending on the economy s performance over the course of 2019 what are the other tools at the pboc s disposal the central bank could also cut the interest rates on tools such as the reverse repo rate used to adjust daily liquidity in the banking system this would help to lower the cost of corporate borrowing and so boost economic activity however such a move would send strong signals that the pboc is easing since it would reverse the modest rate hikes the central bank employed over the past two years in response to the rate increases by the us federal reserve reducing the difference between us and china interest rates would put downward pressure on the yuan s exchange rate which the government has promised to keep stable a more unconventional tool beijing policymakers could use is window guidance when governments use dialogue rather than legislation to persuade banks to loosen the purse strings and lend to small businesses this would be directed towards the five largest state owned banks which receive a quarter of the country s lending quota and is widely viewed as an effective way to accomplish policy targets aa clerk counts chinese currency notes at a bank outlet in huaibei in central china s anhui province photo chinatopix via ap are the floodgates now open despite its continued effort to pump liquidity into the banking system including four rrr cuts last year and the most recent cut last week the central bank has stressed that it is support for bank lending rather than engaging in a major easing of monetary policy some analysts view this as rhetoric designed to guide market expectations but regardless it is expected that fiscal expansion through tax cuts and government infrastructure spend will be the main drivers of stimulus this year beijing is also trying to avoid a repeat of the policy mistakes it made with its massive stimulus efforts in response to the global financial crisis of 2008 that 4 trillion yuan fiscal and monetary policy loosening is credited with saving china s economy from a crash but also led to severe industrial overcapacity a surge in risky lending huge piles of local government debt and delays in much needed economic restructuring china s top leaders also believe a major stimulus effort is unlikely to solve china s deep rooted structural problems previous rounds of stimulus have shown that funding often does not flow to the areas the government wishes to support instead excess liquidity can create asset bubbles in the economy depreciate the currency and undermine ongoing structural adjustment efforts what is the pboc monetary policy priority for 2019 at its annual conference last week the central bank made clear that supporting growth while maintaining control over financial risks will remain its priorities this year need to further strengthen counter cyclical adjustment maintain reasonably ample liquidity and reasonably stable market rates said its online statement released after the meeting the pboc will seek to fine tune policy to keep national growth from dropping below the government s target rate this year s government gross domestic product target figure will be released during the meeting of the national people s congress in march the central bank s work will also concentrate on improving the way it communicates policy changes to the market so that they can be more effectively implemented

it hasn t article content the dubious statements capped an expansive week of assertions by the president on top of the usual twitter flow trump opened a cabinet meeting with 90 minutes of opining to the press touching on immigration drug prices the soviet history in afghanistan his approval ratings syria oil prices the attractiveness of his generals better looking than tom cruise and much more a few days later he spoke for an hour at a rose garden news conference a sampling of his claims trump investigations trump many people currently a part of my opposition including president obama the dems have had campaign violations in some cases for very large sums of money these are civil cases they paid a fine settled while no big deal i did not commit a campaign violation tweet saturday the facts trump has been tied to but not charged with a crime at issue is not a routine campaign violation prosecutors court filings last month said trump directed cohen to make payments to buy the silence of porn actress stormy daniels and former playboy model karen mcdougal during the 2016 presidential campaign both women alleged they had extramarital affairs with trump which the white house denies advertisement 3 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content cohen who pleaded guilty in august to campaign finance crimes in connection with those payments had previously implicated trump now the justice department is backing up cohen s claims in particular the justice department says the hush money payments were unreported campaign contributions meant to influence the outcome of the election that assertion makes the payments subject to campaign finance laws which restrict how much people can donate to a campaign and bar corporations from making direct contributions it s unclear whether trump will actually be charged with illegal activity because justice department legal memos from 1973 and 2000 have suggested that a sitting president is immune from indictment house speaker nancy pelosi d calif told nbc this past week that trump isn t necessarily immune calling an indictment of a sitting president an open discussion in terms of the law there s a big difference between obama s campaign violation and cohen s case a federal election commission audit found that the 2008 obama campaign failed to file 48 hour contribution reports in a timely manner for more than 1 200 donations totalling 1 9 million the commission also found the campaign was late refunding some contributions that exceeded legal limits and discovered some other reporting errors regarding contribution dates advertisement 4 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the commission fined the obama campaign 375 000 for the violations the campaign was not found to have wilfully violated the law making it a civil infraction in cohen s case he admitted he knew he was breaking the law by making the payments cohen told abc last month that of course trump knew it was wrong to make the hush money payments though he did not provide any specific evidence in the interview unlike the obama case where the issue was timely reporting the hush money payments were never disclosed at all on trump s campaign filings andrew herman a lawyer specializing in campaign finance at law firm miller chevalier said the two cases are completely different species one is a paperwork error he said and the other is a conscious attempt to obscure payments made to affect an election the wall trump as far as concrete i said i was going to build a wall i never said i m going to build a concrete i said i m going to build a wall rose garden news conference friday the facts actually he did say he would build a concrete wall trump even repeated that promise last week rejecting the claim of his departing white house chief of staff john kelly that trump had abandoned the notion of a solid concrete wall early on in the administration advertisement 5 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content an all concrete wall was never abandoned trump tweeted on dec 31 some areas will be all concrete but the experts at border patrol prefer a wall that is see through during the 2016 campaign trump pledged to build a big beautiful wall made of concrete rebar and steel across the length of the southern border with mexico back then he lashed out at the suggestion that what he was proposing had anything in common with mere fencing jeb bush just talked about my border proposal to build a fence he tweeted in 2015 it s not a fence jeb it s a wall and there s a big difference he now often refers to the wall as steel slats steel is stronger than concrete he said friday if i build a steel wall rather than a concrete wall it will actually be stronger than a concrete wall trump when they say build the wall i don t say that any more i say finish the wall remarks to reporters sunday trump we ve already built a lot of the wall rose garden news conference friday the facts he hasn t built much of the wall at all trump s claim is only supported when counting work done under past presidents and ignoring the fact that fences from prior administrations are not the towering walls he promised the 2006 secure fence act has resulted in about 650 miles 1 050 kilometres of border barrier money approved by congress in march 2018 is to pay for 84 miles 135 km but that work is not done trump has achieved some renovation of existing barrier advertisement 6 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content trump the drugs are pouring into this country they don t go through the ports of entry when they do they sometimes get caught rose garden news conference the facts he s wrong in saying drug smugglers don t or only rarely use official border crossings for their trafficking land ports of entry are their primary means for getting drugs into the country not stretches of the border without barriers says the u s drug enforcement administration the agency said in a november report that the most common trafficking technique by transnational criminal organizations is to hide drugs in passenger vehicles or tractor trailers as they drive into the u s though entry ports where they are stopped and subject to inspection they also employ buses cargo trains and tunnels the report says citing smuggling methods that would not be choked off by a border wall trump the new trade deal we have with mexico and canada what we save on that just with mexico will pay for the wall many times over just in a period of a year two years or three years so i view that as absolutely mexico is paying for the wall rose garden news conference advertisement 7 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the facts mexico is not paying for the wall and nothing in the trade agreement would cover or refund the construction cost trump is assuming a wide variety of economic benefits will come from the agreement but they can t be quantified or counted on for example he said the deal will dissuade some u s companies from moving operations to mexico and he credits that possibility as a payment by mexico for his wall the deal updates the north american free trade agreement in the main preserving nafta s liberalized environment of low or no tariffs among the u s mexico and canada while making certain improvements for each country trump stated inaccurately that it s brand new it s totally different moreover it s not in effect the deal has yet to be ratified in any member country and its chances of winning legislative approval are not assured trump has argued repeatedly that mexico is footing the bill even while insisting on 5 6 billion from the u s treasury to go toward wall construction his demand and the refusal of democrats to satisfy it are behind the budget standoff that has closed parts of the government advertisement 8 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content syria trump we are pulling back in syria we re going to be removing our troops i never said we re doing it that quickly remarks to reporters sunday trump we re bringing the troops back home over a period of time i never said so quickly but over a period of time cabinet meeting wednesday the facts he s wrong about his past statements regarding the pace of withdrawal in a video posted to his twitter account on dec 19 for instance trump said of the roughly 2 000 troops in syria they re all coming back and they re coming back now trump i read when we pull out oh russia is thrilled russia is not happy you know why they re not happy because they like it when we re killing isis because we re killing them for them and we re killing them for assad and we re killing isis also for iran cabinet meeting the facts russia says it s happy a u s withdrawal opens opportunities for moscow and tehran to increase their influence and may help the syrian government survive as a kurdish led opposition force loses its military ally on the ground advertisement 9 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content russian president vladimir putin says the u s has done the right thing in planning to pull out afghanistan trump the reason russia was in afghanistan was because terrorists were going into russia they the soviets were right to be there cabinet meeting the facts his assertion that the soviet union was experiencing a terrorist influx from afghanistan when it invaded in 1979 is out of step with history and his belief that the soviets were right to invade is a stark departure from u s and world opinion the soviets were trying to bolster communists in afghanistan and possibly expand their influence against the united states and the west world condemnation was swift the u n general assembly voted 104 18 to deplore the soviet intervention in afghanistan the u s supported the anti communist rebels giving them shoulder fired rockets to down soviet aircraft the soviets withdrew in 1989 trump russia used to be the soviet union afghanistan made it russia because they went bankrupt fighting in afghanistan cabinet meeting the facts afghanistan was far from the sole reason for the breakup of the soviet union in 1991 the dissolution occurred in a time of ethnic and political troubles economic woes and a series of revolutions that led soviet republics to seek their independence the soviet demise was accelerated by the heavy cost of competing with the west to wield influence around the world including in afghanistan advertisement 10 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article

luck i called up certain people and i said let that damn oil and gasoline you let it flow the oil it was going up to 125 if that would ve happened then you would ve had a recession depression cabinet meeting wednesday the facts it s not all about him or even mostly about him while americans may end up paying somewhat less for gasoline this year trump s suggestion that he deserves all the credit and averted a u s economic depression is an exaggeration oil prices which peaked oct 3 have been generally falling on the realization that u s sanctions against iran would not create a shortage and on fear that a global oversupply of oil will spill into 2019 if slower international economic growth depresses energy demand the president s supposed let it flow edict did not stop opec and its russia led allies from agreeing last month to cut oil production that initially failed to stop oil prices from sliding further they have since rebounded a few dollars in the past week continued opec production cuts would push prices higher advertisement 11 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content trump has pointed to his positive relations with saudi arabia which remains the biggest oil exporter as a so called swing producer with the ability to adjust production up or down relatively quickly it can indeed influence the price of crude but the market is complex canada for example is actually the top source of u s oil imports with saudi arabia second tariffs trump the united states treasury has taken in many billions of dollars from the tariffs we are charging china and other countries that have not treated us fairly in the meantime we are doing well in various trade negotiations currently going on tweet thursday the facts trump is off on two major issues first tariffs are taxes paid largely by u s business and consumers not foreign countries and while trump s many billions might sound like a lot it s doing little to nothing to improve the federal balance sheet the u s government spent 4 1 trillion last fiscal year and the budget deficit shot up according to trump s own treasury department customs and duties generated 41 3 billion in revenues last year up from 34 6 billion in 2017 advertisement 12 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content that 6 7 billion increase occurred in part because of the president s tariffs but it amounted to just 0 16 per cent of federal spending mattis trump on jim mattis i wish him well i hope he does well but as you know president barack obama fired him and essentially so did i i want results cabinet meeting wednesday the facts actually mattis resigned as defence secretary in protest over trump s decision to pull u s troops from syria the retired marine general announced on dec 20 in a resignation letter that he was stepping down after trump s decision to withdraw 2 000 u s troops from syria mattis said he would stay on the job until the end of february three days later trump said he was replacing mattis with the second ranking defence official pat shanahan on jan 1 as to the tenure under obama mattis served as commander of the military s central command he departed a few months earlier than expected in 2013 in part because of disagreements over iran drug prices trump i think you re going to see a tremendous reduction in drug prices cabinet meeting wednesday advertisement 13 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the facts prices continue to rise administration policies announced last year and currently being completed don t seem to have shifted that trend figures on u s prescription drug price changes compiled by health data company elsevier show that from dec 20 through jan 2 there were 1 179 product price changes of those 30 were price cuts and the remaining 1 149 were price increases with 328 of them between 9 per cent and 10 per cent all but one of the rest were by lower percentages elsevier spokesman chris capot said more companies will be announcing price increases this month separately a data firm whose software can help patients find the most cost effective medications says its information shows price increases on many commonly used drugs for conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes in the first two days of january prices have increased on more than 250 different products said michael rea ceo of rx savings solutions the average increase is about 6 per cent he added immigration trump on the number of immigrants living in the u s illegally i used to hear 11 million all the time it would always stay right at 11 i said does it ever increase or go down no it s 11 nobody knows it s probably 30 35 million people they would flow in mostly from the southern border they d come in and nobody would talk about it nobody would do anything about it cabinet meeting wednesday advertisement 14 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the facts it s nowhere close to 30 million to 35 million according to his own homeland security secretary as well as independent estimates the nonpartisan pew research center estimates there were 10 7 million immigrants in the u s illegally in 2016 the most recent data available advocacy groups on both sides of the immigration issue have similar estimates at a house hearing last month homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen acknowledged the number was somewhere between 11 million and 22 million significantly lower than trump s claim of 35 million according to pew the number of immigrants in the u s illegally had reached a height of 12 2 million in 2007 representing about 4 per cent of the u s population before declining in part because of a weakening u s economy trump the coyotes are using children to gain access into this country they re using these children they re not with families they re using the children they re taking the children and then they dispose of the children after they re done this has been going on for years this isn t unique to us but we want to stop it cabinet meeting wednesday advertisement 15 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the facts this does happen though it s not as common as trump suggests by talking about it so often he is referring to adults who come with children they falsely claim to be theirs so that they won t be detained under a no child separation policy but such cases of fraud are rare according to the homeland security department about 500 immigrants were found to be not a legitimate family unit and thus separated upon detention from april 19 to sept 30 of last year that s a small fraction of the 107 000 families apprehended in the last budget year which ended sept 30 associated press writers eric

for strong follow through buyers to take it decisively above 300 but at the same time the stock is also not attracting fresh sellers to drag it sharply lower this leaves the bias bullish the 21 day moving average at 289 is a key near term support as long as sbi trades above this support the possibility of the stock breaching the 300 302 support zone is high such a break will take the stock higher initially to 310 and 312 a further break above 312 can then target 320 and 322 as mentioned last week a crucial long term resistance is poised around 322 as such the price action around it will need a close watch to get a cue on the direction of the next move the near term view will turn negative if sbi declines decisively below 289 in such a scenario a fall to 282 or 280 is possible traders who have taken long positions above 294 can hold it with a stop loss at 282 move the stop loss higher to 301 as soon as the stock moves up to 307 book profits at 318 itc 280 7 itc was stuck in a sideways range between 277 and 284 last week the resistance at 284 is continuing to cap the upside for the third consecutive week a strong break above this hurdle is needed to ease the downside pressure for the stock such a break can take itc higher initially to 287 and 290 the next key resistance levels if itc manages to breach 290 decisively the stock can gain momentum and target 296 and 300 but a pull back from 290 can drag the stock lower to 285 and 280 again on the other hand if itc continues to trade below 284 in the coming days and declines below 277 it can test 275 and 274 the outlook will turn completely negative if the stock breaks decisively below 274 in such a scenario there is a strong likelihood of the stock tumbling towards 270 and 268 but the price action on the chart makes the bias bullish for itc to break above 284 medium term investors who have taken long positions at 282 and 278 can hold it retain the stop loss at 262 infosys 660 7 infosys seems to be lacking strength the stock inched up in the initial part of the week but failed to sustain higher infosys made an intraweek high of 677 and came off sharply giving up almost all the gains made during the week the near term outlook is unclear the 200 day moving average at 650 is a crucial support to watch out for if infosys manages to sustain above this support a bounce to 675 and 680 is possible in the near term a strong break above 680 will ease the downside pressure and take the stock higher to 700 and 710 levels thereafter the region around 710 is a significant resistance a strong break and a decisive close above 710 is needed to turn the outlook completely to positive such a break will then pave way for the next targets of 750 and 760 on the other hand if infosys declines decisively below the 200 day moving average it can come under renewed pressure in such a scenario a fall initially to 630 can be seen a further break below 630 can then drag the stock lower to 600 and 590 ril 1 099 ril has been stuck in a sideways range between 1 050 and 1 150 over the last one month within this range the stock fell 2 per cent in the past week a breakout on either side of 1 050 or 1 150 will determine the direction of the next move the 200 day moving average support is at 1 069 a decisive close below this support will increase the possibility of the stock declining below 1 050 a break below 1 050 will take ril initially lower to 1 020 a further break below 1 020 will then increase the possibility of the stock tumbling towards 900 or even 980 thereafter on the other hand if ril sustains above the 200 day moving average support the bias will remain positive a strong break above 1 150 will ease the downside pressure the next targets are 1 190 and 1 200 a strong break above 1 200 will turn the outlook to positive and will pave way for a revisit of 1 250 and 1 300 medium term investors can hold the long positions taken at 1 125 and 1 095 retain the stop loss at 1 025 tata steel 487 7 tata steel tumbled 5 per cent last week the sharp fall last week indicates that the long term downtrend in the stock is intact though there is a support near current levels at 480 tata steel looks vulnerable to break below it a break below 480 can take the stock lower to 460 a further break below 460 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its fall to 430 cluster of significant supports are poised in the broad 460 430 region there is a strong likelihood of the current downtrend halting in this support zone a strong upward reversal from this 460 430 support zone could be a good buying opportunity for investors with a long term perspective as such the price action around the 460 430 support zone will need a close watch to get a cue on the next trend on the other hand if tata steel sustains above 480 a bounce to 500 or 510 can be seen but the upside is likely to be capped as fresh sellers are likely to emerge at higher levels 9 00 am index outlook the third quarter earnings season to kick off this week could lend direction to the market macro economic data and rupee movement will also be keenly watched strong december jobs report also lifted

the gap in both income and wealth continues to grow sparking political backlash around the globe is it also becoming a drag on growth human beings have collectively generated an enormous amount of wealth in the past 20 years most of that newly generated wealth has gone to those who already possessed great wealth this has been particularly acute in developed countries does it matter very paradoxically despite all the discussion of inequality from davos all the way to social forums and political debates when you look at policies nothing has really happened in the rich countries to reduce inequality says branko milanovic professor at the stone center on socio economic inequality at the graduate center of the city university of new york if anything milanovic adds policies such as the new tax rules in the us or france s labor market reforms do just the opposite they help the rich get richer kindled by the great recession of 2007 08 and thomas piketty s astonishing trove of new data and analysis the two pronged issue of income and wealth inequality has taken center stage in the past decade yet remains mired in debate lately the conversation has acquired a new urgency since a wave of political surprises the uk s brexit the elections of donald trump viktor orbán rodrigo duterte and jair bolsonaro and the uprising of france s gilets jaunes yellow vests to name a few began uprooting entrenched political alliances and threatening the established order inequality is an issue charged with political and social judgment calls the acceptable level of inequality is a political choice that differs from nation to nation and from era to era some argue that recent political upheavals are the frantic last gasps of globalization s losers who must adapt or die as silicon valley likes to put it yet many have started to see this as an emerging economic problem rather than a healthy natural stimulus wondering as gdp seems stuck despite unprecedented credit availability and multnationals awash in cash buy back stock rather than investing for the future has inequality itself become a drag on growth it is a difficult discussion with few standard metrics and a wide range of conditions on the ground from country to country should we measure inequality by the gap between rich and poor or should we focus on the living standards of the middle class do we celebrate that inequality has narrowed significantly in the middle east and somewhat in latin america or do we consider that these were the most unequal to start with despite advances the middle east currently has the highest gini coefficient a long established measure of inequality of any world region 0 69 followed by latin america 0 64 then by asia and the us both at 0 6 only europe has a gini number under 0 5 making it the world s most equal region furthermore focusing on inequality bypasses enormous and meaningful advances in the human condition in china and much of emerging market asia and africa for example the gdp pie has grown so large that the poorest citizens have a higher standard of living than 20 years ago even if they are getting an ever smaller share of that pie in sub saharan africa the middle 40 is taking home a fractionally larger share of national income than in 1984 while national incomes have grown significantly from 4 859 5 566 per adult to 5 900 per adult in cote d ivoire for example india 15 0 u s 5 1 asia 4 3 world 4 0 rural china 3 4 europe 2 6 france 2 3 latin america 1 9 china 1 8 sub saharan africa 0 6 middle east and north africa 3 0 source world inequality database in developed nations however those at the bottom as well as many in the middle have seen their standards of living slide non college educated white americans born in the 1960s are worse off than their peers born in the 1940s in many respects says mariacristina de nardi professor of macroeconomics at university college in london they face wages that are lower in real terms have shorter life expectancies and face higher medical expenses during retirement this is not the result of short run fluctuations it is a longer term shift de nardi who is conducting research while visiting the opportunity and inclusive growth institute at the minneapolis fed stresses that her opinions are entirely her own most developed economies face aging populations as declining birth rates usually go hand in hand with development japan recently demonstrated a new degree of openness to foreign workers to keep its economy humming in the us millennials laden with education debt are not buying homes and therefore not stocking them with dishwashers and refrigerators with predictable effects on the housing and durable goods markets early christmas shopping returns in europe prompted several fashion chains and online retailers to warn of disappointing sales and a global index of retail stocks has fallen more than 17 since mid september business cannot thrive when consumers have no spending capacity janet yellen herself at a conference in boston in 2014 admitted that the past few decades of widening inequality can be summed up as significant income and wealth gains for those at the very top and stagnant living standards for the majority with respect to income some say inequality is a natural outcome of higher productivity those with the best abilities command a premium yet the evidence is thin the gap between the very high labor incomes and others is very difficult to explain says cuny s milanovic we really do not have an explanation for the rising education premium and especially for very high incomes at the very top of the earning distribution looking around the globe suggests other factors in the us for example the average ceo earns over 350 times more than the average worker that ratio is just 76 in israel 67 in japan and under 50 in denmark austria and poland according to a 2014 study by statista ceos in europe are not paid so much as they are in the us and this seems to be the result of cultural differences says ugo panizza pictet chair and professor of economics at the graduate institute of international and development studies in geneva we tend to think that rich people are lucky while americans tend to think that rich people are smart bottom 50 top 1 u s 3 2 5 5 china 4 1 4 2 france 1 5 1 6 u k 0 8 3 3 world 0 7 1 8 latin america 1 2 2 6 source world inequality database a turning point the watershed moment for global inequality was the 2008 financial crisis even though the crisis itself didn t cause soaring inequality inequality of income has been rising since before the global financial crisis since at least the 1990s says paul donovan global chief economist for ubs wealth management however income inequality was hidden by the availability of credit when banks subsequently froze up and stopped lending the loss of credit donovan explains brought on a very sudden realization about what inequality was doing and political backlash but more than the credit crunch the fed s policy of quantitative easing qe adopted by other central banks notably in europe added fuel to the fire boosting the wealth of the wealthy even as workers saw their capacity to save diminish nomi prins a financial industry observer and fellow at demos noted in a recent commentary pumped into financial markets that money sent stock prices soaring which naturally ballooned the wealth of the small percentage of the population that actually owned stocks at the same time she pointed out actual economic growth simply didn t materialize at the levels promised growth in the us averaged less than 2 per year through the past decade according to imf data compared to more than 3 annually in the decade to 2008 the same story played out in most of the developed world and many emerging markets as well capital sought higher and faster returns than could be achieved in crucial infrastructure or social strengthening projects like building roads high speed railways hospitals or schools she notes in the us stock buybacks are part of that picture foreign earnings that were repatriated in recent years were spent shoring up stock prices rather than investing in plants equipment or r d yet inequality of income may not be the biggest problem more unequal than income distribution is often wealth distribution says alberto bisin an economics professor at new york university even in a country such as sweden where a large set of active redistribution policies creates a more equal distribution of income wealth is skewed france for example is a relatively equal country with a gini coefficient of 32 7 in 2015 according to the st louis federal reserve that is likely due in to the country s strong social safety net but in 1984 the poorest half of the population held 9 of national wealth the middle 40 held 41 and the richest 10 owned 50 by 2014 the poorest held only 6 3 the middle class only 38 4 while the richest 10 held 55 3 of wealth the figures are similar but more extreme for most nations a compounding problem the wealth gap is compounded because wealth begets more wealth richer people get on average higher returns on their assets says bisin who co authored a study titled wealth distribution and social mobility a quantitative analysis of u s data they have more information and better tools according to his research investors in the top 1 of wealth in the us get about 1 more than average returns compounded over the years this makes an important difference says bisin adding that this situation would improve with some form of wealth taxation some government policies in the us and elsewhere have excerbated income and wealth inequality by encouraging monopolies monopsonies and anti competitive practices the extension of intellectual property rights such as those on drug patents for example locks up value in profit seeking schemes licensing requirements have been extended into more professions and sectors beauticians in the us or retail in europe for example limiting opportunities for business startups wealth inequality is too high and at least in part due to monopoly rents says bisin the economy would work better in terms of future ability to grow if these rents were taxed yet there are those who don t see inequality as a problem to solve i do not think that we should fight inequality per se necessarily says de nardi i think that we should fight poverty and help people who have fewer opportunities starting very early in life meanwhile the skills of the currently unemployed continue to atrophy while their capacity to consume is diminished a double whammy for growth and productivity a 2005 study by sarah voitchovsky titled does the profile of income inequality matter for economic growth shows that inequality at the bottom of society poverty of education resources and opportunities tends to delay a nation s economic growth at davos for 10 years they ve been saying that the major issue is inequality but nothing has ever been done says milanovic people who are there are of course themselves large contributors to that inequality this is paradoxical and bizarre on several levels maybe this year will be different
many economists view the change in china s reserves as a gauge of the people s bank of china s pboc intervention in the foreign exchange market to support the yuan exchange rate by selling foreign assets and buying the yuan china s foreign exchange reserves its accumulation of assets valued in foreign currencies rose by us 11 billion in december to us 3 073 trillion according to data released on monday slightly above median forecast of us 3 072 trillion in a bloomberg survey china s foreign exchange reserves rose modestly in december for the second consecutive month as sentiment about the yuan exchange rate remained stable the fact that the reserves remained above the psychologically important us 3 trillion level over the past year suggests that any pboc intervention remained small over the period they said capital economics estimated capital outflows at about us 25 billion last month showing little change from november the people s bank of china in beijing photo reuters the yuan depreciated sharply against the us dollar last year up until november and for the whole of 2018 the yuan was down 5 7 per cent due to worries of the negative impact on the economy from the trade war with the united states foreign exchange reserves fell us 67 24 billion in the whole of 2018 against a gain of us 129 4 billion in 2017 the yuan s steep slide against the us dollar for most of 2018 came to an abrupt halt in november possibly as a prerequisite for a trade deal with the united states before the march 1 deadline analysts said to curb yuan depreciation pressure the pboc deployed other currency management tools without having to burn through its foreign exchange reserves such as capital controls and the use of its countercyclical factor in calculating the midpoint of the yuan s allowed daily trading range the central bank also used moral suasion to guide market expectations and last month it reiterated its promise that it would keep the yuan basically stable at a reasonable and balanced level it is now widely accepted by the market that the yuan will not be allowed to get out of control this is really quite an achievement for the pboc and the nation s foreign exchange reserves are stabilising as a result said nathan chow an economist at dbs bank on monday the yuan was changing hands at 6 8502 per dollar unexpectedly rising 0 28 per cent even though the pboc cut commercial banks reserve requirement ratio on friday recent declines in us treasury yields and the us dollar amid signs that the us federal reserve may consider a pause in its interest rate increase path which has provided room for the pboc to ease monetary policy without creating sharp depreciation pressure on the yuan aidan yao senior emerging asia economist at axa investment managers expects another three reserve ratio cuts this year to help offset growing economic headwinds given the outlook for further monetary policy easing this year china s onshore bond market is poised for another rise this year analysts said chinese bonds were the second best performer among nine asian bonds in 2018 generating an investment return of 1 0 per cent according to jpmorgan the best performer was the south korean bond market which returned 1 1 per cent china s monetary policy easing was the main driver in the onshore bond market in 2018 said jason pang fixed income portfolio manager at jpmorgan policy is likely to keep its dovish bias which is supportive of the onshore bond market bonds could potentially rally further in 2019 or at least stay rangebound photo ap moreover chinese government bonds continue to be favoured by foreign investors with their upcoming inclusion in major global bond indices starting from april analysts said foreign investors raised their holdings of chinese bonds significantly in december as monetary policy easing by the central bank boosted investment returns overseas funds added 82 7 billion yuan us 12 billion in onshore bonds in december the second largest monthly increase since data became available in 2014 bringing total foreign holdings at the end of the month to 1 5 trillion yuan us 218 36 billion according to the china

onshore bonds in the jpmorgan government bond emerging market index and the ftse russell world government bond index is expected to take place in 2020 becky liu china head of macro strategy at standard chartered bank estimated that full inclusion in all three indices would bring in a total us 286 billion in passive inflows as investors balance their portfolios to include chinese bonds in

this piece is a response to paygo is based on a fallacy and the best way to argue against paygo developing countries trade deficits are the product of fundamental economic shortcomings themselves often a legacy of colonial rule the rising popularity of modern monetary theory mmt has inevitably brought misconceptions critics across the political spectrum often claim that mmters want sovereign governments to just print money with no concern for the national debt or as max b sawicky suggests inflation some especially on the right point to venezuela and zimbabwe as classic cases of hyperinflation but mmt points to a different primary cause of inflation in developing countries not domestic spending but foreign debt and a resulting lack of monetary sovereignty a country has full monetary sovereignty when it has its own national currency that is not fixed to the value of gold or another nation s currency it uses that currency to impose taxes fees and fines and all its debt is payable in that currency countries that meet these criteria like the united states and japan face no external constraints on government spending as pavlina r tcherneva explains the risk of inflation remains under control so long as government spending does not outpace the economy s real productive capacity the availability of physical resources skilled labor equipment and technical know how for developing countries the problem begins with trade deficits and resulting debt owed in foreign currencies those deficits are the product of fundamental economic shortcomings themselves often a legacy of colonial rule postcolonial countries are typically unable to produce enough food and energy to meet domestic need and they face structural industrial and technological deficiencies because of this they must import food and energy along with essential manufacturing inputs for example venezuela lacks refining capacity so while it exports crude oil it must import more expensive refined oil contributing to trade deficits importing more than they export causes these countries currencies to depreciate relative to major currencies with a weaker currency new imports like food fuel and medicine become relatively more expensive this imbalance is the real driver of inflation and often of social and political unrest the international monetary fund imf historically steps in at this point with emergency loans coupled with painful austerity measures to get out of imf conditions even progressive policymakers typically prioritize acquiring foreign currency reserves in order to honor external debt payments they promote tourism tourists bring foreign currency and design agricultural and manufacturing policies to support export industries meanwhile industries that would build self sufficiency and thus fix the trade imbalance like food crops for domestic consumption receive little government support all of this decreases self sufficiency and reinforces the dependence on foreign goods that caused the debt in the first place most developing countries looking for foreign currency also open their economies to investment from foreign corporations agreeing to low environmental standards weak labor regulations and tax exemptions going deeper in the hole so what would an mmt informed solution look like to help developing countries regain monetary policy and their ability to spend on domestic priorities the goal is to reduce imports secure a favorable trade balance and pay off their debts so countries would focus on the root causes of trade deficits invest in sustainable agricultural practices like aquaponics to restore food sovereignty build renewable energy like solar to secure energy sovereignty and invest in education and research and development to increase productivity and gain the ability to manufacture more valuable products such development would also increase the real productive capacity of the economy meaning that governments would have more room to spend before inflation by illuminating the origins of postcolonial economic struggles mmt shows us how to overcome them
twenty years ago on jan 1 1999 the euro was launched with the highest of political and economic expectations today its 20th anniversary is being commemorated amid deep disappointment across europe at both its economic and political results this has to raise questions anew as to whether the euro might have been fatally flawed from the start and whether it is likely to survive the next global economic downturn mosads the euro s architects had high hopes that its launch would substantially improve europe s economic prospects by minimizing transactions costs it was hoped that the introduction of a single currency would promote intra european trade it was also hoped that by increasing competition among member states the euro would force countries in the eurozone s periphery to radically reform their unproductive economies beyond providing economic advantages the euro s architects hoped that it would promote deeper european political integration and institution building they also hoped that it would constitute a challenge to the u s dollar s dominance as the world s international reserve currency it would be an understatement to say that the euro has not delivered on its economic promises especially since the 2008 lehman brothers crisis whereas over the past decade the u s economy has grown by some 15 percent the overall eurozone economy has barely recovered its pre crisis 2008 peak level meanwhile far from narrowing the economic disparity between the eurozone s prosperous north and its sclerotic south those disparities have been increased as an example while germany s economy is now some 10 percent above its pre 2008 crisis peak the italian economy remains around 5 percent below its peak this is not to mention the greek economy which is barely recovering from an economic depression that has been worse than that experienced by the u s in the 1930s as to the hope that the euro project might have promoted political unity and harmony it would seem that it has done just the opposite those countries in the eurozone s economic periphery deeply resent the austerity that has been imposed on them by the prosperous north in general and by germany in particular they blame that austerity for their poor economic performance at the same time those countries in the prosperous north have grown increasingly resentful of having to bail out a european economic periphery that they believe has been too slow to reform its wayward economic ways more disturbing yet especially since 2008 europe s poor economic performance has undermined public confidence in europe s political elite thereby contributing to a wave of populism across the continent most recent examples of this populist trend have been the rise of the yellow vest movement in france the coming to power of the five star movement and of the league in italy and the waning of angela merkel s political star in germany in the run up to the euro s 1999 launch american economists like milton friedman and martin feldstein presciently warned of the great risks of attempting economic union before attaining political union they also noted that the eurozone was not an optimum currency area especially in the sense that it lacked labor mobility or a centralized fiscal authority to make it work over the past decade the eurozone s experience has also underlined the inevitable tensions that would rise from locking in a monetary union a country like italy that had a poor productivity record with a productivity powerhouse like germany without the ability now to regain competitiveness through currency devaluation italy was bound to progressively lose competitiveness to germany which in turn was bound to result in disparate economic performance between those two countries the fundamental flaws in the euro currency arrangement which became all too apparent during the eurozone sovereign debt crisis have been papered over to date by the forceful action of the european central bank ecb in mid 2012 at the peak of the crisis the ecb declared that it would do whatever it takes to keep the euro from failing it backed up this statement by action first by the introduction of an outright monetary transaction program and then by a massive round of quantitative easing sadly a number of countries in the eurozone periphery and most disturbingly italy did not take advantage of a favorable global economic environment to reform their economies or to reduce their excessively high public debt levels mossecondads this leaves those economies very vulnerable to another round of the debt crisis in the event of another global economic recession this would seem to be particularly the case now that the ecb has ended its bond buying program and now that resistance is growing in germany to any future bailout programs for countries in the eurozone periphery one has to doubt whether the euro s architects would have launched the single currency in 1999 had they known as we know today how troubling the eurozone s economic and political developments would have been over the subsequent two decades with little reason to believe that there will be a material change in the eurozone s economic and political developments in the years to come there is strong reason to doubt that the euro will make it in its present form to its next 10 year anniversary desmond lachman is a

by benjamin cohen with equities slumping exchange rate volatility increasing and political risks intensifying financial markets around the world have hit a during times like these international investors generally grow cautious and prioritize safety over returns so money flees to safe havens that can provide secure liquid investment grade assets on a sufficiently large scale but there are no obvious safe havens today for the first time in living memory investors lack a quiet port where they can find shelter from the storm historically the safe haven par excellence was the united states in the form of treasury bonds backed by the full faith and credit of the us government as one investment strategist put it back in 2012 when people are worried all road lead to treasuries the bursting of the us real estate bubble in 2007 offers a case in point no one doubted that the us was the epicenter of the global financial crisis but rather than flee the us capital actually flooded into it in the last three months of 2008 net purchases of us assets reached a half trillion dollars three times more than that of the preceding nine months combined to be sure some of these dollar claims were due to the fact that foreign banks and institutional investors needed greenbacks to cover their funding needs after interbank and other wholesale short term markets seized up but that was hardly the only reason why portfolio managers piled into the us much of the increased demand was due to sheer fear at a time when nobody knew how bad things might get the us was widely seen as the safest bet but this was before the arrival us president donald trump who has managed to undermine confidence in the dollar to an unprecedented degree in addition to abandoning any notion of fiscal responsibility trump has spent his first two years in office attacking international institutions and picking fights with us allies to be sure even before trump confidence in the dollar suffered a blow in 2011 when standard poor s downgraded treasury securities by one notch in response to a near shutdown of the us government that episode was triggered by a standoff between then president barack obama and congressional republicans over a routine proposal to raise the federal debt ceiling today however investors have even more reason to worry about the us government s credit rating in 2018 alone the us government was shut down three times and it remains in a partial shutdown to this day owing to trump s demand for funds to build a big beautiful wall on the border with mexico where can investors go if not the us the eurozone might seem like a logical alternative after the dollar the euro is the world s most widely used currency and taken together the capital markets of the eurozone s 19 member states are close in size to the us market but europe has troubles of its own economic growth is slowing not least in germany and the risk of a banking crisis in italy the eurozone s fourth largest economy looms on the horizon worse still is the uncertainty over brexit which could prove highly disruptive if the united kingdom crashes out of the european union without a divorce agreement needless to say britain too can be ruled out as a safe haven at least until the brexit fiasco is resolved what about the swiss franc though its attractions are obvious switzerland s financial markets are simply too small to serve as an adequate substitute for the us that leaves japan with its abundant supply of government bonds it is the biggest single market for public debt outside the us the question for portfolio managers though is whether it is really safe to invest in a country where government debt exceeds 230 of gdp for comparison the public debt to gdp ratio in the us is around 88 and even in troubled italy it is no more than 130 admittedly the market for japanese government debt is more stable than most owing to the fact that much of it is held by domestic savers which is to say it is safely tucked under the mattress but japan is an aging country with an economy that has remained almost stagnant for a quarter century investors would be right to wonder where it will find the resources to continue servicing its massive debt overhang and then there is china with the world s third largest national market for public debt certainly the supply of assets in china is ample but the chinese market is so tightly controlled that it is essentially the opposite of a safe haven it will be a long time before global investors even consider putting much faith in chinese securities with secure ports becoming scarce investors will become increasingly jittery they will be inclined to move funds at the slightest sign of danger which will add substantially to market volatility today s rough patch is probably here to stay benjamin j cohen is professor of international political economy at the university of california santa barbara and is the author of currency

general news of monday 7 january 2019 source ghananewsagency org ghana returned to constitutional rule and multi party democracy after a topsy turvy eight military regimes from 1966 to 1982 without any clear sense of direction for her political and socio economic development therefore the 1992 constitution which came into effect on january 7 1993 provided the nation a sovereign document and clear direction for organising a democratic state the country adopted a unitary republic with sovereignty residing in the people and designed to ensure probity accountability and the rule of law as well as ensuring power sharing among the three arms of government namely the executive legislative and judiciary the 1992 constitution reflected the lessons learnt from the previous constitutions of ghana including the 1957 1960 1969 and 1979 and also incorporated some provisions and institutions drawn from british and united states constitutional style flight lieutenant jerry john rawlings a retired air force pilot who for 10 years presided over the provisional national defence council pndc won the 1992 presidential elections and was subsequently sworn into office on january 7 1993 most ghanaians remember former president rawlings for his charisma championing the principles of discipline probity and accountability who led the economic recovery programme during his 10 years as the head of state under the pndc administration and eight years as the first president under the fourth republican constitutional dispensation however his critics believed he rawlings presided over a society characterised by so many human rights abuses and atrocities while freedom of expression by the media the judiciary and other members of the public were trampled upon with impunity though there were others who credited rawlings for championing media pluralism in the country and allowing the establishment of private radio and television stations after serving two terms in office president rawlings handed over political power to john agyekum kufuor on january 7 2001 former president kufuor popularly known as the gentle giant became the second president under the fourth republic after emerging victorious in the 2000 presidential polls he was sworn into office on january 7 2001 marking the first peaceful democratic transition of political power in ghana since independence in 1957 president kufuor was fondly remembered by many for his courageous decision to take ghana to the highly indebted poor country initiative which was intended to cancel the country s foreign debts restore the national economy and put it on the path of growth he introduced some programmes under the five priority areas including the pursuit of good governance modernisation of agriculture for rural development private sector development enhanced social services and vigorous infrastructure development it was during the administration of president kufuor that the private sector was touted as the engine of growth and created the private sector initiatives for cassava and palm nut plantations which was to harness the creativity and the entrepreneurial spirit of the ghanaian for wealth creation and prosperity for all president kufuor extended credit to small scale businesses and made the realisation of all inclusive government possible by appointing dr paa kwesi nduom the then member of the convention people s party cpp and alhaji inusa of the people s national convention pnc into his government he also introduced the metro mass transport system the national health insurance scheme the development of model senior high schools the school feeding programme and the livelihood empowerment against poverty leap after serving two terms in office president j a kufuor bowed out of the political scene as the constitution of ghana demanded the ghanaian electorate through the ballot box voted in professor john evans atta mills popularly known as asomdwee hene into power as the third president of the fourth republic ghanaians liked him for his godly character and humility which resonated through his speeches and relationship with his fellow ghanaians president atta mills showed his godly character by defiantly declaring to the western countries that ghana would not legalise homosexuality with his vast knowledge in taxation president atta mills introduced economic programmes and policies which reduced inflation to a single digit ensured a stable currency and increased the country s economic growth rate to 14 per cent in 2011 and ghana started producing crude oil in commercial quantities after president prof atta mills sudden demise in 2012 his vice john dramani mahama was sworn in as president and led the country into peaceful election on december 7 2012 which he eventually won president mahama who continued the policies and programmes of his predecessor steered the country to achieve some successes including infrastructural development such as construction of roads community senior high schools health facilities electrification projects and respect for the rule of law however his administration witnessed prolonged electricity crisis otherwise known as dumsor leading to the collapse of some businesses and allegations of corruption by members of his government ghanaians eventually voted against him in the 2016 general election and ushered in the nana addo dankwa akufo addo led government into office on january 7 2017 nana akufo addo came into power on the back of many juicy promises which were outlined in the npp manifesto including the one district one factory one constituency one million cedis one village one dam free senior high school policy intention to create jobs for the numerous unemployed youth stimulus package for collapsing but viable businesses protecting the public purse and fight corruption nana akufo addo reiterated his intention to fulfil those promises during his inaugural address on january 7 2017 and gave the assurance that he would not disappoint ghanaians at the 72nd session of the united nations general assembly in new york usa last year president akufo addo told the world that ghana was determined to realise her potentials and ensuring a prosperous nation he said we want to build an economy that is not dependent on charity and hand outs but we want to build an economy that looks past primary commodity and position our country in a global market place we re not disclaiming aid but we do want to discard the mind set of dependency and living on hand outs we want to build a ghana beyond aid president akufo addo named his ministers and other appointees in record time but some ghanaians lambasted the government for appointing 110 ministers which is the highest number in any of the fourth republic government the government witnessed some tough moments with some members of the ruling party the invincible forces attacking some government appointees in an act of political vigilantism which created insecurity in the country and painted a bad picture of the country in the eyes of the international community government took a bold step to clamp down on illegal small scale mining otherwise known as galamsey leading to a six month moratorium on all operations of small scale mining in view of the environmental devastation the phenomenon had caused to vegetation and water bodies the akufo addo led government rolled out its economic policy and budget statement in march 2017 which planned to stabilise the local currency reduce inflation undertake debts profiling and ensure stable macroeconomic indicators that would create conducive environment for doing business government announced some tax cuts for businesses in the budget it also rolled out its flagship free shs policy on september 13 2017 which saw government footing the bills of over 360 000 bece candidates who qualified for admission into senior high school the government also re introduced the teacher and nursing trainee allowances paperless ports programme e registration of businesses national property addressing system and e licensing of vehicles and started putting structures in place to roll out the national identification system the finance minister ken ofori atta announced in the 2018 budget in november last year that government had chalked some successes in managing the economy in 2017 with the gdp growth pegged around 7 8 per cent from 3 6 in 2016 reduction of the policy rate from 26 per cent to 20 reduction of inflation from 15 4 per cent to 11 7 per cent as of september mr ofori atta indicated that the country s debt stock had reduced from 73 per cent to gdp to 68 3 as of september 2017 the fiscal deficit which in 2016 was around 9 3 is projected around 6 3 per cent by the end of 2017 however dr eric osei assibey an economist and senior lecturer at the university of ghana told the gna that the programmes instituted by government was brilliant but the approach it was using to address graduate unemployment would be problematic in the long term he therefore urged government to expand the local economy and provide more incentives to the private sector to expand in order to absorb the unemployed graduates and add value to the country s primary commodities locally instead of exporting them abroad he said government should look at innovative ways of generating enough revenue within since budget support from donors had dwindled considerably therefore government should be more aggressive in domestic revenue mobilisation dr kwabena opuni frimpong the general secretary of the christian council of ghana also asked government to come clear on how it would ensure sustainable funding of its flagship programmes such as the free shs one constituency one million ghana cedis and the one district one dam among other promises it made in the 2016 election dr vladimir antwi danso a researcher and expert on governance issues asked government to enforce discipline in the country adding that ghanaians have high expectations and would not take any excuses from the government it is our fervent hope that the government would mobilise resources from both within and outside as well as adding value to the country s primary commodities so that ghana would work again and create the needed jobs for the teeming unemployed youth and ensure prosperity for all he said

let us begin the week with some good news for the central bank from the land of the rising sun or nihon that is that the nikkei 225 equity index rallied strongly this morning and its 2 44 surge saw it regain the 20 000 level and close at 20 038 the bank of japan will be pleased on two counts of which the first is the wealth effects it will expect from a higher equity market the second is that it will improve its own position as what we have labelled the tokyo whale the bank of japan s purchases of exchange traded funds since the start of 2018 exceeded 6 trillion yen 53 billion on tuesday reaching a record high on a yearly basis and signaling the central bank has been increasingly exposed to riskier assets the mainichi for newer readers the bank of japan has been buying japanese equities for around 5 years and has been doing so on an increasing scale under governor haruhiko kuroda the boj announced aggressive monetary stimulus in 2013 aimed at breaking japan s economy out of its deflationary malaise the measures included increasing the central bank s holdings of etfs by an annual 1 trillion yen which it expanded to 3 trillion yen in 2014 and again to 6 trillion yen in 2016 the name tokyo whale came about because as you can see it found the need to keep increasing the size of the purchases as the expect results did not materialise this meant that it cannot keep this going for much longer as it will run out of equity etfs to buy why does it buy them well the bit below hints at it etfs allow investors to buy and sell exposure to a basket of equities or an index without owning the underlying shares so the bank of japan can avoid claims it is explicitly investing in the companies concerned or if you like is a passive fund manager those of you who recall the media claims last autumn that the bank of japan was in the process of conducting a tapering of its purchases will find the bit below familiar the purchases have been criticized by some as artificially buoying stock prices leading the boj in july this year to give itself more flexibility by saying it may increase or decrease the amount of purchases depending on market conditions the tokyo whale bought more and not less as the 24 000 or so of late summer was replaced by the current level purchases of the investment funds swelled as the boj stepped in to underpin the stock market which in october suffered huge losses amid concerns over heightened trade tensions between the united states and china if we step back and wonder what influence this has been then this from the tokyo whale itself hardly provides much support a challenge lies in the household sector in that the mechanism of the virtuous cycle from income to consumption expenditure has been operating weakly money supply we have been observing for some months now that many countries have had lower money supply growth which has then led to lower economic growth so as you can imagine i was waiting for the monetary base data released today what we see is that the monetary base in japan grew by 17 in 2017 but by a much lower 7 3 in 2018 and the annual rate in the month of december was only 4 8 quite remarkably there were spells in december when the monetary base actually fell that begs a question about this the bank of japan will conduct money market operations so that the monetary base will increase at an annual pace of about 80 trillion yen as ever in japan picking one s way through this is complex as we arrive at what i think is the largest number we have noted on here you see the japanese monetary base which is some 504 2 trillion ten has been pumped up so much by the bank of japan the annual rate of growth could not be kept up for a start there was the issue of how many bonds and the like have already been bought the boj s balance sheet after all reached a dubious milestone in 2018 when it topped japan s 4 87 trillion of annual gross domestic product nikkei asian review rather oddly the nar then tells us this the boj could easily buy more government debt and etfs actually there are not many etfs left to buy and the bank of japan itself is seeing dissent against the current level of purchases that is not to say that the bank of japan could not use other methods as it has shown itself willing to buy pretty much anything if we move to the wider liquidity measure of the bank of japan we see that the rate of growth was 3 5 in november 2017 but only 1 8 this november thus both the bass line and the drumbeat from the monetary system are not only the same but they are a 2018 theme because of the different nature of the japanese system it is hard to be precise about any likely effect because all the expansion seemed to have only a minor upwards effect but one would expect that to now disappear oh and my largest number did not last long as japanese liquidity is 1788 5 trillion yen the yen it was only last week that we were mulling the flash rally in the yen as yet another weak period for equity markets saw a yen for yen a combination of thin markets and a japanese bank holiday saw the yen strengthen into the high 104s versus the us dollar i am told that exited some of the hedges placed by japanese exporters but there was no sign of the bold action often promised by the bank of japan things are now calmer and the yen is at 108 but even that is higher over time and that has been against a relatively strong us dollar as the nar points out this will not be welcomed by the japanese authorities the central problem is that japan s economic growth relies largely a weak yen and its capacity to boost exports though prime minister shinzo abe talked grandly about structural reform the yen s 30 drop beginning in late 2012 was the fuel behind the 12 quarter run of growth japan experienced until its july september stumble comment the tokyo whale faces quite a few problems right now for example the third quarter of 2018 showed something it has claimed was temporary quarter on quarter gdp shrank a real 0 6 percent downgraded from the earlier reading of a 0 3 percent contraction the japan times according to the markit business survey there was a bounce back from earlier today positive survey data from the manufacturing sector were not mirrored by japan s dominant service providing industry in december where business activity increased at the weakest pace since may if the natural disaster hit september is discounted the survey also pointed to abating demand pressures as private sector sales increased only mildly on the month but then we will expect to see the impact of slowing money supply growth so 2019 may see the tokyo whale do this as we wait to see how those who have presented abenomics as a triumph deal with elvis costello being number one again she s been a bad girl she s like a chemical though you try to stop it she s like a narcotic you want to torture her you want to talk to her all the things you bought for her putting up your temperature pump it up until you can feel it pump it up when you don t really need it meanwhile here is my podcast from last week with covers my thoughts on how japan has survived the lost decade s

economy out of its deflationary malaise the measures included increasing the central bank s holdings of etfs by an annual 1 trillion yen which it expanded to 3 trillion yen in 2014 and again to 6 trillion yen in 2016 the name tokyo whale came about because as you can see it found the need to keep increasing the size of the purchases as the expect results did not materialise this meant that it cannot keep this going for much longer as it will run out of equity etfs to buy why does it buy them well the bit below hints at it etfs allow investors to buy and sell exposure to a basket of equities or an index without owning the underlying shares so the bank of japan can avoid claims it is explicitly investing in the companies concerned or if you like is a passive fund manager those of you who recall the media claims last autumn that the bank of japan was in the process of conducting a tapering of its purchases will find the bit below familiar the purchases have been criticized by some as artificially buoying stock prices leading the boj in july this year to give itself more flexibility by saying it may increase or decrease the amount of purchases depending on market conditions the tokyo whale bought more and not less as the 24 000 or so of late summer was replaced by the current level purchases of the investment funds swelled as the boj stepped in to underpin the stock market which in october suffered huge losses amid concerns over heightened trade tensions between the united states and china if we step back and wonder what influence this has been then this from the tokyo whale itself hardly provides much support a challenge lies in the household sector in that the mechanism of the virtuous cycle from income to consumption expenditure has been operating weakly money supply we have been observing for some months now that many countries have had lower money supply growth which has then led to lower economic growth so as you can imagine i was waiting for the monetary base data released today what we see is that the monetary base in japan grew by 17 in 2017 but by a much lower 7 3 in 2018 and the annual rate in the month of december was only 4 8 quite remarkably there were spells in december when the monetary base actually fell that begs a question about this the bank of japan will conduct money market operations so that the monetary base will increase at an annual pace of about 80 trillion yen as ever in japan picking one s way through this is complex as we arrive at what i think is the largest number we have noted on here you see the japanese monetary base which is some 504 2 trillion ten has been pumped up so much by the bank of japan the annual rate of growth could not be kept up for a start there was the issue of how many bonds and the like have already been bought the boj s balance sheet after all reached a dubious milestone in 2018 when it topped japan s 4 87 trillion of annual gross domestic product nikkei asian review rather oddly the nar then tells us this we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us the boj could easily buy more government debt and etfs actually there are not many etfs left to buy and the bank of japan itself is seeing dissent against the current level of purchases that is not to say that the bank of japan could not use other methods as it has shown itself willing to buy pretty much anything if we move to the wider liquidity measure of the bank of japan we see that the rate of growth was 3 5 in november 2017 but only 1 8 this november thus both the bass line and the drumbeat from the monetary system are not only the same but they are a 2018 theme because of the different nature of the japanese system it is hard to be precise about any likely effect because all the expansion seemed to have only a minor upwards effect but one would expect that to now disappear oh and my largest number did not last long as japanese liquidity is 1788 5 trillion yen the yen it was only last week that we were mulling the flash rally in the yen as yet another weak period for equity markets saw a yen for yen a combination of thin markets and a japanese bank holiday saw the yen strengthen into the high 104s versus the us dollar i am told that exited some of the hedges placed by japanese exporters but there was no sign of the bold action often promised by the bank of japan things are now calmer and the yen is at 108 but even that is higher over time and that has been against a relatively strong us dollar as the nar points out this will not be welcomed by the japanese authorities the central problem is that japan s economic growth relies largely a weak yen and its capacity to boost exports though prime minister shinzo abe talked grandly about structural reform the yen s 30 drop beginning in late 2012 was the fuel behind the 12 quarter run of growth japan experienced until its july september stumble comment the tokyo whale faces quite a few problems right now for example the third quarter of 2018 showed something it has claimed was temporary quarter on quarter gdp shrank a real 0 6 percent downgraded from the earlier reading of a 0 3 percent contraction the japan times according to the markit business survey there was a bounce back from earlier today positive survey data from the manufacturing sector were not mirrored by japan s dominant service providing industry in december where business activity increased at the weakest pace since may if the natural disaster hit september is discounted the survey also pointed to abating demand pressures as private sector sales increased only mildly on the month but then we will expect to see the impact of slowing money supply growth so 2019 may see the tokyo whale do this as we wait to see how those who have presented abenomics as a triumph deal with elvis costello being number one again she s been a bad girl she s like a chemical though you try to stop it she s like a narcotic you want to torture her you want to talk to her all the things you bought for her putting up your temperature pump it up until you can feel it pump it up when you don t really need it meanwhile here is my podcast from last week with covers my thoughts on how japan has survived the lost decade s

while you are reading this the eskom sustainability task team appointed by the president on 15 december is very likely to be hard at work at producing a document by the 29 january deadline given some of the people appointed to the task team it is likely to be an excellent analysis and will also probably produce sensible recommendations but that being said and somewhat akin to the analysis of our educational outcomes following the release of the annual matric results there is a sense of déjà vu one is reminded of the film groundhog day it s about a cynical old tv weatherman sent against his will to some american village to report on the annual return of the groundhog if a groundhog emerges out of hibernation and sees its shadow it gets scared and runs back into its burrow supposedly predicting six more weeks of winter weather in the movie the weatherman played by bill murray finds himself in an endless loop where groundhog day is repeated no matter what he does stuck in this endless loop of one repeating day the weatherman realises that groundhog day may be his fate for eternity nevertheless after exploring his dark side the weatherman starts to become a better person and develop new skills living each repeated day more perfectly than the previous same day our researchers and experts in energy and education appear to be in the same loop every year they come with new deeper more detailed data and statistics better presented structured and even more persuasive than the previous year it is almost as if the researchers feel that somehow just somehow their work can eventually persuade policymakers to change course but very little does change actually the data presented from any previous year would have been sufficient but our politics makes change difficult so they relive their groundhog day every year we have long known what to do with eskom 2019 will be the 21st year that the 1998 white paper on energy policy was adopted by the government as official policy it proposed breaking up eskom and introducing competition it would be surprising if the task team departs in its long term recommendations from what should have occurred over two decades ago the task team s terms of reference include making proposals to resolve eskom s debt burden it was reported that a turn around plan presented by eskom s management included a r100 billion government bailout an analysis of eskom s financials strongly suggests that a massive bail out is now unavoidable eskom is no longer primarily an electricity sector problem it has become an enormous macroprudential problem a bailout that cuts into eskom s unaffordable debt overhang will certainly blow away commitments to reduce the country s own debt however a 20 year on year electricity price increases for the next three years will crush any prospects of an economic turn around and hasten our de industrialisation making even the government s existing indebtedness unsustainable besides price increases at the levels proposed will push large users in mining metallurgy and cement out of business and accelerate the switch to off grid alternatives by high income users in both the commercial and residential sectors there is another group of people at national treasury also hard at work on preparing the national budget by the time the state of the nation sona address is delivered at the beginning of february it needs to be largely complete any big bailout that the minister of finance will have to make a few weeks later will need to have been addressed in the sona inconveniently this year s sona is also in an election year up to now the indebtedness of eskom has been addressed mostly by debt guarantees provided to eskom listed in the budget contingent liabilities there is little discussion as to just how contingent those liabilities are the fact is that the guarantees provided to eskom are becoming more real this much was clear from eskom s interim financials it projects a loss of r15 billion and does not have the cash reserves to cover the loss it can t continue like this a cash strapped electricity utility creates all sorts of other risks most of us know what happens when we ourselves are cash strapped we put off doing the things that we know have to be done in the hope that we will address them when if better times return recent load shedding on eskom s own version is a result of unavailable resources to do proper maintenance on ageing equipment eskom is a textbook example of what goes wrong with monopolies settled economic theory shows that a monopoly produces at less than the efficient quantity and if it lobbies the government to keep it that way say via employing too many people or buying coal from politically favoured suppliers it creates a deadweight loss determining the price of supply is also very difficult there are no benchmarks or pricing signals it does not help that eskom has always operated under conditions of unusual secrecy compounding the monopoly problem is that eskom as an independent state owned company soc has sought to raise its debt to unsustainable levels using r350 billion government guarantee it has created a quasi deficit for the country without proper oversight making things worse is that as much as r150 billion of this debt is in foreign currency and eskom now has to provide its creditors with far better returns than the government provides to its own creditors this amounts to a free ride because eskom or our electricity system as a whole simply can t be allowed to default there will be a lot of suggestions on what to do next but it is now well past time to stop fooling ourselves that eskom s problems and its indebtedness can be traded out the focus should be on managing a bad situation as well as possible the eskom task team will have its own recommendation but here are some additional suggestions operational staff overhead eskom will have to address its cost overheads in the near term it needs to reduce its staff complement from 47 000 people to where it was in 2007 at around 36 000 people in doing so it will need to be sure that it does not lose the critical skills that it needs these critical skills might already have exited eskom and should be incentivised to return regularise the coal supply contracts eskom should be compelled to publish the details of every coal contract that it has and is planning to enter into and do so at the level of each power station at power station level daily information on stockpiles and outcomes of compliance testing should be published perhaps the monitoring of the performance of all coal suppliers could be done independently but certainly the quality and quantity of all coal delivered must be properly monitored eskom should always buy coal directly and not do so through intermediaries or traders where intermediaries are used they need to disclose their margins or commissions all future coal contracts or tenders must be published and every subsequent contract must be on the terms of the tender reprioritise decommissioning commissioning generating units all of eskom s power stations are bespoke builds each made up of six or more largely independent generating units years of poor maintenance has left them in a poor state the primary cause of recent load shedding instead of decommissioning at a power station level according to the age of the power station concerned decommissioning should be reprioritised at a unit level decommissioned units can then be a source of spare parts for functional units that remain we need a full technical assessment of medupi and kusile to figure out the extent of the multiple technical problems and what is salvageable any claims against any contractors should also be pursued with vigour some suppliers have already provisioned for these types of claims resuscitate eskom s internal market mechanism during the process of getting the ismo bill as far as parliament eskom implemented a comprehensive internal market in terms of which each generator would bid into the grid based on the pricing that it could offer this process determined the dispatch order of different generators based on their different cost and generating profiles these processes should be revived and the outcome of them made available to the public for further analysis and consideration structural restructure refinance eskom s debt it should be obvious that a focus on having eskom service its debt can no longer work eskom has both too much debt and the cost of that debt is too high and will get more expensive as it seeks to refinance this debt in the coming years having eskom pay a large premium for its debt over what the government pays makes no sense at all being so indebted prevents the other much needed and frankly inevitable structural reforms to our electricity supply industry from happening one way to do this although it appears at first to be a retrogressive step and it would be if done permanently is to de corporatise nationalise eskom and its debt if done sensibly and transparently it may even be seen as credit positive for the country a signal that the government is serious about fixing the biggest risk identified by the credit rating agencies even as national debt would be significantly increased align all capital expenditure to the integrated resource plan irp south africa undertakes its resource planning through an irp process which helps to plan what generation capacity should be added over different time periods the 2018 irp is near completion and once accepted by cabinet becomes official the 2018 irp proposes significant additions of renewables but these have to be accommodated by the grid to do this investments need to be made to enable the grid to utilise this capacity commence the process of separating generation transmission and distribution while re introducing the ismo bill and passing it into legislation is the existing plan it might be preferable to introduce a proper formal separation each generator operated separately would then have a stand alone management team and be subject to a power purchase agreement ppa with the national grid the national grid operating independently would be able to then enter into formal power purchase agreements with these generators and others contemplated by the irp processes the distribution side a part of the electricity system also suffering from years of under investment should be consolidated and ring fenced from local government budgets properly structured distributors will then be able to be primarily responsible for demand side management this includes shifting loads away from the peak periods through the time of use metering pricing frequency management as well as contracting generating or battery storage capacity to address frequency response and variable loads bring on the energy transition but make it just eskom s existing power plants are nearing the end of their useful lives the irp shows the energy mix that should replace this capacity and increase this capacity those most affected by this transition such as eskom employees and workers in the eskom supply chain including miners need viable employment alternatives for various reasons no renewables are planned for the mpumalanga region where most of eskom s power plants are situated this should change in terms of natural resources mpumalanga is nearly as good for renewables development as other areas but it has distinct advantages the density of the existing transmission infrastructure and the proximity to the largest load centres mpumalanga should immediately be declared a renewable energy zone just to replace eskom s capacity would require 2000mw 3000mw per annum of new build wind and solar pv rights to develop this replacement generation capacity could be allocated to a combination of eskom trade unions and local communities funding could be readily secured on the back of eskom as well as private power purchase agreements eskom as well as union pension funds could play leading roles in financing the replacement build supported by syndicated pension funds including the likes of those managed by the pic this alone would create significantly more relatively well paying jobs than currently exist an energy transition like this would also attract international funds that are mandated to invest in clean energy
inside the market s roundup of some of today s key analyst actions equity analysts at td securities made a number of changes to their ratings for canadian stocks on monday their moves were jonathan

ratings for five stocks while upgrading another in response to changes to the firm s commodity price deck our 2019 oil price forecast uses the forward strip pricing for the first two quarters of the year with a gradual improvement in the latter half of 2019 to reflect our revised 2020 assumption the analysts said in a research report this leads to the lowering of our wti crude oil price forecast for 2019 to us 50 75 bbl from us 72 50 bbl while lowering our 2020 expectation to us 60 00 bbl from us 72 50 bbl our 2019 wcs discount to wti assumption is reduced from an average of us 26 50 bbl to us 18 75 bbl our 2020 differential for the grade is marginally changed at us 22 00 bbl for edmonton par our differential forecast narrows from us 11 65 bbl to us 9 10 bbl in 2019 and is modestly widened from us 9 30 bbl to us 10 00 bbl in 2020 with the changes analyst nick lupick lowered cenovus energy cve t cve n to sector perform from outperform with a target of 13 50 from 18 50 the average on the street is 14 23 we continue to believe that cenovus leadership team is making all of the correct strategic decisions necessary to return the company into a free cash flowing entity with a normalized capital structure he said unfortunately however the 27 per cent reduction in our target price resulting from the change in the acc price deck has removed enough target price upside that it no longer warrants an outperform rating we add that we continue to believe that cenovus remains a strong holding for shareholders looking for leverage to a rising commodity price given its industry leading oil sands portfolio and limited downstream refining integration mr lupick also downgraded imperial oil ltd imo t to underperform from sector perform with a target of 20 50 from 22 the average is 42 78 while we acknowledge that imperial has begun to see measurable operational improvements at its kearl mine which we include in our forecasts given the stock s relative outperformance during q4 18 falling 18 per cent vs its peers at down 27 per cent and the 19 per cent reduction in our price target resulting from our revised price deck imperial s current share price relative to our target price no longer warrants it a sector perform rating he said investors seeking greater upside and a strong defence to the risk of widening domestic crude differentials we recommend investment in suncor he moved pengrowth energy corp pgf t to underperform from sector perform with a 75 cent target down from 1 25 and below the 80 cent average while we continue to believe that lindbergh is among the best thermal heavy oil assets in the basin competing with the economics of husky s lloydminster assets given the company s leverage the material reduction in our target price of 40 per cent resulting from our revised acc price deck the risk inherent with the capital structure and the limited implied target price upside of 12 per cent we no longer believe that a sector perform equity recommendation is warranted the analyst said thomas matthews dropped bonavista energy corp bnp t to underperform from sector perform with a target price of 90 cents falling from 1 75 the average is 1 50 headed into 2019 we had always assumed bonavista was going to maintain its core production base flat year over year resulting in a spending profile that was less than cash flow with money left over to repair its balance sheet said mr matthews we ve maintained this view however our 2019 pricing assumptions do not allow this flat drilling program to meaningfully pay down debt nor create meaningful pdp value given irr s are 10 35 per cent on a half cycle basis using our average type curve assumptions bonavista may prudently elect to drill its best acreage thus exceeding our type curve assumptions to ensure any capital allocated meets return hurdles however although this may maintain production with improved capital efficiencies in the near term this approach is unlikely to result in growth of its underlying pdp asset value per share net of debt which we feel is the ultimate driver of share price performance especially in light of reduced glj engineering pricing assumptions and an higher than average debt position given the commodity price headwinds foreseen in 2019 for producers with significant exposure to aeco pricing we feel bonavista will continue to fight corporate declines with a constrained cash flow neutral budget and as such have reduced our rating mr matthews also lowered gear energy ltd gxe t to sector perform from outperform with a 75 cent target from 1 35 the average is 1 29 although we were champions of gxe in mid 2018 for their efficiency and pdp value creation which was ultimately reflected in the share price our view at the time considered wti prices of more than 60 per barrel which our current forecasts don t call for until year end 2020 he said for this reason we are downgrading gear patrick o rourke lowered pine cliff energy ltd pne t to underperform from sector perform with a 20 cent target from 40 cents the average is 39 cents although management has done an excellent job in maximizing the value of the assets from an operational perspective and has achieved some market diversification from aeco with 49 per cent of gas priced outside of aeco in the near term ultimately the limited liquids pricing exposure combined with high aeco exposure drove our reduced target price he said the low production declines and required reinvestment capital would see pine cliff as a top choice for outperformance in the case of a surprise recovery in aeco prices conversely mr lupick upgraded encana corp eca t eca n to outperform from sector perform with a us 10 target down from us 13 50 while we continue to be uncertain as to what is core to the company having once again expanded its asset base to five operating basins from four the stock s underperformance since the announcement of its acquisition of newfield exploration has been jarring he said despite our punitive price target methodology described next encana has the highest implied target upside of any large cap entity under coverage at 61 per cent despite the reduction in our commodity price assumptions recall that we recently altered our price target methodology until further clarity on the company s strategy is outlined for investors namely what assets are core what is not and the pace of development for those which are core canaccord genuity analyst doug taylor lowered his rating for shares of quarterhill inc qtrh t qtrh q in response to uncertainty surrounding the ongoing litigation involving its wi lan business and apple inc aapl q in a statement released monday quarterhill said in a trial verdict rendered on august 1 2018 in the united states district court for the southern district of california a jury awarded wilan 145 1 million in damages against apple inc for infringement of wilan s u s patent nos 8 457 145 and 8 537 757 in a january 4 2019 ruling judge dana sabraw upheld the jury verdict that apple infringed the two wilan patents the court did not lower the damages award but did grant wilan the option to accept either reduced damages in the amount of 10 0 million or a new trial limited to determining the amount of damages only this ruling confirms infringement and the only issue between the parties remains damages prior to that announcement mr taylor moved the stock to hold from speculative buy based on the desire for more clarity and the go forward consolidation strategy for quarterhill given increasingly unpredictable results for its existing business it was reported by bloomberg on friday that a federal judge has cut the damages awarded to quarterhill s wi lan business in its suit against apple to us 10m from us 145m he said while it remains to be seen how wi lan will respond to this news accept the new amount or refight the damages portion of the suit we view this development as a slight negative despite a 9 per cent rise in the shares friday given renewed uncertainty in the amount and timing of collection we had previously included a steeply discounted 50 amount in our sum of the parts valuation his target fell to 1 50 from 2 the average is currently 2 27 the unpredictability of the wi lan business remains extreme and was again evidenced in friday s news the analyst said while the company intends to improve quarterly financial predictability through additional acquisitions of more stable businesses there has been no capital deployed to this end since april 2017 elsewhere cormark securities analyst gavin fairweather downgraded quarterhill to market perform from speculative buy with a target of 1 80 from 2 50 scotia capital analyst trevor turnbull updated his ratings for a group of gold equities on

2 target rising by a loonie but below the average of 3 05 bsr real estate investment trust hom u t is deploying its balance sheet capacity much more rapidly than expected according to industrial alliance securities analyst brad sturges who now sees its financial leverage employed falling below its long term target range mr sturges made the comments in response to bsr s us 42 5 million acquisition of a 334 unit multifamily apartment complex in grand prairie tex which was announced on dec 20 the deal is to funded by utilizing the reit s revolving credit facility including riverhill bsr s texas multifamily portfolio now represents 54 per cent of pro forma noi enhancing the reit s portfolio quality through increased portfolio exposure to larger us sunbelt apartment markets such as dallas fort worth tx 14 per cent of pro forma noi bsr foresees potential at riverhill to generate both organic rent growth and further rental income noi growth over time through moderate capital improvements such as suite upgrades and other property enhancements he added the transaction was financed through the reit s revolving credit facility increasing bsr s debt to gross book value gbv assets ratio on an ifrs basis to 49 per cent on a pro forma basis slightly below its long term target range of 50 per cent to 55 per cent based on a 52 5 per cent financial leverage ratio the mid point of the reit s long term target range bsr s remaining acquisition capacity is estimated to be 75 million mr sturges thinks bsr now may consider selling assets that do not fall into its long term investment criteria which focuses on smaller secondary and tertiary multifamily property market bsr s class b garden style multifamily property portfolio in the u s provides investors with attractive exposure to an improving us apartment property sector he said bsr is expected to continue to benefit from favourable multifamily demand fundamentals in the us sunbelt property markets that are supported by compelling demographic population and job growth which may support further increases in rental apartment demand the reit may generate above average same property revenue growth yoy that is mainly driven by rising amrs year over year and improving average occupancies yoy further execution of the reit s value creation strategies could augment nav unit and affo unit growth prospects currently we expect bsr to generate sp noi growth yoy of 3 per cent to 4 per cent in the next 12 months from a trading perspective we believe that the recent above average sell off in bsr s units since its ipo in may 2018 is unwarranted given bsr s attractive u s multifamily exposure and the reit s early execution of its stated growth strategies bsr s units offer a compelling entry point and buying opportunity reflecting 1 its deep discount valuation 2 its above average nav unit and affo unit growth prospects and 3 possible portfolio enhancements through executed capital recycling activities keeping a strong buy rating for bsr units he lowered his target to us 10 25 from us 11 the average on the street is currently us 10 87 industrial alliance securities analyst george topping reduced his base metals estimates in a research note released monday citing recent weak economic data signalling a near term global slowdown the resolution of the trade war with a weaker u s dollar should be supportive he said we remain positive on copper and zinc given the spate of recent m a suggesting senior producers see a supply shortfall ahead conversely mr topping emphasized gold is on a tear finally and now sits in line with his expectations with a more dovish interest rate outlook and a projected weaker us on fears of a recession gold has commenced a bull run up 7 per cent us 85 per ounce since nov 18 he said our gold forecast already projected a long term rise from us 1 270 oz in 2018 to us 1 350 in 2019 and onward to us 1 500 oz by 2021 and thus remains unchanged slight impacts to our junior gold targets are due to recent dilutive financings where applicable updated cost projections and a lower c assumption in 2019 of us 0 78 c from us 0 80 c mr topping raised his target price for shares of wesdome gold mines ltd wdo t after the toronto based company finished 2018 up 160 per cent off its lows and expecting a further rise this calendar year mining of the high grade 303 lens at eagle should push production to 75 80 000 ounces of gold in 2019 he said the initial resource at kiena 340 000 ounces au at 11g t was overly conservative and should reach 1 million ounces in 2019 these catalysts combined with a better market sentiment should allow wdo to appreciate further to our increased target of 6 20 share from 5 50 share he maintained a strong buy rating for the stock at the same time the analyst dropped his target for first quantum minerals ltd fm t to 15 50 from 20 pointing to significant build up risks with us 7 billion us 10 share in net debt and the do or die build up imminent at cobre we reiterate our hold rating and are reining in our target price due to the high risk he said the risks of operating in zambia 80 per cent of copper production have been demonstrated with the new tax regime which went into effect on january 1 saying it currently possesses compelling value bmo nesbitt burns analyst randy ollenberger upgraded his rating for shares of encana corp eca t eca n to outperform from market perform on monday we believe the sell off in encana shares following the proposed newfield acquisition is overdone and that the shares offer compelling value he said in our opinion encana holds a strong portfolio of assets in the top resource plays in north america we believe that the company is well positioned to exceed investor expectations regarding the operating and cash generation upside associated with the pending acquisition of newfield exploration mr ollenberger reduced his target by a loonie to 11 the average is currently 15 34 bmo s richard carlson raised general motors co gm n to outperform from market perform with a target of us 41 up from 38 the average is us 44 57 mr carlson said the two key factors to

offshore investors who have become enamored of the illusion of economic growth and political stability in china may want to recalibrate the reality gauge in 2019 the western view of china s political economy is driven partly by anecdote partly by accepting beijing s propaganda economic data as fact foreign investors have convinced themselves that the chinese communist party ccp is superior in terms of economic management this despite ample evidence to the contrary thus accepting the official view is easy but also increasingly risky in a december 15 speech renmin university s xiang songzuo warned that chinese stock market conditions resemble those during the 1929 wall street crash he also suggested that the chinese economy is actually shrinking but this apostate view was quickly rejected by legions of captive western economists and investment analysts whose livelihood depends upon selling china to credulous foreign audiences facts aside the perception of china is what matters to global investors part of a larger pathology of hope based investment allocation that eschews those rare bits of hard data that disagree with the positive narrative china growth tesla profitability or the mystical blockchain all require more credulity than ever before for example in the first half of 2016 global capital markets stopped due to fear of a chinese recession credit spreads soared and deal flows disappeared but was this really a surprise in fact the chinese government had accelerated official stimulus in 2015 and 2016 to counter a possible slowdown and particularly ensure a quiet domestic scene as paramount leader xi jinping was enshrined into the chinese constitution today western audiences are again said to be concerned about china s economy and this concern is justified but perhaps not for the reasons touted in the financial media the china beige book cbb fourth quarter preview released december 27 reports that sales volumes output domestic and export orders investment and hiring fell on a year over year and quarter over quarter basis headed by leland miller cbb is a research service that surveys thousands of companies and bankers on the ground in china every quarter contrary to the positive foreign narrative about growth in china cbb contends that deflation is the bigger threat compared to inflation because of china s structural problems deflation has very clearly emerged as the bigger threat in a slowing economy than inflation consumer demand has weakened and you see that reflected in retail and services prices cbb managing director shehzad qazi said in an interview in fact the bank of china has been cutting reserve requirements for chinese banks since the start of 2018 another example of how long it took for wall street to get the joke on china of course the real driver of the economic tightness in china is the same as in the united states and europe namely the voracious appetite that the u s treasury has for cash the federal open market committee talks about interest rates but the debt issuance of the treasury is the doggie the fed is the tail and the actions of the treasury combined with the runoff of the fomc s bond portfolio aka quantitative tightening or qt is constricting credit markets from paris all the way to beijing and back again the continuing unwind of the shadowy and likely insolvent chinese conglomerate hna is a useful metaphor for the chinese economy more broadly lots of debt but no visible equity in a corporate organization chart that defies understanding offshore holdings in companies or real estate are being liquidated as fast as they were accumulated during the third quarter of last year chinese conglomerates sold off more than 1 billion worth of commercial real estate in the united states while purchasing only 231 million according to the wall street journal the retreat from offshore investments came after restrictions were imposed by the chinese government on foreign investments because of the slowing internal economy there is every indication that xi intends to increase restrictions on offshore holdings especially those involving debt to help maximize liquidity at home what does this suggest chinese companies all clear their currency and securities through bank of china thus the chinese central bank has a comprehensive view of and risk to offshore flows for investments and debt service a single point of failure to borrow from the world of enterprise risk the forced liquidation of hna and insurer anbang suggests a degree of urgency to pairing back the huge amounts of debt leverage used by many chinese companies and the attendant cost of funding these obligations hna lest we forget was once touted as a chinese champion hna officials paid for assets threw lavish events and pasted the company s name on the sides of building around the world that s a bit flashy also hna was seen as a savior for germany s deutsche bank ag but now the company has begun to unwind its debt financed position in the bank s common stock incredibly u s and eu bank regulators still have no idea as to the true beneficial ownership of hna meanwhile hna also is in talks to sell its ingram micro business to apollo global the chinese conglomerate reportedly seeks 7 5 billion including debt for ingram micro one of america s largest distributors of personal computers and electronic equipment but why did hna buy ingram in the first instance nobody knows and virtually everyone on wall street including the credit rating agencies was and is happy to do business with hna it is telling that china development bank cdb is leading a team to supervise hna group s asset disposals watching the liquidation of the hna group you begin to appreciate just how fragile beijing s control is over the economy cdb of course is hna s biggest creditor and it in turn is an appendage of the bank of china the financial disarray seen among some once high flying chinese companies suggests a major turnabout from the years when offshore investments were encouraged western analysts tend to think about china in terms of economic risk but internal stability may be a more pressing issue both because of the growing potential for violent change and because western audiences are completely unprepared for this eventuality these are the key risks facing the chinese economy mountains of debt no real equity leverage in the economy and a payments system that is entirely focused through the bank of china but the most troubling development are the growing signs that the ccp and paramount leader xi jinping feel compelled to take more and more authoritarian measures to retain political control credulous western observers talk about the long term perspective of the ccp but in fact this gang of running dogs to borrow the marxist terminology is no different than western politicians the ccp is no more able to manage a complex modern economy than is president donald trump thomas sowell argues that american liberals are authoritarians with a human face china on the other hand is brutally and unapologetically authoritarian the rise of xi jinping to sole power in china is nothing if not a display of massive insecurity and power starting with the elimination of all rivals and ending with the dissolution of collective leadership revelations that beijing expects to imprison over a million muslim uighurs in work camps a mere 10 percent of the eleven million population of xinjiang also suggests a very direct and present fear of instability but it is difficult to look at china today and not be reminded of some unfortunate historical parallels mao tse tung wrote in world marxist review in 1961 a potential revolutionary situation exists in any country where the government consistently fails in its obligation to ensure a least a minimally decent standard of life for the great majority of its citizens if there also exists even the nucleus of a revolutionary party able to supply doctrine and organization only one ingredient is needed the instrument for revolutionary action today the revolutionary party is radical islam spilling across china s western and southern borders the ccp well recognizes the parallels with chinese history and it has happened before just as the chinese nationalists and communist forces defeated the japanese in world war ii after decades of cruel occupation by tokyo s fascist rulers the ccp is now in the position of the oppressor and the islamist terrorists are the liberators no member of the ccp who understands china s political and military past could fail to be impressed by this parallel when wang jian the co chairman and a co founder of hna group accidentally fell off a wall in provence france he atoned for creating a scheme so gigantically absurd and so heavily leveraged that it actually threatened the ccp the ccp is happy to tolerate or even encourage wealth creation but only so long as it does not become a problem the so called spending spree by hna was in fact a reply of the exuberant behavior of cash flush japanese investors in the 1980s but with lots more debt hna s 50 billion debt fueled investment binge was and is still a problem for china in 2019 but it also only illustrates a larger issue of national economic solidity and financial cohesion westerners may need to consider the possibility of political change in china driven by economic factors historically political change in china has come from the periphery and moved to the center in beijing communist party doctrine is especially constructed to forestall such an event but perhaps financial stress may be a catalyst offshore investors who have become enamored of the illusion of economic growth and political stability in china may want to recalibrate the reality gauge in 2019

its plan to raise interest rates to a neutral range the bank of canada which has hiked five times since july 2017 to leave its benchmark interest rate at 1 75 per cent is widely expected to refrain from further tightening on wednesday following recent volatility in stock markets and the price of oil one of canada s major exports still the central bank said as recently as last month that it will need to raise rates further to a neutral range of between 2 50 per cent and 3 50 per cent to achieve its inflation target i think there are people thinking that the bank will stick to its guns a

heading into 2019 oil producers are getting the feeling that they ve seen this market before that suspicion was reinforced last month when the price of global benchmark brent crude briefly fell below 50 for the first time since june 2017 in addition for the second time in five years declining oil prices have forced global oil producers to stabilize the market by cutting production by 1 2 million barrels per day bpd and for the second time in those five years producers will have to deal with the consequences of low prices even if the pain might not be as bad this time around
donald trump has said the u s federal reserve the fed is his biggest threat because it is raising rates too fast and he also said he doesn t speak with fed chair jerome powell because the fed is independent although he is unhappy with what powell is doing statements and showdowns that would once have been unusual to hear of in the established political system in the u s have now become a norm when people throughout the world began to see the u s president s anger toward the fed chair his statements regarding the tensions on the south china sea his hatred toward emmanuel macron or his joint decisions with president recep tayyip erdoğan on syria first thing in the morning they also began to focus on global economic political issues it would only be a dream not to expect a ceo turned president who took on cnn correspondents and even fbi directors as the occasion arose to not have a showdown with the fed which serves as the chief financial officer of the u s economy for that matter the response to such an interrogative stance by trump was not delayed james bullard who is the president and ceo of the federal reserve bank of st louis implicitly addressed the president by saying that it is the fed s responsibility to make the best decisions regarding price stability and employment and warned him to avoid meddling in these affairs meanwhile being the character he is trump did not take a step back and reiterated that tightening monetary policy damages the decisions made until now and that interest rate hikes could cast a shadow on the u s competitive edge which may damage the economy i had stated in my article is new fed chair nominee powell a dove or hawk dated nov 3 2017 that powell would support expansionist policies contrary to former chair janet yellen s practices and that he would make it easier in the transition toward a production based economy in the meantime we unfortunately witnessed that powell too kept pace with the helm of wall street style banking we will see with numbers if trump s so called rightful accusations are just or unjust the interest rate corridor reached the 2 25 2 5 band with the latest move by the fed which increased interest rates for the fourth time since the beginning of the year without making any concessions regarding a tightening of policies since 2015 the fed revised its growth forecast for 2019 from 2 5 percent to 2 3 percent it would be a mistake to not expect such a move which weakened the dollar against other currencies to not anger an american nationalist like trump in a period when the u s is squeezed in a tight corner with china has increased its maximum influence over its european and nato allies and is trying to put the country in a growth trend through minimizing its military existence in syria and afghanistan the fed s moves are contrary to the white house s america first motto and has also surprised us like everybody else the central bank of whom president trump has warned the fed to remember it is the central bank of the u s rather than the world perhaps in the near future he may take some steps to pull the fed into a more statist line the main reason behind this is that the wind is currently blowing in trump s favor the growth of the gdp in the u s in the third quarter has been revised from the previous figure of 3 5 to 3 9 above expectations personal consumption expenditures in the same period has also increased 1 4 percent meeting expectations while unemployment rates hit the lowest in a decade president trump s political future seems bright contrary to what is being published by popular media outlets especially with the support of rural states and the working class then how come the fed is utilizing such harsh policies to set the handbrake despite all the positive data referred to as core numbers if a recession is expected in the u s in 2019 then isn t the market supposed to be relieved through keynesian and expansionist policies although the trump administration s 1 5 trillion tax cut package will have supporting impact for growth the end of fiscal incentives next year the trade war with china and the effects of a strong dollar will inevitably have an impact on the production sector if the slowdown of global growth and the increase of the tightening cycle as a result of volatility of finance markets results in such a tight policy one must think that there are other fears behind these the ever so difficult to control budget and current account deficit might have pushed the fed to a mandatory slowdown the u s bond market meanwhile the second risk is potentially caused by the u s bond market which has been sending a distress call for over a year and a half research shows that the beginning periods of the six largest crises that took place between 1940 and 2011 saw serious issues with bond markets when investors started to pull out of the market as a result of price fluctuations it must be noted that many economists and investors in london and wall street keep a close watch on this indicator which can serve as an early warning system for us it is beneficial to go into more detail regarding this issue firstly if demand is high on the bonds their prices go up and profit ratio goes down likewise their yield also goes up when the demand goes down and bond prices decrease but what is currently happening in the u s bond market u s bonds are seen as an attractive instrument in comparison to other investment types due to the fact that they are seen as a less risky investment tool long term bonds are always in demand because they yield higher profit to make up for real damage and inflation pressure this is why the profit of a long term bond is always higher than a short term bond so for instance two year four year six year eight year and 10 year bond returns proceed in a upward motion and show strength in the long term giving investors the message that they can have confidence in this country in the long term if the bond return reverses so if the 10 year bond returns are below the two year returns this is seen as a warning for the economy and now the fed sees this perhaps believing that the u s economy will no longer be a safe harbor in 2019 with this in mind they aim to make people reduce consumption to encourage savings with the goal of stabilizing indebtedness starting in 2018 the fed undertook the toughest tightening plan in its history while it faced the most controversial president in the white house and that president wants to reduce unemployment through expansionist economic policies before entering the elections the fight could be much more serious than we imagine in the long term one must not forget that there is serious opposition wanting the return of the trump bonds to remain low ph

by benjamin cohen with equities slumping exchange rate volatility increasing and political risks intensifying financial markets around the world have hit a during times like these international investors generally grow cautious and prioritize safety over returns so money flees to safe havens that can provide secure liquid investment grade assets on a sufficiently large scale but there are no obvious safe havens today for the first time in living memory investors lack a quiet port where they can find shelter from the storm historically the safe haven par excellence was the united states in the form of treasury bonds backed by the full faith and credit of the us government as one investment strategist put it back in 2012 when people are worried all road lead to treasuries the bursting of the us real estate bubble in 2007 offers a case in point no one doubted that the us was the epicenter of the global financial crisis but rather than flee the us capital actually flooded into it in the last three months of 2008 net purchases of us assets reached a half trillion dollars three times more than that of the preceding nine months combined to be sure some of these dollar claims were due to the fact that foreign banks and institutional investors needed greenbacks to cover their funding needs after interbank and other wholesale short term markets seized up but that was hardly the only reason why portfolio managers piled into the us much of the increased demand was due to sheer fear at a time when nobody knew how bad things might get the us was widely seen as the safest bet but this was before the arrival us president donald trump who has managed to undermine confidence in the dollar to an unprecedented degree in addition to abandoning any notion of fiscal responsibility trump has spent his first two years in office attacking international institutions and picking fights with us allies to be sure even before trump confidence in the dollar suffered a blow in 2011 when standard poor s downgraded treasury securities by one notch in response to a near shutdown of the us government that episode was triggered by a standoff between then president barack obama and congressional republicans over a routine proposal to raise the federal debt ceiling today however investors have even more reason to worry about the us government s credit rating in 2018 alone the us government was shut down three times and it remains in a partial shutdown to this day owing to trump s demand for funds to build a big beautiful wall on the border with mexico where can investors go if not the us the eurozone might seem like a logical alternative after the dollar the euro is the world s most widely used currency and taken together the capital markets of the eurozone s 19 member states are close in size to the us market but europe has troubles of its own economic growth is slowing not least in germany and the risk of a banking crisis in italy the eurozone s fourth largest economy looms on the horizon worse still is the uncertainty over brexit which could prove highly disruptive if the united kingdom crashes out of the european union without a divorce agreement needless to say britain too can be ruled out as a safe haven at least until the brexit fiasco is resolved what about the swiss franc though its attractions are obvious switzerland s financial markets are simply too small to serve as an adequate substitute for the us that leaves japan with its abundant supply of government bonds it is the biggest single market for public debt outside the us the question for portfolio managers though is whether it is really safe to invest in a country where government debt exceeds 230 of gdp for comparison the public debt to gdp ratio in the us is around 88 and even in troubled italy it is no more than 130 admittedly the market for japanese government debt is more stable than most owing to the fact that much of it is held by domestic savers which is to say it is safely tucked under the mattress but japan is an aging country with an economy that has remained almost stagnant for a quarter century investors would be right to wonder where it will find the resources to continue servicing its massive debt overhang and then there is china with the world s third largest national market for public debt certainly the supply of assets in china is ample but the chinese market is so tightly controlled that it is essentially the opposite of a safe haven it will be a long time before global investors even consider putting much faith in chinese securities with secure ports becoming scarce investors will become increasingly jittery they will be inclined to move funds at the slightest sign of danger which will add substantially to market volatility today s rough patch is probably here to stay benjamin j cohen is professor of international political economy at the university of california santa barbara and is the author of currency

federal reserve may get antsy and raise interest rates again a move that tends to hurt stocks and speaking of the fed and interest rates can it successfully pursue its primary mission keeping inflation low and employment high without inadvertently pushing the economy into a recession it s a difficult tightrope to walk but fed chairman jerome powell after sending conflicting signals last week made his position clear while the central bank expects to raise its benchmark federal funds rate twice this year it will be flexible acting only if the data warrant tighter credit not following a predetermined path to bringing rates back to more normal levels but there is only so much reassurance the fed can offer it has erred in the past most recently by keeping rates too low for too long

chartered stockbroker and financial journalist said national president constance shareholders association of nigeria mikail shehu said the crisis that bedeviled nigeria s apex capital market regulator securities and exchange commission sec which saw the suspension of its director general and the refusal of the government to address other regulatory governance issues such as the composition of the board of sec also affected the market some other actions taken by other regulators without consideration to the minority shareholders such as the takeover of skye bank also affected the morale of the investing public we hope to see a better outlook in 2019 as soon the general election is over when it is free and fair and the new government starts the governance process shehu said managing director cowry asset management limited mr johnson chuwku also attributed the decline in foreign portfolio inflow to political tension in the country noting that government needs to give assurance that the coming elections will be free and fair and that the two major political parties will not create a major crisis the major thing driving portfolio investors is not necessarily that the economy is weak the economy is still quite strong the underlying thing is that quoted companies are performing very well but because portfolio investors are always wary of tensions in emerging markets they are not willing to risk being caught in crossfire of political parties chukwu said vetiva capital management limited which had in the second half reviewed its projection downward to average full year return of between 5 0 per cent and 5 0 per cent for nigerian equities noted that despite an improving macroeconomic environment and a semblance of policy stability nigeria s financial markets would likely be steered by the fallout of electoral activities and rising global interest rates managing director apt securities funds limited mallam kasimu kurfi said the performance of the nigerian market should also be viewed within the context of the slowdown in the global equities markets amid disputes between the major economies he noted that equities market globally recorded poor performance with major global indices such nasdaq dow jones ftse and jse asi among others closing lower than previous performance according to him the poor performance of the global markets might not be unconnected with raising of benchmark interest rate by the united states of america usa trade war by usa and china and ongoing exit of britain from the european union among others in the case of nigeria the introduction of fgn sukuk bond with high yield encouraged many stockholders to diversify from equities into bond and commercial papers with high yields being an election period also contributed to our poor performance as a result of divestment by foreign investors kurfi said a shareholder eric akinduro also agreed that the performance of the market belied the generally steady improvement in corporate earnings noting that the three major factors that adversely affected the nigerian market were the exit of foreign investors introduction of new fixed income instruments by government and electioneering much hope on post election recovery despite a negative start that had seen the market with a net capital depreciation of n245 4 billion or average decline of 2 10 per cent in the first two trading sessions of the year most analysts said they expected the market to close positive in 2019 rising above expected slow performance in the first quarter as the heightened political risks narrowed down into the closing phase olushekun said the fundamentals of most quoted companies suggest positive outlook for the market citing attractive earnings yields price to book ratios and dividend yields that show that nigerian equities are undervalued and have considerable upside potential this year you can expect to see a rebound last year was a flight to safety but this year after the elections you will see a steady recovery i see political stability and the continuation of the economic programmes of the government most of which should underpin long term development of the economy olushekun said he advised investors to invest in companies with sound fundamentals and to seek the advice of their stockbrokers to determine the most appropriate timing to enter into the stocks oni said the factors that would shape the nigerian market in 2019 included the global economic performance nigerian political transition and implementation of key fiscal and monetary policies in our own setting the outcome of the next general election and ability of whichever government to tackle the ongoing economic challenges especially investment in infrastructure management of fiscal and monetary policies and specifically creating sustainable conducive business environment among others are expected to shape activities in the stock market oni said according to him discerning investors should take advantage of low valuation of stocks and strong market fundamentals to beef up their portfolios he added that emerging activities of commodity exchanges are expected to create more investment opportunities in the capital market as these are consistent with the government s plan to increase investments in agriculture which is the base of commodity products vetiva capital management limited stated that it was cautiously optimistic that the electoral process would emulate the 2015 election in delivering a peaceful and transparent process which is expected to stimulate the market according to the firm although 2019 economic performance is unlikely to be materially affected by the outcome of the elections investor confidence can be significantly boosted by a favourable outcome and smooth process analysts at cordros capital stated that the negative performance for the equities market will persist in the short term amidst growing political concerns ahead of 2019 elections and absence of a positive market trigger our outlook for equities in the short to medium term remains conservative amidst brewing political concerns and the absence of a positive trigger however stable macroeconomic fundamentals remain supportive of recovery in the long term cordros capital stated in the coming year we expect the equities market to resume trading on a weak note while anticipating a post election rally across all indices on the local bourse afrinvest securities stated akinduro said the stock market should witness a recovery in the first quarter of 2019 as companies release their 2018 full year earnings reports and dividend recommendations post listing rules at the nse require quoted companies to submit their full year earnings reports not later than three months or 90 calendar days after the expiration of the period most quoted companies including all banks major manufacturers oil and gas companies breweries and cement companies use the 12 month gregorian calendar year as their business year the business year thus terminates on december 31 the deadline for the submission of the 2018 annual reports and accounts is expected to be friday march 29 2019 the last working day of the first quarter kurfi also said the outlook for 2019 looks brighter citing the low valuation of most stocks and the inflow of additional funds with the implementation of new investment structures that allow pension fund administrators to invest up to 75 per cent of their funds in the capital market according to him the expected listing of mtn nigeria before the end of the second quarter of 2019 will increase the depth of the market while the ongoing merger between diamond bank plc and access bank plc may trigger similar merger in other banks thus stimulating the competitive banking sector he added that the demutualisation of the nse will also improve the confidence of the market publicity secretary independent shareholders association of nigeria isan moses igbrude urged the political parties and other stakeholders in the political process to place the national interest above their personal interest and not to further overheat the polity according to him the stock market will bounce back after the general elections when the tension in the polity is over the year 2019 will be a very remarkable and active year for the stock market with a lot of activities across all sectors of the market from access bank and diamond bank merger insurance companies recapitalisation to the divestment by mr femi otedola from forte oil all these are indications that the new year is going to be full of possibilities my honest advice to government and politicians is that they should be very cautious and mindful not to heat up the economy igbrude said he urged government to provide conducive and favourable environment for businesses to thrive pointing out that government should avoid policy inconsistency and untoward tax collection practices the outlook for the nigerian stock market and the economy generally depends on the successful conduct of the february march 2019 general elections that appears to be a consensus among the analysts but the global crude oil fluctuation and its broad implications on domestic fiscal and monetary management especially foreign exchange forex stability and regulatory issues at the capital market including the resolution of governance impasse at the securities and exchange commission sec which has been operating without a board and substantive executive management will also moderate the performance of the stock market in all it is still uncertain times for investors though the uncertainties appear less and the upside looks brighter

as expected china announced the first round of 2019 monetary easing measures on jan 4 the first in a series of actions beijing is anticipated to take in order to shore up its reeling economy commentary as expected china announced the first round of 2019 monetary easing measures on jan 4 the first in a series of actions beijing is anticipated to take in order to shore up its reeling economy china is preparing for a challenging year ahead both economically and politically at home and abroad but for the first salvo policymakers resorted to old tricks the people s bank of china pboc the nation s central bank announced cuts to the amount of reserves banks are required to hold by one percent over two days the required reserve ratio rrr will be shaved by 50 basis points 0 5 percent effective jan 15 and jan 25 the move is expected to pump roughly 1 5 trillion yuan 218 billion of liquidity into the economy and more easing measures lie ahead we expect 300bps basis points more rrr cuts this year to accommodate fiscal easing morgan stanley s chief china economist robin xing wrote in a note to clients overall gdp growth could bottom in 1q with policy easing fully kicking in by march the bank added on the same day prime minister li keqiang met with leaders of china s largest commercial lenders china construction bank bank of china and the industrial and commercial bank of china and urged them to increase lending to private and small enterprises li hopes that the increased liquidity as a result of the rrr reduction will make its way onto balance sheets of small and private companies to that end the pboc has unveiled the so called targeted medium term lending facility bearing a super low interest rate specifically for smaller private companies the goal is to keep smaller firms in business and avoid job losses looking ahead china is expected to announce further easing measures largely from its past playbook those include cuts to the value added tax and the reduction of restrictions on debt financing at local levels boosting infrastructure investments and potentially foreign exchange transactions will it work repeating tried and true methods of easing might work at the margins but it s far from a slam dunk china deftly managed the global financial crisis a decade ago but 2019 is not a repeat of 2008 ten years ago there was no trade war with the united states the rest of the global economy is comparatively stronger today and most importantly china itself was not nearly as levered a decade ago beijing can t enact the forceful measures it once did in 2008 for now it can only hope that dabbling at the margins will keep the economy afloat a decade of increasing debt levels has crippled the nation s ability to stimulate much further without ratcheting up financial risk in addition the u s federal reserve s interest rate hikes are limiting the pboc s flexibility over monetary policy a benchmark rate cut by china would exacerbate capital outflow and put more pressure on the yuan besides small business lending china is also boosting infrastructure spending quietly the national people s congress standing committee in early january authorized to allocate its local government debt quota ahead of schedule this is typically approved in march in order to allow local governments to issue more debt earlier this cleared around 1 39 trillion yuan 202 billion of new bonds to be issued a large portion of that quota will be allocated to special purpose bonds whose proceeds will depend on revenues from infrastructure projects such as railroads highways and redevelopment most of them in far flung locations not only do these projects count toward china s gdp growth they also create jobs and keep migrant workers employed if there are no pro growth measures we will see jobs at risk which is a key threat that the central government wants to avoid wrote iris pang ing s chief china economist in a jan 4 note china still hasn t cleaned up the local government and infrastructure debt from the last crisis some of which are sitting on the balance sheets of china s so called asset management companies bad banks and others were bought by pension funds and private investors so far beijing is looking to add more debt judiciously because kicking the can down the road only works if there s more road ahead but this time the road is narrower and the stakes are higher
