by yaleglobal online currencies are fluid with pros and cons to overvaluation and undervaluation depending on a nation s circumstances by farok j contractor currency overvaluation or undervaluation can have advantages or disadvantages depending on a country s circumstances as part of negotiations for a trade deal with the chinese the trump team seeks assurances that the government will not devalue the yuan or renminbi but currency valuations are relative and fluid and governments lack full control currencies may become undervalued for natural reasons when political crises increase wariness about that country s assets or currency as happened in brazil and turkey since 2013 in other cases governments deliberately keep the currency undervalued to encourage export sales us and other officials allege that the people s bank of china has consistently undervalued the renminbi yuan since the early 1990s a currency s value can appreciate or devalue against other currencies in multiple ways market sentiment deliberate government actions direct buying or selling in the foreign exchange market or by fiat in extreme cases when the government dictates the exchange rate currencies may become overvalued when foreigners desire that currency in the exchange markets and seek to hold assets in that nation currencies can also become temporarily overvalued if the country s central bank raises internal interest rates foreigners seeking to earn higher interest then demand that currency in the spot market in other cases especially in the emerging world governments like india may deliberately keep their currency overvalued for political reasons advantages of undervaluation from china s point of view china s exporters receive a boost as dollars earned convert into more renminbi than they would otherwise foreign direct investment is less costly and more attractive to outside investors as their currencies convert into more renminbi for buying factories or local assets investment and jobs pour into china s export sector turning it into the factory of the world due to the expectations of consistent undervaluation by the central bank imports headed into china are more expensive in renminbi thereby protecting domestic chinese firms from import competition and retaining investment and jobs in the country overall investment and jobs increase crucial for a population of 1 4 billion people the drawbacks of undervaluation for china effective protection against imports reduces competition which can also reduce efficiency and competitiveness of local firms excess demand for jobs is created escalating wages in a country with a limited labor supply which in turn could increase inflation this did not happen in china initially because of its large population however due to the one child policy reports of labor shortages have emerged with costs escalating sharply overvalued currencies are more likely found in emerging countries although examples of overvaluation also occur in developed economies such as norway and switzerland advantages of overvaluation for emerging economies like india thailand egypt or nigeria as of early 2019 include imports are cheaper in the local currency this can be crucial for import dependent populations where local markets rely on imports for basic necessities like food medicines or energy political stability increases to the extent that the government handles or subsidizes imports of necessities devaluation poses political consequences for incumbents because basic necessities like energy may have to be imported anyway increased costs can contribute to unrest and protests importing at the overvalued exchange rate is cheaper than local production especially in import dependent economies keeping inflation under control drawbacks of overvaluation exports may be reduced because companies converting foreign currency earnings say us dollars at the overvalued exchange rate do not earn enough local currency say indian rupees or nigerian naira to justify their costs imports may appear artificially inexpensive compared with local substitute products thereby dampening investments and jobs in sectors that could produce locally to compete against imports foreign direct investment coming into a country with an overvaluated currency is somewhat reduced foreign currencies like the us dollar convert into fewer units of local currency like rupees with which to buy local assets such as land comparing currency values is complicated because comparisons involve converting moneys into one reference currency such as the us dollar which fluctuates in value too also living standards and the cost of living vary dramatically across nations complicating analyses overvaluation and inflation the difference between the inflation rate of the rupee and that of the us dollar averaged 4 15 but the rupee devalued more slowly suggesting overvaluation source niranjan rajadhyaksha livemint however the theory of purchasing power parity or ppp provides analysis for the long run the theory s main idea is simple money as such has no value and is merely odd pieces of metal paper or phantasmal electronic entries under the theory money has value depending on what holders can do with it what and how much consumers can purchase with that currency the exchange rate for a currency in the long run according to the theory is based on the comparison of its purchasing power versus that of another currency in the simplest example if a basket of goods and services can be purchased for 78 000 in india and the same basket of goods and services can be purchased for 1 000 in the united states then the theoretical purchasing power parity exchange rate should be 1 78 as of february 2019 this rate was 1 71 suggesting the rupee is somewhat overvalued unfortunately all currencies eventually lose value through the strange process of inflation erosion of any purchasing power over time a number of socioeconomic factors spur inflation depending on the country a complication is that currencies lose purchasing power at different rates in short the currency that has a higher inflation rate such as the indian rupee should and indeed will in the long run according to ppp theory devalue against a reference currency such as the us dollar that suffers lower inflation a simple way of calculating this take the difference between the inflation rate of the rupee and that of the us dollar as reference currency over a suitable period according to a calculation from niranjan rajadhyaksha for livemint the indian rupee should have devalued at a rate proportionate to the difference in the inflation between india and the united states calculated as an average annual 4 15 difference if so the rupee should have devalued by 4 15 percent each year on average however it did not the rupee devalued more slowly less than it should have according to ppp theory that means the rupee is somewhat overvalued inflation in the indian economy has moderated recently but remains higher than that in the united states if this continues in the long run the theory says economists should expect the rupee to continue to devalue against the dollar governments and multinationals worldwide study ppp theory assessing whether currencies are overvalued or undervalued to determine the best timing for portfolio or foreign direct investments for example a country s interest rate may appear attractive to foreigners but once the foreign bank deposit matures value depends on the exchange rate when proceeds are converted or consider the fact that many companies in brazil turkey and elsewhere in the emerging world finding us interest rates irresistibly low from 2011 to 2013 borrowed heavily in us dollar denominated debt when the loans had to be repaid say in 2018 after the dollar strengthened companies found their cost of repayment in local currency so high that it strained finances forcing some to fail for governments ppp theory is useful in deciding how much to devalue or revalue their currencies for example the vietnamese government gradually devalues the dong based on ppp calculations ppp theory is far from accurate and works best for the long run calculated over several years yet it gives executives investors and governments guidance and insights

by invasion of venezuela by us and its proxies is just around the corner this past week vice president pence flew to colombia once again for the fifth time in recent weeks to provide final instructions to us local forces and proxy allies there for the next step in the us regime change plan evidence that the green light for regime change and invasion is now flashing are supportive public statement by former president barack obama and several high level us democratic party politicians and candidates directly attacking the maduro regime they are signaling democrat party support for invasion and regime change events will now accelerate just in time perhaps to coincide with the release of mueller report on trump behind the scenes it is clear as it has been for months that us neocons are once again back in charge of us foreign policy driving the us toward yet another war and attempt at regime change of a foreign government us strategy in brief the us neocon led strategy is increasingly clear establish a beach head on the colombian venezuelan and venezuelan brazilian border under the guise of providing humanitarian aid use the aid to get venezuelans on the border to welcome the us proxy forces to cross over set up political and military structures thereafter just inside the venezuelan borders with colombia and brazil from which to launch further similar efforts deeper into venezuela repeat this province by province step by step penetrating venezuela space until enough local units of the venezuelan military change sides and convince one or more of the venezuelan military hierarchy to join them establish a dual state and government within and along the border of the venezuelan state this way a breakaway state and dual power within the country make it appear by manipulating the media that the venezuelan people are rising up against the maduro government when in fact it is us proxy forces invading and using opportunist local politicians military and others in the conquered zones as the media covers for their invasion the main ideological justification being used for the invasion and regime change is that the maduro government has grossly mismanaged the venezuelan economy and driven its people into poverty with democrats now joining trump and republicans in support of invasion the liberal mainstream us media as well as the rightwing alternative media are both pushing the same line to blunt us opposition to invasion and yet another war before the final military assault is launched somehow the democratic elections less than a year ago which returned the maduro government to power did not represent the will of the people explanations how they did not are thin and unconvincing moreover nor is any explanation given how us policies and actions have played the central role in destroying venezuela s currency and economy and the financial measures used to destabilize the economy are especially opaque financial imperialism the case of venezuela venezuela today is a classic case how us imperialism in the 21st century employs financial measures to crush a state and country that dares to break away from the us global economic empire and pursue an independent course outside the us empire s web of entangling economic and financial relations here s how us financial imperialism has worked and continues to work with the intent of assisting regime change in the case of venezuela in a world where us capitalism is the dominant hegemon the us currency the dollar is the centerpiece of the us global economic empire the dollar serves as the global trading currency as well as the global banking reserves currency more than 85 of all global trade export and import is done in dollars certain commodities like global oil and oil futures contracts are traded virtually only in dollars recently more countries have begun to peg their own currency to the dollar allowing it to move in tandem with the dollar some have even eliminated their currency altogether and now use only the us dollar as their domestic currency increasingly as well more countries are issuing their domestic bonds in dollars i e dollar denominated bonds and their central banks follow the us central bank the federal reserve s policy as it raises or lowers us interest rates that in turn cause the us dollar to rise and fall they do so even if rising us interest rates mean rising rates in their own economies that precipitate recessions and mass unemployment these are all examples of the growing financial integration with the us imperial state and economy but even those economies that maintain their own currency are at the mercy of the us dollar since the dollar is the global trading and reserves currency whenever the dollar rises in value due to us monetary policy changes or us inflationary pressures or just changes in supply or demand for the dollar the currencies of other countries fall in value as the dollar rises in value other currencies fall that s how global exchange rates work in the 21st century global us empire where the dollar is the trading reserves currency other currencies the british pound euro and even less so the japanese yen or china yuan are still largely insignificant as reserves or trading currencies and it appears very unlikely they will soon replace the dollar one of the key pillars of the us empire the us has the power to engineer a collapse in a country s currency a collapse in its currency means the price of imported goods rises rapidly especially those goods it can only be obtained by imports i e medicines critical food commodities intermediate business goods necessary for domestic manufacturing etc accelerating import inflation in turn leads to domestic businesses cutting back production due to lack of affordable resources commodities or parts mass layoffs follow production cutbacks rising inflation brought on by currency collapse is thus accompanied by rising unemployment wage income and consumption in turn collapse and thereafter the economy in general widespread shortages of key imports inflation and domestic production decline and unemployment brought on by the shortages and inflation simultaneously lead to social discontent and loss of support for the government opposition groups and parties proclaim these problems are due to the mismanagement of the economy by the government or corruption by its leaders or just socialist policies in general but in fact the economic crisis i e shortages inflation production unemployment is traceable directly to the root cause of the collapse of the currency engineered by us imperialist policies intent on crashing the economy as a prelude to regime change and economic reintegration to the us global economic empire there are many ways the us can and does cause a collapse of a country s currency one set of measures are designed to cause a severe shortage of dollars in the target country s economy a shortage of dollars drives up the value of the us dollar in the target economy which in turn drives down the value of the country s own currency the us has been engineering a collapse of venezuela s currency the bolivar now for years first by causing dollars in venezuela to flow out of the country and secondly by measures preventing venezuela from obtaining dollars from abroad us policy over the last several years at least has been to force us companies doing business in venezuela to repatriate their dollars back to the us or else divert them elsewhere globally among subsidiaries or just to leave venezuela and take their dollars with them us policy has also been to publicize and promote wealthier venezuelans with dollars to take them out of the country and invest them in colombia where the us has arranged an online investment firm with the assistance of its colombian government ally rich venezuelans have been encouraged as well to send their money to miami banks and to move there in large numbers which they have taking their dollars with them or dumping their bolivars in exchange for dollars the outflow of dollars from venezuela has raised the value of dollars that remain in venezuela on the black market there thereby helping to depress the value of the bolivar in venezuela even further these measures pale however to us imperial efforts to prevent venezuela from obtaining dollars in global markets in an effort to try to offset the outflow of dollars from the economy for example the us has taken action to prevent us and global banks from lending dollars to venezuela or from participating in underwriting and insuring venezuelan bond issues which would also raise dollars for venezuela if allowed bank loans and bond funding thus dry up depriving the government of alternative sources of dollars more dollar shortage more bolivar domestic currency collapse i e more expensive imports more inflation more shortages declining production rising unemployment more discontent the main effort by which the us is attempting to deprive venezuela of dollars is to impose sanctions on other countries that try to buy venezuelan oil oil sales are the number one source of the country s dollar acquisitions since all oil trade is done in dollars and venezuela depends on 95 of all its government revenues from selling its oil the us imposes sanctions on would be buyers and thus cuts off access to dollars as it simultaneously through other policies works to encourage dollar flight out of venezuela and cut off bank loans and bond issuance by the country and if the prior bonds and loans were dollar denominated then the lack of dollars to pay the interest and principal coming due leads directly to defaults and in turn to business collapse and even more unemployment venezuela has turned to selling its oil to china and russia and a few other countries it has been forced to resort to paying its interest and principal on past loans from these governments with shipments of oil instead of payments in dollars as the us turns to sanctions as an economic weapon to enforce its will on other countries which it has been doing in recent years more countries are become aware of the tactic and are taking countermeasures they are dumping dollars or reducing their purchases of dollars in world markets and buying gold china and russia are leading this way while experimenting with non currency dependent trade another recent move by the us to deny venezuela dollars and collapse its currency has been to seize the venezuelan oil distribution company citgo in the us its remittances back to venezuela have been in dollars by seizing citgo the us deprives the country of yet another source of dollars with which venezuela might otherwise have been able to purchase imports of food medicines and other economically critical goods so venezuelans in this case are clearly forced to forego these critical imports due to us policy not due to economic mismanagement by its government moreover adding insult to injury the dollar funds from citgo seized by the us are being delivered to the venezuelan government s opponents and its hand picked ally of the us guido the opposition now gets to finance its counter revolution with the money formerly remitted to venezuela the counter revolution is financed at the expense of critical goods and services that otherwise might have been made available to the venezuelan people seizure of the citgo asset is not the only such example of dollar deprivation other assets in the form of inventories investments cash in us banks etc are also being impounded and not just from the venezuelan government individual venezuelan companies and individual citizens have been having their assets in the us impounded as well and the us is increasing its pressure on foreign governments to impound and seize assets as well of the government businesses and citizens the impoundment and seizure has recently been extended as well to venezuelan gold stocks held offshore in other countries in direct violation of international law recently the us company and mega bank citigroup has been forced to withhold venezuelan gold in violation of its contracts with the country the bank of england has also been asked and is complying with the us demand to freeze venezuelan gold deposited in the uk and countries like abu dhabi where gold is traded globally have been asked to stop trading in venezuelan gold gold is a substitute money for the us dollar so preventing gold access to venezuela is like preventing dollar access as well with its gold venezuela could more easily buy dollars or trade for goods directly than with using bolivars that are falling in value and sellers are less likely to take as payment countries with economies whose currency is seriously declining in value are able to get a loan to stabilize its currency from the international monetary fund the imf recent examples are argentina turkey south africa and even pakistan but the imf is an institution set up by the us in 1944 the us maintains with its close european allies a majority vote on imf decisions the imf does nothing the us does not approve its mission is to lend to countries in need of stabilizing their currencies the imf however as an appendage of the us global empire has refused to lend venezuela anything to help stabilize its currency this is in contrast for example to the record loan of more than 50 billion recently provided to argentina once that country put in its current business and us friendly macri government the record imf loan by the way was so that argentina could pay off debts owed to us and other speculators in the early 2000s so argentina saw little of that 50b what the payoff did enable however was for macri and other argentinian bankers to go to new york to get new loans from us banks once it repaid the speculators from which macri and friends no doubt personally benefitted immensely as the venezuelan currency collapses due to us arranged dollar shortages venezuela must print even more bolivars to enable it to purchase what goods from abroad it might still be able to buy a collapsed currency means the price of imported goods rises proportionately so more bolivars are needed to buy the goods that are continually rising in price printing more bolivars adds to the supply of bolivars in the economy which raises domestic price inflation even further but the excess printing is in response to the currency collapse which is engineered by the dollar shortage and the falling exchange rate in the first place the over supply of bolivars is not due to mismanagement it is due to the shortage of dollars and the desperate effort by the venezuelan government to somehow pay for inflating import goods the falling price of crude oil in 2017 18 added further pressure on the bolivar the collapse of oil prices globally appears unrelated to us policy but it wasn t the oil venezuela has been able to continue to sell mostly to china or russia declined by 40 in price in 2018 the global oil deflation of 2018 thus generated less oil revenue for the country and thus fewer dollars but that too was due indirectly to us policy and economic conditions the collapsing price of oil in 2018 is directly attributed to us shale oil producers raising their output by more than a million barrels a day which increased the world oil supply and depressed world oil prices the us then attempted to manipulate world oil output with saudi arabia but that exacerbated the over production and deflation problem still further here s how the us attempted to impose sanctions on iranian oil in 2018 saudi arabia believed it would capture the customers that iran would lose and therefore it saudi arabia also raised its output of crude as us shale producers raised theirs but iran was able to continue to sell its oil as us sanctions broke down the result of the us shale overproduction plus saudi overproduction was a 40 collapse in world oil prices in 2018 that further deprived venezuela of much needed government revenue apart from us sanctions on venezuela oil sales us monetary policy in 2018 further exacerbated the currency crisis in venezuela as it did elsewhere in latin america and emerging markets in general in 2017 18 the us central bank launched a policy of raising interest rates since other world central banks respond to the us central bank world rates began to rise as well rising us interest rates caused a rise in the us dollar and as the dollar rose in 2017 18 emerging market currencies fell they fell for venezuela in part due to this effect as well as due to other causes mentioned falling currencies precipitate what is called capital flight out of the country less money capital means less available for investment and thus lower production output and more unemployment so currency collapse precipitates not only inflation but recession as well to prevent the capital fight emerging market economies raise their own domestic interest rates this led to recession for example throughout latin america in 2017 18 capital flight out of venezuela has been significant since 2016 as wealthy venezuelans sent more of their dollars out of the country to miami thus exacerbating dollar shortages in venezuela and further driving down the value of the bolivar left behind us sanctions on other countries banks and companies offshore are designed not only to prevent venezuela access to dollars and money capital offshore sanctions also target real goods trade like oil and other key commodities but there s another means by which the us shuts down the flow of real goods into and from a country causing shortages of critical goods it s the us controlled international payments exchange system called swift this is where us banks arrange the exchange and transfer of payments for goods and services by converting from one currency to the other and transferring the funds from one bank to another across countries the us has been preventing venezuela from normally using the swift system so even if another country is willing to buy venezuela goods including oil and exchange bolivars for its own currency it is prevented from doing so by the us bank controlled swift system summing up financial imperialism has been waged against venezuela for decades but the attack on venezuela employing financial measures has recently intensified as the us neocons and imperialists have accelerated their plans to launch a more direct attack by political means including military to force regime change in venezuela at the center of the on going and now intensifying financial warfare against the country by the us are measures designed to destroy venezuela s currency imperialism is often thought of as military conquest and colonialism that s 19th century british and european imperialism but the american empire in the 21st century does not need colonialism it has a more efficient system for forcing the integration of other economies and for extracting value and wealth from the rest of the world the us empire is increasingly knitted together in the 21st century by a deep web of financial relationships that afford it multiple levers of economic power it can pull if and when it desires and when those economic and financial levers prove insufficient to overthrow domestic forces and governments that remain intent on pursuing a more independent path outside the empire s economic and political relations then the breakaway state is attacked more directly once the economy is sufficiently wrecked such is the case of venezuela today financial imperialism has paved the way for more direct political and military action
prominent figures in the modernization of the middle east in the last half century say the region s economies and financial institutions have come a long way over 50 years the financial sector is now more professional and better regulated than ever before but they warn that the next generation of leaders still needs to act to diversify away from dependence on oil revenues reduce the number of financial institutions and further develop local capital markets that will enable money generated in the middle east to be invested there furthermore some argue that the increase in oil sales to asia means that in the next 50 years the arab world will increasingly look east rather than west these figures who have held positions of power for nearly two generations are uniquely placed to assess how successful the region has been in steering its way through the challenges and opportunities since the first oil boom of the mid 1970s abdullah saudi nasser saidi served as deputy governor of the lebanese central bank and a government minister in the 1990s before becoming chief economist at the dubai international financial centre in the 2000s he says the first key moment came when civil war ended the era in which beirut had been the region s financial centre the big story from lebanon s point of view is that the centre of economic geography moved from the mediterranean to the gulf he says lebanon used to be the petrodollar hub with beirut playing the leading part now the gulf can manage its own money through its domestic and free zone financial centres and to an extent they have come of age sultan nasser al suwaidi was governor of the uae central bank from 1991 to 2014 while john elkhair worked for central and commercial banks across the region and was middle east managing director for jpmorgan chase they both see the sharp increase in us interest rates in the early 1980s which led to the first falls in oil prices as the next seminal shift the most important moment in my career came when us dollar interest rates were hiked in 1981 and the impact this had on economic growth and oil prices says al suwaidi the fall in oil prices created a lot of problems for the young economies in the region our banks had had only five or six years of growth from the mid 1970s to the early 1980s then revenues went down and assets were impacted according to elkhair the importance of the oil price fall was that for the first time decision makers became aware of the cyclicality of the commodity the first time it happened it had a major impact in a region that had become used to the good times rolling on he says bankers traders and businesses had to adjust suddenly and it was a really important lesson for the big borrowers and lenders now oil price ups and downs have become part of the normal cycle and bankers are much more experienced in dealing with them as they showed in the financial crisis of 1998 and in the aftermath of the 2008 crash the effects of greater western interest in arab finance are still being felt any law adopted by the us becomes effectively international whether or not it is necessary for a local economy abdullah saudi but in kuwait the difficulties were compounded by the dramatic souk al manakh crisis of 1982 investors had piled money into this illegal stock market and when it crashed every bank but national bank of kuwait nbk was technically insolvent there was a government bailout for banks and investors ibrahim dabdoub first joined nbk in the early 1960s rising to become chief executive from 1983 to 2014 the souk al manakh crisis left dabdoub more convinced than ever of the virtues of prudent and sensible banking challenges dabdoub was soon to face an even greater challenge the iraqi invasion of kuwait his task then was to smuggle the discs that contained all the bank s data and details of its customers accounts first to jordan and then to london this gave me all the information i needed to enable us to continue to offer a banking service to our customers he says abdulkarim bucheery inevitably there was a regional impact from saddam hussain s perceived threat to the gulf s political stability and security the invasion of kuwait and the disruption that hit the region was a challenge as it was unseen and untested says elkhair i was in bahrain and saw the liquidity dry up foreign banks curtailed their business demand dropped but there was a pickup in trading and services due to the military mobilization the veteran bankers agree that the experience gained from these early financial and political difficulties taught them and their fellow leaders an important lesson in crisis management and left them much better equipped to deal with future challenges they note that the region subsequently dealt more effectively with the russia and emerging markets crashes of 1998 9 11 the us invasion of iraq in 2003 and the global economic crash of 2008 we came through the invasion by iraq and the souk al manakh crises so subsequent events caused much less panic and a desire to sort out the problems says dabdoub moreover it also become clear that while a war may have caused a short term downturn the states damaged by conflict provided lots of reconstruction business the invasion of iraq and first gulf war did impact the region but only for a short time says al suwaidi in the longer term the need for reconstruction created growth there were periods of downturn followed by reconstruction that is not to say that the region was immune from the impact of global financial crises the fallout from the 2008 sub prime crash exposed the risky lending practices of many private equity companies and some banks culminating last year in the collapse of abraaj capital moreover a consequence of 9 11 was that western regulators paid a lot more attention to the middle east financial sector as they tried to stop money laundering and terrorism financing for arab central bank governors like al suwaidi there was the challenge of explaining to american politicians how systems like the informal hawala network of money brokers really worked when oil prices are high talk of diversification goes off the agenda but when they fall there is not enough revenue to carry out reforms abdulkarim bucheery and in the longer term 9 11 had a more profound impact on the middle east than any other jurisdiction as the west regarded arab banks with even greater suspicion because it regarded them as the main route for terrorism finance al suwaidi is keen to stress that the effect was felt most strongly post 9 11 because of the anti money laundering and counter terrorism legislation but the economy did bounce back a couple of years later and did so all over the world due to lower us interest rates john elkhair however abdullah saudi who founded arab banking corporation in 1979 argues the effects of greater western interest in arab finance are still being felt any law adopted by the us becomes effectively international whether or not it is necessary for a local economy this is still causing a lot of disturbance to banks because of the amount of information they are asked to provide this is perhaps the clearest evidence that one of the key ambitions of the late 1970s to make the region independent from international interference has not been fulfilled improvements on the positive side there has been a dramatic improvement in the quality of local financial institutions and the local bankers who manage them in 1980 the gulf relied heavily on western banks mostly clustered in bahrain to recycle petrodollars the majority of local banks depended on the expertise of non nationals mainly from the us and europe to run their institutions with governments as their main shareholders they did not have to work hard to acquire deposits there was little expertise in investment banking today most banks are more professionally managed and many run by experienced nationals and they are better placed to play a leading role in managing financial deals the leading local bankers include dabdoub who year after year delivered strong performance at nbk and ali shihabi who formed his own investment bank rasmala and more recently established a washington dc geopolitics think tank the arabia foundation shihabi remembers leading a hostile takeover of saudi hollandi bank by the local mawarid group when he was just 30 this was something saudi arabia had never seen before he says the region has plenty of consultants providing long term visions but it needs to be accompanied by sound implementation strategies and processes to ensure execution yields the desired outcome of creating jobs for economies with high levels of young people john elkhair as chairman of saudi hollandi he then oversaw a restructuring over three to four years including firing all the top management and half of the staff he now admits he was too aggressive we lost share clients left us we upset a lot of people he says i learnt the lesson that in saudi arabia you do things more softly you can t take the ruthless approach that you see in new york nasser saidi other positive changes include a reduced reliance by banks on government funds islamic finance is now a mainstream business gaining greater traction across the region and becoming a commercially competitive operation it no longer involves just acting as a deposit house that offers very little return for those who wish to bank in line with their religious principles but the creation of cross border banks such as arab banking corporation and gulf international bank in the 1970s has in some respects proved to be a false dawn the region s financial sector remains fragmented and overbanked while there have been important mergers most recently between abu dhabi commercial bank united national bank and al hilal bank to create a 114 billion institution to be called adcb most takeovers are within countries rather than cross border there are still too many small financial institutions while the idea of creating a regional banking powerhouse which many political and economic leaders enthused about in the 1980s is yet to materialize financial sector regulation however has improved markedly in the 1970s regulators had for the most part failed to shake themselves free of political interference and there was a reluctance to clamp down on so called name lending since then long serving governors such as al suwaidi abdullah saif in bahrain and hamad al sayyari in saudi arabia gradually imposed stricter regulations there is no doubt that the quality of financial regulation is much higher and better now says abdulkarim bucheery chief executive of bank of bahrain and kuwait from 2008 to 2016 the move to higher standards was also helped by the introduction of financial centres in dubai and qatar regulated by international rather than local courts equity markets are also better regulated in the 1970s insider dealing was rife and suggestions of independent capital market authorities were greeted with incredulity but attitudes changed when the gulf states relaxed their opposition to foreign investment urged on by senior figures such as jammaz al suhaimi the first head of saudi arabia s capital market authority markets behave differently they force you to focus on international standards and ideas and adopt them nasser saidi it was process of change that accelerated as stock markets allowed in foreign investors who insisted on proper independent regulation and transparency failure the failure according to almost every banker and regulator has been in establishing debt markets historically corporations and governments have relied heavily on banks for their funding ibrahim dabdoub al suwaidi says there is still a need for a proper market for bonds and sukuks which will help governments and banks free up their balance sheets i want to see corporates raise money through bond markets saidi puts some of the blame for the failure to develop debt markets on to the big family businesses that have never convinced themselves that they should use the markets they have never seen the power of debt and equity markets once you get on to the markets automatically you will get international investors and they will not only provide greater scrutiny and corporate governance but are also a source of technology and new ideas commercial banks don t do this they are just lenders markets behave differently they force you to focus on international standards and ideas and adopt them a further consequence of this lack of local debt markets has been that too much regional money is placed globally rather than invested locally government sovereign wealth funds which should have been invested in developing the middle east have instead placed the bulk of their money overseas we should have been able to attract the wealth of the arab world but we lost it says saidi we have not invested enough in ourselves as well as developing debt markets there is a general consensus among the veterans that more effort must be made by the next generation of financial and political leaders to convert the ambitious plans prepared by consultants into reality they should says elkhair look at the need for long term planning even so there is general agreement that the quality of economic management has improved the region he says has plenty of consultants providing long term visions but it needs to be accompanied by sound implementation strategies and processes to ensure execution yields the desired outcome of creating jobs for economies with high levels of young people the message from the past few decades is the importance of managing the economy rightly and effectively including resources and the price at which they are sold says bucheery the way a country s top team manages things is critical in dubai there is a team of talented entrepreneurs qatar has dynamic young leadership as do bahrain and saudi arabia we came through the invasion by iraq and the souk al manakh crises so subsequent events caused much less panic and a desire to sort out the problems ibrahim dabdoub much has been achieved even though the gulf states have been less successful when it comes to working together through institutions the creation of the gulf cooperation council gcc in 1981 was meant to herald an era in which regional states did not compete directly with each other but shared responsibility for a particular industry such as ship repair the concept was stillborn not least because dubai refused to accept it and systematically and successfully challenged bahrain which argued that it should be the centre for ship yards aluminium production airlines and most importantly finance in part bahrain was itself to blame as it failed to take the rivalry from dubai seriously in the 1970s sultan nasser al suwaidi nor have plans to diversify the economy away from a reliance on oil revenue been successful billions have been invested in property in the region while some states particularly dubai have developed a booming tourism sector and service industries such as airlines and free zones but the vision of establishing manufacturing industries in sectors that are not oil dependent has not been brought to reality in part it is an inevitable consequence of political and economic pressures when oil prices are high talk of diversification goes off the agenda says bucheery but when they fall there is not enough revenue to carry out reforms al suwaidi still thinks there are opportunities we can create opportunities for diversification he says for example we can develop our tourism further and we need a good train system to go round the gulf different economies have tried to diversify and some have been more successful than others there is a chance to diversify but we need to rethink the process and come up with strategies there has also been an acceptance that large government subsidies to kick start industries like agriculture have not really justified the investment further challenges says saidi will come from the need to adapt to technological developments both those in finance and those brought on by the speed of decarbonization while remaining internationally competitive different economies have tried to diversify and some have been more successful than others there is a chance to diversify but we need to rethink the process and come up with strategies sultan nasser al suwaidi the challenge of diversifying the regional economy has been made much more difficult says elkhair because the low labour costs of chinese and other east asian countries have made it much harder to attract industry next generation one of the key questions for the next generation of leaders is whether or not the focus of middle east governments will shift from the west to asia for 50 years gulf governments have looked to the us and europe as their main trading and political partners now as more oil is sold to china and other asian countries and as china looks to extend its political influence to the region this could change saidi is in no doubt he sees a tectonic shift from the us to china which is much more prepared to act as a development partner when i look at what china does he continues i see a country that invests in infrastructure and into supply chains in the decades ahead this will lead to a transformation look at the prospective rebuilding of syria iraq yemen lebanon and sudan and you will see that funding will come from the gcc and china who will be involved in construction sector chinese and gcc developers will successfully develop partnerships and joint ventures for reconstruction and development the new generation of gulf leaders has much to do in terms of completing the work begun by their predecessors but they have been given the considerable legacy of economies and financial sectors that are now capable of building on the successes of the last 50 years and performing resiliently in the face of political and economic turmoil
the king abdullah financial district in riyadh saudi arabia bnp paribas may still have its middle east and africa headquarters in bahrain but many of its employees there will tell you at least off the record that they would like to leave their favoured destination dubai of course bnpp is the last of the global banks to be based in bahrain s financial harbour manama japan s mufg is also there but its main regional office is in dubai the other big international institutions are not in bahrain at all and their employees only rarely visit when they do it is usually to enjoy a brief respite from the emirati buzz rather than for bahrain s intrinsic business appeal the french bank s enduring commitment to the small gulf state serves as a reminder of a time when dubai did not yet hold the status of the region s preeminent financial hub a time when abu dhabi beirut cairo doha kuwait city manama and even tehran all tussled for the top spot before a small deserted emirate took the lead and never let go euromoney has documented every twist and turn in this saga over the past 50 years it was there in the early 1970s when beirut seemed like the natural home of middle east banking during the two decades that followed when bahrain took on that status and in the 2000s when dubai mounted an extraordinary effort to create a financial zone that would eventually become the most successful banking hub the region had yet known already at the start of the 2000s in the early days of the dubai international financial centre difc the emirate s draw seemed near impossible to resist between 2002 and 2006 michel accad headed citi s middle east and north africa division from cairo the result of a combination of circumstances rather than a considered decision by the bank accad now chief executive of al ahli bank of kuwait recalls feeling removed from the main hive of activity that was dubai and he made sure to travel there as often as possible michel accad citi it was a bit of an accident he tells euromoney of his being based in egypt asked if he was the only regional head at a big bank based outside dubai at the time he laughs and says i think so yes citi moved its regional headquarters to the difc in 2006 dubai s ability to attract the world s top financial institutions only grew stronger in the years that followed today it hosts not just legacy western banks but all manner of financial institutions from around the world including asia s largest bank by assets industrial and commercial bank of china and africa s standard bank still there are reasons to believe that the competition for regional dominance is back on the dramatic fall in the price of oil five years ago made those cities that had lost the fight to dubai years ago realize once again the importance of a diversified economy supported by a broad base of banks with deep pockets the emergence of new technology from cryptocurrencies to artificial intelligence has also upended common conceptions of what it means to be a financial centre putting innovation ahead of physical size and status we need to do much more i don t see competition as bad i want to see the creation of more hubs i want to see the creation of much more activity richard teng adgm finally the realization that the middle east in general including dubai has enduring deficiencies in various areas of finance has given other regulators hope that there are opportunities for their respective jurisdictions to get ahead rather than simply follow their emirati neighbour s lead we need to do much more richard teng the chief regulator of abu dhabi s financial free zone adgm tells euromoney i don t see competition as bad i want to see the creation of more hubs i want to see the creation of much more activity adgm is certainly working towards that goal even poaching from the difc to achieve it its 2014 hire of jan bladen the chief operator of the difc s regulatory authority to become its executive adviser and programme lead was one such aggressive move other centres from egypt to bahrain are also fighting hard to make themselves attractive to international finance once again this is the story of how dubai reached the top and what its rivals are now doing to get some of its business back limited capability beirut in the 1960s and early 1970s was not the ideal place for banking deposit taking was meagre the dollar interbank market was unsophisticated and there was only limited syndication of medium term loans it was even by the standards of the day a place of limited capability but for years almost every banker would have pointed to beirut as the region s most accomplished banking hub the city s fun loving lifestyle and five star hotels attracted not only brigitte bardot and marlon brando but hundreds of expatriate financiers too there were other reasons behind its attractiveness known as the paris of the middle east it could also lay claim to being the region s zurich as lebanon s banking secrecy laws made it a particularly welcoming place for wealth management and private banking bankers could also rely on a broader economy as beirut served as a big port for the whole region connecting lebanon syria jordan iran and iraq to the rest of the mediterranean and beyond these factors combined to make lebanon s capital a financial hub for the region such was its status that in a 1976 issue of euromoney klaus tjaden commerzbank s middle east representative called the city irreplaceable as a service and information centre for the region but even a dominant hub can be bested by its neighbours if they go about it the right way where the bankers went after beirut and why they will go back was the headline of that article which covered bankers exodus from lebanon during the country s civil war but even as euromoney rooted for the resilience of beirut it cited alan moore director general of the bahrain monetary authority who subtly undermined his rival beirut was never a major centre for dealing in wholesale money markets he said these were the early days of the struggle for the top spot in middle east banking bahrain was lining up to take over beirut s mantle but in the mid 1970s everything still seemed possible and each city s claim to dominance was credible in its own way kuwait a vital commercial centre with vast reserves of oil and cairo a city that boasted some of the best managerial talent in the region took it in turns through the 1970s of being named the future financial centre of the middle east in the uae abu dhabi already had a large resource based economy that might have appealed to the financial sector while dubai was setting up an important commercial centre and transportation hub in large part the result of efforts by the enterprising sheikh rashid at the start of the decade neither was ready to come to prominence yet but both were in the running even tehran won the support of michael von clemm executive director at credit suisse white weld in london in the pages of euromoney in 1975 iran s deep and varied economy supportive political climate increasingly specialized banking sector and skilled management class meant that compared with the illiberal policies and or economic shallowness of its arab rivals von clemm argued tehran stood every chance of being the region s most important financial market that put it he concluded in the world league of banking communities euromoney s editor at the time padraic fallon also felt that iran had the most coherent policies for making the best use of its resources and might therefore be stealing a march on cairo and beirut to turn teheran into the most sophisticated financial centre in the middle east that was until iran s islamic revolution four years later which abruptly ended those plans tehran s financial sector has been more or less isolated from the outside world in the 40 years since the stock exchange in tehran not as impressive as first touted bahrain s rise and then there was bahrain at first it did not look like it had the potential to outsmart its rivals manama was hardly an attractive place to live for young bankers looking for excitement abroad more importantly setting up an offshore banking unit there was expensive in the 1970s capital expenditure and operating costs with a staff of just 15 could rise to as much as 1 7 million equivalent to about 7 7 million today for the bahrfirst year but bahrain displayed a number of advantages that beirut and all of its other rivals lacked its geographical position at the heart of the persian gulf close to those countries with the greatest oil wealth a more stable political environment than many of its neighbours and crucially relatively liberal banking regulation owing in part to the uk s recent rule over the kingdom such was bahrain s rise through the 1970s that it was little surprise when nemir kirdar a protégé of david rockefeller and former head of chase manhattan bank s operations in the persian gulf established a new pan middle eastern business in manama at the start of the following decade investcorp as it was named was able to pool capital from hundreds of the gulf s wealthiest to invest in projects in the middle east and the west it quickly became the largest private sector investment company in the region a privately owned parallel to the powerful gulf cooperation council gcc formed at around the same time the bahraini royal family eager to drive the growth of the country s financial sector as beirut s star dimmed supported the project wholeheartedly it s the first real investment bank to be set up in the gulf boasted investcorp chairman abdul rahim al atiqi to euromoney in 1983 it was also the most international of the region s home grown financial firms i think it will be a catalyst for change in the region s financial markets andrew dixon hsbc middle east over the last two decades of the 20th century bahrain asserted itself as the financial heart of the middle east through oil s highs and lows in the mid 1970s around 30 banks had licences to establish themselves in manama by the turn of the century manama was home to 48 offshore banking units 32 investment banks 20 of them islamic 19 onshore commercial banks 40 representative offices of international banks 17 money changers and nine investment advisory firms making it the most densely packed financial hub in the region that was the high point of bahrain s dominance dubai having become an important commercial and transportation hub was also ready to make an impact in finance that ambition took shape in 2002 with the foundation of the difc and two years later with the start of its operations the centre offered a haven for international banking providing foreign institutions with a special regulatory regime inspired by familiar english law exempting its members from the local legal regime applicable to domestic banks while bankers viewed bahrain s regulators favourably bahraini laws were not as auspicious to foreign institutions and a series of popular uprisings there in the 1990s had shaken bankers trust in the safety and stability of the country the gate dubai the grandeur of dubai s design was what differentiated the emirate from its rivals while others anguished over the need to provide investable opportunities for local and international money dubai moved rapidly building up a hub for capital markets insurance offshore banking and islamic banking to drive the project forward it went on a charm offensive attracting top names in international finance including ian hay davison former chief executive and deputy chairman of lloyd s of london to head the regulatory council of the proposed centre then came the 2003 world bank and imf annual meeting held for the first and only time in dubai that choice would prove momentous for the fast growing city as it showcased its potential to visiting businesspeople bankers and officials fourteen thousand delegates descended on the emirate which had built a conference centre from scratch to host the panels two new grand hotels the shangri la and grand hyatt to host the guests and new roads to carry them from one location to another i think it will be a catalyst for change in the region s financial markets andrew dixon then chairman of hsbc middle east told euromoney before the event he was right the new dubai was born that september it had retained its authoritarianism no outdoor protests took place alongside the event and added to that the sheen and appeal of a modern hospitality and business hub having a regulator tailored to the needs of international banks proved an irresistible pull the 110 acres of land attributed to the difc were soon teeming with thousands of suits it was not all plain sailing in 2004 hay davison was dismissed from the difc a story that he first told in detail in the pages of euromoney the following year as he revealed then powerful elements in abu dhabi were unhappy with dubai s plans the emirati central bank feared that it might lose influence because of the creation of a new and independent financial centre and regulator with the power to grant banking licences and supervise its own stock exchange hay davison revealed further internal struggles including the indignity of seeing the centre s chief regulator s computer seized by emirati authorities a most foolish act he said at the time because it makes it most unlikely that the dfsa will ever be able to enjoy confidential relations with other regulators around the world he was wrong about that it took time but dubai eventually healed these wounds and retrieved enough international faith in its governance to achieve its ambitions as a financial centre still dubai faced other challenges over the years first among them its real estate crash a decade ago euromoney predicted that crisis in october 2008 in a piece that lambasted the emirate s useless state sponsored real estate projects as well as its deluded and quixotic financial centre when the property bubble finally burst it became clear that as much as a quarter of dubai banks deposits had been extended to the real estate sector a market whose astronomical prices had been fuelled by years of speculation as euromoney reported at the time dubai s hallucinatory financial visions are over in its own way it is joining the rest of the world in long overdue crisis and retraction dubai s oil rich neighbour and political senior abu dhabi funded dubai s way out of the crisis a humiliation for a city that believed its many business successes including that in finance had earned it the respect and envy of its peers as one banker said then of dubai s hubris the model wasn t wrong but the concept grew too big too quickly dubai survived according to shayne nelson chief executive of emirates nbd it learned from those mistakes if you look back at most of the problems that dubai government linked companies had very few had major problems in the end in dubai he says it was all the offshore investments they did that s a lesson we have to have when you know your own market and your own demand you can move forward ultimately however that crisis made clear that the emirate s financial miracle was like any other subject to booms and busts now other cities are once again mounting efforts to build thriving financial centres few can realistically hope to take over dubai s role as the region s preeminent hub for the foreseeable future at least but abu dhabi kuwait qatar saudi arabia and others have come to the realization that their interests would be better served by hosting foreign banks rather than relying on dubai although hundreds of bankers and investors fly in to meet their sovereign wealth funds few stick around financiers are happy dealing with the region s vast oil wealth but they typically do it out of dubai and therefore contribute little to the financial life of the broader region economic diversification the dramatic drop in the price of oil five years ago impressed upon complacent local leaders that this situation was no longer tenable hence the drastic plans for economic diversification that have sprouted across the gulf in the years since with saudi arabia abu dhabi and qatar declaring their intention to radically transform themselves by 2030 and kuwait by 2035 each of these plans includes as a central pillar the development of a financial centre they certainly have the funds to build the required infrastructure al maryah island the home of abu dhabi s financial free zone adgm is home to a lot of office space saudi arabia s king abdullah financial district has a cluster of skyscrapers that cuts an impressive figure against riyadh s otherwise low skyline kuwait meanwhile has recently rekindled its ambition to build silk city a massive new urban development that would also host a financial centre but having the infrastructure to house financial institutions in no way guarantees that they will come many gulf officials have realized that specialization is the key to attracting talent dubai is the ultimate generalist but it is not equally strong in every area of business finding niche sectors of finance in which they can thrive and developing their particular strengths is the only pathway to reclaim some business from the difc bahrain for example is still a hub for the local incorporation of mutual funds it is also a big centre for islamic banking home to al baraka bank khaleeji commercial bank kuwait finance house and many more it can build on these strengths another one of bahrain s strengths is the low cost of setting up shop there thanks in large part to the fact that foreign banks do not have to rent real estate in a densely crowded financial centre as in dubai but can instead settle anywhere in the country while still benefiting from the same laws dalal buhejji a senior financial services manager at bahrain s economic development board tells euromoney that this cost effectiveness combined with bahrain s heavy focus on finance it is the largest private sector contributor to the economy after oil and gas make it an ideal place for foreign banks dalal buhejji bahrain s economic development board when financial institutions look at expanding to the region she says bahrain is always one of the first countries they look at because there is the right framework for them to establish a presence others too have cards to play saudi arabia for one has promised large privatization deals public listings and debt issues as part of its reform programme saudi aramco s multi billion dollar ipo is still on the table at least in theory and the kingdom s debut sovereign bond issuance has broken records for size and investor reception foreign bankers have flocked to riyadh to meet decision makers there and last year citi opened an office on the ground speaking of the changes in saudi arabia richad soundardjee middle east head at société générale tells euromoney that the oil price fall has made certain jurisdictions more attractive to banking by definition you had very big chunks of the region and saudi arabia is the best example that literally discovered debt he says the sovereigns in particular and the sovereign related entities in saudi arabia needed international banks with appetite for the region that is exactly what we are abu dhabi is also making itself more attractive the combining in 2017 of first gulf bank and national bank of abu dhabi to form first abu dhabi bank has put the emirate firmly on the map of regional finance thanks to that merger abu dhabi is now home to the second largest bank by assets in the middle east after qatar national bank but crucially ahead of dubai s emirates nbd another planned merger of abu dhabi commercial bank with union national bank and al hilal bank will add to abu dhabi s significance in the gulf s financial landscape abu dhabi is also working hard to create bridges with china whose international trade and infrastructure policies could boost banking activity in the region the recent visit of the chinese premier bodes well in that regard as does the planned establishment of a belt and road stock exchange in adgm which would create a close relationship between abu dhabi s financial centre and shanghai s exchange even the more politically troubled landscape of cairo is showing some signs of rejuvenation egypt s investment banking scene has grown markedly in recent years with the international expansion of both efg hermes and beltone financial trust in egypt s financial sector more broadly has benefited from the central bank s decision to allow the egyptian pound to float freely financial technology crucially regulators across the region have come to see financial technology as a means to get ahead since the large incumbent banks are well established in dubai burgeoning banking hubs might better spend their energy on attracting digital startups looking for a home these firms may favour a less expensive city they may also be less picky about where there are headquartered because they do not necessarily require a bricks and mortar presence in every country in which they wish to operate bahrain and abu dhabi have made headway in this area both setting up early regulatory sandboxes that have received a large number of applications from companies in the gulf and beyond including those from the uk and silicon valley adgm was the first in the region to introduce a regulatory regime in relation to the spot trading of crypto assets again an indication of its desire to overtake dubai in this space to succeed in this goal collaboration may also benefit the smaller financial centres late last year abu dhabi and bahrain signed a memorandum of understanding to exchange expertise on financial technology and to improve their respective regulations we are very keen about working together to make sure that the financial services sector across the gcc is thriving says buhejji that is even more important now with fintech because these companies don t look at one single country they look at the whole region the more connectivity a financial centre has across the broader region the more likely it is to attract startups however despite the progress big challenges still hold the rivals back kuwait s vision of growth is sluggish and many doubt that it can deliver on silk city which has been in the works for many years in 2017 one of the architects of the project told euromoney that she was unsure if the city would ever see the light of day similarly saudi arabia has been criticized for the slow pace at which it is delivering its objectives there are delays to privatizations for example and concerns over the leadership s willingness and ability to reform saudi society as comprehensively as initially stated king abdullah financial district may be up but it is still a ghost town as for qatar it may have in qnb the region s largest bank with a strong international presence reaching as far as southeast asia and africa but the country s blockade by its neighbours in the gulf has largely isolated doha from the rest of the region s financial industry it is unlikely to emerge as much of a hub in these conditions abu dhabi meanwhile still suffers from its proximity to dubai while adgm is still too young to have properly demonstrated its worth poster child for now at least dubai seems likely to retain the crown on background difc regulators say they are hardly worried about the competition they say dubai is not resting on its laurels but consistently outpacing its competitors including in fintech richard teng adgm enbd s nelson who first visited dubai in 1998 is very much of that opinion to illustrate that point he says that what most surprised him when he joined the emirati bank from standard chartered five years ago was the quality of the technology available dubai seems unlikely to fall behind on the latest developments in digital banking to its neighbours dubai still is the poster child for a successful financial centre teng is eager to stress that adgm s model is not inspired by the difc there are free zones all around the world he says clearly tired of the constant comparisons drawn between abu dhabi s hub and dubai s but it is hard to see how it couldn t be even adgm s size 114 hectares is virtually identical to the difc s still dubai s continued dominance does not prevent others from playing an increasingly important role whether it is in fintech asian trade private banking or islamic finance the middle east is still heavily reliant on foreign finance it could do far more to increase home grown wealth management stock listings small and medium sized enterprise lending and debt capital market access for local corporates many of these products are sourced outside the region even dubai has not been able to fully capture these activities there is room for much more financing activity in the middle east in reality it doesn t much matter whether it takes place in dubai or elsewhere as long as it takes place in the region

tonight i would like to discuss dr willis s wisdom and his original vision for the federal reserve i will also talk about how the fed s role has evolved and the ways in which the founders intentions continue to be relevant to policy discussions today the fed was founded to manage monetary conditions in the united states and reserve bank lending to member banks was central to accomplishing that goal in accordance with the real bills doctrine of which willis was a leading proponent monetary policy would be appropriate if the fed was permitted to lend only against certain classes of assets but within a decade of its founding the fed shifted toward conducting monetary policy via outright purchases and sales of treasury securities as we do today and over time lending became entirely divorced from monetary policy nonetheless the fed s lending powers have persisted and have been used in ways willis and the other founders likely never envisioned or intended this lending contributed to the most recent financial crisis i would argue by making our financial system more fragile a re examination of the origins of the fed s lending authorities and the evolution of their use thus seems well warranted before i begin i should note that the views i express are my own and might not be shared by my former colleagues in the federal reserve system the currency problem in 1923 willis published a book describing the workings of the 10 year old federal reserve system and detailing the vigorous debates that preceded the fed s creation and continued during its first few years of operation in the introduction he wrote if the federal reserve system is to render the service for which it was originally designed it must overcome the prejudice and misunderstanding that are now evidently gathering about it if it is to fulfil its entire function as a genuine central banking system it must retrace its steps in some particulars and evolve a more effective and general type of service i believe these words are as applicable today as they were nearly a century ago and that our financial system would be well served by retracing some steps and clearing up some misunderstandings the founders of the federal reserve system were motivated by the many banking panics the united states had experienced since the end of the civil war perhaps most famously the panic of 1907 which was the final straw for many bankers and policymakers 2 while these panics varied in their nature and severity there was widespread agreement on the fundamental problem the supply of currency i e paper notes and coins was inelastic meaning it didn t easily expand and contract with the needs of the economy this was a result of the national banking acts of 1863 and 1864 which required currency to be backed by certain u s government bonds the process a bank had to go through to issue new notes could take as long as three weeks which made it difficult for banks to supply enough currency during seasonal increases in demand such as the fall harvest or the holiday shopping seasons moen and tallman 2015b banks also struggled to provide enough currency during panics when many people tried to withdraw their deposits at the same time an additional problem was the fragmentation of the banking industry branching restrictions meant that essentially every town had its own small bank to the tune of more than 25 000 banks in the united states by 1914 board of governors 1976 this unit banking system meant that banks were highly vulnerable to local economic shocks and they were unable to diversify risks across regions or head off bank runs by moving funds between branches 3 the so called country banks and city banks were connected via an intricate web of correspondent relationships and clearinghouses this system made it possible to clear and settle check payments efficiently and distribute currency nationwide but it also meant that strains could spread quickly from city banks to country banks and vice versa particularly in the fall when the seasonal demand for currency was already high when these strains developed into full blown banking crises the country banks often found themselves cut off when clearinghouses restricted the withdrawal of currency in order to protect clearinghouse members in the city the result was frequent spikes in interest rates and sometimes when the demand for notes was particularly acute the suspension of payments to depositors 4 together the restrictions on new note issue the prohibitions on branching and the correspondent bank system had created a currency problem this is the problem the fed s founders were trying to solve the real bills doctrine but how to solve it widespread public debate in the 1890s and early 1900s produced a plethora of proposals for banking reform in 1911 senator nelson aldrich r ri introduced a plan for a new central bank modeled after the ideas of paul warburg the german american financier 5 the aldrich plan featured a single national reserve association but it met stiff resistance from democrats see romero 2015 after woodrow wilson was elected president in 1912 he asked rep carter glass a democrat from lynchburg va to draft a currency bill glass enlisted willis and together after extensive research they settled on a modified plan that featured a system of regional clearinghouse banks that would pool the reserves of their member banks and have the authority to issue paper notes 6 through a process called rediscounting banks could assign their regional reserve bank some of their own assets at a discount essentially an implied interest rate and receive currency or reserves in exchange this is the origin of the discount window lending facility provided by the federal reserve banks without the federated structure introduced by glass and willis the act would have had little chance of success in the democrat controlled houses of congress willis and glass along with others with a hand in the federal reserve act had a critical choice to make what assets would the reserve banks hold the choice would govern the amount of reserves and currency supplied by the reserve banks over time they considered making u s government bonds eligible for rediscounting but money backed only by government bonds was associated with inflationary wartime finance eventually the founders settled on a class of financial instruments that we now call commercial paper 7 these were short term obligations that arose from financing trade because they were secured by goods in transit and endorsed by banks they were relatively safe so the federal reserve banks were given the authority to purchase or make loans backed by certain types of commercial paper this approach reflects what is known as the real bills doctrine which held that if currency was backed by banks lending against sound short term commercial paper then the money supply would automatically fluctuate with the needs of commerce and inflationary increases in the money supply would be impossible 8 the doctrine is based on a distinction between lending based on real productive activity which would be an appropriate backing for note issue and so called speculative lending that financed purchases of financial assets such as stocks or debentures note issue tied to speculation was believed to cause inflationary boom bust cycles willis was a firm believer in the real bills doctrine and was instrumental in writing it into the federal reserve act as he wrote in 1923 strictly and carefully framed the original provisions of the act were intended to prevent the issue of notes save as the result of the discount of actual bona fide commercial paper willis 1923 1521 the real bills doctrine has largely been discredited because it fails to recognize the fungibility of bank funding mints 1945 even if real bills are the only allowable collateral for discount window loans in practice such loans would allow the borrowing bank to acquire any asset 9 thus a real bills policy does not necessarily serve as an effective check on inflationary lending moreover the real bills theory presumed adherence to the gold standard that is a government mint standing ready to buy or sell gold at a fixed price in terms of currency without that institutional backdrop monetary policy under a real bills approach is untethered if prices increase the dollar volume of loans will expand to fund the same number of real transactions these loans then increase the money supply which raises prices which increases the volume of loans and so on in a never ending inflationary cycle humphrey 1982 4 a similar feedback loop can occur in a deflationary contraction and adherence to the real bills doctrine is viewed as one of the reasons the fed allowed the money supply to collapse in the great depression 10 willis persisted in defending the real bills doctrine well into the 1930s and he opposed policies that might have prevented or limited the great depression friedman and schwartz 1963 meltzer 2003 humphrey and timberlake 2019 but in his defense willis and other proponents of the real bills doctrine were making a valiant attempt to constrain monetary policy by tying the stock of money to the fluctuating needs of the economy so that it was neither excessive nor insufficient in modern terms he was looking for a way to institutionalize price stability the fed as lender of last resort as i have discussed the fed was created to solve the currency problem but there s a popular myth that the fed was created to lend to distressed institutions that are unable to find credit in the marketplace the idea that a central bank should serve as a lender of last resort is widely attributed to the 19th century author walter bagehot and his writings about the bank of england although henry thornton articulated the concept much earlier 11 while the intellectual history of this notion is beyond the scope of my remarks this evening suffice it to say that what bagehot and thornton had in mind is quite clear the purpose of lender of last resort operations was to expand the supply of bank notes when depositors attempt to make substantial withdrawals as they did during 19th century bank panics under a fractional reserve banking system such wholesale shifts runs from deposits to currency would be disruptive and deflationary without accommodating increases in currency supply providing central bank loans to distressed institutions as the fed has done at various times throughout its history was a byproduct not the objective of the institutional mechanism by which the bank of england managed the note supply 12 in fact the idea that the fed would serve as a lender to failing banks is noticeably absent from the founders statements on the federal reserve act and from the act itself in a report willis prepared to explain the bill to the house committee on banking and currency for example he wrote that a fundamental element of the banking reform bill was the creation of a joint mechanism for the extension of credit to banks which possess sound assets and which desire to liquidate them for the purpose of meeting legitimate commercial agricultural and industrial demands on the part of their clientele a deliberately narrow prescription willis 1923 283 in part the absence of lending to distressed banks reflects the founders beliefs that a central bank would prevent financial panics from occurring in the first place by making the currency more elastic and by making it easier for banks to access reserves during financial strains bordo and wheelock 2011 but it also reflects their views on moral hazard willis for instance also noted the adverse consequences of the treasury s practice of placing its own funds with large money center banks in the decades before the fed s founding the practice inevitably tended toward scandal since it was not long before some of the larger institutions which themselves were heavy lenders in the stock market began to exceed the bounds of prudence in the belief that at almost any time they could count upon getting aid from the treasury in the form of special government deposits the founders concern about moral hazard also was exemplified by their opposition to deposit insurance at the time willis and glass started working on the federal reserve act the idea of deposit insurance had attained a hold upon the popular mind willis 1923 134 and they were willing to consider including it for the sake of getting the act passed but ultimately they decided against deposit insurance and remained vocal opponents to it even after the rash of bank failures in the late 1920s and early 1930s willis for example attributed these failures to poor management bank failures have been numerous and they have been largely due to the unwise grant of charters to improper groups of people often under political influence and as a result we have a host of weak unreliable banks that crowd one another out of existence by being too numerously organized in places where there is no support for the multifarious institutions that have been established there both willis and glass believed deposit insurance would only make the problem of overbanking worse by reducing depositors incentives to monitor the bank s soundness and although the 1933 bill that established the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic bore glass s name he resisted its inclusion until the very end and acquiesced only out of political necessity calomiris and white 1994 166 74 the turn to treasuries let me return now to the early days of the federal reserve even though the fed s founders had rejected government bonds as a backing for currency the act did give the fed the authority to purchase government bonds and other assets on the open market but this authority was little used until the united states entered world war i in the spring of 1917 quickly the fed s focus shifted from furnishing an elastic currency to supporting the war effort this support took a variety of forms including marketing war bonds and lending at preferential interest rates to fund the purchase of war bonds and treasury certificates even after inflation began to rise the fed maintained low interest rates to facilitate government spending on the war davies 2013 willis recognized that the fed s actions had contributed to the allies eventual success and that the war had afforded the fed a tremendous opportunity to increase its assets and operations willis 1923 849 at the same time however he lamented the subjugation of the fed s original purpose to the needs of the treasury in his 1923 book he wrote that the federal reserve system was obliged to submit to many policies with which it had no sympathy and which it accepted simply because of the existence of war and the belief that any opposition or resistance would be not only futile but to the rank and file of citizens would seem unpatriotic he welcomed the war s end and the chance for the fed to assume some measure of independence and begin the task of developing policies which conceivably would lead to a restoration of normality and soundness in business and banking throughout the country willis 1923 1273 74 willis did not foresee the significant shift that was about to occur in the fed s policy tools as i ve discussed the federal reserve act intended for the rediscounting of commercial paper to be the primary method for managing the money supply but in the early 1920s fed officials discovered almost by accident that buying and selling securities in the open market could be an effective tool of monetary policy this occurred in 1922 when regional reserve banks bought large volumes of government bonds to shore up their earnings after a deflation in 1921 member banks had paid back much of what they had borrowed during the war fed officials realized that these purchases rippled throughout the entire banking system affecting banks lending to the public and they began studying this mechanism in earnest burgess 1964 over the next several decades open market operations in u s treasury securities became the predominant means of managing monetary conditions supplanting the role of the discount window simultaneously the ties that bound monetary policy to the gold standard loosened and were severed for good in 1971 completing the transition to a fiat monetary system 13 by the end of the century the fed was conducting monetary policy simply by setting a target for the interest rate on interbank lending of reserves the federal funds rate and then adjusting the supply of reserves using open market purchases to meet demand at that rate discount window lending was generally an overnight safety valve for banks experiencing an unexpected outflow of reserve account balances late in the day discount window lending was routinely sterilized meaning the fed engaged in open market operations to offset the lending s effects and avoid having the additional reserves drive the federal funds rate below target see madigan and nelson 2002 it s important to emphasize the distinction between this kind of discount window lending and the lending willis envisioned when the fed s lending is sterilized it changes the composition of the fed s asset portfolio without changing its monetary liabilities in this case fed lending effectively constitutes fiscal policy the fed can be thought of as selling treasury securities to the public and lending the proceeds to the borrower goodfriend and king 1988 but when the fed was founded direct lending to banks was a form of monetary policy since it affected the central bank s monetary liabilities and thus the supply of money in short as the fed shifted to using open market operations to affect monetary conditions discount window lending became a vestigial appendage essentially divorced from the conduct of monetary policy lacker 2014a 2014c fed lending evolves although direct lending to banks is no longer a meaningful monetary policy tool the fed s authority and willingness to engage in direct lending to both banks and nonbanks has expanded substantially over the years during the great depression for example congress amended section 13 of the federal reserve act to give nonbanks access to the fed s discount window in unusual and exigent circumstances many decades later this amendment would allow the fed to expand its lending programs during the financial crisis congress also expanded the assets reserve banks could accept as collateral and gave the fed the authority to loan working capital to established business firms that couldn t find capital elsewhere although this authority was revoked in the late 1950s also during the great depression congress established the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic as a response to the thousands of bank failures between 1929 and 1933 it s worth noting that deposit insurance found its way into the legislation not because it was the most effective way to shore up the banking system that would have been to allow bank branching and consolidation but because politically influential populist and agrarian groups wanted to preserve locally controlled banks calomiris and white 1994 over time the fdic and the fed drifted into rescuing uninsured creditors a drift that turned into a tidal wave in the 1970s in 1970 the railroad penn central transportation company defaulted on 82 million in commercial paper obligations calomiris 1994 the fed responded by encouraging banks to borrow from the fed to purchase commercial paper thus providing support to securities markets in 1972 the fdic gave the 1 2 billion bank of the commonwealth a 60 million line of credit that prevented its failure in 1974 the fed lent 1 7 billion to franklin national bank and assumed 725 million of its foreign exchange book in 1984 the failing 40 billion bank continental illinois was able to borrow from the discount window even as it was receiving a capital injection from the fdic sprague 2000 14 this sequence of actions built and reinforced investors expectations that the fed would respond to the distress of large financial firms by rescuing their short term creditors these precedents encouraged such firms to rely more heavily on short term wholesale funding that depended on the fed s implicit backstop over time this made the financial system more and more fragile richmond fed economists have estimated that in 1999 about 45 percent of the financial sector s liabilities were protected by both an explicit and implicit government safety net by 2015 that number had reached 62 percent see marshall pellerin and walter 2017 lacker 2013a the fed s special lending facilities and other interventions early in the financial crisis further reinforced investors expectations of rescue the guiding motive behind these actions was the notion that credit markets were malfunctioning and central bank lending was the fix arguably market participants inferred that the fed was standing by ready to rescue the creditors of financial institutions that showed signs of distress surely this dampened the incentives of large financial firms such as bear stearns and lehman brothers to strengthen their positions by raising additional equity or reducing their reliance on short term funding by doing so the fed s actions in late 2007 and early 2008 may ultimately have made the late stages of the crisis more disruptive policymakers at that time were not unaware of the potential to exacerbate moral hazard but in cases of financial distress policymakers have to choose between on the one hand easing investors pain and thus avoiding political recrimination for inaction and on the other reinforcing healthy incentives for investors to manage risk taking goodfriend and lacker 1999 this is a classic example of a time consistency problem a situation in which the exigencies of the moment conflict with a commitment you would like to uphold and would like people to believe you will uphold in the future providing the central bank with broad discretion to make loans in times of financial crisis certainly allows the public sector to respond more rapidly than if such lending were carried out by the treasury subject to the usual constraints of needing to obtain congressional authorization and appropriation but those constraints are the essence of the constitutional checks and balances that prevent arbitrary uses of government power such actions will always be politically charged because the appropriateness of emergency lending can never be unambiguously validated in real time and sometimes not even with considerable hindsight as a consequence the discretion to take such actions can undermine a central bank s claim to deserve independence from political scrutiny and can thereby impede the effectiveness of monetary policy the way forward let me briefly sum up the argument i have made this evening the fed s founders including most influentially parker willis gave the fed direct lending authority as a means to conduct monetary policy in accordance with their belief in the real bills doctrine but the fed soon shifted to conducting monetary policy by buying and selling u s treasury securities on the open market fed lending became divorced from monetary policy and untethered from the fed s fundamental mission over time the fed s direct lending as distinct from lending driven by monetary policy increased in both scale and scope while in any one instance the fed s lending can ease the immediate pain of financial market distress over time it fosters an expectation that the creditors of large distressed financial institutions will be rescued this has encouraged fragile financial arrangements and contributed significantly to the most recent financial crisis in my view the fed s lending authority may have become more of a hindrance rather than a help what can we do moving forward there are several steps i believe we can take to improve financial institutions incentives such as requiring detailed resolution planning so called living wills by large financial firms as stipulated in the dodd frank act lacker 2013a modifications to the bankruptcy code could reduce the burdens associated with resolving the failure of such firms through bankruptcy without government assistance lacker 2014b but the final step toward transparent lending policy and well aligned incentives might require repealing the fed s remaining emergency lending powers given the trade offs policymakers face in crisis situations this might be the only way to ensure that policymakers can credibly commit to forgoing such ad hoc rescues 15 in today s world the fed can conduct monetary policy perfectly well with a portfolio that consists only of treasuries 16 moreover that provides ample ability to increase market liquidity in times of financial distress without the need to subsidize the creditors of failing firms one can only speculate about what parker willis and his colleagues would do if they were here today trying to achieve the same objectives as in 1913 but with a full understanding of today s financial system but a case can be made that they would write the federal reserve act with only a very limited discount window function and would restrict the fed s portfolio to treasuries only their primary goal was monetary stability the fed has achieved low and relatively stable inflation over the last several decades operating predominantly in treasury securities and without an anchor to gold this experience would have convinced these practical men i believe that in the long run our financial system and our economy will be best served if the fed s commitment to and focus on its monetary policy objective is maintained thank you for your kind attention this evening and thank you to washington and lee

november 28 1922 when a member bank s reserve balance is impaired it borrows to make it good and it is quite impossible to determine to what particular purpose the money so borrowed be applied makes little difference to the borrowing bank what transactions may have caused the impairment of its reserve because the paper which it discounts at the reserve bank may have no relation whatever to the

overview it is an eventful day but the capital markets are taking it in stride equity markets are mixed asia may have been weighed down by china s shaving its growth target and announced around cny2 trillion 300 bln in tax cuts to support the economy though chinese stocks edged higher india was the other major market to rise in asia and this despite the us giving 60 day notice that its preferential trade treatment would end due to the lack of sufficient reciprocity turkey is also going to have this privilege removed but in its case it is because of good behavior the sense that it no longer qualifies as a developing country for this assistance purpose and its stock market reacted less favorable europe equities are firm as the dow jones stoxx 600 tries to extend its advance for a fourth session the service pmis generally surprised on the upside in europe with spain the notable exception benchmark 10 year yields are mostly 1 2 basis points firmer with notable exceptions in australia and new zealand the reserve bank of australia remained on hold as nearly universally expected the dollar is firmer against most currencies among the majors the swedish krona is the exception as the stronger than expected pmi follows last week s q4 gdp upside surprise underpins the currency the philippine s peso is suffering its largest loss in several years following what is seen as a political appointment to head the central bank asia pacific economists raise questions about the veracity of chinese economic data yet we can glean much insight into the state of the economy by the measures proposed to address it we have argued that officials have had their draghi moment and will do whatever it takes to support the economy in the face of us tariffs and during the 70th anniversary of the revolution it is as if the ccp is renewing its pledge to the chinese people to deliver better growth while tightening its grip on politics the focus of china s new measures is on tax cuts more than spending increases some initiatives like the three percentage point cut in the highest of three vat rates are meant to discourage capital outflows there will also be more targeted cuts in the required reserve ratio the stimulus program is estimated to be around 1 25 1 50 gdp the gdp target was lowered to 6 0 6 5 from about 6 5 last year the budget deficit goal is 2 8 of gdp last year s goal was 2 6 the call for a stable yuan apparently demanded the us trade negotiators was repeated at this year s national party congress the disappointing caixin service pmi 51 1 vs 53 6 in january was seen as old news in light of the economic stimulus announced japan s service pmi improved to 52 3 from 51 6 but because of the manufacturing slump the composite pmi slipped to 50 7 from 50 9 japan is expected to revise up its estimate for q4 gdp from 1 4 at an annualized pace to 1 7 at the end of the week new capex figures are behind the expectation japan is still going forward with the retail sales tax hike from 8 to 10 in october the government is rolling out a number of different tax breaks to underpin consumption the reserve bank of australia left the cash rate at 1 50 surprising no one despite the rba s claims of neutrality the market is gradually pricing in a greater chance of a cut in the second half the composite pmi slid to 49 1 from 49 7 of the flash reading and 51 3 in january fourth quarter gdp will be reported tomorrow there is a downside risk to the 0 3 median forecast which would be the same as q3 18 today australia reported that net exports shrank 0

between jpy111 90 and jpy112 00 that expire today above jpy112 that we may see after the options cut the next target is near jpy112 60 the australian dollar was sold to nearly 0 7065 its lowest level since february 12 resistance is now seen in the 0 7090 0 7100 area europe the emu service and composite pmi was better than the flash reading it supports our suspicion that the worst of the growth

service sector showed improved to 55 3 from 55 1 of the flash this lifted the composite reading to 52 8 from 52 7 it is the second monthly gain and is at its best level since last october france marred by the continuing yellow vest protests the service sector rose to 50 2 from 49 8 and the composite poked back above 50 to 50 4 from 49 9 of the flash the uk pmi was better than expected the services reading stands at 51 3 from 50 1 in january the median forecast was for a tad below 50 the composite rose to 51 5 from 50 3 this is the best reading since october however the high frequency

of the week should confirm remain robust today the markit composite pmi is expected to confirm the improvement to 55 8 from 54 4 in january the non manufacturing ism is expected to improve as well on the other hand new home sales for december were likely poor separately the us monthly budget position for january will be reported a 12 bln surplus is expected but do not be misled this still

maggie pagano why is the turkish lira crashing this currency crisis alarm has been on the cards turkey s currency is still in free fall the lira has fallen by one fifth against the dollar and despite intervention by the turkish government yesterday slumped to its lowest level against sterling on fears of contagion like most currency crises this one has been bubbling away in the background for months even before this rout the lira has been the world s worst performing currency falling by almost half against the dollar in the past year because of concerns about the economy dropping off a cliff the trigger for this latest crisis is the stand off between president trump and his turkish counterpart recep tayyip erdogan following the white house s strong arm tactics in doubling us import tariffs on turkish steel and aluminium behind the trade dispute is a row over turkey s detention of a christian evangelical pastor andrew brunson the pastor is facing terrorism allegations following the failed 2016 coup and his case has been taken up by religious conservatives in the us but the seeds of this crisis were sown years ago turkey s inflation is soaring there are high levels of credit and debt in the private sector plus it s running a whopping current account deficit inflation peaked at 15 9 per cent in july while the construction sector which has seen the most extraordinary growth and big foreign investment over the past decade is bubbling over investors are rightly concerned about the exposure of banks including france s bnp paribas spain s bbva and italy s unicredit which have operations in turkey foreign investors have been losing trust in erdogan s handling of the economy for months but the final straw was when he installed his son in law at the ministry of finance in july as part of his bid to become the most powerful turkish leader since mustafa kemal ataturk founded the republic from the ruins of the ottoman empire maggie pagano says the big question for financial markets is whether turkey s problems can be contained domestically or whether they will spill over globally the big question for financial markets is whether turkey s problems can be contained domestically or whether they will spill over globally the fear is the lira s crash will spark contagion not just in europe but among other more illiquid emerging market currencies the russian rouble australian dollar south african rand the mexican and argentine pesos are already wobbling it s also august always a volatile month for currency wars to break out not surprisingly the vix volatility index measuring turbulence in the markets jumped 16 per cent erdogan is resisting the more orthodox moves to stabilise the currency and dampen inflation with higher interest rates hoping he can ride out the storm at home and telling turks to sell their foreign currencies he s also unlikely to seek any bailouts from the imf which believes turkey has the lowest level of reserves among the emerging market economies making it even more vulnerable to speculation a troubled turkey is not what anyone should want to encourage the danger is the more erdogan is dumped on by trump and the west the more likely he is to tighten his grip on the country both erdogan and trump are bullies trump is said to be furious that turkey a nato member bought its new missiles from the russians while erdogan is angry about us sanctions on iran is there room for manoeuvre perhaps as trump showed with north korea his bark rarely turns into a bite while erdogan needs foreign support there s only one benefit to the lira s fall cheaper turkish holidays but the cost might be too high to pay in the long term sir peter wood pictured with his partner jacqueline fox is close to making a few bob with the sale of his esure group lucky seven how many times can you start a business in the same industry offering the same sort of deal and make yet another fortune at least seven is the answer and the man in question is sir peter wood surely one of the uk s canniest businessmen wood is close to making a few more bob with the sale of his esure group to bain capital for about 1 2billion wood who revolutionised the insurance industry with direct line in the 1980s will do nicely as he owns about a third of esure it can t be an accident that the brains behind sheilas wheels originally a women only insurer has two ex wives and six daughters the policies come with handbag insurance how genius is that

by doug sandler chris konstantinos rod smyth and rob glownia riverfront investment group we have been fielding a lot of questions from investors recently on the us dollar usd it can be tough to make a blanket statement about the greenback as a forecast often depends on which currency is used in the comparison but for the purposes of this piece we ll discuss why we continue to think that the usd is near a structural high versus many currencies and the implications of this view on our asset allocation portfolio positioning last september we published a weekly view 9 11 18 special fx why riverfront isn t currently hedging major foreign currencies explaining why we were choosing not to hedge the predominance of our portfolios fx foreign currency exposure our opinion was that the usd was close to an intermediate term peak a controversial view after the strength in the dollar during 2018 this contrarian view was based on our opinion that the dollar was generally overvalued after the longest bull market for the usd in four decades see appendix chart on long term dollar trends page 3 and that at some point moderation of the economic growth differential between the us and foreign regions would likely halt the usd s rise we still adhere to this general view for reasons we go into greater detail below however our view on european currencies has become less optimistic since that publication the usd has traded within a relatively tight range to most other developed market currencies notably however the usd weakened meaningfully versus many emerging market em currencies including the chinese yuan and many asian and latin american currencies we believe that this phenomenon has helped the bottoming process in emerging market stocks and currencies since the fourth quarter em currencies likely to remain stable yen dependent on global growth euro pound linked to geo political outcomes partially due to our sanguine view on the usd relative to asian and em currencies riverfront is overweight emerging market stocks and em debt in our longer time horizon more risk tolerant portfolios we also remain overweight japanese assets a view that isn t primarily related to our view on the yen but isn t in opposition to it either we don t have a strong opinion about the yen currently though we believe it s structurally undervalued and that the japanese economy is in better shape than is commonly thought we also recognize that the yen is sensitive to global risk appetites as it tends to strengthen when investors become risk averse with markets bouncing back so far in 2019 perhaps it s not surprising that the yen has been unable to strengthen this year due to risk factors that may impact both stocks and fx we remain underweight european equities for now in our portfolios and thus inherently underweight the euro and the pound going forward we anticipate further near term uncertainty due to brexit and other political issues in europe this underweight is also partially technical in nature as many european markets have rallied into their 200 day moving averages which may prove to be formidable resistance specifically the euro has traded consistently below the decision box we laid out in september which may indicate a new lower trading range see lines on chart right and further potential future weakness in the future while the pound has been stronger recently due to increased hope that brexit will be delayed or possibly rescinded it has only rallied back to the middle of its trading range where we believe risk to reward is mixed at best both european currencies appear to us to be beholden to the perception du jour around brexit italian and french political outcomes given our long term view that most european currencies are cheap and long term mean reversion potential for european stock markets is strong we are monitoring europe s economic and political fundamentals closely for any signs of improvement us dollar priced to perfection the structural bull case on the usd can be boiled down to four arguments each of which appear reasonable first dollar bulls point to the relative strength of the us economy second higher interest rates in the us resulting from the fed s normalizing monetary policy will attract yield seeking investors third the dollar will rise due to the u s s continued status as a safe haven currency given its size liquidity and productivity finally dollar bulls point to the end of extraordinarily easy monetary policy at the federal reserve as further rationale for dollar strength we do not dispute the logic of those making the case for additional upside to the dollar however we believe that the bull case is widely understood and thus potentially already priced into the rich valuation of the dollar on many currency valuation models in our opinion this makes the dollar particularly vulnerable to future changes in these three arguments we would also note that investor sentiment on the dollar appears to be starting to decline from an optimistic extreme made earlier this year high and falling investor sentiment has historically resulted in subpar forward performance over the past 15 years according to ned davis research s daily sentiment poll for the dollar source ndr research 3 2 19 past performance is no guarantee of future results from a fundamental perspective we also see several counterpoints to what we view as consensus thinking on the dollar currency markets attempt to discount future changes in fundamentals at least as much as the current state of fundamentals first while the us economy is indeed the world s most productive and continues to outperform europe and japan there are increasing signs that the us is slowing too economic surprises have turned negative in the us and soft survey data such as manufacturing pmis and small business optimism have recently started to moderate also we believe that asian and em economies are likely to stabilize in the second half of the year led by china s widening program of monetary and fiscal stimulus struggling with growth other em economies such as india are also beginning to stimulate and have a long runway for additional stimulus given the lack of inflation in their economies second with the fed s dovish about face in january and the bond market pricing in close to a 90 probability rates remaining at current levels or lower it s harder to make a case for additional dollar strength in 2019 due to rising interest rates third the dollar s safe haven status could be challenged by our trade and budget deficits with 1t plus deficits starting in 2020 serving as a potential long term headwind political uncertainty in the u s may also increase later this year as we head towards a contentious 2020 presidential election appendix

a liberal s wish list a nightmare for the wisconsin taxpayer billions more in spending a multitude of tax increases hundreds of new government positions untold amounts of borrowing to pay for it all and the roll back of nearly all taxpayer friendly reforms march 4 2019 a maciver institute preliminary analysis based on the budget in brief from the department of administration gov tony evers introduced his 2019 21 biennial budget proposal thursday night the sweeping document would spend 83 5 billion over two years at least 7 billion more than former gov scott walker s last budget the proposal has been described by speaker robin vos as a big liberal wish list looking at the expansive list of progressive policies that vastly grow the size and scope of government it is hard to argue with that description from medicaid expansion the end of recent welfare work requirements an unneeded increase in the state s minimum wage a green pipe dream to make the state carbon free the creation of many new government programs an assault on proven education reform programs the decriminalization of small amounts of marijuana to the end of the property tax freeze this budget is full of liberal dreams these changes and many more that we will detail later will be paid for with a slew of tax increases and hundreds of millions of dollars in new bonding while we sift through the thousands of pages of the budget document line by line we thought it would be helpful to produce a preliminary analysis of the governor s budget based off the budget in brief produced by the department of administration as the name implies the bib is not comprehensive and we won t know what the total picture of this budget looks like until our exhaustive examination is complete gov evers budget seeks to undo many of the reforms championed by walker s administration including repealing right to work restoring the state and local prevailing wage and rolling back numerous tax protections that have led to a property tax freeze in recent years the document claims that the property tax bill for the median value home will grow under the rate of inflation but allowing local units of government more power to raise property taxes will most certainly negate that first let s go through the basics of spending borrowing and overall government positions the basics in total the budget proposal includes a flurry of provisions that would increase property tax bills across the state it makes income taxes more progressive by targeting more income tax relief on lower tax brackets while increasing income taxes for higher earners how about spending positions and borrowing general purpose revenue gpr spending would increase by 7 6 percent to 38 3 billion in the proposal 2 7 billion more than current spending the budget proposal would increase total all funds positions to nearly 71 991 in the second year a 701 position increase of government jobs from all funding sources from the current budget gpr positions would increase to 35 670 by the second year in the biennium a position increase of 391 from current levels taxes in the general fund would increase by a total 1 64 billion over the biennium tax cuts in that fund including a brand new middle class tax credit and expansion of other already existing credits total 951 4 million that means in all the net tax increase to wisconsin taxpayers would be 688 7 million over the next two years however many other tax increases such as the proposed gas tax hike and removal of property tax controls will push this total much higher the budget uses a form of trickery called base year doubled under that method the new base for the next budget is simply double the second year in the prior budget in reality base year doubled is a slight of hand trick that guarantees the constant growth of government spending let s pretend that the government spends 200 total in one budget the first year of the budget spends 50 and the second year spends 150 you might think that the base for the next budget is 200 since that is what we spent it s not the base is instead the second year doubled in this case 300 when setting up assumptions for the next budget it looks like we just spent more than we did and so of course we have to spend even more anything less than 300 now looks like a cut even though that s already 100 more in overall spending assumptions casually shift inflating the base cycle after cycle and fleecing taxpayers time after time most of the time governments back load more of their spending in the second year as this document does that means next budget the base will be even more inflated we see that play out with calculations for this budget the 2017 19 budget is counted as 77 3 billion however actual dollars spent paint a different picture if total actual spending in the two previous fiscal years is added together the total comes to 76 4 billion in that light the actual dollar spending increase in evers budget comes to over 7 billion using the base year doubled method is standard but it s also one way that automatic growth of government is built into the state budgeting process the document analyzed in this piece is called the budget in brief and does not include the statutory legal language that would eventually become law if approved by the legislature that s why some dollar figures such as overall bonding are unclear however the full budget document which we are still examining line by line shows that the budget proposal would increase borrowing by more than 440 million in the biennium that includes borrowing for a number of conservation projects as well as roads the governor s capital budget adds another 2 5 billion in bonding that recommendation is more than double the average borrowing amount 1 157 billion from 2011 through 2019 we wrote about the capital budget in detail here other provisions may not be highlighted within the budget in brief but will become clear in the weeks and months to come the most curious among these is an apparent lack of reference to walker s signature 2011 reform act 10 which was repeatedly slammed by the now governor on the campaign trail and in years past nowhere does the budget in brief seek to roll back taxpayer protections created by the law including increased contribution levels for public sector employee benefits or annual union recertification votes the legislative fiscal bureau has begun its work translating the budget in brief to a more formal analysis which will be published by the end of the month after that the joint finance committee will get to work parsing through the document agency by agency april editors update lfb has now published its fiscal analysis of the document major charts in this piece have been updated to reflect that work see more with chartsmart here tax increases tax cuts evers budget proposal introduces myriad tax hikes to at least partly pay for massive spending increases first on the docket is a tax increase introduced by his office several weeks ago a partial rollback of the manufacturing and agriculture tax credit mac that change would limit the job credit for manufacturers to the first 300 000 of qualified income the move would raise 516 7 million in tax revenue over the biennium by raising taxes on those manufacturers according to one recent analysis by the tax foundation nearly 70 percent of wisconsin manufacturing firms pay the individual income tax rate instead of the corporate tax rate since those companies are organized as pass through businesses all of their business income is taxed as individual income in other words a manufacturer who earns 300 000 or more may appear to be part of wisconsin s upper echelon of earners but all of that business owner s equipment and inventory is included in the figure as joint finance committee co chair sen alberta darling r river hills recently said on the senate floor you know a farmer is dealing with a budget that might be 1 3 5 or 6 million dollars they re not taking that money home those are just the expenses they have to deal with another change would increase the long term capital gains tax under current law long term capital investment gains are taxed at a 5 355 percent rate the budget proposal removes part of an existing exclusion so that those gains are taxed at the top individual income tax rate of 7 65 percent for certain earners individuals earning less than 100 000 and married joint filers earning less than 150 000 would keep paying the capital gains tax at the 5 355 percent rate while earners above them would move to 7 65 percent wibudget if a retiree cashes in a stock they ve held for years those earnings will again be taxed at the highest rate available punishing taxpayers who are successful or preparing for retirement to the tune of 505 1m more in taxes click to tweet if a retiree cashes in a stock they ve held for years those earnings will again be taxed this time at the highest rate available that move punishes taxpayers who are successful or preparing for retirement to the tune of 505 1 million more in taxes evers budget plan includes changes to align wisconsin to federal law under the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act the state would close nearly all divergences with federal law raising tax collections by 362 4 million two dozen new auditors would be hired by the department of revenue alongside 12 compliance related positions those new hires would be charged with collecting any taxes already owed but not yet collected by the state raising an estimated 36 4 million over the biennium the proposal would also extend the cigarette tax to e cigarettes and related vapor products arguing that the new technology amounts to a substitute that should be taxed the same way that change would raise taxes by 34 7 million over the biennium cigarillos or little brown cigars are targeted in a similar manner with a proposed tax increase on the brown cigarettes of 6 8 million other tax increases include a change to the taxation of out of state broadcasters who would see 29 5 million more in taxes over current levels the deduction for private school tuition would also be eliminated raising 24 2 million for the state in the biennium late in his campaign evers announced plans for a 10 percent tax cut on the middle class on thursday the public saw specifics for the new tax credit for the first time the administration is proposing a tax credit called the family and individual reinvestment fair credit individuals earning below 80 000 and married joint filers earning below 125 000 will receive a tax credit of 10 percent of their net tax liability or 100 whichever is greater the credit phases out at 100 000 for single earners and 150 000 for married joint filers that amounts to 833 5 million in income tax cuts over the biennium the average recipient of the credit would see an annual income tax cut of 217 while the median family of four could receive more than 500 annually another new tax credit would be created for child and dependent care beginning in the second year of the budget that credit would be 50 percent of the same credit available federally the same year the tax deduction for child care would be eliminated that change adds up to 10 million in tax cuts annually other tax cuts targeted at low and middle class earners are expansions on already existing programs the earned income tax credit eitc would be expanded so that filers with one dependent child could claim up to 11 percent of the federal credit up from 4 percent filers with two dependent children could increase their eitc credit to 14 percent up from 11 percent those changes amount to 53 1 million in tax cuts eligibility for the homestead tax credit htc would be increased to 30 000 in household income in the second year of the biennium and the credit would become indexed to inflation that year approximately 160 000 new filers would be eligible for the tax credit while more than 100 000 current filers would receive larger credits totaling 38 9 million in tax reductions only seniors those with disabilities and those on earned income may claim the htc individuals who qualify for the eitc or htc are income limited so the majority of the funding for the credits comes from other taxpayers evers budget would also change tax cuts already in law during december s extraordinary session lawmakers passed across the board income tax rate reductions using funds from online sales tax collections following a recent u s supreme court decision the budget proposal officially requires the state to begin collecting those funds raising 93 9 million in the biennium thursday s proposal would focus the income tax rate reductions passed in december solely on the bottom most income tax bracket currently the lowest tax rate is 4 0 percent for single earners making up to 11 230 and married joint earners making up to 14 980 the change that lawmakers passed in december would split the reductions across tax brackets wisconsin s marginal tax rate system means that every taxpayer s first earned dollars up to the cutoff 11 230 or 14 980 is taxed at the same rate for that reason everyone paying taxes in the state would benefit at least slightly from the measure however the budget in brief document does not state the proposed rate for this particular change one final note on taxes apart from the minor shift on income taxes described above evers budget does not raise the general sales corporate or individual income tax rates for all the tax increases tucked into other parts of the budget the governor stayed away from a doyle style ramping up of individual income tax rates consider us pleasantly surprised on this front health care evers budget accepts the federal medicaid expansion under obamacare while significantly increasing spending on a wide range of programs the medicaid expansion has been a costly proposition for states that accepted it medicaid spending in ohio for example skyrocketed 35 percent in four years from 18 9 billion to 25 7 billion between fiscal year 2013 and 2017 and in minnesota premiums increased 50 67 percent forcing the state to implement a reinsurance program costing taxpayers at least 800 million so far the federal dollars that follow a medicaid expansion are anything but free money as advocates persistently claim despite these and many other stark cautionary tales the evers budget proposes expanding medicaid eligibility to everyone earning between 0 138 percent of the federal poverty level in 2019 that income level is 34 638 for a family of four making 82 000 more people eligible for the program however with 92 percent of the population already insured the vast majority of them through employer based insurance it s likely a sizable share of those 82 000 newly eligible for government assistance already have insurance through their employers that means many people who join the program would be moving backward from self sufficiency to dependence on government health care the budget asserts that expanding medicaid will save 325 million in gpr across the biennium because of the federal government s enhanced 90 percent match versus traditional medicaid a tenuous stream of dollars from a federal government already drowning in 22 trillion in debt as with traditional medicaid and its notoriously low reimbursement rates the federal government is likely to back off that enhanced match in the future and leave state taxpayers holding the very expensive bag nonetheless evers budget proposal accepts and then immediately spends the 325 million plus a lot more on increased payments to health care providers and other new spending in all the budget directs 580 million in additional dollars back to health care providers catering to medicaid patients through the badgercare plus program the budget spends 365 million more on reimbursement payments to hospitals serving medicaid patients through five different more traditional reimbursement avenues that includes 142 million more in payments to hospitals handling a larger number of medicaid patients than most 100 million more for payments to acute care and critical access hospitals 20 million more for payments to pediatric hospitals and 1 2 million more for rural hospitals the proposal also hikes spending on considerably less traditional health spending it spends 45 million more for non medical services to reduce and prevent health disparities that result from economic and social determinants of health such as housing referral services stress management nutritional counseling transportation coordination etc it s a significant expansion of the left s beloved cradle to grave set of government programs paid for using 45 million of precious tax dollars meant for actual health care the budget builds off gov walker s reinsurance program aimed at holding down premiums on the individual health insurance market in the era of obamacare s skyrocketing premiums the continuation of this walker era program is a not so subtle admission that obamacare has failed spectacularly to bend the cost curve down and that failure is costing wisconsin taxpayers dearly the budget buttresses the program with 200 million in all funds spending for the office of the commissioner of insurance in the second year of the budget while the walker administration when he rolled out the plan said it would cost taxpayers 34 million out of state coffers evers plan hikes the oci budget by more than 72 million in the second year of the budget in state spending or gpr and by more than 200 million in all funds in the budget s second year to fully fund the program wibudget overall spending is significantly higher especially with federal medicaid dollars in the mix in 2020 all funds dhs spending jumps more than 1 billion an 8 5 increase and more than half a billion dollars more in 2021 click to tweet the spending plan includes an effort to lower prescription drug prices in large part through government mandates it proposes requiring drug companies to justify price increases disclose proprietary information like production and marketing costs and requires the oci to post the information in the name of transparency it also requires pharmacy benefit managers to register with the state and disclose price concessions they receive from drug companies and calls for importing generic drugs from abroad to wisconsin the budget makes an effort to expand access to dental care an area in which wisconsin lags the nation it spends a lot of money to do so 43 million the plan implements a dental therapy license in wisconsin to increase the dental professional workforce a market driven option maciver summarized in a policy brief last year but evers proposal also comes along with a hefty price tag it spends 1 5 million to subsidize educational institutions that add a dental therapy program with the goal to put wisconsin on the cutting edge of this emerging career field in addition to expanding spending to the tune of tens of millions of dollars for dental care under badgercare plus and medicaid the budget also increases spending on a series of programs aimed at in need populations and at grants for dentists who practice in rural areas or provide care to the disabled a series of critical medicaid reforms enacted under gov walker are also repealed wholesale by evers budget despite protections enacted during december s extraordinary session work requirements and health risk assessments for childless adults seeking medicaid are struck walker increased from 20 to 30 hours a week the time that able bodied adults ages 19 to 49 without children must be working training for work or looking for work to receive badgercare health insurance that s the federal maximum as even democrats in congress recognize that 30 hours is not too much to ask for evers budget rolls that back nominal premiums of 8 for households earning from 51 100 percent of the federal poverty level are struck requirements that recipients be in compliance with child support orders are struck copays for non emergency medical services are struck and medicaid health savings accounts are eliminated entirely in addition the proposal includes a variety of provisions aimed at behavioral and mental health care and substance abuse treatment it spends 69 million more for reimbursement rate increases for medicaid recipients seeking mental and behavioral health care in all the budget proposes to increase the department of health services dhs budget by 36 7 million in 2020 and 255 7 million in 2021 gpr the office of the commissioner of insurance oci charged with implementing the reinsurance program is held steady in 2020 but receives a 72 3 million gpr bump in 2021 overall spending is significantly higher especially with federal medicaid dollars in the mix in 2020 all funds dhs spending jumps more than 1 billion an 8 5 percent increase and more than half a billion dollars more in 2021 the all funds oci budget jumps 200 million in 2021 to keep the walker reinsurance program in place the long anticipated gas tax increase the department of transportation gets a 627 million boost in the governor s budget bringing the total up to 6 63 billion from last budget s 6 billion that increase will be funded with an eight cent gas tax up front raising 264 million plus another one cent increase as a result of indexing starting in april 2020 many lawmakers like indexing because it s an automatic tax it increases transportation tax revenue without forcing legislators to actually cast a vote on the hike in essence taxation without representation evers also wants to increase vehicle registration fees by 10 heavy truck fees by 27 percent and create a new hybrid vehicle fee he claims these increases will be offset by eliminating the minimum markup on fuel the minimum markup law is a depression era relic that sets a price floor on numerous products including prescription drugs and gasoline the minimum markup on products other than gas is maintained in evers proposal the budget proposal would cut funding to major highway projects by 5 5 million and to the highway mega projects category by 203 7 million most of evers attention in the state highway program goes to the state highway rehabilitation program which he increases by 225 7 million over the 2017 19 budget his main priority with road funding is on increasing road aids to local governments most local transportation aid comes in the form of general transportation aids gta and is disbursed according to the calendar year as opposed to the fiscal year which runs july to june this year the state will distribute 348 639 300 to municipal governments and 111 093 800 to county governments evers wants to boost that by 10 percent that comes out to 383 503 200 for municipalities and 122 203 200 for counties next year he also wants to increase the mileage aid to 2 628 per mile the transportation budget includes 338 million in additional bonding authority for transportation over the current budget evers budget would do away with the fed swap law which requires dot to consolidate federal funding into as few major highway projects as possible the axed reform saves money by limiting the number of projects subject to the more stringent and costly federal requirements including prevailing wage the budget would allow the dot and dnr to use eminent domain to build bike paths and sidewalks the end of the property tax freeze in addition to all the ways evers budget would raise taxes at the state level his plan would also allow local governments to increase property taxes in several different ways when combined into individual tax bills property owners could be in for a real shock next year first evers would eliminate the school levy tax credit and the first dollar tax credit those credits would provide about 2 billion in property tax relief over the next two years without the change school districts would also be able to hold referendums whenever they want doing away with several important controls on property taxes at the state level wibudget evers plan would also allow local governments to increase property taxes in several different ways when combined together into individual tax bills property owners could be in for a real shock next year click to tweet next evers would adjust revenue caps for municipalities counties and tech school districts currently they can only increase their levy by their percentage of net new construction from the previous year the budget proposal would set a minimum increase of 2 percent most communities currently have less than 1 percent growth each year and the state average for 2018 was 1 62 percent as a result of this change 85 percent of wisconsin communities would see the municipal county and tech college portions of their property tax bills grow at a faster rate year after year than they do now on top of all that local governments could exceed those higher caps to fund emergency dispatch centers and establish mass transit routes to neighboring communities the plan would also increase property taxes on big businesses by allowing municipalities to base property taxes on the basis of that business total income rather than the value of a given property individuals who own homes aren t charged property taxes based on their income they re charged based on the value of their home or land this shift would fundamentally change how property taxation is calculated in wisconsin finally local governments would be allowed to raise fees without having to lower their tax levies in exchange this means local governments could start charging residents for things like garbage pickup and recycling without having to lower property taxes in other words if you re not paying for things like garbage pickup right now chances are you will be big labor evers first budget handsomely rewards his big labor allies and is a full on assault on worker freedom the budget reverses many changes made over the past eight years that have weakened the state s tradition of championing workers collective bargaining and local control the budget documents states what evers plans to do is bring back forced union dues reinstate artificial wage floors that cost taxpayers big and force the return of union exclusivity contracts the budget restores the prevailing wage law for state and local public works projects evers asserts bringing back the great depression era relic ensures that workers are not underpaid relative to other workers performing similar in the area wibudget what evers plans to do is bring back forced union dues reinstate artificial wage floors that cost taxpayers big and force the return of union exclusivity contracts click to tweet wisconsin s previous prevailing wage statute which tied wages on taxpayer funded construction projects to inflated rates paid by unions was repealed for local projects in the 2015 17 state budget in a compromise walker subsequently signed legislation that repealed the union led artificial wages for state projects the changes allow markets to set wage rates for local construction projects saving taxpayers from well documented cost overruns evers budget also would eliminate what the document describes as wisconsin so called right to work law it s called right to work precisely because it prohibits private sector labor organizations from making compulsory union dues a condition of employment in 2015 wisconsin became the 25th right to work state in the nation when walker signed the worker freedom legislation into law big labor immediately challenged the law in court and lost with evers organized labor is found and their vendetta against right to work is now being carried out by the democratic governor in more payback for unions evers is pouncing on another walker era victory his budget plan permits the project labor agreements for public works projects that the former governor signed out of existence in 2017 plas stipulate that only union firms can bid on a project and many units of government required them shutting out non union shops the republican led reform law prohibits a government from requiring a pla as a condition to bid on a taxpayer funded project a big win for the free market and the taxpayers who benefit from increased competition democrats have argued the law is yet another attack on unions and that it limits local control curiously no mention of walker s signature reform act 10 is made in the budget in brief document despite continuous attacks on the campaign trail and earlier evers document does not appear to make changes to reforms such as increased benefits contributions for public employees or union recertification votes however it s possible that such changes are included in the document s legal language but not the brief still for a governor who campaigned on championing collective bargaining and undoing years of conservative reforms one would think changes to act 10 would be front and center the governor s budget plan also gets rid of a reform law aimed that ends the patchwork of employment laws statewide evers provision would repeal preemption of costly local government ordinances on family and medical leave wage claims employee benefits hours of work and overtime and solicitation of prospective employees salary histories the preemption reforms require such employment regulations to be governed by uniform statewide policy not created through the whims of local governments at business and taxpayer expense k 12 education property tax levels are largely driven by spending in schools another issue area where this proposal would spend vastly more evers budget proposal for k 12 education largely mirrors the budget request submitted last fall by the department of public instruction dpi when he was the head of that agency the total changes would increase dpi spending by nearly 1 6 billion over the biennium more than the dpi budget request it s also more than twice the dollar amount of the last budget s increase to k 12 education that bill upped spending by more than 630 million in the biennium the highest dollar amount in history at the time the majority of k 12 dollars flow through equalization aid also known as general aid which exists to even out funding disparities in local property taxes property poor districts such as milwaukee public schools mps receive disproportionately high amounts of equalization aid forms of aid like the school levy tax credit and the first dollar credit are considered categorical aid and are distributed equally across school districts under evers plan the school finance formula would significantly change and billions more dollars would flow through equalization aid the school levy tax credit and first dollar credit would be eliminated in the first year with that funding instead moving to general aid that move alone is likely to increase property taxes since money that is now used to offset local property taxes will instead flow directly to schools the plan includes a hold harmless provision so that no district will receive less in state funding than current law wibudget the total changes would increase dpi spending by nearly 1 6 billion over the biennium more than the dpi budget request and more than twice the dollar amount of the last budget s increase to k 12 education click to tweet limits on school district referenda implemented in recent years would be done away with school districts would no longer be limited in the number of referenda they may hold in a calendar year another measure certain to increase property taxes across the state other changes to k 12 funding include an increase in the revenue limit adjustment by 200 in the first year and 204 in the second year with future increases indexed to inflation the plan also increases the low revenue adjustment from 9 100 under current law to 9 700 in 2020 and 10 000 in 2021 that ll allow school districts across the state to levy millions more in local property taxes assembly republicans have pushed to increase the low revenue adjustment in recent years including during the previous budget debate the assembly republican plan in 2017 19 would have increased the low revenue adjustment by much less than evers plan and would have allowed local property taxes to increase by up to 92 7 million statewide evers plan of course goes much further than that signaling even bigger property tax increases down the road the budget would also spend more than 600 million on students with special needs while also limiting many of those students options the majority of the hike would go toward increasing the state reimbursement level for special education costs by 606 million over the biennium the high cost special education program would be made sum sufficient and special education transition readiness grants would increase from 1 000 per pupil to 1 500 per pupil increasing spending by more than 7 million on those grants while students with special needs who attend public schools are rewarded in the proposal students in the special needs scholarship program snsp would be shut out of their educational options that program established in the 2015 17 budget allows students with special needs to attend private schools with scholarships from the state no new students could join the program after the 2019 20 school year currently 662 students participate in the program more than triple the enrollment just two years ago when the snsp first began a 2019 audit by the nonpartisan legislative audit bureau lab showed that parents reported strong satisfaction with the program including improved behavior from their children and more positive relationships with peers compared to their experiences in public schools in the audit one respondent is quoted saying that snsp has made it financially possible for my child to receive the appropriate individualized education to which he was entitled but not receiving in his public schools other rollbacks to educational choice include freezing enrollment in the popular private school choice programs in milwaukee racine and statewide total seats available would freeze after the next school year students could join the programs when others graduate or otherwise leave an estimated 38 187 students across the state participate in the three programs with nearly three quarters in milwaukee the programs exist to allow impoverished students go to the schools of their choice using vouchers from the state students earn higher act and forward exam scores than their public school peers and families report higher levels of satisfaction compared to public school the vouchers are worth less than average aid to public schools another budget provision would require individual property tax bills to include the total figure spent on vouchers the milwaukee parental choice program mpcp is the country s oldest voucher program and the student enrollment cap was lifted in 2011 since then participation has steadily grown making it the largest choice program in the state nearly 29 000 students are enrolled in the mpcp today the number of independent charter schools would freeze under the proposal with a ban on authorizations of new schools by entities other than public school districts until 2023 under current law any chancellors of the uw system the city of milwaukee s common council tribal authorities any technical college district board the waukesha county executive and the uw system office of educational opportunity can authorize independent charter schools already existing charter schools would be allowed to continue operating and adding new students in the current school year 8 450 students attend independent charter schools the best rated school at mps is a charter school though it was authorized by mps itself milwaukee excellence received 94 3 out of 100 points on the 2018 report cards with math proficiency double that of the district average choice and charter programs have been remarkably successful in wisconsin showing strong proficiency rates despite higher levels of student poverty of the 17 mps schools receiving five stars on the most recent state report cards 10 are in the private choice program four others are charter schools and just three are traditional public schools on the other end of the scale 50 mps schools received one star in 2018 or failing to meet expectations designations ten of those schools are in the private choice program while three are charters and 37 are traditional public schools wibudget according to the budget students currently participating in choice programs would not be affected by proposed changes however the ban on adding new seats or students will almost certainly lead to school closures click to tweet according to the budget document students currently participating in choice programs would not be affected by proposed changes however the ban on adding new seats or students will almost certainly lead to school closures public school open enrollment the state s most popular form of school choice is not targeted by the budget proposal that long standing program allows students to move to other public schools if they so choose other changes to public school finance include a number of grant increases for target areas student mental health needs would be funded by more than 63 million for in school pupil services staff training and other related initiatives a new urban excellence initiative would spend more than 15 million on closing achievement gaps in the state s five largest public school districts teachers would be required to have 45 minutes or a single class period in planning time every day whichever is greater the budget proposal includes myriad of other comparatively smaller initiatives that nevertheless total millions of dollars in spending including the recommendations of the blue ribbon commission on school funding a future maciver analysis will examine this budget proposal s k 12 education spending in closer detail university of wisconsin system evers budget proposal for the uw system would continue the popular tuition freeze for in state undergraduate students the uw system would see a boost in funding to the tune of 175 million over the biennium spending increases at the uw system include 10 million for fellowships and loan forgiveness for certain nursing candidates who commit to teaching in the system for three years after graduating student support services for the uw colleges would see 5 million and 20 more employees would be hired for uw extension county based representatives need based grants for wisconsin students attending the uw system tech colleges private universities or tribal colleges would be funded by 17 3 million in gpr the proposal sets up a study committee to examine creating a state run student loan refinancing authority the committee is charged with making recommendations by late 2020 for inclusion in the 2021 23 state budget students who are citizens of other countries but who graduated from a wisconsin high school lived in wisconsin for three continuous years before high school or have applied for a permanent resident visa would qualify for in state tuition all told evers budget spends 5 9 million more than the uw system requested in last fall s agency budget request and creates 219 84 new full time positions the wisconsin technical college system would also receive a funding increase of 7 percent in each year totaling 18 million over the biennium the budget proposal eliminates the early college credit program which allows high school students to take university classes under a cost sharing agreement students can earn high school credit college credit or sometimes both instead the budget requires that the uw system implement a program to provide tuition free classes for high school students the budget gives similar treatment to a program that lets high school students take classes at tech colleges instead requiring the tech colleges to provide them for free welfare and other government reforms the budget rolls back some of walker s reforms to the state s welfare systems able bodied adults with dependents aged six to 18 would no longer need to satisfy work requirements in order to receive foodshare drug testing for most public assistance programs is eliminated however in a nod to the success of the walker administration s changes childless able bodied adults would still be required to satisfy job requirements in order to get foodshare that became compulsory in april 2015 evers budget includes 5 3 million to help welfare recipients in the wisconsin works w 2 program access affordable internet on behalf of these families the department of children and families will work with w 2 agencies to reimburse the appropriate internet service providers on a monthly basis the budget document states it s another big government initiative that looks a lot like the city of madison s failed broadband for all pilot program for low income neighborhoods evers 5 3 million seems all the more excessive given that free internet access is as close as the local library neighborhood school or any number of retailers and restaurants minimum wage for state employees would increase to 15 per hour in 2021 for everyone else the state minimum wage would increase to 8 25 in 2020 followed by 75 cent increases annually until 2023 once the minimum hourly wage reaches 10 50 in 2023 it would become indexed to inflation the governor s budget proposal also creates a task force to study how to get the state to a 15 per hour minimum wage most state employees would see a wage increase of 2 percent in each year of the biennium totaling 82 1 million in gpr another 12 1 million would be provided for targeted increases to certain state employees wisconsin would make a statutory goal for all electricity produced in the state to be completely carbon free by 2050 that s pulled right out of the green new deal which argues that the entire world should become carbon free by 2050 as temperatures dipped below freezing in much of the state this weekend a similar move enacted today would mean death by frost thirty years changes a lot but it seems likely that wisconsin will still be a cold northern state by 2050 other changes would limit the changes in law the legislature passed during december s extraordinary session including the ability of the attorney general settle cases without the approval of the legislature the legislature would no longer be able to intervene in lawsuits as a matter of right vast criminal justice and health related reforms would decriminalize medical marijuana while legalizing small amounts of recreational marijuana and expunging drug offenses under a certain amount seventeen year old offenders would also be moved from the adult justice system to the juvenile justice system that includes violent and repeat offenders a proposal much more expansive than other ideas floated in the past the maciver institute released a report in 2016 studying the fiscal effects and feasibility of returning only non violent first time 17 year old offenders to the juvenile system since young people are less likely to reoffend and return to prison if originally processed through the juvenile system the state is likely to see savings in reduced recidivism the governor s plan would also give 5 million to counties who oversee the juvenile system the state would vastly expand its spending on broadband grant programs spending 78 6 million in the biennium through the public service commission it would create a new statutory goal for minimum broadband speed across the state and spends 5 3 million on internet access for welfare recipients the budget plan strips a number of key government reforms codified in state law by walker and the republican led legislature the governor restores administrative language that gives deference to state bureaucrats interpretations of law republican reforms prohibited the practice of state courts simply accepting agency conclusions of the law so did the state supreme court which recently affirmed so in northern wisconsin property rights case we have ended our practice of deferring to administrative agencies conclusions of the law justice rebecca dallet wrote for the majority in cementing the court s position change first declared in a decision last june interpreting the law under wisconsin s constitution is the judicial branch s domain not the executive branch s and evers rolls back legislative reforms on agency use of so called guidance documents used by bureaucrats to set policies critics of the practice say agencies use the documents to bypass legislative oversight and review the same problems occurred during the obama administration when agencies stopped creating rules and instead issued guidance evers office will soon introduce a capital budget bill that will include recommendations for spending and borrowing for state buildings the budget in brief also commits to at least 75 million in bonding in the capital budget for energy conservation programs all told the budget document sets forth a wildly different view of government compared to the administration of the last eight years the proposal creates many new government offices programs and credits while increasing taxes on certain earners and hiking state borrowing by 448 million it would eliminate hallmark reforms such as the right to work bring back the state prevailing wage and accept federal medicaid dollars for expansion since its release republican lawmakers have largely rebuffed the document calling it a liberal wish list the real work will begin when lfb releases its nonpartisan analysis later this month afterward agencies will appear before the joint finance committee to discuss their budgets and allow jfc to learn more then finance will parse through the massive spending document agency by agency before it passes onto the full legislature evers has already indicated that he would be open to vetoing the entire budget if republicans strip out too many of his reforms taxpayers hold onto your hats it s about to be a bumpy spring and summer as always maciver will be here every step of the way look forward to more detailed analyses of individual budget sections in the days and weeks to come
larry summers heated up a brewing row among economists over modern monetary theory calling the deficit friendly doctrine fallacious at multiple levels and accusing its supporters of holding out the promise of a free lunch the former treasury secretary under bill clinton and white house adviser to barack obama is the latest big name economist to turn his fire on mmt a school of thought that s been gaining ground especially on the left wing of the democratic party it argues that governments with their own currencies don t need to tax or even borrow to finance spending and that when inflation is low as it is now there s room for bigger government deficits
during my three day visit to the north i addressed the jaffna managers forum at the euroville auditorium on the topic sri lankan crisis affects the north and south the way forward vartharaja perumal former chief minister of the north and east chaired the meeting a synopsis of my speech the present unp led government was a failure it has lost a golden opportunity to solve the national question with a government of the two major parties the unp and slfp having the active support of the leaders of the tamil speaking people the tna and slmc but it had also taken the whole country north and south into a deep economic social and political crisis the problem of debt is affecting the war widows badly but it is also affecting small entrepreneurs in the north and south causing many to close shop the government is facing a deep debt crisis local and foreign and it is struggling to find money to pay salaries each month the foreign loan repayment for this year is 5 9 billion and there is an increasing trend in the next five years this is accumulated over 20 to 30 years and the unp slfp government led by ranil wickremesinghe has taken as much loans in these four years as the mahinda rajapaksa government in nine years the latter developed infrastructure in the north and south besides the cost of restoring peace but the ranil wickremesinghe government has squandered it on luxury imports and trips abroad for the rich one per cent of the population depreciating dollar as a result the cost of imports is double the income from exports the promised increase in exports by industrialisation through foreign direct investment fdi has not materialised and what had come has departed due to the poor investment climate and lack of economic and political stability the massive central bank fraud which cost the country billions in which the prime minister ranil wickremesinghe is clearly implicated leading to a three per cent increase in the loan interest rate nationally has destroyed investor confidence the gdp growth rate which averaged six to seven per cent during the mahinda rajapaksa government has come down to three per cent and real incomes have come down to solve the economic problems of the people and country we need to emerge from the middle income trap and become an industrialised country with a real gdp growth of at least nine per cent the only areas of growth are vice corruption and drug trafficking in fact in the international corruption index sri lanka s score has remained at 39 per cent placing us at 89 among 180 countries when a vote of no confidence was moved on ranil wickremesinghe in parliament the tna and slmc saved him a clear indication that they do not represent the ordinary tamil speaking people but along with the unp the interests of the rich one per cent which includes the underworld the steep rise in the cost of living is due to many factors the wrong tax policy of high indirect taxes like vat which places the burden on the people while direct taxes are among the lowest in the world with an upper slab of 24 per cent spares the rich the increase of vat from seven per cent to 15 per cent led to the unhrc representative on human rights bohoslavski to attack the ranil wickremesinghe government for violating fundamental human rights imports of luxuries and the like have increased the demand for dollars sending the rupee value from rs 131 per dollar during the rajapaksa government down to rs 182 raising the price of imports made worse by the wickremesinghe government policy shift to encourage imports rather than self sufficiency the result is an increase in poverty hunger and malnutrition throughout the country some people have two or even one meal a day but to make matters worse the ranil wickremesinghe led by yankee wicky has signed agreements with the usa to enable it to use trincomalee as a military base with freedom to bring in weapons for their use and transport them without being bound by our laws by also becoming co signatories to the usas resolution based on the false darusman report which allows foreign interference in our judicial processes sri lanka is no longer an independent sovereign nation we are really a semi colony of the usa we run the risk of being caught in the middle of a usa china war neoliberal agenda why has our country been brought to such a terrible state is it mere bungling no there is method to this madness in the context of the worsening crisis of global capitalism with the west being more affected than the east led by china which has emerged as the second largest economy after the usa there has been a shift in economic power from the west to the east in an attempt to reverse this trend the usa is in the process of implementing the neoliberal solution developed by prof milton friedman in chicago on the basis of the washington consensus with the imf and world bank forged in the 1970s together with promotion of regional conflicts and wars which enables the usa that produces 60 per cent of global armaments to revive its economy neo liberalism is the way out exploitation without direct conquest using the open economy the giant multinational corporations led by those based in the usa and eu are buying up assets including essential utilities from our countries in sri lanka agreements have been framed to purchase the water resources board and the survey department earlier restrictions on transferring acquired funds abroad are removed the welfare state is dismantled and the tax burden shifted from the rich one per cent that owns capital to the 99 per cent living on a daily income the ranil wickremesinghe government backed by the tna and slmc with some help from the jvp are the representatives of both the local and foreign one per cent who own capital the tax burden is shifted from the one per cent to the 99 per cent to perpetuate the power of the one per cent the policy of divide and rule is applied exploiting local racial religious caste tribal differences on a global scale this is why the national question remains unsolved in sri lanka lip service is paid to democracy but elections are not held draconian laws like the counter terrorism cta act are replacing the prevention of terrorism act pta to pave the way for an authoritarian police state ranil wickremesinghe the chairman of the asian chapter of the global conservative international serves usa s interests not sri lanka s the door is opened for foreign intervention way forward the prime task is for the 99 per cent sinhalese tamils muslims and others to unite as one sri lankan nation all oppression based on race religion caste gender and class must end the traitor ranil wickremesinghe and his government with its neoliberal policies must be defeated sooner the better all attempts to flout democracy by delaying elections or by creating conditions of social unrest and conflict to pave the way for a dictatorship using the cta must be prevented sri lanka must withdraw its support for resolution 30 1 at the unhrc all military and trade agreements that harm our national interest must be rescinded we must return to our traditional non aligned foreign policy friendship with all subservient to none we must re establish our national social welfare economy to serve our people both in the north and south a modern industrial economy with maximal value addition to our raw materials using advanced science technology and innovation and promoting local human resource skills is what we need definition of a racist during question time prof hoole thavarasa deputy leader of the epdp and others questioned why the lssp was associating with racists like mahinda rajapaksa my response was mr is a sinhala buddhist nationalist like sambandan of the tna who is a tamil hindu nationalist they are not racists while mr stands for an independent sovereign sri lankan nation developing a national economy that is not subservient to the west sambandan is for a subservient usa dominated economy in the expectation that the latter will help solve the national question in favour of the tamils mr sambandan is forgetting that the usa will not solve this problem but rather use it to divide and rule the country through the unp as it has done in many countries round the world such as in the middle east when i was asked about the role of the lssp and whether the mr led future government would use the all party representative committee report to solve the national question my response was i have already made that request in writing and hopes that it will be accepted and a suitable consensus will be reached

sterling trades broadly lower today and suffers fresh selling in early us session some attributes the decline to reports that uk attorney general geoffrey cox and brexit minister stephen barclay won t get any breakthrough on irish backstop in brussels today but it is actually hardly any news uk government is seeking some legally binded assurances on the temporary nature of the backstop meanwhile eu showed no indication on back down from the principle of avoiding hard irish border pound s could be partly due to weak pmi data or it s just reversing the rally on fading risks of no deal brexit there is just no fresh development for sterling bulls to cheer for meanwhile dollar is the strongest one for today as treasury yield regains strength usd cad breached 1 3340 resistance but there is again no

rosengren may take several fomc meetings to see how much economy will slow boston fed president eric rosengren said in a speech that the most likely outcome for 2019 is relatively healthy u s economic growth somewhat above 2 percent over the course of the year with inflation very close to fed policymakers 2 percent target and a u s labor market that continues to tighten somewhat but he also warned that policymakers cannot place complete faith in what they believe is the most likely outcome us growth would slow due to diminishing fiscal stimulus and the effects of four increases in interest rates last year but to rosengren growth above 2 would still be sufficient to bring additional improvements to labor markets without much risk of higher inflation which is a very welcome outcome he also noted some risk that more pronounced slowdowns in the rest of the world could dampen u s growth more than i am forecasting meanwhile there is less reason to fear overheating with somewhat greater risks to the outlook that justifies a pause in recent monetary tightening cycle and it remains to be seen whether the few signs of weakness at the turn of the year reflect an underlying slowdown in the economy or a response to a variety of temporary concerns that may fade it may be several meetings of fomc before fed policymakers have a clearer read on whether the risks are becoming reality and by how much the economy will slow compared to last year trump to end preferential trade treatment to india and turkey trump sent a letter to congressional leaders notifying his intention to end preferential trade treatment to india he complained that i am taking this step because after intensive engagement between the united states and the government of india i have determined that india has not assured the united states that it will provide equitable and reasonable access to the markets of india under trump s instruction the us trade representative also issued a statement on its intention to terminate generalized system of preferences gsp designation of both india and turkey the statement noted that india s termination from gsp follows its failure to provide the united states with assurances that it will provide equitable and reasonable access to its markets in numerous sectors turkey s termination from gsp follows a finding that it is sufficiently economically developed and should no longer benefit from preferential market access to the united states market and by statute these changes may not take effect until at least 60 days after the notifications to congress and the governments of india and turkey and will be enacted by a presidential proclamation india commerce secretary anup wadhawan said us ending the preferential treatment to india has relatively limited impact the duty benefits were just at usd 190m even though it s the largest beneficiary of the gsp with 5 7 billion in imports to the u s given duty free status also wadhawan said india doesn t plan to impose retaliatory tariffs on us goods both countries have been working on a trade package to address each other s concerns boe uk financial system can withstand worst case disorderly brexit boe noted in the financial policy summary that the core of the financial system is prepared for wide range of risks it could face and it could withstand even a worst case disorderly brexit in such case there will be a sudden imposition of trade barriers with the eu loss of existing trade agreements with other countries severe customs disruption a sharp increase in the risk premium on uk assets and negative spillovers to wider uk financial markets but major uk banks capital ratios are more than three times higher than before the global financial crisis thus these banks have large buffers of capital to absorb losses the capital is even sufficient to withstand severe global stresses happening at the same time of worst case disorderly brexit ecb and boe activate currency swap arrangements

unchanged at 1 50 today as widely expected the message of the accompanying statement is largely unchanged rba maintained the central scenarios of growth inflation employment outlook and continued to expect the gradual progress of reducing unemployment and inflation returning to target the central back acknowledged that economy slowed over the second half of 2018 but it maintained the central scenario is still to grow by around 3 this year the outlook is supported by rising business investment higher levels of spending on public infrastructure and increased employment inflation remains low and stable the central scenario is for underlying inflation to be at 2 in 2019 and 2 25 in 2020 labor markets remains strong and further decline in unemployment rate to 4 75 is expected over the next couple of years main domestic uncertainty remains the strength of household consumption in the context of weak growth in household income and falling housing prices in some cities but rba expects

haiti s recent uprising is only the latest example of the country s resistance to imperialism the haitian masses have mobilized a new wave of protest against the corrupt government of president jovenel moïse it began with demonstrations last summer in july and august re emerged in november and december and exploded again in the first two weeks of february when hundreds of thousands marched in all the major cities of the country from the capital of port au prince to the northern city of cap haïtien the demonstrators demanded an investigation into what happened to billions of dollars of funds from venezuela an end to austerity measures and price increases for basic goods and the resignation of moïse and his prime minister jean henry céant the government predictably responded with a combination of concessions and repression it rescinded the price increases and promised investigations into corruption but neither moïse nor céant agreed to step down at the same time the police and army backed up by the un forces nominally in haiti to ensure peace cracked down on the protests killing 26 people and injuring 77 since february 7 taking the long view of this crisis the uprising is the latest example of revolt against the strategies pursued by great empires since haiti s birth as an independent nation state more than two centuries ago in the more recent past american imperialism s imposition of neoliberal structural adjustment programs on haiti in the 1980s followed by two u s backed coups against former president jean bertrand aristide undermined the project of social reform to address the country s deep social inequality now those grievances are again bursting out into the open the slave revolution led by toussaint l ouverture succeeded in driving out haiti s french masters in 1804 and fending off britain and spain and yet imperialism would not leave haiti alone though the world s imperial powers couldn t directly colonize haiti they could compel the free black republic to pay an enormous price for its liberation isolating it from the world economy and in the case of france forcing haiti to pay 21 billion in today s dollars for the loss of its slaves these powers also meddled in haitian politics backing different factions of the ruling class that has exploited and oppressed the country s peasantry and small working class for the last two centuries the u s repeatedly invaded the country to back up its handpicked autocrats occupying from 1915 to 1934 and creating a domestic military force with the sole purpose of repressing the haitian masses during the cold war the u s supported the brutal regime of françois papa doc duvalier as an ally against castro s cuba he ruled the country through terror enforced by his own paramilitary force the ton ton macoutes after papa doc s death in 1971 the u s backed his son and anointed successor jean claude baby doc duvalier this father son dictatorship killed between 30 000 and 60 000 people in order to cement its rule over the course of nearly 30 years under the influence of washington in the 1980s baby doc implemented a neoliberal economic program with the aim of turning the country into a giant export processing zone based on exploitation of workers drawn out of the peasant majority and into the cities these plans for sweatshop development failed triggering a mass movement called lavalas that drove baby doc from the country and eventually led to elections in 1991 won by liberation theologist and leader of the struggle jean bertrand aristide he and his party fanmi lavalas hoped to implement a program of social democratic reforms to alleviate the country s desperate poverty but the u s and haiti s ruling class united against him with the military staging a coup that drove aristide into exile after protests within haiti and internationally the u s returned aristide to power but on the condition that he agree to implement washington s neoliberal program count years lost to the coup as part of his term and agree to step down in 1996 while aristide succeeded in abolishing the despised haitian army and did resist some of washington s neoliberal dictates he implemented other parts of them and so did his successor and ally rené préval who governed until aristide won re election in 2001 back in office he continued to advocate redistribution of wealth and demand reparations from france for the debt imposed on haiti after the revolution but he was unable to implement many reforms and many in his government became corrupt leading to mass disillusionment with his rule the haitian ruling class and the right took advantage of this to stage a campaign of destabilization then in 2004 with the country reeling the u s kidnapped aristide and forced him into exile after this second coup washington and its allies deployed un forces to occupy the country from 2004 until 2017 when they were replaced with a smaller force assigned supposedly to ensure the rule of law when new elections were held in 2006 préval again won but he at best implemented neoliberalism with a human face failing to enact any significant reforms in the interests of the masses as a result the country s workers the urban poor and peasants have suffered ever worsening poverty the world bank estimates that 59 percent of the nation s 10 5 million people live below the official poverty line of 2 41 a day while a shocking 24 percent survive in extreme poverty defined as less than 1 23 a day and with such poverty comes hunger so pervasive that usaid estimates half the population is undernourished then in 2010 a devastating earthquake struck flattening whole sections of port au prince where housing had been built with next to no regulation in accordance with neoliberal doctrine the haitian government estimated that the quake killed 300 000 people while other analysts put the total at about 100 000 more than 1 3 million people were displaced and close to 40 000 were still living in camps as of 18 months ago on top of that three hurricanes thomas in 2010 sandy in 2012 and matthew in 2016 swept through the country destroying villages farmlands and whole sections of cities with devastating floods matthew was the worst it killed 546 people displaced 175 500 and pushed 806 000 into extreme food insecurity the social conditions wrought by imperialism and the haitian ruling class turned a series of natural disasters into a social catastrophe the u s and other international donors disbursed 10 billion in foreign assistance and promised in the words of bill clinton to build back better instead they betrayed the country and its people the biggest scandal centered on the red cross which raised half a billion dollars from appeals and claimed to have built homes for 130 000 people after the earthquake but as an investigation by propublica and npr proved only six permanent homes were built aid largely bypassed the haitian state and ended up in the coffers of international ngos most based in washington and other imperial cities as a result the haitian state was incapacitated and private services provided by international and local agencies proliferated to such an extent that haiti has been called the republic of ngos the development that did happen merely laid out the red carpet for the predatory tourist industry and established new sweatshop complexes even much of that failed to materialize and the un which had promised to provide disaster relief behaved as its critics predicted like an occupying army repressing protests by a desperate population worst of all un troops introduced cholera into the country for the first time a fact the un denied until 2016 the ensuing epidemic killed 10 000 people and only recently subsided abandoned betrayed and disillusioned the haitian masses largely sat out a series of elections that brought american backed neoliberal puppets to power michel martelly a former kompa singer nicknamed sweet micky narrowly won an election riddled with controversy ruled as a neoliberal technocrat and restored the dreaded haitian army with the sole purpose of domestic repression he handpicked his successor moïse a businessman whose most recent enterprise is a failed export oriented banana plantation moïse won the presidency in 2016 with only 18 percent of voters participating in the election martelly and moïse proved themselves venal rulers who plundered the state coffers for their own enrichment they saw an opportunity in venezuela s petrocaribe alliance flush with money from high oil prices at the time hugo chávez launched it in 2005 to promote a regional reformist strategy of state led capitalist development as an alternative to washington s neoliberal consensus venezuela sold oil to 12 caribbean countries at 60 percent of the market rate with the remaining 40 percent paid for by long term low interest loans to the consternation of the u s haiti joined petrocaribe in 2007 then president préval promised to use the 4 billion in credit to build hospitals schools and roads however the corrupt governments led by martelly and moïse gobbled up more than 2 billion of the funds for themselves and their cronies the scandal became public when a haitian senate commission published a 650 page investigative report on the petrocaribe program according to the new york times it implicated much of haiti s political class in inflating government contracts funneling money to ghost companies and a host of other financial improprieties after oil prices collapsed venezuela entered a crisis of its own which was further compounded by u s sanctions the crisis brought the petrocaribe program to a close and left haiti billions of dollars in debt to venezuela desperate for funds the haitian state turned to the imf last year for a 96 million loan which unsurprisingly came with neoliberal strings attached it required haiti to cut its fuel subsidy and sell it at prevailing market prices immediately jacking up gas prices by 50 percent predictably this inflamed an already rising inflation rate with prices increasing by double digit percentages each year since 2014 putting all kinds of basic necessities out of reach for many households desperate and enraged the people of haiti want answers and they have been flooding into the streets in repeated waves of protest since last summer in february protests shut down most of the country s cities and marchers converged on moïse s house in the elite suburb of pétion ville after a guard beat a woman protester the crowd pelted his property with stones protesters are calling for the president and prime minister to resign an end to austerity measures and an investigation into the theft of the petrocaribe funds with the backing of the u s and un the haitian state responded with brutality deploying the police and army against the february demonstrations moïse refused to resign i jovenel moïse head of state will not give the country up to armed gangs and drug traffickers he declared he and céant did offer to trim their perks promised further investigations into the misspending of the petrocaribe funds increased the minimum wage and lowered prices of basic goods but who would trust this utterly corrupt regime either to investigate itself for its crimes or enact reforms in the interests of its people the rising against the government has precipitated an even deeper crisis in haitian society as imports of food distribution of water and shipments of fuel have been interrupted disgracefully novum energy which has a contract to supply fuel to the country stopped its tankers from unloading 60 000 barrels of gas and 260 000 barrels of diesel because the government was behind in payments thereby exacerbating shortages of fuel while the protests have subsided for now the haitian masses face big challenges ahead various reformists have attempted to position themselves as a credible alternative but their strategy blazed by aristide and his party fanmi lavalas hit the inevitable contradictions of trying to run capitalism with a human face under the thumb of american imperialism ominously the haitian right is also re emerging and putting itself forward as an alternative to the corrupt neoliberal rulers baby doc s son nicolas duvalier is even rumored to be considering a run for the presidency in the next election meanwhile the haitian left which struggled to position itself as a force independent of aristide s reformism is trying to rebuild itself amid the new wave of protests one thing is for sure the u s is part of the problem perhaps the most important part facing the haitian people the trump administration has proven itself utterly hypocritical it backed the current venal regime to the hilt and betrayed promises to haitians in the u s in a blatantly racist fashion trump s double standards are brazen on the one hand his administration denounces nicolás maduro in venezuela on wildly exaggerated claims while the u s plots a coup to overthrow him on the other it supports moïse s brutal and corrupt rule in haiti and thus only calls for new elections which it will rig in favor of neoliberal candidates as a face saving solution why because moïse and his ilk are useful puppets for washington s imperial ambitions including against venezuela moïse s government for example joined the u s and 17 other countries in the organization of american states in passing a resolution refusing to recognize maduro s government trump has also betrayed promises to haitians in the u s and on its border in mexico during the 2016 campaign he promised haitians that he wanted to be your greatest champion but in office he has proved himself their greatest enemy infamously in a meeting in the oval office he complained about immigrants coming from shithole countries like haiti trump rescinded temporary protected status tps to haitians which had allowed 59 000 to stay in the country since the earthquake that led to an exodus of haitians crossing into canada in the hopes of finding safe haven there while the courts have put a stay on that order those with tps still face an uncertain future moreover amid the spiraling crisis in haiti thousands have left the country for latin america and many of those have attempted to enter the u s through mexico only to be denied entry at the border haitians have become the target of anti migrant xenophobia and racism throughout the region most horrifically in the dominican republic which deported 120 000 haitians last year haiti and its people are thus caught in an organic crisis precipitated by imperialism neoliberal capitalism and the failure and collapse of reformism within the country and region nevertheless the haitian masses have yet again demonstrated their determination to fight for democracy and equality their resistance offers the country s left the opportunity to rebuild and lead a new wave of struggle amid this crisis activists in the u s must defend the right of haitians to determine their own fate including overthrowing and replacing the current corrupt neoliberal government and we must oppose the u s its imperialist allies and the un from interfering in their fight for liberation instead the u s and france should be forced to pay reparations to haiti for the debt trap in which they ensnared the country and for the neoliberal program they imposed on it so that the people have the resources to rebuild society in their own interests and we must agitate for the indefinite extension of tps for any haitians requesting it and open u s borders for haitians and all other migrants seeking safe haven we should see the haitian struggle as part of our revolutionary struggle for a new

was lowered enough for most companies to beat their beaten down estimates 8 everyone seems to have been emboldened by the q4 real gdp data in the usa a solid 2 6 per cent annual rate i remember the days when a number like this was referred to as sluggish no mention i have to say about the spurious run up in business capital spending which somehow escaped the monthly indicators but showed through in the gdp report outside of that and gdp would have gripped a 1 handle in q4 now the data have been spotty overall but the mantra in the economics community is that we are in a 2016 type of soft patch that will prove transitory 9 the prevailing view in china is that the data are stabilizing and fiscal and monetary stimulus efforts are going to turn growth back into acceleration mode and the equity market rally might lead one to believe that this is indeed the case note that the shanghai index led the world on the way down last year and led the way up last fall recall that the chinese market had already bottomed prior to the late year u s meltdown the msci decision to quadruple the representation of chinese shares in its flagship emerging market composite to 3 3 per cent in line

10 there s even some renewed enthusiasm in the euro area which is brand spanking new even though italy s macro numbers have remained abysmal confidence seems to have returned in both france and germany and the just released data showed the eurozone jobless rate slipping to a 10 year low of 7 8 per cent and the headline inflation did the unthinkable and ticked up to 1 5 per cent from 1 4 per cent though oil prices had a thing or two to do with that while these factors may be encouraging the bulls it is nevertheless amazing that we could have a situation this past week where investors positively rerated the economic outlook and repriced the federal reserve for a renewed tightening in policy after all the citigroup economic surprise index for the united states deteriorated to 43 4 which is the weakest it has been since august 2017 and the global index sagged to 32 4 a level we last saw in june 2013 which only begged for more monetary easing americans should take note that their little brother north of the border saw real gdp growth throttle back to a mere 0 4 annual rate in q4 the atlanta fed took its q1 real gdp growth estimate to a microscopic 0 3 per cent annual rate and the ny fed is down to 0 9 per cent even the usually bullish macroeconomic advisers cut its q1 view to 1 2 per cent from an already puny 1 6 per cent the week before be that as it may the consensus is adamant that this is all related to temporary factors like the weather the government shutdown and trade tariff tensions advertisement 7 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content even if true the reality is that despite this broad consensus that the data softness is temporary the numbers are coming in surprisingly weak the economists knew that this so called transitory malaise was going to result in an ism decline in february but why did the index fall so hard from 56 6 to 54 2 rather than to 55 9 as was widely expected why are the numbers surprising so much to the downside this was after all the worst ism reading since november 2016 new orders slipped to 55 5 from 58 2 production sagged to 54 8 from 60 5 in the past six months the headline has receded 6 6 points which has not happened since the credit rating downgrade in august 2011 each of the past three recessions were presaged by such a dive and the only other head fake was in 1995 note that in 1995 and 2011 the fed was forced into easing action to lean against escalating downside economic risks all the powell fed has done so far is talk oh and as for the latest backup in bond yields this too looks temporary because the ism data showed prices paid declining for the fourth month in a row to 49 4 from 49 6 nearby peak was over 80 the first time since january february of 2016 that we have seen back to back sub 50 readings on the inflation metric and keep in mind that back in early 2016 oil and commodity prices were sinking not sharply rebounding as

s for sure only one economist polled by bloomberg was calling for such a decline and we already know that auto sales plunged 5 per cent in january 16 6 million units with no recovery at all in february 16 56 million units which is the lowest tally since august 2017 the consensus was looking for a rebound to 16 8 million but this was not forthcoming the friday data on pce was a tell tale that no sorry the retail sales plunge that month was not due to any hasty reporting flaws and while the consensus was looking for a decline indeed the slump was twice as much as what was generally expected real discretionary outlays fell 0 4 per cent in the sharpest decline since february of last year and before that september 2009 when it wasn t even clear yet that the great recession had run its course perhaps even more disconcerting was the extent to which essentials are being cut from the family budget nondiscretionary spending contracted 1 1 per cent in december which is a deeper slide than anything we ever saw in each of the past three recessions having occurred just two other times in the past three decades advertisement 9 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the decline in real consumer spending was right across the board in december the government shutdown happened too late to have any perceptible impact the weather that month was just fine the mantra by the experts was how great the holiday shopping season was going the stock market decline had little to do with it because the wealth effect on spending occurs with lags it is not contemporaneous i can t believe how many times i ve heard this as a reason volume spending on durable goods sagged 1 9 per cent in the worst month since september 2009 nondurables dropped 1 2 per cent in the largest decline since the month of the lehman collapse in september 2008 and even spending on services typically resilient to the forces of the business cycle dipped 0 2 per cent something we haven t seen since august 2012 let s not forget that the spending plan components of the latest conference board consumer confidence survey rolled over in a meaningful way in february and this includes the effects of the stock market rebound across autos housing major appliances and even vacations by road and by air ignore forward looking indicators at your peril advertisement 10 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content and the next question is whether canada is acting as a leading indicator too after all look at the similarities tensions with china a national leader under pressure an early year stock market boom a central bank that has been pushed to the sidelines after a rate hiking cycle signs of deleveraging in the household sector and the benefits of the recovery in oil prices canada may be small for a country but it s economy is bigger than california s and being so well integrated with the united states it may be serving up a wake up call here keeping in mind that california has been known to have been a leading indicator at times in the past as well one can kiss goodbye to the bank of canada s efforts to keep market based rate hike expectations alive so americans should take note that their little brother north of the border saw real gdp growth throttle back to a mere 0 4 per cent annual rate in q4 from 2 per cent in q3 and 2 6 per cent in q2 of last year the bright spot in the report was actually dismal in its own right a 0 7 per cent annualized increase in real consumer spending housing contracted at a 14 7 per cent annual rate and business spending plunged 10 9 per cent 4 8 per cent for machinery and equipment and 15 per cent for nonresidential construction the government sector didn t help either 0 6 per cent if not for an inventory boost curiously at the same time as imports declined the headline would have been much worse indeed real final domestic demand contracted at a 1 5 per cent annual rate in q4 and that followed a 0 5 per cent drop in q3 back to back declines in this metric virtually all the time are associated with official recessions advertisement 11 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the monthly series showed a 0 1 per cent gdp dip in december and that sets the stage for another flat quarterly reading at best for q1 one can kiss goodbye to the bank of canada s efforts to keep market based rate hike expectations alive all the more so with core inflation still modestly below target and to the early year rally in the canadian dollar as well the loonie should not be rallying in the face of a horrible 0 8 per cent rundown in industrial activity in december the fourth setback in the past five months contracting at a 2 3 per cent annual rate through the piece this all comes as a bit of a surprise given the alleged good news we have seen on the employment front but the household survey may have been flashing a false signal the companion though lagged seph data showed a 20 000 net payroll slide in december and even though the headline household survey data appeared to have been decent the workweek has shrunk 0 3 per cent the second decline in a row and flat or down in four of the past five months hours worked are a leading indicator for job creation and the news here is not good and keep in mind that the q4 inventory bulge does not augur well for any near term recovery in manufacturing activity advertisement 12 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the one thing canada is showing us all is that one monetary policy does influence the economy with a lag this receives scant attention from u s economists and two ballyhooed infrastructure spending sounds great from a political feel good standpoint but doesn t do a very good job at affecting the business cycle but won t stop the big government spenders south of the border from clamoring for a big package financed by money printing out of the fed one final comment on the risk on rally that has taken hold in the first two months of the year i would hazard to say that if we hadn t endured that q4 meltdown such a flashy rebound never would have occurred as things stand the stock market is still more than four per cent off the highs and actually despite all the euphoria of late has really made no headway at all for the past 14 months it could be dangerous to extrapolate very good january february stock market gains into the future because if memory serves me correctly the s p in prior such years went on to post mediocre gains or outright declines in the ensuing 10 months

talks have achieved a breakthrough in some areas while the negotiations were difficult zhong said both teams are continuing with their work trump to end preferential trade treatment to india and turkey trump sent a letter to congressional leaders notifying his intention to end preferential trade treatment to india he complained that i am taking this step because after intensive engagement between the united states and the government of india i have determined that india has not assured the united states that it will provide equitable and reasonable access to the markets of india under trump s instruction the us trade representative also issued a statement on its intention to terminate generalized system of preferences gsp designation of both india and turkey the statement noted that india s termination from gsp follows its failure to provide the united states with assurances that it will provide equitable and reasonable access to its markets in numerous sectors turkey s termination from gsp follows a finding that it is sufficiently economically developed and should no longer benefit from preferential market access to the united states market and by statute these changes may not take effect until at least 60 days after the notifications to congress and the governments of india and turkey and will be enacted by a presidential proclamation india commerce secretary anup wadhawan said us ending the preferential treatment to india has relatively limited impact the duty benefits were just at usd 190m even though it s the largest beneficiary of the gsp

china sought to shore up its slowing economy through billions of dollars in planned tax cuts and infrastructure spending with economic growth at its weakest in almost 30 years due to softer domestic demand and a trade war with the united states the government is targeting economic growth of 6 0 to 6 5 percent in 2019 premier li keqiang said at tuesday s opening of the annual meeting of china s parliament less than the 6 6 percent gross domestic product growth reported last year sources told reuters earlier this year that china would cut its 2019 growth target to 6 0 to 6 5 percent from the 2018 target of around 6 5 percent as both global and domestic demand ebbed and the u s trade war heightened economic risks speaking in beijing s great hall of the people li warned of the challenges the world s second largest economy faced and pledged to keep it on a safe footing with an array of stimulus measures the environment facing china s development this year is more complicated and more severe he said there will be more risks and challenges that are either predictable or unpredictable and we must be fully prepared for a tough battle li said china s fiscal policy would become more forceful with planned cuts of nearly 2 trillion yuan 298 3 billion in taxes and fees for companies those tax cuts are more aggressive than the 1 3 trillion yuan delivered in 2018 and include reductions aimed at supporting the manufacturing transport and construction sectors china s gdp last year expanded at its slowest pace since 1990 due to the trade war and beijing s crackdown on financial risks which raised corporate borrowing costs and hurt investment analysts say beijing s move to adopt a gdp target range rather than a single growth figure gives policymakers room to maneuver but the increase in planned fiscal stimulus marks an explicit acknowledgement that authorities remain concerned about growth if you are not sick you will not take so many medicines at one time said iris pang greater china economist at ing wholesale banking it means the headwinds have not gone away they are still there a longer term campaign to curb polluting and low value industries also slowed china s vast manufacturing sector china has ramped up the propaganda in the run up to parliament with state media releasing english language videos and even a rap song praising the event as an exercise in chinese democracy though the legislature never rejects laws and its members are chosen for their loyalty to the communist party the annual gathering in the capital includes more than 3 000 delegates who come from all over china with ethnic minorities showing up in colorful traditional outfits to support growth li said china would closely monitor employment at exporting companies heavily exposed to the u s market and cut the value added tax vat for the manufacturing sector to 13 percent from 16 percent vat for the transport and construction sectors will be cut to 9 percent from 10 percent china aims to create more than 11 million new urban jobs this year and keep the urban unemployment rate within 4 5 percent in line with its 2018 goals at the same time it will cut the social security fees paid by companies deeper tax cuts support to smes in a push to ramp up infrastructure investment china s finance ministry raised the special bond issuance quota for local governments to 2 15 trillion yuan 320 8 billion from 1 35 trillion yuan last year the lower tax revenue and higher government spending push china s budget deficit target for this year up to 2 8 percent of gdp from last year s 2 6 percent the government has also set a consumer inflation target of around 3 percent despite a recent softening in price rises to less than 2 percent which gives beijing some room to stimulate consumption over the past year china s central bank has cut the reserve requirements for commercial lenders five times to spur loans to small and private companies vital for growth and jobs li said on tuesday monetary policy would be neither too tight nor too loose and that the government would not resort to a flood of liquidity growth targets for m2 money supply which includes cash in circulation and deposits and total social financing this year would be in line with nominal gdp growth to support private and smaller firms li said beijing will step up targeted cuts in the reserve requirement ratio for smaller and medium sized banks with an aim to boost lending to small companies by large banks by more than 30 percent the government must also continue reforms to hand more power to market forces li said including steps to reduce red tape so that companies can spend more time doing business and less time chasing approvals trade risks addressing one of the biggest challenges china s economy faces the government s work report to parliament said it would continue to promote sino u s trade negotiations and was committed to safeguarding economic globalization and free trade li s work report also said china will further improve market access for foreign investment and create an environment in which chinese and foreign firms are treated as equals and engage in fair competition separately china s top banking regulator said on tuesday beijing could absolutely reach an agreement with the united states on opening up its financial sector even as the country s commerce minister admitted talks with washington had been difficult in recent weeks the united states and china appear to have moved closer to a trade deal that would roll back u s tariffs on at least 200 billion worth of chinese goods u s secretary of state mike pompeo said on monday he thought both nations were on the cusp of a deal to end their trade war reuters content is

by hopewell chin ono donald trump has extended the targeted sanctions against zimbabwean officials for another year after declaring that their behavior is still a foreign policy risk for the u s government the targeted sanctions should not be confused with zimbabwe democracy and economic recovery act zdera that hasn t been used before because it can only be used after zimbabwe has paid its multilateral debts the road ahead will not be an easy one for zimbabwe s economy and neither will it be a short leap into normalcy for its battered political and economic reputation that currently is lying on the floor the finance minister mthuli ncube must know this reality too well than anybody else in president emmerson mnangagwa s embattled ministerial cabinet that might be reshuffled soon according to rumours swirling around state house reshuffling of cabinet ministers without resolving the civil service incompetence is totally pointless civil service bureaucrats do the work in government and ministers only give policy direction we currently have the bulk of mugabe s senior civil service in place barking the same old hot air rhetoric so how can things change unfortunately nobody in the current cabinet is willing to publicly articulate that the nation s leaders must rebuild trust with their citizens and the international community before they can think of sleeping easy at night with the economy back on track like any relationship that is broken it will be harder to rebuild than destroy and there will be more international checks and balances than ever before especially after the disastrous false start to president mnangagwa s touted new dispensation that zimbabweans are now jokingly calling the not so new republic the absence of a civil war or mass migration out of any country keeps it off the international radar of the rest of the world and zimbabwe is no different it is not high on any policy maker s screen at the moment except for the usual annual sanction renewals the lack of international interest and immediate urgency towards zimbabwe makes it difficult for mthuli ncube to motivate the required economic assistance until the previously agreed plans of action are in place and trust and confidence is being regained years ago zimbabwe punched above its weight because it was a frontline state and afterwards because so many policy makers around the world were heavily invested in its success something that looked very real in the 1980s zimbabwe also had a controversial very loud and at times foul mouthed president whose stage stature was captivating to the rest of the world but unfortunately mostly for the wrong things that controversy cost the country a lot in regards to its global standing as former president robert mugabe had the ability to wickedly annoy with his empty fiery rhetoric that he used devastatingly in order to embarrass world powers at international gatherings only for cheap entertainment value however after mugabe s demise much was invested in wanting to see zimbabwe succeed against all odds but unfortunately his successors proved to be equally disappointing and dispiriting once their power assured many watchers both home and abroad were greatly disappointed because they had chosen to give president mnangagwa and his team a chance regardless of their messy past a past that they invariably share with their former commander in chief robert mugabe an otherwise quiet and orderly election turned into a bloody affair in august of 2018 when the zimbabwean military gunned down innocent civilians this happened in the middle of an opposition demonstration against the country s electoral management body the zimbabwe electoral commission this was however resolved with the appointment of a commission of inquiry and a cabinet that was applauded by even president mnangagwa s well known critics unfortunately for zimbabwe the mishandling of the currency situation turned into a pricing nightmare resulting in large fuel queues and a sharp fuel price increase that motivated a massive stay away protest similarly like what happened in august of 2018 the military was deployed during this stay away in january of 2019 and civilians were killed some were violently beaten up and women gave untested testimonies of sexual abuse at the hands of the military the government also took the unprecedented action of switching off the internet something that caused a major crisis for companies that are based in harare and yet supplying services to the rest of the world a major kenyan financial services company was greatly affected and there is now talk that some companies that were also affected are now moving their internet based operations to other reliable african countries this is bad for zimbabwe s business reputation and contrary to what the president s spokesman george charamba said when he argued that investors are not interested or worried about internet shutdowns that has actually become a major headache for the zimbabwean government if senior civil servants like george charamba are not aware of it it means that there is a catastrophic failure of intelligence or he was simply playing politics and propaganda when all this happened the world turned off including britain that had been closely involved in the ascendancy of president mnangagwa through unprecedented support after his inauguration or at least lack of public remonstrations as what the british government did during mugabe s era britain sent former harvard professor and the then minister for africa rory stewart to meet president mnangagwa on the day of his inauguration in november of 2017 if anyone was ever in doubt of britain s position regarding president mnangagwa s ascendancy to power the immediate dispatching of rory stewart to harare settled those doubts and answered the question of britain s position the message to the rest of world was very clear the former colonizer had blessed the military coup that brought president mnangagwa into office that however is enough history to understand what happened in the first fourteen months of president mnangagwa s reign but perhaps i must add that he also failed to implement any of his major promises that were meant to get the u s sanctions removed where do we go from here now after this tumultuous start to mnangagwa s presidency and after donald trump has extended the sanctions for another year although many have correctly asserted the need to repeal repressive legislation such as access to information and protection of privacy act aippa and the public order and security act posa as a necessary step towards normalizing relations with the west more now needs to be done after the chaotic and disappointing beginning and trump s actions the removal of only these repressive laws will not help attract the much needed foreign direct investment fdi or the removal of sanctions it also won t lead to the international financial institutions ifis to start lending zimbabwe money for infrastructure projects or infuse cash for the painful and yet necessary monetary reform program mthuli ncube like patrick chinamasa before him has failed to implement the debt and arrears clearance plan which was first adopted in lima in 2015 in peru the lima agreement was intended to resolve the country s foreign debt overhang and unlock fresh capital through the world bank international monetary fund and the paris club it would have also signalled to other lenders that zimbabwe was now credit worthy after almost two decades in the doghouse as a pariah state with zero credit rating and a bogus currency called the bond note later comically renamed the rtgs dollar implementation of the lima agreement would have been a precursor to reform and assistance but i doubt very much that zanupf is willing to hurt its murky cash cows and revenue streams that are mainly benefiting the political elites and their business surrogates this is because any reform agenda will involve cleaning up areas like the fuel sector that is currently central to zimbabwe s problems and yet it is benefiting the most powerful state actors and business interests close to the seat of power just after the removal of robert mugabe many were very confident that president mnangagwa and his team were willing to reform and give their soiled reputations a thorough make over allowing zanupf to be able to win elections again without deploying any form of coercion or brutal violence and also more importantly getting the country s economy back on track president mnangagwa s ardent supporters billed him as the president for business as they argued that he was more interested in the country s economy than politics unfortunately it all went pear shaped and the robert mugabe excuse script of sanctions and the legendary load mouthing reappeared again only without mugabe s linguistic sophistry it was quite clear that the president and his team had no cogent plan in place on how they would turn things around this is because there are many interests to be appeased otherwise how can one explain the total loss of direction the interests start with the military that assisted him to ascend to power his immediate political surrogates his business friends and interests and somewhat ethnic base that saw him appointing folks from his ethnic group to lead other provinces something that is talked about in hushed tones and has really upset many folks in his zanupf party this played out on the parliament pavement when the independent member of parliament for norton temba mliswa accused his midlands based karanga ethnic group of running the country like a mafia president mnangagwa s challenges are too many and varied to put down on a paper what is needed is to look at what he has to do now to get his presidency back on track international investors and policy makers don t believe that zimbabwe s political ruling class is serious about its commitments to reform that it preached to the rest of the world post mugabe s removal in the midst of the euphoria there maybe sympathy among africans working in mid level slots in international financial institutions like the world bank and the imf but none of them have the political juice to assist zimbabwe if it doesn t reform and implement previously agreed international commitments the laws that cause companies to be skittish about investing such as majority ownership need to be rethought and designed in a manner that leads to investment while ensuring that black ownership increases for example most mines are running at under fifty percent capacity and i don t think that contracts for the lithium mines are in place yet the president and the government have to implement the lima agreement which will require them to reform parastatals by either getting rid of them through privatization or by professionalizing them and removing the excess employee baggage on their books will they be able to do this seeing that most of these folks in parastatals came through the ruling party structures and they are needed in government because of their desired level of loyalty the government needs to drastically cut its civil service bureaucracy that currently stands at about 500 000 workers doing that is a hotly contested area because of the political ramifications if the cull goes ahead the government needs to reduce its spending to levels that are acceptable levels that are economic and sustainable for the shivering economy that is currently in the intensive care unit zimbabwe needs to attend to the american zdera sanctions that have the potential to stop it from accessing international loans even if it pays its world bank debt currently the zimbabwean government talks about the removal of sanctions without doing anything about the problem sanctions are removed through engagement and not through empty rhetoric in state media or social media platforms they are also not removed through seeking solidarity with regional leaders that have no power or influence in the american political corridors lack of balance of payments and budget support from the world bank and international monetary fund imf has stalled economic growth and nobody has come to the table to fill that void because of zimbabwe s long standing reputation of breaking promises and agreements without the world bank and the international monetary fund debt clearance implementation zimbabwe s credit rating will be junk status zimbabwe last serviced its world bank debt exactly twenty years from today so with or without sanctions in place it wouldn t have been able to get lines of credit form the world bank or the imf or any other serious and reputable international creditor if zimbabwe had followed up on implementing the lima agreements the multilateral debt would have been paid up by 2016 according to the agreements and structured roadmap plan the ten point plan required zimbabwe to strengthen its financial sector confidence accelerate the re engagement process with the international community that has currently stalled again because of the chaotic state of affairs it also requires zimbabwe to revitalize its agriculture and the agro processing value chain by advancing beneficiation and value addition to the agriculture and mining resource endowments zimbabwe also agreed to focus on infrastructure development and unlocking the potential of small to medium enterprises and improving the investment climate to attract foreign direct investment lima also requires zimbabwe to accelerate public enterprises parastatals reform and improving public finance management and modernizing labour laws and the aligning of national laws to the constitution and adhering to the rule of law and finally pursuing an anti corruption thrust drive corruption and incompetence are central to zimbabwe s economic demise and as such without genuinely tackling these evils it would be tough for zimbabwe to be taken seriously as a born again economy driven and underpinned by a positive and progressive political agenda currently zimbabwe has been mainly assisted with aid inflows from the european union eu department for international development dfid and usaid that currently spend us 200million of american tax money annually in zimbabwe i have always argued that ordinarily zimbabwe needs trade more than it needs aid this will not happen until president mnangagwa s government sets its priorities right and remove the political and economic impediments currently choking the progressive side of government post the 2018 general election the assistance sought by certain ministries to start reforming parastatals has been blocked through resistance from hardliners and saboteurs in president mnangagwa s government these folks fear losing relevance without control of these state owned companies and hence they bellow anti western rhetoric to mask their corrupt enterprises rhetoric that goes against agreements that the government signed up to however without the required and agreed reforms zimbabwe will remain a pariah and broken state at war with its people pursuing an illusive dream to reconstruct and succeed this dream will remain a fleeting illusion to be pursued but never to be attained without a complete political and economic point of departure the ball is now firmly in zimbabwe s own court after trump s actions today we either chose to kick the ball wisely into goal or to throw it into the choppy deep sea zimbabwe must now become like cinderella and woo the princes and princesses of international capital through reforms before the us sanctions clock strikes at midnight again in march 2020 mthuli ncube will be in washington dc to meet the international financial institutions and help lobby against sanctions that trip is now pointless with today s action by president trump unfortunately for mthuli ncube he is in a corner outnumbered by the hawks and saboteurs who hold more power and sway on issues related to decision making in the zimbabwean government it is now up to president mnangagwa to either continue forging ahead with his current futile direction or to restructure his strategy if there ever was one there is no other way out of this mess for zimbabwe s famed crocodile as for us and all those that gave him unprecedented goodwill winston churchill once said that an appeaser is one who feeds a crocodile hoping that it will eat him last the broken promises are now making it extremely difficult for many folks that supported or gave a chance to president mnangagwa s presidency to do it again he has to be very dynamic and revolutionary to ever think of getting that international goodwill again hopewell

china on tuesday set its 2019 gdp growth target at 6 6 5 per cent lower than the annual 6 6 per cent growth witnessed last year according to a government report quoting national bureau of statistics figures the country however stated that the 2019 growth projection lowest target set in nearly three decades was comparatively high among major economies in the world and is in accordance with domestic and international expectations china also said it will lower its defence budget growth rate to 7 5 per cent in 2019 from 8 1 per cent last year the defence budget will be 1 19 trillion yuan a state media report said gdp figures in china seen together with india s show that two of the world s fastest growing economies have been slowing down in india figures released in february 2019 shows that the overall gdp growth estimate for 2018 19 was revised downwards to a five year low of 7 per cent as against the reserve bank of india s projection of 7 4 per cent for this fiscal advertisement on tuesday the chinese report presented by premier li keqiang at the 13th national people s congress in beijing noted that china has taken a pragmatic approach and made a moderate adjustment to the projections this is on the basis of a thorough assessment of destabilising factors and uncertainties affecting the economic performance the report states in the context of the protracted trade dispute between china and india li said that his country will continue to promote china us trade negotiations china is committed to safeguarding economic globalisation and free trade and actively involved in the reform of the world trade organization he said soon after the gdp target was announced an opinion piece on the official news agency xinhua noted one should not make a fetish of the growth rate also economic slowdown is not necessarily a siren not to mention a drag on the global growth it said that the key reason for the slowdown is a shift in the chinese government s growth model from an investment export driven one to a more sustainable style that draws strength from consumption services and innovations the report also set the year s target for urban job creation at above 11 million and said the targets for the survey based and registered urban unemployment rates are about 5 5 per cent and below 4 5 per cent respectively advertisement the target for urban job creation takes into account new entrants to the workforce in 2019 and allows leeway for arrangements to be made for workers displaced due to overcapacity cuts workers returning to the workforce after unemployment and rural residents moving into confirm jobs the report states china has also said that contribution from scientific and technological advances to economic growth will reach 59 2 per cent and research and development spending as a percentage of gdp will rise to 2 2 per cent according to reports it also promised further improvements to the environment committing to a cut in pm2 5 concentrations by 2 per cent in cities at and above prefecture level that fall short of the national standards it also noted that energy consumption per unit of gdp will decrease by about 3 per cent and carbon dioxide emissions per unit of gdp will fall by about 3 6 per cent and emissions of major pollutants will continue to decline in giving greater weight to these indicators which reflect the quality and effect of growth and the structural adjustments of the economy we want to primarily ensure that we are acting on the new development philosophy putting the vision of people entered development into practice and following the principle of giving priority to the quality and effect of growth the report states

to overcome the present foreign exchange crisis one of the most viable solutions will be to attract many export oriented industries through fdis capitalising on our strategic location but our high construction cost which will increase the setting up costs of an industrial venture could act as a disincentive to attracting fdis needed to spur economic growth pic by shehan gunasekara by eng col nissanka n wijeratne in any country the performance of the construction industry is often considered as a barometer of economic development at present our construction industry is plagued by low construction volume skilled worker shortage high construction costs and unequal competition from foreign contractors a clear indication on low construction volume is the 7 drop in cement consumption in 2018 compared to 2017 the construction industry contribute about 9 to the gdp employing about 600 000 in recent years the total annual construction turnover is about rs 800 billion which is expected to increase if the investments planned by the government materialise to overcome the present foreign exchange crisis one of the most viable solutions will be to attract many export oriented industries through fdis capitalising on our strategic location but our high construction cost which will increase the setting up costs of an industrial venture could act as a disincentive to attracting fdis needed to spur economic growth from a comparison of the construction costs of middle class housing it is evident that our unit cost of construction is the highest in the region second only to singapore which is a well developed country with a very high gdp per capita the following are some measures that can be taken to reduce the construction cost nbt on construction contracts nbt was not previously applicable to construction contracts it was introduced by the budget for 2017 introduction of nbt on construction contracts has a cascading effect due to the nature of construction projects which have several layers of subcontractors and specialist contractors e g piling air conditioning electrical lift installations etc which will be constituent components of a main contract also with the present operation of nbt there is a tax on tax situation as vat is charged on nbt as well considering the above it may be prudent to completely withdraw the nbt on construction contracts which was the practice up to 2017 withholding tax wht on construction sector services with the introduction of wht with effect from 1 april 2018 5 wht is to be deducted from work subcontractors and other small service providers if monthly payments exceed rs 50 000 but for employed persons paye tax is applicable only when the monthly gross salary exceed rs 100 000 as these small scale subcontractors are not registered with the inland revenue department this wht cannot be recovered by them and as such becomes an additional cost on the main contractors in the end therefore it is proposed to increase the threshold of rs 50 000 to rs 200 000 for 5 wht high cost of imported materials due to five different taxes imposed as stated before our unit construction cost is the highest in the south asian region a main reason is the five different taxes imposed on many imported construction materials the aggregate effect of these five taxes for ceramic tiles amounts to 107 6 of the cif value as the majority of the construction materials are imported with the application of such taxes it is no wonder that our construction cost is the highest table 2 shows an example of these taxes as applicable to ceramic tiles and sanitary ware for a cif value of rs 100 00 on top of these costs importers have to pay port charges as well it defies any logic that nbt and vat is charged even on the other 3 taxes viz customs duty cess and pal to reduce the construction cost and rationalise the tax calculations the following is proposed on import of construction materials limit cess levy to 15 on all imported construction materials and charge only on cif value withdraw pal and nbt completely on all imported construction materials compute vat wherever applicable only on the cif value to avoid tax on tax with the above proposals implemented the total taxes will reduce to 60 as against the present 107 62 we consider the margin of 45 60 vat is sufficient to protect local manufacturers supply of sand for construction work the government has very correctly imposed restrictions on mining river sand and transporting it due to the massive environmental damage caused due to excessive mining the total annual requirement of sand is estimated at 21 mcm million cubic meters the alternatives to river sand are the mechanically washed and sieved offshore sea sand and manufactured sand by crushing rock the annual supply of offshore sea sand and manufactured sand is not more than 3 mcm as such 18 mcm is still obtained from river beds out of this 18 mcm nearly 30 or 5 mcm of river sand are transported illegally without permits the price of river sand in colombo is rs 18 000 per cube 2 83 cm whereas washed and sieved offshore sea sand price is rs 10 300 per cube at nawala the only way to curb illicit river sand mining and transport is by making the cheaper sea sand available abundantly to meet the construction demand this will reduce the demand for river sand and at the same time reduce construction costs at present offshore sea sand is pumped only at muthurajawela by the sri lanka land reclamation and development corporation sllrdc but their present maximum annual supply capacity is only 350 000 cm even with the expected addition of a 2nd washing plant at muthurajawela the supply capacity will increase only to 1 300 000 cm but to make an impact on the market and reduce price the annual supply of sea sand should be targeted at a minimum of 5 mcm as such in parallel to the sllrdc supply at muthurajawela there should be another 2 supply points to pump sand from the deep sea one of the biggest constraints to pump sea sand wash and sieve is the large extent of land needed close to the beach and a fresh water source as pumping has to be done during a short period of 1 2 months due to high cost and the need to avoid rough weather during monsoons to undertake the supply of 2 mcm of sea sand annually will need land in extent of 25 ha the government should make available land 25 ha in extent near chilaw close to the beach on a concessionary lease with a 10 year tax holiday to set up an operation to pump sand from deep sea stockpile and supply after washing and sieving for this purpose even the former voa land at iranawila will be suitable another alternative to reduce the demand for river sand is to promote the manufacture of rock sand there are a few companies who have set up manufacturing plants to produce rock sand but when selling this sand to house builders and small contractors the producers are at a disadvantage this is because the manufactured sand is liable to vat whereas off shore sand and river sand are not liable as such it is proposed to also exempt manufactured sand from vat competition to local companies from foreign companies the local construction companies are at a tremendous disadvantage when competing with some of the foreign contractors due to various incentives provided by the foreign governments with cheaper import of materials and access to concessionary working capital in addition some of these companies continue to use construction machinery imported on a duty free basis in the past for foreign funded projects on new projects for which such facilities are not available as a result in some recent tenders the foreign contractors especially chinese were found to be 30 cheaper than the lowest local tenderer it is reported that already there are 95 chinese companies undertaking work whereas there are only about 70 local construction companies in cida grades c 2 and above if no corrective action is taken to support the local construction industry very soon many local construction companies will collapse of the over 2000 construction companies first to collapse will be the small and medium companies who comprise the majority of our construction landscape reportedly chinese construction companies have access to cheaper working capital at approximately libor 2 when needed such facilities are not available to local companies to support the local construction industry which contribute about 10 to the gdp and employ 600 000 direct the following measures are proposed support to local construction companies restrict projects without majority foreign funding exclusively to local construction companies foreign companies could be considered for these projects only after tendering with local companies have failed and with the approval of construction industry development authority cida this could be ensured by a suitable amendment to the construction industry development act no 33 of 2014 allocate 200 million to a special fund to be disbursed through the approved banks to support local construction companies to mitigate adverse impact due to high interest rates at 16 on working capital needed to execute a contract undertaken and also unequal competition by foreign contractors banks are to provide term loans at 8 interest repayable over 8 years the amount given could be limited to 15 of the average annual construction turnover of a company during the last 3 years as per the inland revenue act a foreign construction contractor operating in sri lanka for a single project without a local company registration can pre declare their profits and thereby pay only 20 tax instead of the 28 which the local contractors are liable to pay present status quo is no equal playing field for local construction contractors as such this 20 rate should be increased to 28 foreign consultants contractors to form jvs with local consultants contractors we can have no objection to the foreign consultants and foreign contractors undertaking projects with majority foreign funding if it is a foreign loan funded project through erd then competitive bids should be called from eligible foreign consultants and contractors rather than awarding on a single bid proposal in all instances foreign consultancy and construction companies shall be compulsorily required to form jvs with local counterparts sharing at least 40 of the project scope this is one of the objectives of the national policy on construction adopted by this government to ensure better compliance to local regulations and standards and also to facilitate technology transfer such requirements are prevalent in many developing countries to protect and develop the local companies equal treatment to local steel manufacturers another proposal is that all steel manufacturers should be given the same concessions when importing steel billets for the production of reinforcing and structural steel at present an exemption on port and air port development levy pal which is charged at 7 5 is allowed for the import of steel billets to only one manufacturer as proposed above if pal is withdrawn on the import of all construction materials then this anomaly will be automatically removed now there is no customs duty on import of steel billets by all manufacturers if concessions are to be given to any manufacturer because of the magnitude of investment then it should be as a concession on corporate tax and not on the taxes charged on import of raw materials liberalising cement industry by removing mrp the government has imposed a maximum retail price mrp on cement which is hindering further investment on cement manufacturing this has also led to much corruption this is at much variance to the other major construction material reinforcing steel on which there is no price control presently there is sufficient competition on cement supply with two cement manufacturers five bulk cement importers and 40 bag cement importers with this level of competition there is no justification to impose a mrp on cement when there is no mrp on reinforcing steel removal of the mrp will encourage more investment on cement manufacturing and thus even more competition removing restrictions on bitumen imports a few years back the import of bitumen was a monopoly of ceylon petroleum corporation but since 2016 several private suppliers were allowed to import in addition to cpc and ioc as a result the quantity of bitumen imported by cpc has dropped to 1 2 in 2018 but the present practice is for the ministry of petroleum resources development to issue letters of recommendation to import bitumen this has caused many delays and could be a source of corruption bitumen being a non hazardous material should be allowed to be imported according to market demand subject only to quality control this will allow a timely supply of bitumen for road development work threat to local roofing products manufacturers by the 2014 budget the import of roof and ceiling sheets on a duty free basis under the india sri lanka free trade agreement isfta had been gazetted relevant hs codes are 6811 81 and 6811 82 this is against the policy of the government to provide protection to local manufacturers we have to be very careful when importing roof ceiling and partition boards due to the substandard quality and potential fire risk even in the grenfell tower fire disaster in london which killed 71 persons the main cause was the partition boards which were supposed to be inflammable as such these materials should be quality controlled and should not be imported free under ftas there should be a reasonable duty imposed income tax charged on trade chambers and professional institutes the trade chambers and professional institutes which are formed by acts of parliament or as companies by guarantee where no profits or dividends are distributed among the members shareholders play a very important role to nurture domestic industry and uplift professional services without any financial support from the government these chambers and professional institutes have managed to raise funds in an exemplary manner to extend their services in spite of many difficulties some of them were exempted from income tax payments up to 2017 but now all of them are subject to 28 income tax this will adversely impact their services as such it is proposed that the trade chambers which are either formed by acts of parliament or as companies by guarantee with no profits distributed among shareholders members be either exempted from income tax or only subject to 14 concessionary tax rate similarly even the professional institutes who have become members of any one of the above chambers or formed by acts of parliament should be allowed the above concession as a policy professional institutes should be encouraged to be part of the relevant trade chamber so that they could function in unison with the industry the writer is a former secretary ministry of housing and construction and foreign employment promotion and welfare and currently secretary general ceo of chamber of construction industry sri lanka promoting export of construction services export of construction services played a major role in the development strategy of south korea in the 1980s as sri lanka has many well developed construction companies with suitable incentives export of construction services can be promoted as a major source of foreign exchange earnings already there are a few companies who have ventured out amidst many difficulties the following are proposed to encourage export of construction services bank facilities in countries where work is undertaken to get an award for a construction contract it is necessary to get bank guarantees from a bank registered in that country as our companies are not known to these banks this is possible only by our banks facilitating guarantees through a bank in the country concerned on a back to back basis this is the practice adopted even by the foreign contractors when undertaking work here consequently it is proposed that the government should make arrangements through the central bank for our banks to issue back to back bank guarantees to our construction companies to undertake work in saarc countries gcc countries and countries such as kenya uganda tanzania zambia rwanda tonga benin ghana ivory coast ethiopia madagascar seychelles mauritius australia fiji malaysia and indonesia through correspondent banks in these countries when tendering it is necessary to have the guarantees within a short period of about two weeks and as such it is essential to have standing arrangements made beforehand facilitating easy travel abroad for key company executives to attend meetings when undertaking construction services abroad it is necessary for key executives of companies to travel to destinations such as bangkok hong kong kuala lumpur and manila to attend business and progress meetings at short notice but now visas to these destinations take over 2 weeks in addition to explore work possibilities it is necessary to travel to many countries where economies are expanding our company executives face many difficulties when obtaining visas to travel for business purposes to several of these countries company executives from china singapore india malaysia japan and korea have no such difficulties as such the following measures are proposed issue tpns by the foreign ministry to embassies based in colombo for business travel of senior construction and consultancy company executives when recommended by the chamber of construction industry sri lanka such tpns to be issued within 2 days for directors of major construction and consultancy companies who undertake work abroad issue an official passport with an endorsement such as commercially important person cip this will facilitate obtaining visas without much delay as well as easy passage through airports at our airport have separate immigration channels for business first class travellers and foreign passport holders with only one common channel as there is now there is a long queue export of construction services to be formally considered as an export even though several companies have undertaken overseas contracts for consultancy and construction this is yet to be considered formally as an export qualifying for concessions given to other exporters this should be corrected immediately in addition since 2017 earnings from the export of construction services is taxed whereas these earnings were exempted from tax before for companies with export income on construction services over 80 the tax rate is 14 and for other companies it is 28 but only one company is engaged totally on construction work overseas thus qualifying for 14 this is discouraging our construction and consultancy companies to venture overseas as such it is proposed to exempt from tax earnings from overseas operations of these companies as before establishment of building information modelling centre the contribution of the construction industry to gdp is about 9 during the last year this is expected to reach 15 within the next 2 years if the expected fdis become reality increasing productivity timely completion and avoidance of disputes in the construction industry are essential pre requisites for a healthy economic growth building information modelling bim is a new system widely practiced in developed countries to achieve the above objectives the usa commenced using this system from 2003 and now more than 70 of construction and consultancy companies use bim in uk use of bim is mandatory norway denmark finland sweden and germany are european countries heavily using bim in singapore bim is mandatory for project approval hong kong and malaysia are two other asian countries where bim is widely used however in sri lanka most architects engineers and quantity surveyors still do not use this system this is partly due to the very high cost of bim software and partly due to the fact that most of our architects engineers and quantity surveyors are not trained in this system even our universities do not provide training on the bim system already for all building projects in colombo port city the use of bim has been made compulsory this will be the trend with all new buildings with fdis as such there is an urgent need to establish a bim centre to provide training to industry professionals as well as to make its facilities available to be used by the consultancy and construction companies on a reasonable payment scheme the government should seriously consider establishing a bim centre with a minimum of 25 workstations by extending a financial grant of rs 150 million establishment of this bim centre will make our construction industry more competitive by reducing costs and will be a step forward to the future setting up real estate investment trusts reits under the colombo stock exchange globally real estate investment trusts reits have become an integral part of the investment portfolio accepted by individual and institutional investors providing greater access to real estate projects sri lanka can also benefit significantly by the introduction of the same it can provide a platform for much needed fdi without transferring the ownership of real estate assets to the foreign investor asian reits market is now valued at approximately 180 billion singapore hong kong taiwan japan south korea malaysia and thailand are the market leaders now even indonesia philippines pakistan and india have introduced reits necessary legislation should be enacted to introduce reits in sri lanka soon which was a previously announced budget proposal the writer is a former secretary ministry of housing and construction and foreign employment promotion and welfare and currently secretary general

annual production per share growth of approximately 13 and fourth quarter 2019 production per share growth of almost 25 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 significant low cost reserves growth in 2018 nuvista is pleased to report its 2018 year end independent evaluation of our reserves by glj petroleum consultants ltd glj the glj report nuvista continued its track record of delivering high quality reserve results including a record increase in both our proved developed producing pdp and total proved plus probable tp pa reserves at favorable cost the following results illustrate our high quality montney resource base and the continued advancement of the inventory to underpin our profitable growth to our 110 000 boe d target and beyond delivered a record increase in pdp and tp pa reserves of 55 each to 84 mmboe and 538 mmboe respectively as compared to the prior year this growth was driven by nuvista drilling activity positive technical revisions due to well performance and recovery assumptions and reserves acquired in the acquisition of the pipestone north assets the pipestone acquisition this represents an increase of 20 per share as compared to the prior year increased the respective value net present value before tax discounted at 10 npvbt10 of our pdp and tp pa reserves materially year over year from 530 million and 1 782 million to a record high of 879 million and 3 430 million this growth includes the reserves acquired in the pipestone acquisition and it represents 28 and 49 growth on a per share basis respectively increased tp pa undeveloped locations by 35 to 367 this reflects 9 years of booked inventory at the planned development pace best estimate contingent resource locations increased by 40 to 798 achieved robust recycle ratios of 1 4x and 3 3x for pdp and tp pa reserves respectively based on our 2018 operating netback of 21 23 boe these were driven by pdp and tp pa finding and development f d costs of 14 90 boe and 6 43 boe respectively the three year average pdp f d cost was 12 40 boe and the tp pa finding development and acquisition fd a cost was 8 22 boe achieved a reserves replacement ratio of 300 and 1 400 on a pdp and tp pa basis respectively resulting in a tp pa reserves life index rli of over 30 years and booked reserves and undeveloped locations in portions of each of the four developable montney horizons in pipestone which is a positive leading indicator ahead of the results from our first four layer cube at pipestone later in 2019 the detailed summary of our year end 2018 reserves disclosure is included further below and will be included in our annual information form which will be filed on or before march 29 2019 at www sedar com a strong year in review the year 2018 was very active and successful for nuvista with record adjusted funds flow record production and material reserves per share growth these milestones were reached while advancing significantly on our long term growth plan of 110 000 boe d and beyond our 2019 outlook provides for strong production per share growth while spending sustainably within adjusted funds flow in the current commodity price environment we have continued to drive capital and operating costs downwards the company s balance sheet is strong and the strategic diversification of our gas markets outside of alberta continued to be advanced materially to protect future cash flow from operating activities nuvista completed the strategic pipestone acquisition in september of 2018 which included 9 600 boe d of production plus many years of future drilling locations providing long term line of sight for continued high condensate production growth adjacent to our pre existing pipestone south property nuvista has a material position in the condensate rich greater wapiti montney play which with prudent management has delivered solid financial returns to shareholders over the past several years and remains resilient to low natural gas prices our strategy is to maintain a strong balance sheet to allow the flexibility to accelerate spending when returns are strong when there is near term commodity price weakness we can choose to moderate our pace to spend the minimum required while adhering to our long term growth objectives we also ensure strong alignment of every employee with our shareholders through our compensation structure which is linked to key financial metrics and shareholder returns excellence in operations continues we have spud another four well pad in the northeast area of bilbo as part of an additional 7 wells to be drilled in bilbo in 2019 these will contribute to fourth quarter 2019 and 2020 production at elmworth we have concluded the drilling of a three and a two well pad both pads will be fractured with higher intensity fracture stimulation hifi and brought on stream in the second quarter and should keep the elmworth infrastructure at or near capacity until 2020 at gold creek we are commencing the drilling of the next four well pad the semcams wapiti plant construction has concluded on budget and has successfully started up early in the first quarter of 2019 several months ahead of schedule as planned our gold creek production has now been switched out of our elmworth compressor station into the new semcams wapiti plant our newly acquired pipestone north property continues to outperform expectations with production ranging from 9 500 to 10 000 boe d without decline as we continue to bring on legacy montney wells which had been shut in temporarily in mid 2018 by the previous operator to make facility space available for the most recent well pad we have reached two exciting milestones as we have spud our first pad in pipestone south and we have commenced construction of our pipestone south compressor station the pad will be the largest drilled by nuvista to date with eight wells spanning all four of the montney zones from the lower montney up to the middle montney b c and d zones the compressor facility construction is proceeding on schedule and on budget with startup expected in the fourth quarter of 2019 keeping the balance sheet strong nuvista exited 2018 with approximately 57 drawn on the company s 450 million credit facility net debt including senior unsecured notes and working capital deficiency was 511 million and net debt to 2018 adjusted funds flow was 1 9 times the senior unsecured notes were included in net debt and were issued in 2018 with an aggregate principal of 220 million and a five year term at a 6 5 coupon this provides financial flexibility and certainty with a competitive fixed coupon and 5 year term significant commodity price diversification and risk management after a year of strong oil prices the fourth quarter of 2018 saw significant wti price volatility as well as a widening differential for heavy oil light oil and condensate condensate is an imported product and therefore is not reliant upon export pipelines to get to market as a result condensate was not adversely affected to the same degree as oil although the condensate differential suffered the least of the three products it was temporarily impacted averaging a discount from the wti price of us 13 53 bbl for the quarter as opposed to the typical average of 3 to 5 bbl premium or discount to wti with the alberta government oil production curtailments we have seen an immediate improvement in all liquids differentials crude by rail is anticipated to increase and the enbridge line 3 pipeline replacement project is anticipated to be in service by mid 2020 which should provide continued relief for oil differentials since condensate is imported and required by the alberta oil sands suppliers for diluent purposes no curtailments to condensate production were mandated while some volatility may persist the condensate differential to wti has now recovered to nearly normal levels currently averaging us 2 00 to us 3 00 bbl discount western canada experienced relatively warm weather during the fourth quarter which impacted local gas demand and aeco gas prices which averaged c 1 80 gj during the period export markets fared much better with cold weather in eastern canada and the us midwest driving strong export prices and strong nymex which averaged us 3 64 mmbtu for the quarter due to our significant market diversification nuvista had minimal exposure to aeco spot prices in the fourth quarter as evidenced in our average realized selling price of 3 69 mcf cold weather descended upon western canada in the first quarter of 2019 causing aeco prices to increase significantly nuvista continues to benefit from the discipline of our strong rolling hedge program during this period of volatile commodity prices we currently possess hedges which in aggregate cover 61 of projected 2019 liquids production at a wti floor price of c 79 58 bbl and 52 of projected 2019 gas production at a price of c 2 02 gj hedged and exported volumes converted to an aeco equivalent price these percentage figures relate to production net of royalty volumes due to our fixed price hedges basis differential hedges and our export pipeline volumes nuvista is in the enviable position of having only 18 of our projected natural gas volumes exposed to spot aeco prices in 2019 representing a very small proportion of adjusted funds flow 2019 guidance re affirmed strong growth and spending within adjusted funds flow we are pleased to note that our 2019 capital and production budget forecasts annual production per share growth of approximately 13 and fourth quarter 2019 production per share growth of almost 25 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 our production guidance for 2019 is unchanged with a range of 51 000 to 54 000 boe d first quarter 2019 production guidance is also unchanged with a range of 43 000 to 46 000 boe d the remaining quarters of 2019 are all expected to be well above 50 000 boe d and more specific quarterly guidance will be provided as the year unfolds we intend to keep net debt levels relatively flat with capital spending at or near adjusted funds flow at 2019 price expectations of approximately us 55 00 bbl wti oil us 2 85 mmbtu nymex natural gas c 1 30 gj aeco natural gas condensate wti differential of us 1 00 bbl and cad usd exchange rate of 1 33 as such we have set our capital spending for 2019 to a planned range of 300 325 million with flexibility to reduce capital further if pricing unexpectedly falls while still preserving a healthy growth plan for 2020 if prices remain stable or improve nuvista has top quality assets and a management team focused upon relentless improvement we are excited to continue pursuing our montney growth plan to 110 000 boe d and beyond and we will adjust the annual pace of growth as needed to ensure balance sheet strength comes first and that the profitability of that growth is always maximized we would like to thank our

pound sterling exchange rates backed off recent highs after weaker uk construction pmi fell into contraction territory uk services this morning one to watch but the currency remains sensitive to ongoing brexit negotiations say analysts at lloyds the pound to euro exchange rate is 0 12 higher 1 16388 today the pound to us dollar exchange rate is 0 02 higher 1 31812 today overnight after a frightening day of volatility which saw the dow jones down more than 350 points at its low before recovering markets had a risk off tone into the asian open the nikkei 225 was buoyed by a stronger note into the close of the north american session on monday still down around 0 3 initially crude oil was also weaker the japanese yen jpy one of the premier haven currencies continued to retrace its gains against the dollar usd as usd jpy climbed back towards the 112 handle advertisement the day ahead there are a few high risk events today of these events the first is the uk services pmi financial services are obviously one of the most critical pieces of the modern british economy and hence of the three pmis that are released it is usually the one that has the biggest impact on the value of the british pound given the fears about an exodus post brexit this particular report continues to be important speaking of gbp it was the worst performing currency of the day the decline started shortly after the uk construction pmi came out it fell below 50 for the first time since march taken together with the fall in the uk manufacturing pmi that s not a good sign today s uk service sector pmi is also expected to fall below the 50 boom or bust line as the uk appears to be entering recession gdp in december was down 0 4 mom we ll be interested to hear what bank of england gov carney has to say about the outlook in his testimony today before the house of lord s economic affairs committee i doubt if it will be good gbp negative analyst preview lloyds bank today s services pmi survey for february is the main uk data focus this week last month it fell to 50 1 just a whisker above the 50 level which separates expansion and contraction the omens from the lloyds business barometer for february released last week appear not to be too positive our survey showed business confidence falling to the lowest level since mid 2016 in the aftermath of the referendum nevertheless while a weaker number cannot be ruled out we are mindful that the services pmi had already fallen quite significantly in recent months our central forecast is for a slight rise to 50 5 still a soft signal for overall activity compared with the consensus forecast for 49 9 in the us home sales and non manufacturing are the big events to look out for analyst preview marshall gittler acls global the main us indicator out today is the institute of supply management ism non manufacturing pmi given the large size of the us service sector economy this is a very important indicator of the health of the us economy in particular the employment index no forecast available is one of the best indicators of the job outlook since most us jobs are in the service sector the ism non manufacturing pmi is expected to rise in line with the similar markit index that should be positive for the dollar later in the day governor carney will speak and while a high risk event it seems unlikely he will say anything too dramatic analyst preview lloyds bank bank of england governor carney is scheduled to testify to the house of lords economic affairs committee from 15 35gmt separately uk attorney general cox and brexit secretary barclay travel to brussels today to seek a revised deal to prevent a permanent irish border backstop a sticking point for many conservative mps a vote on a

gbp boe gov carney speaks foreign exchange markets with plenty of debate about the prospects for brexit there is a good deal of uncertainty over what might transpire in parliament over the next week analysts at ing released a report on the outlook for brexit and the gbp on monday noting that they believe an extension of article 50 is still the most likely move when may s deal is kicked out at last next week despite news over the weekend that some members of the european research group are willing to back prime minister theresa may s deal if three tests are met we still see it as more likely that the pm s deal won t get passed in parliament next week and that article 50 will need to be extended to allow for further negotiations the pound to dollar exchange rate gbp usd is struggling after its recent rally to 1 33 now back below 1 32 cable is facing pressure as investors position more carefully ahead of a turbulent week of politics ing look for today s pmi to pressure sterling as for the pound the rising odds of may s deal succeeding are helping although we still think the probability is below 50 but the likely soft uk services pmis should limit the near term upside risk off conditions in markets have proven to be a big problem for the more risk sensitive british pound major swings in stock indices are bad news in particular as many believe as economic growth slows in europe and the uk the eu will be stingier with the economic concessions they make to uk negotiators it s worth keeping an eye on labour s brexit proposals as they may hold a significant tail risk if may takes them onboard latest exchange rates 05 03 2019

michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thanks les good morning and thank you for joining us today i will begin today s call with a review of our operating highlights and some market commentary and then lynn will cover our financial results in more detail we will then open the line for your questions now turning to slide 3 we were pleased to deliver a solid third quarter highlighted by record net sales and adjusted ebitda for both our reported and base business results our organic sales increase of 6 6 reflects strength and balance in both our product offering and the markets that we serve we did face some challenges on the sales front however including lost shipping days associated with some abnormally wet and extremely cold weather conditions in the quarter and further softening in the canadian single family residential construction market organic revenue growth was broad based across each of our product lines with 3 9 growth in wallboard sales 10 6 growth in ceilings and 13 1 growth in steel framing other product net sales were also up 4 5 organically on the profitability front we generated a 41 5 year over year increase in adjusted ebitda to a record 59 7 million for the third fiscal quarter the increase reflect the contributions from titan increased operating leverage including benefits from the cost savings initiatives undertaken earlier this fiscal year continued pricing improvement and favorable lease accounting let me touch on a few of these areas next in the third quarter there were some further softening in the canadian single family residential market which resulted in sales of our canadian business declining low single digits on a constant currency basis with further impact from about a 5 depreciation in the canadian dollar year over year nonetheless titan continues to be very accretive to our consolidated operating results our long term strategic rationale for the acquisition of titan including increased scale and footprint in north america geographic expansion into the highly attractive and fragmented canadian market and creation of a well balanced platform for growth remains very compelling the integration continues to progress well as we have continued to work closely with our key suppliers to generate purchasing synergies and take advantage of our scale and the power of our north american platform with the commencement of our annual purchasing programs in january 19 we began to realize our purchasing synergies at the run rate associated with our previously announced 10 million target for purchasing synergies and we continue to expect to exceed our original 10 million estimate for fiscal 20 and we continue to look for even more synergies with our cross border suppliers and through other non purchasing initiatives we have also continued to make progress on our previously announced strategic cost reduction initiatives in the us as demonstrated to the 130 basis points of operating leverage achieved during the fiscal third quarter which excludes the impact of the change in lease accounting as expected we achieved full run rate savings as of january 19 and are on track to realize the full 20 million annual benefit of these initiatives in fiscal 20 we generated strong free cash flow of 55 6 million during the quarter which enabled us to reduce our net debt by 32 8 million and repurchase 11 5 million of our common stock under the repurchase authorization announced last quarter we also opened a greenfield location just outside akron ohio and this morning announced the acquisition of commercial builders group llc subsequent to the end of the quarter this tuck in acquisition operates two facilities in the greater new orleans and baton rouge louisiana markets adding coverage of two important top 100 metro areas in the us as evidenced by all of these actions we are executing on our stated and balanced capital allocation strategies of debt reduction disciplined growth through acquisitions and greenfields and opportunistic share repurchases i d now like to spend a few moments explaining our current view of the end markets that we serve now as a reminder we estimate that approximately 55 of our consolidated revenues are to the commercial construction markets and approximately 45 is related to residential construction with just less than half of that 45 related to new single family residential construction since the latter part of calendar 2018 there has been a great deal of speculation with respect to the current macroeconomic outlook and the potential impact on residential and commercial construction from our perspective we remain encouraged by what we re seeing across our business and in the broader economy as it relates to residential construction while it s still early in the traditional spring selling season we believe the late 18 slowdown in new single family residential construction was related to a confluence of factors including a rise in interest rates home price appreciation and resulting affordability issues and geopolitical uncertainty like others while we expect that this market may take a pause we do not currently believe they will be prolonged or particularly deep jobs and income growth remained at very healthy levels and many of the major markets in the us continue to have limited housing supply as building remains below historical averages all of which bodes very well for the mid to long term outlook on the commercial front which represents the majority of our business most indicators and estimates point to continued growth against the backdrop of an economy that remains healthy we are seeing that in our own business with strong backlogs and quote activity in my recent visits to many of our locations in multiple geographies i ve heard from our own people and peak ph commercial customers that pipelines are strong extending through calendar 2019 and in some cases even in calendar 2020 while it s impossible to predict what levels of growth are ultimately realized near term in the markets we serve we remain focused on controlling what we can we believe our market leading position in the distribution of interior building products our balanced product portfolio and our diversified exposure across commercial and residential new and r r construction markets which we believe continue to exhibit healthy long term fundamentals will enable us to continue to take advantage of growth opportunities across our business both now and in the future looking to the balance of fiscal 2019 and beyond we remain committed to growing our business both organically and through selective acquisitions with an emphasis on profitability and free cash flow generation with which reducing debt remains a priority now with that i will turn it over to lynn for a more detailed review of the financial results lynn lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller thanks mike and i would also like to thank you all for joining us on the call today we were pleased to deliver a solid third quarter highlighted by record net sales and adjusted ebitda performance and strong free cash flow generation looking at slide 4 we grew net sales 23 6 to 723 9 million and increased our base business sales during the quarter by 6 6 compared to the third quarter of last fiscal year our wallboard net sales increased 16 to 297 million in the third quarter compared to the same period last year it was driven by acquisitions and pricing the 3 9 growth on an organic basis was comprised of a strong pricing gains of approximately 4 and flat volume the latter of which was due in large part to the lost shipping days in the us and lower sales in canada our third quarter ceiling sales increased by 16 4 year over year to 105 million as a result of pricing improvement higher organic volumes resulting from increased commercial business and the positive benefit of acquisitions the 10 6 organic increase was comprised of price increases of approximately 7 as well as higher volumes of approximately 3 our steel framing sales increased during the quarter by 21 4 year over year to 117 4 million this was driven by strong pricing gains acquisitions and higher organic volumes from greater commercial business the 13 1 organic increase included price gains of approximately 10 and an uptick in volume of approximately 3 our sales of other products which consist of installation joint compound tools inaudible and other complementary products totaled almost 204 million and were up 43 6 compared to the third quarter of last year the recent acquisition of titan have expanded the breadth of our product offerings while at the same time our 4 5 increase in our base business sales of other products reinforces the success of our efforts to continue to grow this other product category our gross profit increased almost 20 to 234 2 million on higher sales including the positive impact from acquisitions our gross margin of 32 4 declined from 33 4 a year ago primarily due to increased product costs as well as changes in product mix also last quarter s third quarter gross margin was a tough comparison being the highest gross margin level of any quarter last fiscal year and positively impacted by a higher level of supplier incentives associated with a larger level of wallboard pre buy rising product costs over the past year included two wallboard increases multiple steel and ceiling grid increases as well as various freight surcharges on a sequential basis gross margin improved 20 basis points from the second quarter and slightly exceeded the 32 2 guidance we indicated in last quarter s call which we continue to believe is a reasonable benchmark for the remainder of this fiscal year related technical difficulty to our ph wallboard increase we believe price cost dynamics turning to slide 5 we reduced our adjusted sg a as a percentage of net sales by 210 ph basis points year over year to 24 2 in the quarter a 130 basis points of the reduction was the result of increased cost efficiencies primarily due to the cost reduction initiatives taken during this fiscal year as well as contributions from the titan acquisition these were partially offset by continuing inflationary pressures primarily in logistics costs as well as higher costs operating with the weather disruptions mike referenced earlier the remaining 80 basis points of the reduction was driven by changes to lease accounting as we ve discussed we ve made significant progress on these reduction initiatives and we continue to find many opportunities to further streamline our business as a result we would expect fourth quarter adjusted sg a as a percentage of sales to decrease year over year at least by the level we experienced in the third quarter we delivered 59 7 million in adjusted ebitda in the third quarter this was up 41 5 year over year from 42 2 million in the prior year quarter adjusted ebitda margin was 8 2 as a percentage of sales or 7 4 if you exclude the impact of our lease accounting which was up 20 basis points from 7 2 a year ago turning to slide 6 during the third fiscal quarter we generated over 55 million of free cash flow this enabled us to reduce our net debt by 33 million as well as repurchase 11 5 million of our common shares as of january 31 our net debt to ltm pro forma adjusted ebitda was 3 8 times this was consistent with the level as of the end of q2 we intend to continue to de lever through strong free cash flow generation and as a reminder our current leverage ratio post titan compares favorably to 2014 when our ratio was six times as well as just prior to our may 2016 ipo when it was 4 3 times additionally of our total long term debt approximately just over 75 is not due until 2025 also in order to hedge against potential future interest rate volatility in february we entered into an interest rate swap agreement this agreement effectively provides a fixed rate on 0 5 billion of our first lien term debt our balance sheet remains healthy with 74 3 million cash on hand and 220 million available under our abl facilities this results in substantial liquidity for the business now let me turn the call back over to mike before we open the line for questions michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thanks lynn just a few additional comments before we open the line for questions we are pleased with our third quarter performance and believe that as the market leading distributor of interior building products with significant scale advantages combined with local expertise we are poised for continued growth our third quarter results provided further evidence of this with sales and adjusted ebitda growth of over 23 and 41 respectively we continue to take advantage of our multiple levers to drive this growth through organic growth greenfields m a and operating leverage we believe our large diverse end markets continue to exhibit healthy fundamentals providing us with significant growth opportunities across our business both now and in the future and then finally and probably most importantly our great network of dedicated gms employees in both the us and canada continue to embrace our strong entrepreneurial culture to deliver the outstanding service to our customers that we believe will deliver profitable growth over time to our shareholders and with that operator we re now ready to open the line up for questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from the line of michael wood with nomura instinet please proceed with your question ryan nomura instinet analyst hey guys this is ryan calling on for mike did logistics surprise you was this sudden and can you just explain how logistics hurt sg a whether this is freight rates or inefficiencies michael callahan president chief executive officer and director well i think the short answer to that is as i mentioned there was definitely some impacts weather related and the reality is that when you re when you re dealing with production challenges just in terms of getting loads out your logistics and efficiency in terms of labor utilization is impacted so i would say that really was a key factor in how logistics impacted us in the quarter ryan nomura instinet analyst okay thank you and then just one follow up how did flat organic wallboard volumes compare to industry sell through in your view lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller yeah thanks for the question in terms of how we compare it to the industry the gypsum association data our read on that data is that we believe that we maintained share we believe that most of the both year to date decline and quarter over quarter decline in the gypsum association was due to the impact of pre buy so looking at that we believe our flat volumes indicate that we are on par with our market share ryan nomura instinet analyst thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of david manthey with baird please proceed with your question david manthey robert w baird co analyst thank you good morning michael callahan president chief executive officer and director hi dave david manthey robert w baird co analyst hey good morning first off you mentioned that your gross margin percentage was lower due partly to higher product costs but clearly your realized selling prices were higher also i guess this implies the price cost relationship is negative could you talk a little bit about that relationship and why you think that happened lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller yeah sure thanks for the question related to the year over year decline in gross margin this was due to like we said some changes in product cost and mix in addition the prior year comp was really impacted by a higher level of volume incentives that we realized in the third quarter of prior year due to the december 2017 pre buy david manthey robert w baird co analyst okay thank you and then second what is your outlook for price in the coming 12 months to 18 months i guess we should assume a little bit less leverage on sg a if your pricing moderates down is that your assumption michael callahan president chief executive officer and director no that s not our assumption at this point i mean as you know dave price in terms of wallboard the price increases literally rolling out as we speak and then it took effect in the first part of march so there have been announced increases as always it takes a period of time for to settle out but our assumption right now is to continue to look through the pending increase of the existing increase and see how it settles in we re not baking in a lower price environment for the year david manthey robert w baird co analyst i just meant more moderate price increases than last year in steel for example michael callahan president chief executive officer and director oh i m sorry i would say yeah probably would say generally speaking i think if you look at steel prices they certainly have moderated kind of flattened out but i think that s a safe assumption yeah the only caveat to that might be insulation i think insulation is still on the bubble as it relates to the inflation david manthey robert w baird co analyst great all right thanks mike michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thanks david operator thank you our next question comes from the line of trey grooms with stephens inc please proceed with your question trey grooms stephens inc analyst hey good morning michael callahan president chief executive officer and director good morning trey trey grooms stephens inc analyst just real quick i guess kind of following up with the last question is the looking out on pricing you mentioned maybe a little bit more moderate price increases were you talking specifically just for clarity around wallboard pricing or and i know you mentioned steel but wallboard pricing or ceilings any is it both or one or the other that you re referring to just for clarity michael callahan president chief executive officer and director i would say that in terms of the pricing going forward wallboard certainly the increase as i said is in the process of rolling out as we speak i think in terms of ceilings as we ve often said ceilings generally tends to price up one to two increases a year it s a 3 to 5 increase generally speaking on ceilings insulation there still seems to be pressure on pricing as far as that goes so i would anticipate maybe be some inflation there and but steel has definitely settled down a bit and i don t see any near term price increases there trey grooms stephens inc analyst all right well thanks for that just hearing that you are expecting more moderate i just was making sure we were fully understanding that comment okay and then secondly is the canadian market is clearly weakened was down this most recent quarter for you guys what are you hearing from your customers there and their outlook for the building season in that market as we re kind of at least starting to come into view with the building season here in canada michael callahan president chief executive officer and director well there is a general backdrop clearly just in this period of time tends to be a seasonal slowdown for canada anyway just based on the snow and cold conditions i would say the outlook right now on the single family side there definitely has been some downward pressure single family detached so the stand alone homes definitely have seen and a lot of that frankly has to do with the mortgage programs they have in place and the stress test that the canadian government essentially has imposed on mortgages so that s definitely had an impact but i would say that the when you look at the commercial high rise and commercial development as well as the commercial multi family and this pretty much goes across the board the market outlook is still very positive so i would say as far as canada is concerned it s pretty well not completely isolated but for the most part it s that single family detached business which is under pressure right now but our view is still positive i mean i think the market overall is sound and the outlook is generally pretty optimistic trey grooms stephens inc analyst okay thank you and last one from me is just on with the increases that are out there especially on wallboard are you guys seeing or are you guys participating in any pre buy of any size at this point lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller no we ve had limited pre buy this season trey grooms stephens inc analyst all right that s it for me i ll pass it on thanks a lot michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thanks trey operator thank you our next question comes from the line of keith hughes with suntrust robinson humphrey please proceed with your question keith hughes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst thank you the ebitda margins were up 20 basis points year over year excluding the change in the leases i assume were your organic margins down given the titan usually mixes you up and if so kind of how much lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller yeah thanks for the question keith we don t break it down by the geographies keith hughes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst okay let me ask you this way on titan you talked about sales being weak if you kind of comment i know you didn t own it last year but just roughly how did their margins look compared to last year given the weak environment lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller yeah keith they were lower and their sg a as a percentage of sales was also impacted by the same weather conditions that we discussed and one thing on a constant currency basis sales were down 2 the canadian dollar did decline about 5 and that resulted in about a little bit less than 1 million impact on their adjusted ebitda keith hughes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst and just one small question on this come up in the fourth quarter the interest expense we saw in the third is that roughly a tax rate is that roughly what we ll see in the fourth quarter leslie h kratcoski vice president of investor relations yes that s a good way to think about the fourth quarter in terms of interest and taxes keith hughes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst okay great thank you michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thanks keith operator thank you our next question comes from the line of matt bouley with barclays please proceed with your question matthew adrien bouley barclays bank plc analyst hi thank you for taking my questions mike are you able to kind of quantify the impact of lost shipping days in the quarter and then maybe provide any comments around what you ve seen i guess in february thus far thanks michael callahan president chief executive officer and director yeah thanks matt you know it s really tough to quantify the bulk of the impact in terms of weather tends to gravitate toward single family and if you look at our numbers overall our mix you re probably looking 22 23 of our business overall is new revenue if you break it down on that basis so when you think about that given the just the magnitude of the impact that had on the single family piece and it is we lost numerous shipping days it s not just the fact that it rains for three or four consecutive days but it s also that you ve got to get the job sites themselves to dry out so while i can t really quantify that i think anybody that s been looking at the news and seeing it from texas all the way to dc that we ve all had to deal with pretty adverse conditions now we ll say that the november december we re under a lot of pressure january we saw a significant pick up in momentum and activity which carried over into february so i would say that the momentum activity in january plus frankly we were delivering on saturdays trying to catch up which also leads to some sg a pressure frankly in terms of overtime and things such as that so if you pick all that together so we re trying to catch up as best we can but fundamentally i think the january february momentum levels give us cause for optimism going into the fourth quarter leslie h kratcoski vice president of investor relations yeah i would note also that our february per day sales is up versus prior year on an organic basis michael callahan president chief executive officer and director that s a good point matthew adrien bouley barclays bank plc analyst okay appreciate that detail excuse me and then secondly just following up on the titan business in canada obviously you called out the challenges on the single family side and that the data seems to be a bit better on the multi family side could you remind us of titan s multi family versus single family exposure and then just maybe put some finer points around what you re seeing on the multifamily side specifically because i do think that the data has been a bit stronger there thank you michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thanks leslie h kratcoski vice president of investor relations yeah there are 40 commercial construction and then 60 resi on the resi side about 40 new and then in that 40 of the total in market and 20 r r and we estimate on the commercial side that there s 10 new and 30 r r matthew adrien bouley barclays bank plc analyst okay appreciate the detail thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of michael dahl with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question michael glaser dahl rbc capital markets analyst good morning thanks for taking my questions michael callahan president chief executive officer and director good morning michael michael glaser dahl rbc capital markets analyst mike i wanted to follow up on the pricing comments again actually two parts of it but first on the wallboard side i think you d ph mentioned not really any pre buy right now and you re talking about seeing how the price increases settle out there early on but is there anything to interpret in terms of how you re viewing the market and the likelihood for price in terms of you guys not participating in pre buy michael callahan president chief executive officer and director well first off the circumstances around pre buy this year different because of the increase itself is pushed out so routinely this is a january increase and it got pushed out this year so and then of course based on some of the conditions relative to deliveries and some of the pressure just to build ability to find a place to put the board was limited based on our inventory positions and delivery lag so the general outlook mike is that we are going to be nimble as the price increase is introduced into the marketplace but it s so we re still early on we don t really know a lot of it has to do with just demand levels and traction and take away from the plants and that literally has taken place as we speak now that the manufacturers continue to talk about escalating cost and inflationary pressures and they re reacting to that with their price increases but the market will dictate just exactly how much of this ultimately is going to be realized and depending on when it settles in first there maybe a second phase to the increases as they always leave the door open for that so i can t really handicap it at this point we are going up as we received higher costs from our manufacturers in many cases where we re quoting commercial work we re quoting escalators based on the projected increase and we have yet to see how it s all going to settle out michael glaser dahl rbc capital markets analyst okay that s helpful the second part of the pricing was really back related to steel and comments about not expecting any further increases i guess given the path of steel pricing when you look out over the next few quarters do you think that we could see price declines actually michael callahan president chief executive officer and director that s really that really is hard for me to call based on the current you know just the current uncertainties around steel in general and tariffs and everything else that s going on what i will tell you though is that we have our purchasing group here has a daily dialog on those with the steel producers and we keep very very close to the ground as to what s going on relative to steel pricing and so are we can move quickly too but based on how we turned our inventories i mean our steel inventories cycle very quickly so even if there is a near term price adjustment up or downwards we re able to cycle through that pretty quickly based on our just on how quickly we cycle the steel inventories so it s tough to handicap right now i would say right now we look at it is kind of flattish and where it goes from here really remains to be seen based on demand levels and just consumption michael glaser dahl rbc capital markets analyst got it if i could fit one more in you made a comment about the fourth quarter gross margin i just wanted to understand or clarify that a little were you saying that the 32 4 seen in 3q was still the reasonable assumption for 4q or was that comment related to your prior 32 2 leslie h kratcoski vice president of investor relations yes no our guidance continues to be the 32 2 michael glaser dahl rbc capital markets analyst okay great thank you michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thanks mike operator thank you our next question comes from the line of kevin hocevar with northcoast research please proceed with your question kevin hocevar northcoast research analyst hey good morning everybody michael callahan president chief executive officer and director hey kevin kevin hocevar northcoast research analyst you mentioned that so 3q 18 had a favorable gross margins for the you mentioned incentives ahead of price increases taking effect on the wallboard side it sounds like you re not really pre buying much ahead of this increase and gross margin expectations are from 3q to 4q relatively similar so can we infer from that that you re not seeing the same level of incentives this year as you saw last year ahead of the price increases leslie h kratcoski vice president of investor relations the favorable the favor ability that we saw in our margin last q3 due to the incentives was simply i think timing of the purchases so in terms of whole dollars or percentage the incentives remained fairly constant if not even a little bit more favorable so no i wouldn t infer that kevin hocevar northcoast research analyst okay okay and then so the largest ph wallboard manufacturers is that can be acquired here sometime in early 2019 so curious if you have any thoughts on that in terms of do you expect that to have any impact on that industry or do you think it will be pretty much business as usual after that transfer takes place michael callahan president chief executive officer and director you know in my view having done business a significant business with both sides of that equation so to speak i think it s going to be business as usual i think it s going to be a very strong and formidable company and they certainly have a very impressive array of products from the insulation side all the way through wallboard and ceiling so from our advantage point it s going to be business as usual and we re going to continue to do business with them as a combined entity just as we have separately in the past kevin hocevar northcoast research analyst got you okay thank you very much michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thanks operator thank you our next question comes from the line of matt mccall with seaport global securities please proceed with your question matt mccall seaport global securities analyst thanks good morning everybody michael callahan president chief executive officer and director good morning matt mccall seaport global securities analyst sorry i lost my voice so mike you made some comments bullish comments about the mid to long term specifically on the residential markets i was curious about more the near term view as you said there may be a pause i m just i m wondering about the impact of kind of the start weakness that we saw in 18 and expected impact on your business to start 19 calendar 19 michael callahan president chief executive officer and director well i mean i think it s logical to say that the same thing that we were talking about in terms of weather impacts on our business has impacts on starts too i mean it s tough to clear a land with a bulldozer when it s going to be submerged in six foot of water it had a subdivision in atlanta georgia so i mean i think the reality is our outlook is that if there is slippage we think it s going to be moderate slippage because there s still a shortage of inventory in just about every major market that we serve so and based on our conversations with the large national homebuilders that we do business with throughout our footprint that house counts generally speaking are up and i think the general attitude of the homebuilders is optimistic as well with the custom builders it s just with the rate increases back at 18 carrying it over under the tough winter i think the data is just kind of noisy right now so as we get deeper into the spring selling season i think all of us will have a little bit better clarity on where this market is going to settle out but a pause i think is the best word because i don t consider to be at a kind of a long term slippage i think it s just a matter of making a temporary market adjustment frankly matt mccall seaport global securities analyst okay thanks that s helpful the detail around the synergies and the cost saves that was also helpful can you it sounds like you re optimistic about meeting or exceeding those goals but can you give us an idea of where you were as of q3 for both the synergies and the cost saves and how we should layer those in over the next i guess four five quarters lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller yes are you referring to the the titan synergies or sg a synergies matt mccall seaport global securities analyst both the cost saves and in the synergies as well lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller yes so on the sg a so i would expect that for q4 that our reduction in sg a as a percentage of sales our sg a leverage is somewhere between where it was q2 over q2 and q3 over q3 matt mccall seaport global securities analyst okay and then does that kind of get you i think you had talked about the total for i think you said through 2020 for both synergies and cost saves so i guess when do we hit the full run rate of each of those both from titan and the sg a or the operational synergies lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller so in terms of the full run rate on the titan synergies we just those will both be 2020 yeah those will both be 2020 michael callahan president chief executive officer and director when we have the 10 million the 10 million full run rate synergies with titan which we expect to exceed those will be fully realized in fiscal 20 which is april of 20 and the same thing on the cost efficiencies or the cost savings of 20 ph matt mccall seaport global securities analyst okay all right thank you operator

the most dangerous call on wall street in recent years has been to predict the end of the bull market in bonds which has lasted more than three decades each time u s treasuries look as if they re about to roll over and die they quickly rebound and make even the smartest minds look foolish just consider the last 15 months a period when the benchmark 10 year note yield treasury went from about 2 45 percent to as high as 3 26 percent in october before falling back to around 2 72 percent tuesday now one influential firm says yields will fall further much further the economists and strategists at morgan stanley came out with a bold call tuesday by predicting yields which are used to help set borrowing costs for everything from corporate debt to household mortgages will drop as low as 2 35 percent by the end of the year a level not seen since the end of 2017 based on the latest monthly survey by bloomberg news that makes the firm more bullish than any of the other 23 primary dealers which are allowed to trade with the federal reserve and help the u s government with its debt sales tame inflation and lower economic growth are the main reasons morgan stanley reduced its year end yield forecast from 2 45 percent which compares with the median estimate of 3 percent in february s monthly survey the next one is due out in coming days the point is that morgan stanley is unlikely to be the only firm lowering its yield forecasts with economists working overtime to reduce their economic growth estimates the federal reserve bank of atlanta s gdpnow index which aims to track growth in real time has fallen to a stall speed level of 0 3 percent while a similar gauge from the federal reserve bank of new york is under 1 percent

climate politics after the yellow vests climate politics after the yellow vests far from being anti environment the gilets jaunes have exposed the greenwashing of macron s deeply regressive economic and social agenda it s well and good to tell people who are making 1000 a month to change their car but they can t says elsa a thirty three year old translator photo by colin kinniburgh i first passed the protest camp on christmas eve as the sun was setting and most of the country was preparing to sit down for the holiday dinner so were twenty odd local gilets jaunes this dedicated group of protesters had spent over a month camped out at jeanne rose a large roundabout on the outskirts of the former industrial town of le creusot about four hours drive southeast of paris their ranks had thinned since november 17 when 150 or so protesters first rallied to the jeanne rose roundabout out of some quarter million across the country but those who stuck around had reason to be optimistic already they had won a series of concessions including the suspension of the fuel tax hike that sparked the movement from a government that had spent its first year and a half steamrolling reform after reform past all opposition wearing their signature yellow vests the local gilets jaunes toasted the christmas holiday together with escargot a regional specialty donated by a sympathizer and grilled over the campfire it is this kind of camaraderie that has sustained the protesters through the damp cold of france s winter months and has given the yellow vest movement a much greater staying power than expected in mid january a few weeks after i first visited a series of raids cleared most of the small town protest camps but some groups of gilets jaunes have managed to hang on as of early march a cabin at the edge of the jeanne rose roundabout still welcomes passersby chez manu et brigitte bonfire roaring across the country mass marches and rallies remain a saturday routine with protesters numbering in the tens of thousands every weekend meanwhile police repression of the gilets jaunes has if anything grown fiercer since the movement started hundreds of protesters and bystanders have been gravely injured by flash balls and other police weapons including one who was killed at least seventeen who have lost an eye five who have lost their hands and dozens more who have been permanently disabled the yellow vested protesters have achieved a phenomenal amount of attention impact and support over a relatively short amount of time at the height of their popularity in november and december the gilets jaunes were favored by upwards of 70 percent of those polled the decline in popular support since then to around 50 percent can partly be attributed to troubling instances of violence by a subset of participants not just against property and police but against journalists and each other anti semitic incidents on the margins of the protests though limited in number have drawn national attention to the far right conspiracist creep of segments of the movement the harassment of philosopher alain finkielkraut by gilets jaunes in paris in mid february amid a rash of similar incidents in and around the capital including the defacement of portraits of simone weil with swastikas marked an especially low point the movement s explosive trajectory and lack of clearly defined leadership mean that the gilets jaunes continue to defy easy characterization but their lasting contribution has been a national reckoning over macron s pro business agenda which several previous rounds of strikes and protests failed to provoke a broad swath of people who felt they had no say in politics people who had never been to a protest or been part of a union who had lost trust in elected officials and their parties who felt nothing but contempt from the elites holding power over their lives have experienced the thrill of collective power whatever becomes of the gilets jaunes their uprising has achieved at least one crucial thing it has jolted the idea still stubborn among policy elites that climate change and inequality can somehow be confronted separately it has demanded an urgent reconciliation that is between two of the defining challenges of our time by way of a stern warning the gilets jaunes have dragged the climate debate just one step further away from incremental market based half measures and toward an egalitarian alternative climate politics they remind us must spell equality not austerity or else for years france has positioned itself as a global leader in combating climate change it was in paris of course that 195 countries in 2015 signed a landmark agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and keep global warming below 2 c it was in paris too that emmanuel macron in the first weeks of his presidency vowed to make our planet great again in response to donald trump s announcement that the united states would withdraw from the agreement macron had already raised international hopes by naming a widely respected longtime activist nicolas hulot as environmental minister in july 2017 hulot released a climate plan designed to lead a just transition toward a low carbon economy ending french fossil fuel extraction and reducing unequal access to energy along the way but macron s green halo quickly dimmed even as the climate plan was unveiled his government made clear that it had other priorities it pushed ahead a slew of tax cuts and other market friendly reforms notably to labor law education and the national rail system whose guiding principle was to make france more competitive in keeping with his determination to transform paris into the financial capital of post brexit europe macron scaled back france s financial transactions tax which he had promised to strengthen and abolished the solidarity tax on wealth in french isf for short in the process he surrendered billions of euros of revenue earmarked for social and climate policy and cemented his reputation as president of the rich the repeal of the wealth tax which applied only to france s richest 5 percent has since become a central grievance of the gilets jaunes meanwhile the government s professed ambitions on climate were slipping hulot lamented that carbon emissions were going back up and pleaded for a stronger financial transactions tax his frustration culminated in a bombshell radio interview last august when he announced live without warning that he could no longer lie to himself and would be resigning as minister all of this left macron on thin ice when it came time last fall to defend a fresh round of fuel tax hikes announced for 2019 the specific policy in question is in fact a carbon tax which since 2014 has made up an increasing share of france s notoriously high gas taxes macron accelerated these increases and on january 1 2019 the tax on diesel which powers most french drivers cars especially outside of big cities was set to jump by another 11 percent the government s stated purpose in raising the carbon tax was twofold to encourage people to drive less or better yet switch out their old polluting cars for more efficient ones and to raise revenue for green investment it was also a way of backtracking on a three decades long european push toward diesel cars based on the premise that they polluted less an error whose full implications are finally catching up to the governments responsible not least france s in this respect macron was perfectly open they told us for decades that we had to buy diesel and now it s the opposite he said in early november but he continued if the french public was taking his proposed solution badly it was understandable he simply hadn t explained himself enough on the contrary an increasing share of the public understood the problem all too well their government had made a huge mistake partly under pressure from corporate lobbies and yet again it was trying to weasel its way out by passing the bulk of the costs down not to the auto companies not to the biggest polluters but to the people reduced to counting every cent when they went to fill up the tank in the name of the planet macron was demanding that the working class sacrifice while the rich were getting tax cuts public services were being eroded and green investment was nowhere to be seen for several gilets jaunes i spoke to and many more interviewed by other outlets this was the last straw yves clarisse 54 right worked most of his life in factories for the past eight years he has devoted himself to looking after his father suffering from alzheimer s photo by colin kinniburgh about fifteen minutes drive southeast from the jeanne rose roundabout is the exit for sanvignes les mines population 4 500 where my grandfather lives this is peri urban france neither urban nor entirely rural nor close enough to a big city to constitute a suburb it s the sort of in between zone that now constitutes much of the french landscape long devoid of protest movements such areas have become ground zero for the gilets jaunes and it s no coincidence they re the kind of places that are almost impossible to get around without a car sure enough when i visited the area in late december i was greeted by a clownish puppet of macron and a barrier of stacked tires fencing off the protest camp of the gilets jaunes du magny inside was a firepit and a wooden cabin big enough to hold a dozen people the site wasn t chosen at random the road it overlooks known as the route centre europe atlantique rcea is a major artery for trucks crossing from france s atlantic ports into central europe and the on ramp provides an easy vantage point from which to block it we don t exactly do blockades let s call it filtering says yves clarisse who has been a fixture of the local yellow vest protests since november 17 we tend to slow the trucks down because by doing so even if it s only for a half hour an hour an hour and a half it has an impact on the economy so the government is forced to take notice clarisse fifty four lives in social housing in neighboring montceau les mines population 19 000 and spent most of his career working in factories for the last eight years he has devoted himself to looking after his ninety year old father who suffers from alzheimer s unlike many gilets jaunes who express disdain for all established parties clarisse is an avowed supporter of la france insoumise the left populist formation led by veteran leftist jean luc mélenchon asked why the fuel tax hike had triggered a mass movement when so many other unpopular reforms hadn t he said it was about freedom but for clarisse the kind of freedoms allowed by owning a car could just as well be provided by free public transit if we moved toward free transit it would allow a ton of people to get out of the house whether it s the elderly people living alone people who are out of work and to express themselves more in life he says if anything it is this desire for a greater say in the decisions affecting their everyday lives that has animated the gilets jaunes the demand for a citizens referendum ric for référendum d initiative citoyenne has become one of the movement s signatures and a rare point of unity at the jeanne rose camp outside of le creusot you could see it from the highway the sole message greeting passing drivers from a bright yellow banner were the three letters ric this demand is emblematic of the way the gilets jaunes positions scramble typical understanding of the divisions between left and right étienne chouard the figure most credited with popularizing the ric among the gilets jaunes styles himself as an anarchist but his conspiracist bent has found him allies among hardened anti semites and other veterans of the far right prominent gilets jaunes friendly to chouard such as eric drouet and especially maxime fly rider nicolle have spread their own share of vicious conspiracy theories notably one that equates france s adoption of the december 2018 marrakesh pact on migration with selling france to the united nations hatred of the european union and other international institutions courses through yellow vest social media channels among some gilets jaunes the call for participatory democracy itself reflects this distrust of big government especially as it extends beyond the borders of the nation state but for the gilets jaunes i spoke to and in the movement s most widely shared collective statements the broader demand for democracy was inextricable from social and by extension climate justice a list of forty two demands issued in late november compiled through an online poll in which 30 000 people were said to have participated included a halt to closures of local rail lines post offices and schools a major retrofitting program to insulate homes the renationalization of electric and gas utilities a ban on the privatization of other public infrastructure an end to austerity and the fair treatment of asylum seekers among a host of other measures aimed at reducing precarity and increasing equality in january an assembly of assemblies comprising 100 gilet jaune delegations from across the country concluded in a joint statement stressing many of the same themes running through these demands is a call for a renewal of the public sphere and between the lines an acknowledgement that in the twenty first century there can be no meaningful public sphere without collective and transformative solutions to climate change far from being anti environmental the gilets jaunes have exposed the greenwashing of macron s deeply regressive economic and social agenda clarisse pointed out that of the additional 4 billion in revenue that the fuel tax hike since scrapped was projected to raise in 2019 only 19 percent would have been channeled directly toward the green transition with the rest going back into the government s general budget meanwhile france s biggest corporations are reaping tens of billions of euros worth of tax cuts under the tax credit for competitivity and jobs or cice of course the government s main justification for raising the carbon tax publicly at least was not to raise revenue but to discourage the use of fossil fuels but on this point too gilets jaunes and environmental economists alike are skeptical attempting to change people s habits through taxes presumes that if one product gets too expensive they can just switch to another one but many working class households simply can t afford to decarbonize their commutes it s well and good to tell people who are making 1000 a month to change their car but they can t says elsa last name withheld a thirty three year old translator and a fellow regular at the magny camp along with clarisse she like so many gilets jaunes sees macron s government as imposing a false binary between people s livelihoods and saving the planet macron s government for its part claims that it has offered french drivers alternatives by granting low income households up to 5000 in incentives to upgrade to a less polluting car one of a few of the measures the government proposed in early november in an attempt to calm mounting anger over the fuel tax but for many gilets jaunes this offering was either too little too late or nowhere near enough even a 5000 bonus for one thing falls far short of the cost of switching to a hybrid or electric car the explosion of the yellow vest movement on november 17 exposed a deeper unease which a series of concessions since including a government funded bonus for low wage workers have similarly failed to allay the continuous protests have put the president in an uneasy position of his own it s not just that his government s legitimacy has taken a severe blow though it has a february poll showed his approval rating steadily recovering from its record low at the height of the yellow vest movement when he tied his predecessor françois hollande for least popular president of the fifth republic but it remained at 34 percent several points below trump s macron s concessions to the protesters have also put his government at odds with eu budget rules which mandate a maximum deficit to gdp ratio of 3 percent macron s finance minister bruno le maire was quick to clarify that the 10 billion in concessions including the energy subsidies and wage bonus would be made up by spending cuts elsewhere macron himself has insisted that restoring the wealth tax isf a central demand of the gilet jaunes is off the table and while the government is keen to showcase a new tax on tech giants google apple facebook and amazon or gafa for short le maire stressed in a mid january interview that the government s priority remains to downsize the public sector in a bid to attract foreign investment as for the yellow vest movement and great national debate launched by macron in response le maire was sanguine this is a historic opportunity he said for french citizens to make their voices heard as long as they stick to the right questions notably which spending to cut in order to cut taxes of course this austerity mindset is not only a french problem far from it and nor is macron its chief architect but the audacity of a government that professes to be a global leader on the environment while in practice catering above all to transnational capital has brought into stark relief the true stakes of the climate fight the french government s approach is symptomatic of the attitude that treats climate change as a market error one which can be corrected with a tax here an incentive there targeted primarily at individual consumers when climate science increasingly tells us that confronting climate change means reorienting our entire economies and fast so far the gilets jaunes have been far more effective in underlining the flaws of neoliberal climate policy than in proposing alternatives but other movements are filling in the gaps since september near monthly climate marches in france and neighboring countries have brought tens of thousands of protesters into the streets to demand meaningful action on climate change including about 200 in montceau les mines in december even those who weren t wearing yellow vests overwhelmingly shared the sense that their struggles were one and the same borrowing a phrase from nicolas hulot they chanted fin du monde fins de mois mêmes coupables même combat end of the world end of the month same culprits same fight poll after poll shows climate change to be a top concern for growing numbers of french voters as for many of their counterparts around the world nicolas hulot remains by far the most popular political figure in france with a 75 percent approval rating he is practically the only one to clear the 50 percent mark a petition mounted by four environmental groups in mid december threatening legal action against the french government if it did not take immediate concrete measures to honor its climate commitments quickly became the most successful in french history with 2 1 million signatures as of this writing it outpaces the petition credited with kickstarting the yellow vest movement by almost a million still it took the gilets jaunes to send out the kind of sos signal that the rest of the world was willing to hear they have set the tone for the rest of macron s first term and may yet augur a new era in french politics if not european politics writ large in the meantime the trucks rumble on along the rcea in a week some 300 of them go back and forth just from one new lidl warehouse outside of le creusot this outpost of the german based discount supermarket mega chain is now the largest in france having replaced a smaller one just a few miles down the road directly across from the now evacuated yellow vest outpost at le magny this hasn t escaped the attention of the local gilets jaunes who blockaded the warehouse on two separate occasions in late november a group of about 200 gilets jaunes did the same at a lidl distribution center in small town brittany in early december perhaps the movement s most unsung strength is its knack for pinpointing such key nodes of an evolving world economy whose carbon footprint continues to balloon while those least responsible shoulder the blame taxing everyday consumption of fossil fuels may be a necessary step toward abandoning them for good but it will only succeed if those who profit most pay most and the benefits to everyone else are immediate and tangible proposals toward that end are not lacking among them is the european version of the green new deal championed by the diem25 european spring movement led internationally by economist yanis varoufakis and represented in france by the new party génération s this group insists that problems as fundamental as inequality and climate change cannot be solved at the national level alone even a french government hell bent on taxing the rich would be hard pressed to do so singlehandedly at least at the levels needed to finance a rapid low carbon overhaul of the economy without support from european institutions so their answer is not less europe but more a more democratic more egalitarian continental system that could oversee a massive green transition the european spring manifesto calls for a 500 billion year continent wide green investment program a job guarantee and a universal citizen dividend that would pave the way for a continental basic income renegotiation of europe s energy and agricultural policies to foster renewables and agroecology a financial transactions tax and a crackdown on tax havens a strengthened right to housing greater rights for migrants and refugees and so on this program like the green new deal in the united states could easily be accused of being a socialist grab bag but the vital insight it shares with its u s counterpart and what brings it coherence as a climate policy is its emphasis on the massive investment across a huge variety of different sectors needed to flip the switch toward a low carbon economy in france a similar platform is also being championed by place publique a new group seeking to form a united front of ecological democratic left parties for the european elections and beyond their points of unity include the principle that the future of life on earth cannot be sacrificed to spending limits like the eu s 3 percent deficit rule adding to this list is the manifesto for the democratization of europe launched by thomas piketty and some 120 other european intellectuals in december and now counting over 100 000 signatures these new initiatives build on the long running demands of tax justice groups like attac which was born out of the alter globalization movement of the late 1990s and today leads a coalition calling for 1 million climate jobs in france alone echoes of a green new deal can also be found in the platform of la france insoumise albeit couched in more euro skeptic terms mélenchon s party favors the language of green economic planning and it presents the ecological transition as the task for an independent france for all the discord over europe strategy and style not to mention accumulated grudges between party leaders there are important common threads binding all of these proposals as well as the demands of the gilets jaunes at their core is the question of who pays and who gets paid to lead the ecological transition there is consensus among the broad left that corporate subsidies such as france s cice tax breaks must be directly reinvested in the green economy but which green economy renewable energy public transit and agroecology are no doubt central to the equation but so is an entire other sphere of un and undercompensated care and service work what marxist feminists like nancy fraser have called the labor of social reproduction building on the momentum of the gilets jaunes the demands of these workers have also been rising to the surface in france there are the stylos rouges red pens the teachers calling for salary hikes and an end to job cuts there are the gilets roses pink vests the childcare workers mobilizing against planned reforms to unemployment insurance that especially threaten short term contract workers like them and among the gilets jaunes themselves there are not only professional healthcare aides like ingrid levavasseur who announced in january that she would head up a list of yellow vest candidates for the european elections but many like yves clarisse who devote their lives to taking care of their loved ones for little to no compensation clarisse is entitled to 500 a month in state support for looking after his father about a third of the minimum wage but even combined with his father s pension he told a local reporter it s barely enough to get them through the month the effort to revalue care work in this mold is central to why green new deal advocates on both sides of the atlantic have put a universal basic income a job guarantee or some combination of the two at the center of their agenda as scholars like alyssa battistoni have long stressed policies privileging care education and other services are natural building blocks of an egalitarian low carbon economy if done right such policies would upturn the vicious cycle of race to the bottom practiced by multinational corporations like lidl which treat employees like disposable goods in the pursuit of selling ever more well disposable goods imported from global south sweatshops at great carbon cost to customers who are sorely in need of the discounts reading through the list of demands issued by the gilets jaunes in late november it s striking how much of this same agenda emerges but so far the connections between their movement and programs like the green new deal or the european spring remain mostly between the lines the convergence of struggles long heralded by french leftists and flickering in these overlapping lists of demands remains elusive what the gilets jaunes have made clear in the interim is that to gain a foothold in france let alone in europe a green new deal will need to harness some of the rage that animated the roundabouts this past winter it will be an uphill battle to rally even a plurality of the french public to the idea that the democratic left rather than the national front represents the most credible challenge to macron s three decades late reprise of there is no alternative the european elections this may will be the first major test of which way the yellow vest revolt ultimately points toward a democratic egalitarian alternative anchored around an expansive vision of climate justice or toward a hardening zero sum battle between the neoliberal center and the far right for now the crackle of the bonfires that kept the protesters warm through the winter has largely given way again to a quieter smoldering of discontent still at roundabouts like jeanne rose a dedicated core of protesters are searching for next steps while across the

for the adoption of topic 606 non gaap financial measures this press release includes information about non gaap diluted earnings per share non gaap tax rates and constant currency revenue and constant currency unearned revenue growth rates collectively the non gaap financial measures these non gaap financial measures are measurements of financial performance that are not prepared in accordance with u s generally accepted accounting principles and computational methods may differ from those used by other companies non gaap financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable gaap measures and should be read only in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap management uses both gaap and non gaap measures when planning monitoring and evaluating the company s performance the primary purpose of using non gaap measures is to provide supplemental information that may prove useful to investors and to enable investors to evaluate the company s results in the same way management does management believes that supplementing gaap disclosure with non gaap disclosure provides investors with a more complete view of the company s operational performance and allows for meaningful period to period comparisons and analysis of trends in the company s business further to the extent that other companies use similar methods in calculating non gaap measures the provision of supplemental non gaap information can allow for a comparison of the company s relative performance against other companies that also report non gaap operating results non gaap diluted earnings per share excludes to the extent applicable the impact of the following items stock based compensation amortization of acquisition related intangibles and previously the net amortization of debt discount on the company s convertible senior notes as well as income tax adjustments these items are excluded because the decisions that give rise to them are not made to increase revenue in a particular period but instead for the company s long term benefit over multiple periods specifically management is excluding the following items from its non gaap earnings per share as applicable for the periods presented in the q4 fy19 financial statements and for its non gaap estimates for q1 and fy20 stock based expenses the company s compensation strategy includes the use of stock based compensation to attract and retain employees and executives it is principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of our stockholders and at long term employee retention rather than to motivate or reward operational performance for any particular period thus stock based compensation expense varies for reasons that are generally unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period amortization of purchased intangibles the company views amortization of acquisition related intangible assets such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company s research and development efforts trade names customer lists and customer relationships and in some

the call over to mike callahan mike michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thanks les good morning and thank you for joining us today i will begin today s call with a review of our operating highlights and some market commentary and then lynn will cover our financial results in more detail we will then open the line for your questions now turning to slide 3 we were pleased to deliver a solid third quarter highlighted by record net sales and adjusted ebitda for both our reported and base business results our organic sales increase of 6 6 reflects strength and balance in both our product offering and the markets that we serve we did face some challenges on the sales front however including lost shipping days associated with some abnormally wet and extremely cold weather conditions in the quarter and further softening in the canadian single family residential construction market organic revenue growth was broad based across each of our product lines with 3 9 growth in wallboard sales 10 6 growth in ceilings and 13 1 growth in steel framing other product net sales were also up 4 5 organically on the profitability front we generated a 41 5 year over year increase in adjusted ebitda to a record 59 7 million for the third fiscal quarter the increase reflect the contributions from titan increased operating leverage including benefits from the cost savings initiatives undertaken earlier this fiscal year continued pricing improvement and favorable lease accounting let me touch on a few of these areas next in the third quarter there were some further softening in the canadian single family residential market which resulted in sales of our canadian business declining low single digits on a constant currency basis with further impact from about a 5 depreciation in the canadian dollar year over year nonetheless titan continues to be very accretive to our consolidated operating results our long term strategic rationale for the acquisition of titan including increased scale and footprint in north america geographic expansion into the highly attractive and fragmented canadian market and creation of a well balanced platform for growth remains very compelling the integration continues to progress well as we have continued to work closely with our key suppliers to generate purchasing synergies and take advantage of our scale and the power of our north american platform with the commencement of our annual purchasing programs in january 19 we began to realize our purchasing synergies at the run rate associated with our previously announced 10 million target for purchasing synergies and we continue to expect to exceed our original 10 million estimate for fiscal 20 and we continue to look for even more synergies with our cross border suppliers and through other non purchasing initiatives we have also continued to make progress on our previously announced strategic cost reduction initiatives in the us as demonstrated to the 130 basis points of operating leverage achieved during the fiscal third quarter which excludes the impact of the change in lease accounting as expected we achieved full run rate savings as of january 19 and are on track to realize the full 20 million annual benefit of these initiatives in fiscal 20 we generated strong free cash flow of 55 6 million during the quarter which enabled us to reduce our net debt by 32 8 million and repurchase 11 5 million of our common stock under the repurchase authorization announced last quarter we also opened a greenfield location just outside akron ohio and this morning announced the acquisition of commercial builders group llc subsequent to the end of the quarter this tuck in acquisition operates two facilities in the greater new orleans and baton rouge louisiana markets adding coverage of two important top 100 metro areas in the us as evidenced by all of these actions we are executing on our stated and balanced capital allocation strategies of debt reduction disciplined growth through acquisitions and greenfields and opportunistic share repurchases i d now like to spend a few moments explaining our current view of the end markets that we serve now as a reminder we estimate that approximately 55 of our consolidated revenues are to the commercial construction markets and approximately 45 is related to residential construction with just less than half of that 45 related to new single family residential construction since the latter part of calendar 2018 there has been a great deal of speculation with respect to the current macroeconomic outlook and the potential impact on residential and commercial construction from our perspective we remain encouraged by what we re seeing across our business and in the broader economy as it relates to residential construction while it s still early in the traditional spring selling season we believe the late 18 slowdown in new single family residential construction was related to a confluence of factors including a rise in interest rates home price appreciation and resulting affordability issues and geopolitical uncertainty like others while we expect that this market may take a pause we do not currently believe they will be prolonged or particularly deep jobs and income growth remained at very healthy levels and many of the major markets in the us continue to have limited housing supply as building remains below historical averages all of which bodes very well for the mid to long term outlook on the commercial front which represents the majority of our business most indicators and estimates point to continued growth against the backdrop of an economy that remains healthy we are seeing that in our own business with strong backlogs and quote activity in my recent visits to many of our locations in multiple geographies i ve heard from our own people and peak ph commercial customers that pipelines are strong extending through calendar 2019 and in some cases even in calendar 2020 while it s impossible to predict what levels of growth are ultimately realized near term in the markets we serve we remain focused on controlling what we can we believe our market leading position in the distribution of interior building products our balanced product portfolio and our diversified exposure across commercial and residential new and r r construction markets which we believe continue to exhibit healthy long term fundamentals will enable us to continue to take advantage of growth opportunities across our business both now and in the future looking to the balance of fiscal 2019 and beyond we remain committed to growing our business both organically and through selective acquisitions with an emphasis on profitability and free cash flow generation with which reducing debt remains a priority now with that i will turn it over to lynn for a more detailed review of the financial results lynn lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller thanks mike and i would also like to thank you all for joining us on the call today we were pleased to deliver a solid third quarter highlighted by record net sales and adjusted ebitda performance and strong free cash flow generation looking at slide 4 we grew net sales 23 6 to 723 9 million and increased our base business sales during the quarter by 6 6 compared to the third quarter of last fiscal year our wallboard net sales increased 16 to 297 million in the third quarter compared to the same period last year it was driven by acquisitions and pricing the 3 9 growth on an organic basis was comprised of a strong pricing gains of approximately 4 and flat volume the latter of which was due in large part to the lost shipping days in the us and lower sales in canada our third quarter ceiling sales increased by 16 4 year over year to 105 million as a result of pricing improvement higher organic volumes resulting from increased commercial business and the positive benefit of acquisitions the 10 6 organic increase was comprised of price increases of approximately 7 as well as higher volumes of approximately 3 our steel framing sales increased during the quarter by 21 4 year over year to 117 4 million this was driven by strong pricing gains acquisitions and higher organic volumes from greater commercial business the 13 1 organic increase included price gains of approximately 10 and an uptick in volume of approximately 3 our sales of other products which consist of installation joint compound tools inaudible and other complementary products totaled almost 204 million and were up 43 6 compared to the third quarter of last year the recent acquisition of titan have expanded the breadth of our product offerings while at the same time our 4 5 increase in our base business sales of other products reinforces the success of our efforts to continue to grow this other product category our gross profit increased almost 20 to 234 2 million on higher sales including the positive impact from acquisitions our gross margin of 32 4 declined from 33 4 a year ago primarily due to increased product costs as well as changes in product mix also last quarter s third quarter gross margin was a tough comparison being the highest gross margin level of any quarter last fiscal year and positively impacted by a higher level of supplier incentives associated with a larger level of wallboard pre buy rising product costs over the past year included two wallboard increases multiple steel and ceiling grid increases as well as various freight surcharges on a sequential basis gross margin improved 20 basis points from the second quarter and slightly exceeded the 32 2 guidance we indicated in last quarter s call which we continue to believe is a reasonable benchmark for the remainder of this fiscal year related technical difficulty to our ph wallboard increase we believe price cost dynamics turning to slide 5 we reduced our adjusted sg a as a percentage of net sales by 210 ph basis points year over year to 24 2 in the quarter a 130 basis points of the reduction was the result of increased cost efficiencies primarily due to the cost reduction initiatives taken during this fiscal year as well as contributions from the titan acquisition these were partially offset by continuing inflationary pressures primarily in logistics costs as well as higher costs operating with the weather disruptions mike referenced earlier the remaining 80 basis points of the reduction was driven by changes to lease accounting as we ve discussed we ve made significant progress on these reduction initiatives and we continue to find many opportunities to further streamline our business as a result we would expect fourth quarter adjusted sg a as a percentage of sales to decrease year over year at least by the level we experienced in the third quarter we delivered 59 7 million in adjusted ebitda in the third quarter this was up 41 5 year over year from 42 2 million in the prior year quarter adjusted ebitda margin was 8 2 as a percentage of sales or 7 4 if you exclude the impact of our lease accounting which was up 20 basis points from 7 2 a year ago turning to slide 6 during the third fiscal quarter we generated over 55 million of free cash flow this enabled us to reduce our net debt by 33 million as well as repurchase 11 5 million of our common shares as of january 31 our net debt to ltm pro forma adjusted ebitda was 3 8 times this was consistent with the level as of the end of q2 we intend to continue to de lever through strong free cash flow generation and as a reminder our current leverage ratio post titan compares favorably to 2014 when our ratio was six times as well as just prior to our may 2016 ipo when it was 4 3 times additionally of our total long term debt approximately just over 75 is not due until 2025 also in order to hedge against potential future interest rate volatility in february we entered into an interest rate swap agreement this agreement effectively provides a fixed rate on 0 5 billion of our first lien term debt our balance sheet remains healthy with 74 3 million cash on hand and 220 million available under our abl facilities this results in substantial liquidity for the business now let me turn the call back over to mike before we open the line for questions michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thanks lynn just a few additional comments before we open the line for questions we are pleased with our third quarter performance and believe that as the market leading distributor of interior building products with significant scale advantages combined with local expertise we are poised for continued growth our third quarter results provided further evidence of this with sales and adjusted ebitda growth of over 23 and 41 respectively we continue to take advantage of our multiple levers to drive this growth through organic growth greenfields m a and operating leverage we believe our large diverse end markets continue to exhibit healthy fundamentals providing us with significant growth opportunities across our business both now and in the future and then finally and probably most importantly our great network of dedicated gms employees in both the us and canada continue to embrace our strong entrepreneurial culture to deliver the outstanding service to our customers that we believe will deliver profitable growth over time to our shareholders and with that operator we re now ready to open the line up for questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from the line of michael wood with nomura instinet please proceed with your question ryan nomura instinet analyst hey guys this is ryan calling on for mike did logistics surprise you was this sudden and can you just explain how logistics hurt sg a whether this is freight rates or inefficiencies michael callahan president chief executive officer and director well i think the short answer to that is as i mentioned there was definitely some impacts weather related and the reality is that when you re when you re dealing with production challenges just in terms of getting loads out your logistics and efficiency in terms of labor utilization is impacted so i would say that really was a key factor in how logistics impacted us in the quarter ryan nomura instinet analyst okay thank you and then just one follow up how did flat organic wallboard volumes compare to industry sell through in your view lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller yeah thanks for the question in terms of how we compare it to the industry the gypsum association data our read on that data is that we believe that we maintained share we believe that most of the both year to date decline and quarter over quarter decline in the gypsum association was due to the impact of pre buy so looking at that we believe our flat volumes indicate that we are on par with our market share ryan nomura instinet analyst thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of david manthey with baird please proceed with your question david manthey robert w baird co analyst thank you good morning michael callahan president chief executive officer and director hi dave david manthey robert w baird co analyst hey good morning first off you mentioned that your gross margin percentage was lower due partly to higher product costs but clearly your realized selling prices were higher also i guess this implies the price cost relationship is negative could you talk a little bit about that relationship and why you think that happened lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller yeah sure thanks for the question related to the year over year decline in gross margin this was due to like we said some changes in product cost and mix in addition the prior year comp was really impacted by a higher level of volume incentives that we realized in the third quarter of prior year due to the december 2017 pre buy david manthey robert w baird co analyst okay thank you and then second what is your outlook for price in the coming 12 months to 18 months i guess we should assume a little bit less leverage on sg a if your pricing moderates down is that your assumption michael callahan president chief executive officer and director no that s not our assumption at this point i mean as you know dave price in terms of wallboard the price increases literally rolling out as we speak and then it took effect in the first part of march so there have been announced increases as always it takes a period of time for to settle out but our assumption right now is to continue to look through the pending increase of the existing increase and see how it settles in we re not baking in a lower price environment for the year david manthey robert w baird co analyst i just meant more moderate price increases than last year in steel for example michael callahan president chief executive officer and director oh i m sorry i would say yeah probably would say generally speaking i think if you look at steel prices they certainly have moderated kind of flattened out but i think that s a safe assumption yeah the only caveat to that might be insulation i think insulation is still on the bubble as it relates to the inflation david manthey robert w baird co analyst great all right thanks mike michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thanks david operator thank you our next question comes from the line of trey grooms with stephens inc please proceed with your question trey grooms stephens inc analyst hey good morning michael callahan president chief executive officer and director good morning trey trey grooms stephens inc analyst just real quick i guess kind of following up with the last question is the looking out on pricing you mentioned maybe a little bit more moderate price increases were you talking specifically just for clarity around wallboard pricing or and i know you mentioned steel but wallboard pricing or ceilings any is it both or one or the other that you re referring to just for clarity michael callahan president chief executive officer and director i would say that in terms of the pricing going forward wallboard certainly the increase as i said is in the process of rolling out as we speak i think in terms of ceilings as we ve often said ceilings generally tends to price up one to two increases a year it s a 3 to 5 increase generally speaking on ceilings insulation there still seems to be pressure on pricing as far as that goes so i would anticipate maybe be some inflation there and but steel has definitely settled down a bit and i don t see any near term price increases there trey grooms stephens inc analyst all right well thanks for that just hearing that you are expecting more moderate i just was making sure we were fully understanding that comment okay and then secondly is the canadian market is clearly weakened was down this most recent quarter for you guys what are you hearing from your customers there and their outlook for the building season in that market as we re kind of at least starting to come into view with the building season here in canada michael callahan president chief executive officer and director well there is a general backdrop clearly just in this period of time tends to be a seasonal slowdown for canada anyway just based on the snow and cold conditions i would say the outlook right now on the single family side there definitely has been some downward pressure single family detached so the stand alone homes definitely have seen and a lot of that frankly has to do with the mortgage programs they have in place and the stress test that the canadian government essentially has imposed on mortgages so that s definitely had an impact but i would say that the when you look at the commercial high rise and commercial development as well as the commercial multi family and this pretty much goes across the board the market outlook is still very positive so i would say as far as canada is concerned it s pretty well not completely isolated but for the most part it s that single family detached business which is under pressure right now but our view is still positive i mean i think the market overall is sound and the outlook is generally pretty optimistic trey grooms stephens inc analyst okay thank you and last one from me is just on with the increases that are out there especially on wallboard are you guys seeing or are you guys participating in any pre buy of any size at this point lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller no we ve had limited pre buy this season trey grooms stephens inc analyst all right that s it for me i ll pass it on thanks a lot michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thanks trey operator thank you our next question comes from the line of keith hughes with suntrust robinson humphrey please proceed with your question keith hughes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst thank you the ebitda margins were up 20 basis points year over year excluding the change in the leases i assume were your organic margins down given the titan usually mixes you up and if so kind of how much lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller yeah thanks for the question keith we don t break it down by the geographies keith hughes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst okay let me ask you this way on titan you talked about sales being weak if you kind of comment i know you didn t own it last year but just roughly how did their margins look compared to last year given the weak environment lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller yeah keith they were lower and their sg a as a percentage of sales was also impacted by the same weather conditions that we discussed and one thing on a constant currency basis sales were down 2 the canadian dollar did decline about 5 and that resulted in about a little bit less than 1 million impact on their adjusted ebitda keith hughes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst and just one small question on this come up in the fourth quarter the interest expense we saw in the third is that roughly a tax rate is that roughly what we ll see in the fourth quarter leslie h kratcoski vice president of investor relations yes that s a good way to think about the fourth quarter in terms of interest and taxes keith hughes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst okay great thank you michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thanks keith operator thank you our next question comes from the line of matt bouley with barclays please proceed with your question matthew adrien bouley barclays bank plc analyst hi thank you for taking my questions mike are you able to kind of quantify the impact of lost shipping days in the quarter and then maybe provide any comments around what you ve seen i guess in february thus far thanks michael callahan president chief executive officer and director yeah thanks matt you know it s really tough to quantify the bulk of the impact in terms of weather tends to gravitate toward single family and if you look at our numbers overall our mix you re probably looking 22 23 of our business overall is new revenue if you break it down on that basis so when you think about that given the just the magnitude of the impact that had on the single family piece and it is we lost numerous shipping days it s not just the fact that it rains for three or four consecutive days but it s also that you ve got to get the job sites themselves to dry out so while i can t really quantify that i think anybody that s been looking at the news and seeing it from texas all the way to dc that we ve all had to deal with pretty adverse conditions now we ll say that the november december we re under a lot of pressure january we saw a significant pick up in momentum and activity which carried over into february so i would say that the momentum activity in january plus frankly we were delivering on saturdays trying to catch up which also leads to some sg a pressure frankly in terms of overtime and things such as that so if you pick all that together so we re trying to catch up as best we can but fundamentally i think the january february momentum levels give us cause for optimism going into the fourth quarter leslie h kratcoski vice president of investor relations yeah i would note also that our february per day sales is up versus prior year on an organic basis michael callahan president chief executive officer and director that s a good point matthew adrien bouley barclays bank plc analyst okay appreciate that detail excuse me and then secondly just following up on the titan business in canada obviously you called out the challenges on the single family side and that the data seems to be a bit better on the multi family side could you remind us of titan s multi family versus single family exposure and then just maybe put some finer points around what you re seeing on the multifamily side specifically because i do think that the data has been a bit stronger there thank you michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thanks leslie h kratcoski vice president of investor relations yeah there are 40 commercial construction and then 60 resi on the resi side about 40 new and then in that 40 of the total in market and 20 r r and we estimate on the commercial side that there s 10 new and 30 r r matthew adrien bouley barclays bank plc analyst okay appreciate the detail thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of michael dahl with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question michael glaser dahl rbc capital markets analyst good morning thanks for taking my questions michael callahan president chief executive officer and director good morning michael michael glaser dahl rbc capital markets analyst mike i wanted to follow up on the pricing comments again actually two parts of it but first on the wallboard side i think you d ph mentioned not really any pre buy right now and you re talking about seeing how the price increases settle out there early on but is there anything to interpret in terms of how you re viewing the market and the likelihood for price in terms of you guys not participating in pre buy michael callahan president chief executive officer and director well first off the circumstances around pre buy this year different because of the increase itself is pushed out so routinely this is a january increase and it got pushed out this year so and then of course based on some of the conditions relative to deliveries and some of the pressure just to build ability to find a place to put the board was limited based on our inventory positions and delivery lag so the general outlook mike is that we are going to be nimble as the price increase is introduced into the marketplace but it s so we re still early on we don t really know a lot of it has to do with just demand levels and traction and take away from the plants and that literally has taken place as we speak now that the manufacturers continue to talk about escalating cost and inflationary pressures and they re reacting to that with their price increases but the market will dictate just exactly how much of this ultimately is going to be realized and depending on when it settles in first there maybe a second phase to the increases as they always leave the door open for that so i can t really handicap it at this point we are going up as we received higher costs from our manufacturers in many cases where we re quoting commercial work we re quoting escalators based on the projected increase and we have yet to see how it s all going to settle out michael glaser dahl rbc capital markets analyst okay that s helpful the second part of the pricing was really back related to steel and comments about not expecting any further increases i guess given the path of steel pricing when you look out over the next few quarters do you think that we could see price declines actually michael callahan president chief executive officer and director that s really that really is hard for me to call based on the current you know just the current uncertainties around steel in general and tariffs and everything else that s going on what i will tell you though is that we have our purchasing group here has a daily dialog on those with the steel producers and we keep very very close to the ground as to what s going on relative to steel pricing and so are we can move quickly too but based on how we turned our inventories i mean our steel inventories cycle very quickly so even if there is a near term price adjustment up or downwards we re able to cycle through that pretty quickly based on our just on how quickly we cycle the steel inventories so it s tough to handicap right now i would say right now we look at it is kind of flattish and where it goes from here really remains to be seen based on demand levels and just consumption michael glaser dahl rbc capital markets analyst got it if i could fit one more in you made a comment about the fourth quarter gross margin i just wanted to understand or clarify that a little were you saying that the 32 4 seen in 3q was still the reasonable assumption for 4q or was that comment related to your prior 32 2 leslie h kratcoski vice president of investor relations yes no our guidance continues to be the 32 2 michael glaser dahl rbc capital markets analyst okay great thank you michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thanks mike operator thank you our next question comes from the line of kevin hocevar with northcoast research please proceed with your question kevin hocevar northcoast research analyst hey good morning everybody michael callahan president chief executive officer and director hey kevin kevin hocevar northcoast research analyst you mentioned that so 3q 18 had a favorable gross margins for the you mentioned incentives ahead of price increases taking effect on the wallboard side it sounds like you re not really pre buying much ahead of this increase and gross margin expectations are from 3q to 4q relatively similar so can we infer from that that you re not seeing the same level of incentives this year as you saw last year ahead of the price increases leslie h kratcoski vice president of investor relations the favorable the favor ability that we saw in our margin last q3 due to the incentives was simply i think timing of the purchases so in terms of whole dollars or percentage the incentives remained fairly constant if not even a little bit more favorable so no i wouldn t infer that kevin hocevar northcoast research analyst okay okay and then so the largest ph wallboard manufacturers is that can be acquired here sometime in early 2019 so curious if you have any thoughts on that in terms of do you expect that to have any impact on that industry or do you think it will be pretty much business as usual after that transfer takes place michael callahan president chief executive officer and director you know in my view having done business a significant business with both sides of that equation so to speak i think it s going to be business as usual i think it s going to be a very strong and formidable company and they certainly have a very impressive array of products from the insulation side all the way through wallboard and ceiling so from our advantage point it s going to be business as usual and we re going to continue to do business with them as a combined entity just as we have separately in the past kevin hocevar northcoast research analyst got you okay thank you very much michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thanks operator thank you our next question comes from the line of matt mccall with seaport global securities please proceed with your question matt mccall seaport global securities analyst thanks good morning everybody michael callahan president chief executive officer and director good morning matt mccall seaport global securities analyst sorry i lost my voice so mike you made some comments bullish comments about the mid to long term specifically on the residential markets i was curious about more the near term view as you said there may be a pause i m just i m wondering about the impact of kind of the start weakness that we saw in 18 and expected impact on your business to start 19 calendar 19 michael callahan president chief executive officer and director well i mean i think it s logical to say that the same thing that we were talking about in terms of weather impacts on our business has impacts on starts too i mean it s tough to clear a land with a bulldozer when it s going to be submerged in six foot of water it had a subdivision in atlanta georgia so i mean i think the reality is our outlook is that if there is slippage we think it s going to be moderate slippage because there s still a shortage of inventory in just about every major market that we serve so and based on our conversations with the large national homebuilders that we do business with throughout our footprint that house counts generally speaking are up and i think the general attitude of the homebuilders is optimistic as well with the custom builders it s just with the rate increases back at 18 carrying it over under the tough winter i think the data is just kind of noisy right now so as we get deeper into the spring selling season i think all of us will have a little bit better clarity on where this market is going to settle out but a pause i think is the best word because i don t consider to be at a kind of a long term slippage i think it s just a matter of making a temporary market adjustment frankly matt mccall seaport global securities analyst okay thanks that s helpful the detail around the synergies and the cost saves that was also helpful can you it sounds like you re optimistic about meeting or exceeding those goals but can you give us an idea of where you were as of q3 for both the synergies and the cost saves and how we should layer those in over the next i guess four five quarters lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller yes are you referring to the the titan synergies or sg a synergies matt mccall seaport global securities analyst both the cost saves and in the synergies as well lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller yes so on the sg a so i would expect that for q4 that our reduction in sg a as a percentage of sales our sg a leverage is somewhere between where it was q2 over q2 and q3 over q3 matt mccall seaport global securities analyst okay and then does that kind of get you i think you had talked about the total for i think you said through 2020 for both synergies and cost saves so i guess when do we hit the full run rate of each of those both from titan and the sg a or the operational synergies lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller so in terms of the full run rate on the titan synergies we just those will both be 2020 yeah those will both be 2020 michael callahan president chief executive officer and director when we have the 10 million the 10 million full run rate synergies with titan which we expect to exceed those will be fully realized in fiscal 20 which is april of 20 and the same thing on the cost efficiencies or the cost savings of 20 ph matt mccall seaport global securities analyst okay all right thank you operator thank you ladies and gentlemen this concludes our question and answer session i will turn the floor back to mr callahan for any final comments michael callahan president chief executive officer and director well thank you everybody for joining us today we re very excited about where we are today and we look

with the successful management of our portfolio has sustainably decreased our all in sustaining costs to below our strategic target of 800 oz 2019 is expected to be another strong year as we look forward to the first gold pour at the ity cil plant in the coming weeks where construction continues to progress ahead of schedule and on budget over the past two years we have transformed our portfolio investing nearly 1 billion into the business once ity cil commences production we expect to enter a period of sustained strong free cash flow generation with a continued focus on return on capital employed the maiden resource at houndé s kari pump discovery was our most notable exploration achievement in 2018 in 2019 we look forward to converting this discovery into reserves we will maintain an aggressive exploration program focused specifically at houndé where we expect further maiden resources on new discoveries in addition we will look to further grow the resource in the le plaque area at ity and advance exploration at our greenfield properties i would like to thank our entire team for their dedication and contribution to our success in 2018 and for their efforts in positioning endeavour for continued success in 2019 and beyond 2018 key achievements and 2019 catalysts in 2018 endeavour continued to deliver against its strategy with good progress made across its

2016 in 2018 notable successes include the maiden indicated resource kari pump target at houndé and at the greenfield fetekro property of respectively 1 0moz and 0 5moz good results at the le plaque area at ity which are soon expected to yield an increased resource and greater confidence in the kalana main deposit resource active portfolio balance sheet management in line with its aim to focus on long life and low cost high quality assets following the sale of its non core youga mine and nzema mines in 2016 and 2017 respectively endeavour sold its tabakoto mine in 2018 on the balance sheet front endeavour finished the year with strong liquidity sources despite the accelerated construction of its ity cil project 2019 is expected to be another pivotal year for endeavour with the following notable catalysts ity cil project first gold pour expected in early q2 2019 following which the group is expected to be net cash flow positive maiden reserve for the kari pump discovery at houndé

890 houndé mine q4 vs q3 2018 insights a record quarter was achieved as production increased mainly due to significantly higher grades following the end of the rainy season tonnes of ore mined increased as mining activities ramped up following the end of the rainy season mining continued to focus on the vindaloo main and vindaloo central pits the strip ratio was lower than initially planned due to a shift in the mine plan which delayed stripping to 2019 tonnes milled increased slightly continuing to perform nearly 30 above nameplate capacity the ore blend continued to be mainly transitional fresh ore oxide ore represented 34 of the mill feed up from 32 in q3 2018 processed grades markedly improved as higher grade areas of both the vindaloo main and vindaloo central pits became accessible following the end of the rainy season in addition the higher grade ore mined was selectively processed while the lower grade ore was stockpiled recovery rates decreased slightly but remained at the level assumed in the optimized study aisc decreased due to higher production lower unit mining costs associated with reduced water pumping requirements following the end of the rainy season as well as the reduction in sustaining capital expenditures mining unit costs decreased from 2 14 to 1 92 per tonne due to increased volumes mined following the rainy season processing unit costs decreased from 12 71 to 11 84 per tonne due to the reduction in fresh ore processed in the period when compared to q3 2017 along with increased throughput volumes sustaining capital decreased from 2 7 million to 1 1 million following a reduction in waste capitalization in the period there was 3 0 million of non sustaining capex incurred during the quarter relating to waste capitalization fy 2018 vs fy 2017 insights production increased significantly as 2018 benefited from a full year of production since commercial production began in q4 2017 as guided aisc increased as last year s production benefited from processing primarily high grade oxide material stockpiles grew in 2018 amounting to 2 0mt at 1 1g t containing 70koz at year end 2018 performance vs guidance production totaled 277koz significantly exceeding full year guidance of 250 260koz due mainly to both the mining activities and the process plant performing above their nameplate capacities aisc amounted to 564 oz well below the guided 580 630 oz range due to the outperformance of the operation and a lower than planned strip ratio in the second of half the year following a shift in the mine plan which delayed higher stripping to 2019 table 4 houndé quarterly performance indicators for the quarter ended q4 2018 q3 2018 q4 2017 tonnes ore mined kt 1 736 1 413 663 strip ratio incl waste cap 5 87 6 00

is expected to continue in the vindaloo deposit while ore extraction at the bouéré deposit is expected to start in late h1 2019 the strip ratio is expected to increase in 2019 due to both the mine plan sequence and to the carry over of stripping delayed from 2018 throughput is expected to remain above nameplate capacity while the ore blend is expected to shift from the current mix of 30 oxide ore and 70 transitional fresh ore feed to mainly fresh ore by year end resulting in higher operating costs despite the expected higher grades mined the average processed grade is expected to decline due to the use of lower grade stockpiles this marks a change compared to the previous mine plan due to the company s strategic focus on reducing working capital sustaining costs are expected to total circa 35 million mainly due to the increased strip ratio a planned raise in the tsf and the purchase of components for fleet maintenance approximately 7 million of non sustaining expenditure is planned for 2019 mainly for the bouéré pre strip road and resettlement 2018 exploration program the 2018 exploration program amounted to 14 million totaling approximately 165 700 meters of drilling focused mainly on the kari gold in soil anomaly which covers a 6km long by 2 5km wide area resulting in the identification of a maiden indicated resource at the kari pump target totaling 11 3mt at 2 71 g t au containing 987koz as published on november 15 2018 the maiden resource covers an area 1 3km long by 0 8km wide and remains open in various directions the mineralization is amenable to open pit mining and 45 of the indicated resource is located within the oxide and transition zones compared to most of the houndé indicated resource located in fresh zones the kari center discovery which extends 1 2km along strike and across a width of over 200m and remains open in various directions the kari west discovery which extends at least 1 0km along strike and across a width of 500m and remains open in various directions 2019 exploration program in 2019 houndé will continue to be the priority exploration focus for endeavour with a budget of up to 17 million totaling approximately 195 000 meters of drilling with the aim of delineating additional resources at kari pump delineating a maiden resource at the kari centre and kari west targets testing other targets such as sia sianikoui grand espoir and high grade plunges at the vindaloo deposit reserve resource evolution as shown in appendix 3 the variance in p p reserves compared to the previous year is primarily due to mining depletion at the vindaloo deposit while the m i resource increased due to the 987koz maiden resource outlined at the kari pump discovery reserves are expected to increase in mid year as the kari pump resource is expected to be converted to reserves following the completion of the on going metallurgical tests metallurgical tests are underway with als chemex australia preliminary results are indicating good gold recovery rates similar to the vindaloo deposit currently being mined agbaou mine q4 vs q3 2018 insights production increased as expected mainly due to a significant increase in milled grade following the waste extraction efforts over the course of the year which gave access to higher grade areas ore mined increased due to greater extraction at the south pit as less stripping was necessary waste extraction efforts continued in the west pit resulting in an increase in the overall strip ratio mill throughput increased as the proportion of fresh ore processed decreased from 15 to 12 processed grades increased due to the change in mining sequence giving access to higher grade ore recovery rates improved slightly due to a lower proportion of fresh ore processed all in sustaining costs decreased mainly due to increased gold sales which were offset slightly by higher sustaining costs driven by increased waste capitalization activity mining unit costs decreased from 2 57 to 2 38 per tonne because of the increased volumes mined in the south pit processing unit costs decreased from 7 77 to 7 66 per tonne due to the reduction in fresh ore processed sustaining capital increased from 3 6 million to 5 8 million following the increased waste capitalization in the west pit non sustaining capital increased from 0 1 million to 3 3 million due to the pre stripping of the west pit fy 2018 vs fy 2017 insights production decreased as guided as low grade stockpile feed supplemented the mine feed to allow waste capitalization activity to progress quicker in 2018 in addition mining was constrained to lower grade areas aisc increased as guided due to the higher sustaining costs associated with the waste capitalization activity the impact of lower production and higher operating costs related to mining and processing a greater volume of fresh and transitional ore stockpiles declined in 2018 amounting to 1 6mt at 0 6g t containing 32koz at year end 2018 performance vs guidance production totaled 141koz achieving the lower end of the guided 140 150koz range aisc amounted to 819 oz well below the guided 860 900 oz range as a portion of the planned

2018 waste capitalization was shifted to 2019 the plant throughput is expected to decline as the oxide ore blend is expected to reduce from approximately 80 in 2018 to 60 with the remainder of the feed comprised of fresh and transitional ore despite plans to mine higher grade ore the average processed grade is expected to remain fairly flat over 2019 due to the use of lower grade stockpiles this marks a change compared to the previous mine plan due to the company s strategic focus on maximizing free cash flow generation and reducing working capital sustaining costs are expected to increase from 13 million to circa 24 million mainly due to increased waste capitalization approximately 8 million of non sustaining expenditure is planned for 2019 mainly covering work to raise the tsf 2018 exploration program the 2018 exploration program amounted to 4 million totaling approximately 27 800 meters of drilling focused mainly on open pit targets located along extensions of known deposits and on parallel trends and on the at depth potential of the north pit mineralization was confirmed at the extensions of several deposits including the mpn north pit satellite 3 west pit 5 and beta however the mineralization intercepted was low grade and lacked continuity and therefore little follow up drilling was done with a focus instead on testing other higher potential targets mineralization was confirmed at depth in the north pit however in the short term no follow up drilling is planned for this target as the potential resource in this area may not be suitable for open pit operations as such the focus remains on testing other open pit targets 2019 exploration program an exploration program of up to 2 million is being considered for 2019 with the aim of continuing to test targets located along extensions of known deposits and on parallel trends reserve resource evolution as shown in appendix 3 the variance in p p reserves and m i resources compared to the previous year mainly corresponds to mining depletion and an update in unit cost assumptions for the reserve calculation karma mine q4 vs q3 2018 insights production increased due to a significant increase in ore stacked following the end of the rainy season tonnes of ore mined increased as mining activities ramped up following the end of the rainy season activities focused exclusively on mining oxide ore from the kao pit mill throughput increased as operating conditions improved with increased stacker utilization recovery rates remained high due to the improved leach characteristics of the oxide ore stacked aisc improved as the overall operating costs decreased following the end of the rainy season and due to an increase in ounces sold mining unit costs decreased from 3 18 to 1 76 per tonne because of increased tonnages being mined following the wet season processing unit costs decreased from 8 46 to 7 41 per tonne due to higher stacked tonnes and lower reagent consumption for oxide material processed sustaining capital increased marginally from 1 0 million to 1 3 million due to spending on mining components non sustaining capital spend was consistent with q3 2018 with 8 3 million spent the q4 2018 costs were mainly related to pre stripping at the kao deposit as well as the resettlement costs associated to its development fy 2018 vs fy 2017 insights production increased as guided despite a lower processed grade as the plant optimization work done in 2017 increased stacking capacity aisc decreased specifically in the second half of the year when most of the ore

oxide ore from the north kao pit where pre stripping will begin in q1 2019 and ore extraction in q2 2019 the strip ratio is expected to increase in 2019 due to north kao tonnes stacked and recovery rates are expected to remain fairly flat over 2018 the mine s performance is expected to be better in the second half of the year as the first half is expected to be impacted by the kao pit transitional ore sustaining costs are expected to total circa 5 million with the main spending related to the waste capitalization at north kao pit non sustaining expenditure is expected to be relatively flat at 24 million comprising mainly stacking line extension and lift preparation and lining and pre stripping for the north kao deposit 2018 exploration program the 2018 exploration program amounted to 3 million totaling approximately 23 600 meters of drilling focused mainly on yabonsgo and north kao resulting in the identification of a maiden indicated resource at the yabonsgo target totalling 2 9mt at 1 28 g t au containing 119koz the continuity of mineralization at the north kao deposit was confirmed along an 800m strike length with additional lenses identified to the

totaling approximately 27 000 meters has been planned for 2019 with the aim of delineating near mill oxide targets mainly focused on testing the extension of the north kao deposit and the along strike and northern plunge extension of the yabonsgo deposit reserve resource evolution as shown in appendix 3 the variance in p p reserves and m i resources compared to the previous year corresponds to mining depletion and a decreased for the gg2 and kao main deposits following changes in estimation parameters which was partially offset by the addition of m i resources and p p reserves at the yabongso deposit ity mine heap leach operation q4 vs q3 2018 insights 2018 was guided to be a transition year for the heap leach operation with greater priority given to the cil construction activities particularly in the second half of the year as the main goal was to stack ore from lower grade stockpiles however ity s heap leach operation performed above expectations particularly in q4 2018 as mining was opportunistically conducted based on equipment availability and the good progress made on ity cil construction production remained flat as a decrease in stacked grade was offset by a higher recovery rate tonnes of ore mined decreased in line with the plan as mining activity for the heap leach decreased to prioritize the construction of the cil plant mining for the heap leach operation ceased in mid december ore stacked decreased as the quantity of ore mined decreased with lower grade stockpiles supplementing the stacked feed stacking at the heap leach operation ceased in mid december the stacked grade decreased as mining activity at the high grade bakatouo pit ceased for heap leach operations and low grade ore stockpiles were used recovery rates increased due to improved leach characteristics associated with the ore stacked from the bakatouo pit aisc decreased due to lower unit mining costs associated with reduced water pumping requirements as well as a lower strip ratio lower processing and g a costs and increased ounces of gold sold in the period mining unit costs decreased from 7 02 to 6 65 per tonne due to shorter haul distances as mining for the heap leach operations winds down processing unit costs decreased from 14 70 to 13 80 per tonne due to lower reagent usage sustaining capital decreased from 0 3 million to 0 07 million as the heap leach operation winds down there was no non sustaining capital spent in the quarter depreciation and depletion increased for the period due to accelerated depreciation taken on the heap leach assets as it nears the end of mine life fy 2018 vs fy 2017 insights record production was achieved due to significantly higher grades stacked from the bakatouo deposit and increased stacking aisc decreased due to

year the main components for the full year outflow were receivables were a 2018 outflow of 5 million the 2018 outflow primarily related to an increase in vat receivables at the burkina faso mine sites karma and houndé of 5 million and the recognition of 9 million for the current portion of the tabakoto sale receivable this was offset partly by a reduction in other receivable balances during the year across the corporation inventories were a 2018 outflow of 17 million relating primarily to a build up of stockpiles at houndé which totalled 29 million at year end this was offset by a decrease at ity where mining operations is winding down as well as karma where inventory levels are being reduced to optimised levels prepayments are a 2018 5 million inflow due to a prepayment for strategic spares at houndé that was in place at year end 2017 these were received in 2018 and are accounted for as part of consumable inventory trade and other payables are a 7 million inflow 2018 at year end there was a 12 million outflow at karma due to a change in supplier terms from last year and 13 million outflow in payables at agbaou which was the result of the site having a logistical issue in paying a key supplier in the prior period this was offset against an inflow in trade payables of 22 million across ity and houndé the changes in long term inventories is a new policy adopted by the group whereby stockpiled material that will not be processed within 12 months is treated as a non current asset the outflow in the year represents the build up of this newly classified item changes in long term assets relates to the recognition of the long term receivable for nsr on the sale of the tabakoto mine interest and financing fees paid increased due to the increase in debt outstanding related to the construction of houndé and ity cil the revenue protection program based on a collar with a floor at 1 300 oz and a ceiling of 1 500 oz generated a cash inflow net of the premium of 5

aviation equipment purchased to reduce travel costs and improve efficiency 33m was received upon closing of the tabakoto sale in q4 2018 net of transaction fees while the 2017 outflow mainly relates to the purchase of an additional 25 stake in the ity mine which was netted against proceeded received from the nzema sale a foreign exchange loss mainly on the settlement of euro denominated supplier

the consolidation of vie trusts required under gaap management commentary 2018 was another positive year for wmc despite a backdrop of year end equity market volatility that spilled into the fixed income markets and pressured all spread sectors said jennifer murphy chief executive officer of the company notwithstanding the challenging conditions we generated core earnings plus drop income of 0 34 per share for the fourth quarter and 1 36 for the year more than covering our dividends which have been consistent at 0 31 per share for the last eleven quarters the generally wider spreads on our investments in the fourth quarter translated into a negative economic return on book value of 3 3 for the quarter murphy continued however our diversified portfolio and differentiated investment strategy enabled us to generate a positive economic return on book value of approximately 4 8 for the full year which put us at the high end of the range of our mortgage reit peers in addition the overall market sentiment for risk assets turned positive in the first two months of 2019 and as a result we have experienced a partial recovery in our book value sean johnson interim co chief investment officer of the company commented our strong core earnings and positive performance for 2018 were driven by contributions across our diverse holdings in a number of subsectors of the mortgage market and reflects our ongoing shift out of agency rmbs investments into credit sensitive investments and agency cmbs during the year we acquired 2 7 billion of target assets including 1 8 billion of credit sensitive investments particularly in residential whole and bridge loans and commercial whole loans all where we saw opportunities to achieve attractive risk adjusted returns our current expectations are for continued yet moderate u s economic growth along with subdued inflation expectations and a more neutral federal reserve monetary policy we remain constructive on both residential and commercial real estate the u s housing market is entering a more normalized phase as home price appreciation is expected to remain modest commercial real estate fundamentals generally continue to be positive driven by an ongoing economic expansion and job growth as such we believe that our strategy of holding a diverse investment portfolio with an emphasis on credit sensitive investments and our focus on risk management positions us well to continue generating strong core earnings while preserving our book value with the overriding goal of providing our shareholders

gwen sung cnn money about the authors paul craig roberts has had careers in scholarship and academia journalism public service and business he is chairman of the institute for political economy michael hudson is president of the institute for the study of long term economic trends islet a wall street financial analyst distinguished research professor of economics at the university of missouri kansas city his most recent books are killing the host how financial parasites and debt destroy the global economy and j is for junk economics a guide to reality in an age of deception putin s approval rating is high but it has declined over the past year the decline is mainly related to domestic policy apparently the public perceives recent kremlin economic policy as a continuation of the disastrous policies that washington imposed on russia in the 1990s when russia was loaded up with foreign debt while state assets were privatized and plundered by oligarchs sponsored by the west who cashed out by selling the assets to foreigners the approval rating of putin and the government dropped inthe former raised concerns about pension security and reminded russians of the collapse of soviet pensions the latter reduced consumer disposable income and lowered consumer demand and the economic growth rate russia has experienced over 25 billion a year of capital outflows since the early 1990s accumulating to over a trillion dollars this money could have been invested in russia itself to raise the productivity and living standards of its citizens the outflow puts the ruble under pressure and the interest payments draw money out of the country away from russian uses if it were not for these outflows the value of the ruble and russian wages would be higher the us sanctions give russians every reason not to repay their foreign loans yet russians continue to enable their own exploitation by foreigners as neoliberal economists have told them that there is no alternative russia s stock market became the darling of the west in the mid 1990s as underpriced mining oil and infrastructure were sold for a fraction of their value to foreigners thus transferring russian income streams abroad instead of leaving the income to be invested in russia in effect russians were told that the way for their country to get rich was to letwashington took advantage of the gullible and trusting yeltsin government to do as much political and economic damage as possible to russia the country was torn apart historic parts of russia such as ukraine were split off into separate countries washington even insisted that crimea long a part of russia and the country s warm water port was retained by ukraine when the soviet union was dismembered people s savings called the overhang were wiped out with hyperinflation privatization was not accompanied by new investment the economy was not industrialized but financialized the proceeds from privatization were deposited by the russian government in private banks where the money was used to privatize more russian assets in which proconsuls created wealth at the top today privatization continues in the de facto privatization of public assets such as charging fees for use of federal highways as the russian economic profession has been brainwashed by the americans the country is devoid of economic leadership we have pointed out on more than one occasion that it is nonsensical for russia to indebt itself by borrowing abroad in order to finance investments this advice served to prevent russia from using its own central bank to fund public infrastructure and private investment projects by issuing rubles in other words russia might as well not have a central bank apparently russian economists do not understand that russia does not spend borrowed foreign currencies inside russia if russia takes a foreign loan the borrowed money goes into central bank reserves the central bank then issues the ruble equivalent to be spent on the project and the cost of the project goes up by the pointless interest paid to the foreign lender as far as we can tell the institute of economics of the russian academy of sciences is so brainwashed by neoliberal economics that their minds are closed to correct policies intellectual leadership is weak withto be part of the west has been an important goal since peter the first and catherine the great and the russian atlanticist integrationists cannot let go of the ancient goal not only does it imply russian vassalage but also europe is no longer the center of power the east is rising and china is the center and will be until the chinese destroy themselves by copying the western neoliberal policy of financializing the economy although putin is a leader and has a sense of russian purpose many officials use their office not in service to russia but in service to their own wealth much of which is held abroad corruption and embezzlement seem to be the purpose of many office holders scandals abound among members of government and reflect badly on putin and medvedev the russian government s popularity was at a peak when the government showed it had the intelligence and will to reincorporate crimea into russia however the russian government hoping to reassure washington and europe russian nationalists the majority of the population saw this as kowtowing to the west moreover theinstead of acting decisively the russian government enabled the continuation of conflict that can be exploited by washington the russian people understand this even if the government does not by failing to show firmness the russian government encourages the crony system of oligarchs who want a government that they can use for their narrow interests these client elites of the west oppose a powerful russian state that could assert itself on the world stage and offer an alternative policy to the west s policy of plunder the influence of this narrow interest group on government policy indicates that the russian government is compromised various aspects of russia s difficulties and transformation into a power with a foot in both west and east are discussed by commentators what goes unacknowledged is that russian economic policy is constrained indeed crippled by the neoliberal brainwashing given to russian economists by the americans in the 1990s consequently that is ofbut from such factors as location and rise in value due to public infrastructure development such as a road built across a property in a financialized economy credit is used to transfer property ownership instead of to finance new plant and equipment and construction of infrastructure the russian government and central bank have been blinded to the fact that russian infrastructure projects and private investment are not dependent on borrowing dollars abroad or by acquiring dollars by selling russian assets to foreigners such projects can be financed by ruble creation by the russian central bank for russia to succeed russia needs an economic re education and a government that finds its footing in russian nationalism and discourages western provocations with firmer responses it is our view that the western world indeed all of life has an interest in a russia too strong to be attacked or provoked as a strong russia is the only way to curtail the western aggression that is leading to nuclear war

by kevin yao and tom daly beijing reuters china sought to shore up its slowing economy through billions of dollars in planned tax cuts and infrastructure spending with economic growth at its weakest in almost 30 years due to softer domestic demand and a trade war with the united states the government is targeting economic growth of 6 0 to 6 5 percent in 2019 premier li keqiang said at tuesday s opening of the annual meeting of china s parliament less than the 6 6 percent gross domestic product growth reported last year sources told reuters earlier this year that china would cut its 2019 growth target to 6 0 to 6 5 percent from the 2018 target of around 6 5 percent as both global and domestic demand ebbed and the u s trade war heightened economic risks speaking in beijing s great hall of the people li warned of the challenges the world s second largest economy faced and pledged to keep it on a safe footing with an array of stimulus measures the environment facing china s development this year is more complicated and more severe he said there will be more risks and challenges that are either predictable or unpredictable and we must be fully prepared for a tough battle li said china s fiscal policy would become more forceful with planned cuts of nearly 2 trillion yuan 298 3 billion in taxes and fees for companies those tax cuts are more aggressive than the 1 3 trillion yuan delivered in 2018 and include reductions aimed at supporting the manufacturing transport and construction sectors china s gdp last year expanded at its slowest pace since 1990 due to the trade war and beijing s crackdown on financial risks which raised corporate borrowing costs and hurt investment analysts say beijing s move to adopt a gdp target range rather than a single growth figure gives policymakers room to maneuver but the increase in planned fiscal stimulus marks an explicit acknowledgement that authorities remain concerned about growth if you are not sick you will not take so many medicines at one time said iris pang greater china economist at ing wholesale banking it means the headwinds have not gone away they are still there a longer term campaign to curb polluting and low value industries also slowed china s vast manufacturing sector china has ramped up the propaganda in the run up to parliament with state media releasing english language videos and even a rap song praising the event as an exercise in chinese democracy though the legislature never rejects laws and its members are chosen for their loyalty to the communist party the annual gathering in the capital includes more than 3 000 delegates who come from all over china with ethnic minorities showing up in colorful traditional outfits to support growth li said china would closely monitor employment at exporting companies heavily exposed to the u s market and cut the value added tax vat for the manufacturing sector to 13 percent from 16 percent vat for the transport and construction sectors will be cut to 9 percent from 10 percent china aims to create more than 11 million new urban jobs this year and keep the urban unemployment rate within 4 5 percent in line with its 2018 goals at the same time it will cut the social security fees paid by companies deeper tax cuts support to smes in a push to ramp up infrastructure investment china s finance ministry raised the special bond issuance quota for local governments to 2 15 trillion yuan 320 8 billion from 1 35 trillion yuan last year the lower tax revenue and higher government spending push china s budget deficit target for this year up to 2 8 percent of gdp from last year s 2 6 percent the government has also set a consumer inflation target of around 3 percent despite a recent softening in price rises to less than 2 percent which gives beijing some room to stimulate consumption over the past year china s central bank has cut the reserve requirements for commercial lenders five times to spur loans to small and private companies vital for growth and jobs li said on tuesday monetary policy would be neither too tight nor too loose and that the government would not resort to a flood of liquidity growth targets for m2 money supply which includes cash in circulation and deposits and total social financing this year would be in line with nominal gdp growth to support private and smaller firms li said beijing will step up targeted cuts in the reserve requirement ratio for smaller and medium sized banks with an aim to boost lending to small companies by large banks by more than 30 percent the government must also continue reforms to hand more power to market forces li said including steps to reduce red tape so that companies can spend more time doing business and less time chasing approvals trade risks addressing one of the biggest challenges china s economy faces the government s work report to parliament said it would continue to promote sino u s trade negotiations and was committed to safeguarding economic globalization and free trade li s work report also said china will further improve market access for foreign investment and create an environment in which chinese and foreign firms are treated as equals and engage in fair competition separately china s top banking regulator said on tuesday beijing could absolutely reach an agreement with the united states on opening up its financial sector even as the country s commerce minister admitted talks with washington had been difficult in recent weeks the united states and china appear to have moved closer to a trade deal that would roll back u s tariffs on at least 200 billion worth of chinese goods u s secretary of state mike pompeo said on monday he thought both nations were on the cusp of a deal to end their trade war

with the successful management of our portfolio has sustainably decreased our all in sustaining costs to below our strategic target of 800 oz 2019 is expected to be another strong year as we look forward to the first gold pour at the ity cil plant in the coming weeks where construction continues to progress ahead of schedule and on budget over the past two years we have transformed our portfolio investing nearly 1 billion into the business once ity cil commences production we expect to enter a period of sustained strong free cash flow generation with a continued focus on return on capital employed the maiden resource at houndé s kari pump discovery was our most notable exploration achievement in 2018 in 2019 we look forward to converting this discovery into reserves we will maintain an aggressive exploration program focused specifically at houndé where we expect further maiden resources on new discoveries in addition we will look to further grow the resource in the le

890 houndé mine q4 vs q3 2018 insights a record quarter was achieved as production increased mainly due to significantly higher grades following the end of the rainy season tonnes of ore mined increased as mining activities ramped up following the end of the rainy season mining continued to focus on the vindaloo main and vindaloo central pits the strip ratio was lower than initially planned due to a shift in the mine plan which delayed stripping to 2019 tonnes milled increased slightly continuing to perform nearly 30 above nameplate capacity the ore blend continued to be mainly transitional fresh ore oxide ore represented 34 of the mill feed up from 32 in q3 2018 processed grades markedly improved as higher grade areas of both the vindaloo main and vindaloo central pits became accessible following the end of the rainy season in addition the higher grade ore mined was selectively processed while the lower grade ore was stockpiled recovery rates decreased slightly but remained at the level assumed in the optimized study aisc decreased due to higher production lower unit mining costs associated with reduced water pumping requirements following the end of the rainy season as well as the reduction in sustaining capital expenditures mining unit costs decreased from 2 14 to 1 92 per tonne due to increased volumes mined following the rainy season processing unit costs decreased from 12 71 to 11 84 per tonne due to the reduction in fresh ore processed in the period when compared to q3 2017 along with increased throughput volumes sustaining capital decreased from 2 7 million to 1 1 million following a reduction in waste capitalization in the period there was 3 0 million of non sustaining capex incurred during the quarter relating to waste capitalization fy 2018 vs fy 2017 insights production increased significantly as 2018 benefited from a full year of production since commercial production began in q4 2017 as guided aisc increased as last year s production benefited from processing primarily high grade oxide material stockpiles grew in 2018 amounting to 2 0mt at 1 1g t containing 70koz at year end 2018 performance vs guidance production totaled 277koz significantly exceeding full year guidance of 250 260koz due mainly to both the mining activities and the process plant performing above their nameplate capacities aisc amounted to 564 oz well below the guided 580 630 oz range due to the outperformance of the operation and a lower than planned strip ratio in the second of half the year following a shift in the mine plan which delayed higher stripping to 2019 table 4 houndé quarterly performance indicators for the quarter ended q4 2018 q3 2018 q4 2017 tonnes ore mined kt 1 736 1 413 663 strip ratio incl waste cap 5 87 6 00

is expected to continue in the vindaloo deposit while ore extraction at the bouéré deposit is expected to start in late h1 2019 the strip ratio is expected to increase in 2019 due to both the mine plan sequence and to the carry over of stripping delayed from 2018 throughput is expected to remain above nameplate capacity while the ore blend is expected to shift from the current mix of 30 oxide ore and 70 transitional fresh ore feed to mainly fresh ore by year end resulting in higher operating costs despite the expected higher grades mined the average processed grade is expected to decline due to the use of lower grade stockpiles this marks a change compared to the previous mine plan due to the company s strategic focus on reducing working capital sustaining costs are expected to total circa 35 million mainly due to the increased strip ratio a planned raise in the tsf and the purchase of components for fleet maintenance approximately 7 million of non sustaining expenditure is planned for 2019 mainly for the bouéré pre strip road and resettlement 2018 exploration program the 2018 exploration program amounted to 14 million totaling approximately 165 700 meters of drilling focused mainly on the kari gold in soil anomaly which covers a 6km long by 2 5km wide area resulting in the identification of a maiden indicated resource at the kari pump target totaling 11 3mt at 2 71 g t au containing 987koz as published on november 15 2018 the maiden resource covers an area 1 3km long by 0 8km wide and remains open in various directions the mineralization is amenable to open pit mining and 45 of the indicated resource is located within the oxide and transition zones compared to most of the houndé indicated resource located in fresh zones the kari center discovery which extends 1 2km along strike and across a width of over 200m and remains open in various directions the kari west discovery which extends at least 1 0km along strike and across a width of 500m and remains open in various directions 2019 exploration program in 2019 houndé will continue to be the priority exploration focus for endeavour with a budget of up to 17 million totaling approximately 195 000 meters of drilling with the aim of delineating additional resources at kari pump delineating a maiden resource at the kari centre and kari west targets testing other targets such as sia sianikoui grand espoir and high grade plunges at the vindaloo deposit reserve resource evolution as shown in appendix 3 the variance in p p reserves compared to the previous year is primarily due to mining depletion at the vindaloo deposit while the m i resource increased due to the 987koz maiden resource outlined at the kari pump discovery reserves are expected to increase in mid year as the kari pump resource is expected to be converted to reserves following the completion of the on going metallurgical tests metallurgical tests are underway with als chemex australia preliminary results are indicating good gold recovery rates similar to the vindaloo deposit currently being mined agbaou mine q4 vs q3 2018 insights production increased as expected mainly due to a significant increase in milled grade following the waste extraction efforts over the course of the year which gave access to higher grade areas ore mined increased due to greater extraction at the south pit as less stripping was necessary waste extraction efforts continued in the west pit resulting in an increase in the overall strip ratio mill throughput increased as the proportion of fresh ore processed decreased from 15 to 12 processed grades increased due to the change in mining sequence giving access to higher grade ore recovery rates improved slightly due to a lower proportion of fresh ore processed all in sustaining costs decreased mainly due to increased gold sales which were offset slightly by higher sustaining costs driven by increased waste capitalization activity mining unit costs decreased from 2 57 to 2 38 per tonne because of the increased volumes mined in the south pit processing unit costs decreased from 7 77 to 7 66 per tonne due to the reduction in fresh ore processed sustaining capital increased from 3 6 million to 5 8 million following the increased waste capitalization in the west pit non sustaining capital increased from 0 1 million to 3 3 million due to the pre stripping of the west pit fy 2018 vs fy 2017 insights production decreased as guided as low grade stockpile feed supplemented the mine feed to allow waste capitalization activity to progress quicker in 2018 in addition mining was constrained to lower grade areas aisc increased as guided due to the higher sustaining costs associated with the waste capitalization activity the impact of lower production and higher operating costs related to mining and processing a greater volume of fresh and transitional ore stockpiles declined in 2018 amounting to 1 6mt at 0 6g t containing 32koz at year end 2018 performance vs guidance production totaled 141koz achieving the lower end of the guided 140 150koz range aisc amounted to 819 oz well below the guided 860 900 oz range as a portion of the planned

2018 waste capitalization was shifted to 2019 the plant throughput is expected to decline as the oxide ore blend is expected to reduce from approximately 80 in 2018 to 60 with the remainder of the feed comprised of fresh and transitional ore despite plans to mine higher grade ore the average processed grade is expected to remain fairly flat over 2019 due to the use of lower grade stockpiles this marks a change compared to the previous mine plan due to the company s strategic focus on maximizing free cash flow generation and reducing working capital sustaining costs are expected to increase from 13 million to circa 24 million mainly due to increased waste capitalization approximately 8 million of non sustaining expenditure is planned for 2019 mainly covering work to raise the tsf 2018 exploration program the 2018 exploration program amounted to 4 million totaling approximately 27 800 meters of drilling focused mainly on open pit targets located along extensions of known deposits and on parallel trends and on the at depth potential of the north pit mineralization was confirmed at the extensions of several deposits including the mpn north pit satellite 3 west pit 5 and beta however the mineralization intercepted was low grade and lacked continuity and therefore little follow up drilling was done with a focus instead on testing other higher potential targets mineralization was confirmed at depth in the north pit however in the short term no follow up drilling is planned for this target as the potential resource in this area may not be suitable for open pit operations as such the focus remains on testing other open pit targets 2019 exploration program an exploration program of up to 2 million is being considered for 2019 with the aim of continuing to test targets located along extensions of known deposits and on parallel trends reserve resource evolution as shown in appendix 3 the variance in p p reserves and m i resources compared to the previous year mainly corresponds to mining depletion and an update in unit cost assumptions for the reserve calculation karma mine q4 vs q3 2018 insights production increased due to a significant increase in ore stacked following the end of the rainy season tonnes of ore mined increased as mining activities ramped up following the end of the rainy season activities focused exclusively on mining oxide ore from the kao pit mill throughput increased as operating conditions improved with increased stacker utilization recovery rates remained high due to the improved leach characteristics of the oxide ore stacked aisc improved as the overall operating costs decreased following the end of the rainy season and due to an increase in ounces sold mining unit costs decreased from 3 18 to 1 76 per tonne because of increased tonnages being mined following the wet season processing unit costs decreased from 8 46 to 7 41 per tonne due to higher stacked tonnes and lower reagent consumption for oxide material processed sustaining capital increased marginally from 1 0 million to 1 3 million due to spending on mining components non sustaining capital spend was consistent with q3 2018 with 8 3 million spent the q4 2018 costs were mainly related to pre stripping at the kao deposit as well as the resettlement costs associated to its development fy 2018 vs fy 2017 insights production increased

transitional ore sustaining costs are expected to total circa 5 million with the main spending related to the waste capitalization at north kao pit non sustaining expenditure is expected to be relatively flat at 24 million comprising mainly stacking line extension and lift preparation and lining and pre stripping for the north kao deposit 2018 exploration program the 2018 exploration program amounted to 3 million totaling approximately 23 600 meters of drilling focused mainly on yabonsgo and north kao resulting in the identification of a maiden indicated resource at the yabonsgo

totaling approximately 27 000 meters has been planned for 2019 with the aim of delineating near mill oxide targets mainly focused on testing the extension of the north kao deposit and the along strike and northern plunge extension of the yabonsgo deposit reserve resource evolution as shown in appendix 3 the variance in p p reserves and m i resources compared to the previous year corresponds to mining depletion and a decreased for the gg2 and kao main deposits following changes in estimation parameters which was partially offset by the addition of m i resources and p p reserves at the yabongso deposit ity mine heap leach operation q4 vs q3 2018 insights 2018 was guided to be a transition year for the heap leach operation with greater priority given to the cil construction activities particularly in the second half of the year as the main goal was to stack ore from lower grade stockpiles however ity s heap leach operation performed above expectations particularly in q4 2018 as mining was opportunistically conducted based on equipment availability and the good progress made on ity cil construction production remained flat as a decrease in stacked grade was offset by a higher recovery rate tonnes of ore mined decreased in line with the plan as mining activity for the heap leach decreased to prioritize the construction of the cil plant mining for the heap leach operation ceased in mid december ore stacked decreased as the quantity of ore mined decreased with lower grade stockpiles supplementing the stacked feed stacking at the heap leach operation ceased in mid december the stacked grade decreased as mining activity at the high grade bakatouo pit ceased for heap leach operations and low grade ore stockpiles were used recovery rates increased due to improved leach characteristics associated with the ore stacked from the bakatouo pit aisc decreased due to lower unit mining costs associated with reduced water pumping requirements as well as a lower strip ratio lower processing and g a costs and increased ounces of gold sold in the period mining unit costs decreased from 7 02 to 6 65 per tonne due to shorter haul distances as mining for the heap leach operations winds down processing unit costs decreased from 14 70 to 13 80 per tonne due to lower reagent usage sustaining capital decreased from 0 3 million to 0 07 million as the heap leach operation winds down there was no non sustaining capital spent in the quarter depreciation and depletion increased for the period due to accelerated depreciation taken on the heap leach assets as it nears the end of mine life fy 2018 vs fy 2017 insights record production was achieved due to significantly higher grades stacked from the bakatouo deposit and increased stacking aisc decreased due to

oz compared to 1 199 oz in 2017 both these amounts include the impact of the karma stream amounting to 23 750 ounces sold in 2018 and 20 000 in 2017 at 20 of spot prices royalties paid increased due to both greater gold sales and a higher realized gold price representing approximately 67 oz sold for 2018 compared to 59 oz for 2017 sustaining capital for continuing operations for 2018 increased compared to the corresponding period of 2017 due to the addition of houndé and an increase at agbaou which were offset by a decrease at ity as illustrated in the below table further details by assets

year higher realized gold prices and an increase in gold sold at ity which offset the decrease in revenue generated by agbaou non sustaining capital spending from continuing operations increased by 26 million in 2018 over 2017 mainly due to an increase at agbaou for waste capitalization activities and the addition of the houndé mine non sustaining exploration capital increased in line with endeavour s strategic objective of unlocking exploration value as expected there was a working capital cash inflow in q4 2018 amounting to 79 million reducing the total outflow to 10 million for the year the main components for the full year outflow were receivables were a 2018 outflow of 5 million the 2018 outflow primarily related to an increase in vat receivables at the burkina faso mine sites karma and houndé of 5 million and the recognition of 9 million for the current portion of the tabakoto sale receivable this was offset partly by a reduction in other receivable balances during the year across the corporation inventories were a 2018 outflow of 17 million relating primarily to a build up of stockpiles at houndé which totalled 29 million at year end this was offset by a decrease at ity where mining operations is winding down as well as karma where inventory levels are being reduced to optimised levels prepayments are a 2018 5 million inflow due to a prepayment for strategic spares at houndé that was in place at year end 2017 these were received in 2018 and are accounted for as part of consumable inventory trade and other payables are a 7 million inflow 2018 at year end there was a 12 million outflow at karma due to a change in supplier terms from last year and 13 million outflow in payables at agbaou which was the result of the site having a logistical issue in paying a key supplier in the prior period this was offset against an inflow in trade payables of 22 million across ity and houndé the changes in long term inventories is a new policy adopted by the group whereby stockpiled material that will not be processed within 12 months is treated as a non current asset the outflow in the year represents the build up of this newly classified item changes in long term assets relates to the recognition of the long term receivable for nsr on the sale of the tabakoto mine interest and financing fees paid increased due to the increase in debt outstanding related to the construction of houndé and ity cil the revenue protection program based on a collar with a floor at 1 300 oz and a ceiling of 1 500 oz generated a cash inflow net of the premium of 5 million in q4 2018 amounting to 6 million for the year growth project for 2018 was comprised mainly of 235m for the ity cil project 13m on tsf construction and other at houndé 11m on kalana 7m on aviation equipment purchased to reduce travel costs and improve efficiency 33m was received upon closing of the tabakoto sale in q4 2018 net of transaction fees while the 2017 outflow mainly relates to the purchase of an additional 25 stake in the ity mine which was netted against proceeded received from the nzema sale a foreign exchange loss mainly on the settlement of euro denominated supplier payments occurred because of a stronger us dollar 330 million was received in q1 2018 from the convertible notes issuance 280 million was repaid on the revolving credit facility rcf in q1 2018 while

since late january thousands of would be asylum applicants have been held up just outside of the u s border with mexico where they have been forced to wait their turn to speak to u s customs and border protection the growing humanitarian situation camps for migrants are overcrowded unhygienic and dangerous has renewed focus on mexican president andrés manuel lópez obrador s call for a central american marshall plan through which 30 billion would be channeled toward regional development in an effort to ease migration pressures lópez obrador popularly known as amlo has set a goal of funding the plan by may and u s president donald trump eager to halt immigration to the united states agreed to participate to the tune of 5 8 billion since late january thousands of would be asylum applicants have been held up just outside of the u s border with mexico where they have been forced to wait their turn to speak to u s customs and border protection the growing humanitarian situation camps for migrants are overcrowded unhygienic and dangerous has renewed focus on mexican president andrés manuel lópez obrador s call for a central american marshall plan through which 30 billion would be channeled toward regional development in an effort to ease migration pressures lópez obrador popularly known as amlo has set a goal of funding the plan by may and u s president donald trump eager to halt immigration to the united states agreed to participate to the tune of 5 8 billion addressing the root causes of migration insecurity violence and lack of opportunity makes sense both the united states and mexico should want to ensure that emigration is an option for central americans rather than a necessary step to a life of dignity however lópez obrador s strategy rests on a common misunderstanding of the realities of the original marshall plan namely it was not an infusion of cash that caused a european resurgence but a targeted investment that channeled and amplified an economic recovery that was already underway it did so by placing significant restraints on the policies of recipient countries prohibiting the nationalization of companies and mandating strict exchange rate controls balanced budgets and intrusive checks on national economic policy as a result the 17 billion nearly 200 billion in 2019 dollars that the united states invested in europe between 1948 and 1951 became a concerted effort to build resilient political and economic institutions that last to this day there are reasons to be skeptical that a lópez obrador trump partnership would do the same first both lópez obrador and trump have demonstrated disdain for the kinds of political institutions central america must bolster for his part lópez obrador reveres and patterns himself after the great revolutionaries of mexico s past who preferred to lead by imposition and knew nothing of checks and balances it is telling that one of his first major political maneuvers an attempt to address large scale petroleum theft involved placing the mexican armed forces in charge of combating corruption the move might have been crafted to signal his seriousness but it demonstrated that lópez obrador lacked the will to undertake the painstaking work of building strong and independent institutions that could effectively regulate industries and manage corruption in the long term indeed lópez obrador has centralized executive power at the expense of the judiciary and legislature run roughshod over the country s federal system by appointing loyal superdelegates to try to displace governors and mayors and engaged in a broader offensive against independent government institutions that pose a challenge to his accumulation of power by cutting their budgets and hollowing out their bureaucratic personnel trump too has a problematic relationship with political and judicial institutions he has personally attacked judges for decisions he disagreed with and for their ethnic heritage bemoaned the independence of the federal reserve and directed the fbi and the justice department away from investigations aimed at his advisors and toward political opponents such as former secretary of state hillary clinton trump s affinity for strongmen in ankara manila moscow and riyadh meanwhile is well documented it is doubtful that two leaders who have displayed such disregard for the importance of abiding by democratic norms and institutions would have the patience or the appreciation to correctly identify and make the right long term investments to support democracy in central america the price of getting it wrong is steep often more harmful than not sending aid at all in fact poorly conceptualized foreign aid can stymie the deepening of democracy by propping up bad actors and providing them with an economic lifeline to mask their lack of success on reform a second reason to doubt the viability of a central american marshall plan is that the united states has already committed billions of dollars in aid and favorable trade deals to central america with little macroeconomic growth to show for it the recent alliance for prosperity a scheme conceived in the wake of the 2014 unaccompanied minor crisis to which the united states gave 2 6 billion has produced few noteworthy economic accomplishments the united states has also promoted central american economic growth through free trade agreements since 2004 for example the dominican republic central america free trade agreement has granted most favored nation status to the dominican republic costa rica nicaragua el salvador guatemala and honduras according to the u s trade representative s office almost 80 percent of exports from the region enter the united states tariff free in short some of the most important policies for central american economic growth have already been in place for more than a decade yet growth and economic development remain stagnant due to factors like large scale migration insecurity and a stubbornly large informal sector for instance a recent wilson center report on innovation and productivity in the region noted that a latin american worker in the 1970s produced 82 percent of what a u s worker produced today that figure stands at 55 percent at least partially because central american nations have been unable to increase productivity and sustain economic growth remittances still represent about 15 percent of the region s gdp a final reason to doubt the success of a central american marshall plan is that the region lacks willing partners on the ground in the northern triangle made up of the countries from which most asylum seekers come to the united states many political leaders are engaged in democratic backsliding and serious corruption scandals in guatemala for example president jimmy morales is busy dismantling the international commission against impunity in guatemala known as cicig in spanish a u n led anti corruption body working with guatemalan prosecutors to uproot the vestiges of organized crime that have stubbornly clung to power since the country s civil war in honduras president juan orlando hernández remains in power after a highly disputed and potentially rigged election his brother tony hernández was arrested in miami where he was accused of working with some of the largest drug trafficking networks in central america and el salvador just elected a telegenic young president whom some observers have linked to the well known drug kingpin josé luis merino these figures are hardly the type to effectively collaborate with the united states and mexico turning the aid into more of a handout than a return on investment before world war ii most western european countries already had some experience with democracy and higher living standards the marshall plan helped get these societies back on their feet but high levels of human capital and development meant that the groundwork for success already existed as trump and lópez obrador are poised to discover restoring something that once existed and bringing something new into being are entirely different things trump and lópez obrador ought to be commended for their ambition if not for their correct reading of history foresight patience and follow through
gerald celente reveals triggers for world economic blowup gold breakout mike gleason it is my privilege now to welcome in gerald celente publisher of the renowned trends journal mr celente is perhaps most well known trends forecaster in the world and it s always a joy to speak with him mr celente thanks for the time again today and welcome back gerald celente oh thanks for having me on mike mike gleason well gerald the trends journal is forecasting economic 9 11 as one of the big trends for 2019 there are plenty of indicators which just support your thesis for a major slowdown debt levels both public and private have exploded china is slowing down and all the stimulus in europe has failed to generate results there higher interest rates are hurting everything from real estate to auto sales et cetera but none of this is reflected in the stock markets which are roaring higher once again it looks like the fed is up to its old tricks promising to stop the rate hikes they had planned and end the program for selling bonds the constant intervention of the fed has always been one of the major wildcards when trying to predict where things are headed in recent years what do you think can the central bankers kick the can one more time to avoid a recession or are they finally going to lose control in the months ahead gerald celente well i think you ve summed everything up pretty well in analyzing it and the general situation when we made that forecast of an economic 9 11 remember how trends for the new year go out in december in december we just saw the dow have its worst month since the great depression and all of a sudden on january 4th 2019 it all turned around what happened was the federal reserve chairman bent over to trump and he backtracked on his aggressive stance of 2018 where they raised interest rates four times and they were scheduled to raise them three to four more times in 2019 he said he would be patient in late january they said it again that they would be patient they were in no hurry raising interest rates that changed our forecast because what they ve done is they ve injected more monetary methadone into the bull to keep it running you can see what was happening when they were going to pull the needle out the bull was dying it was od ing already and now they just got it going once again and you mentioned wildcard and that s exactly why nobody could predict the future there are too many wildcards whether they re man made or made by mother nature well of course now i have to be proper and politically correct whether women made or made by father nature what happened was they played the wildcard and the fact is whether it was fear of a fed audit or just pressure from trump we listed all the times he called the fed loco and crazy and how disgusted he was with them throughout 2018 beginning in july until they did a backtrack so now what we re looking at mike it s the presidential reality show s already heating up and trump is going to do everything he can to keep the economy pumping along or i should say trumping along remember the cat s in the real estate business to his son in law the family the cushners it s real estate you mentioned about real estate prices going down i mean what happened in december we saw southern california home sales plunge 20 in december to the lowest pace in 11 years so when those interest rates got around 5 for a 30 year mortgage you could see the big reversal not only do we see the fed not raising interest rates in 2019 we could see them aggressively bringing them down if the economy starts to slow down they raised them nine times since 2015 they could lower them nine times mike gleason this year certainly has the potential to be one for the history books in europe we spoke when you were last with us in december about the yellow jacket protests in france they are ongoing and there is reason to think they may be a bigger deal than the conventional media is letting on it is possible that president macron may be forced out which would be quite a populous victory there should also be finally a resolution with regards to brexit in the months ahead what is your take on the events in europe gerald will the populous and anti eu forces be able to win this year or will establishment forces be able to fend off these attacks for a while longer yet gerald celente well they re doing the best to fend them off you mentioned macron and you had his popularity rating was down to 27 now it s moved back up a bit to a 32 they are really really doing everything they can to stop the protest from going you know with hypocrisy by the way in the way the media covers what s going on in venezuela when a few people were killed a week or so ago when they were trying to bring in that so called humanitarian aid and then you look what s going on in france and how many people have been killed and the violence with the rubber bullets being shot out at them and people losing their eyes and on and on and how the difference in the coverage is in france it s okay in venezuela it s terrible so we think what s going to happen in europe is they re going to do everything they can to suppress any kind of populous movements and we re going to see what happens with the elections coming up for the european parliament later this year and that s going to give us the indicator of how deeply the populous movement are moving in right now it s a war between those that want more globalism and those don t want to retain their culture their nationality and their ethnic identity mike gleason you touched on it there but how about venezuela gerald what is your take on what s happening there as the u s looks to exert some of its influence to overthrow the maduro regime and then let s also get your comments about venezuela not being able to get its gold back what do you make of events there gerald celente well again you know this is the perfect example of what america has been doing in central america for over a hundred years you could not be clearer than it s a coup attempt and i love the language they used by the way you know this guy guaido he all of a sudden declares himself and says i m the interim president of venezuela and of course we covered this very deeply in our trends journal that he was brought to the united states prior to that a number of times and this is an outright coup attempt in our november trends journal remember this didn t happen until january late january our november trends journal there as a keynote story it s called the triangle of death and we had forecasted that brazil colombia and argentina would form a triangle of death aimed at venezuela with the united states behind the movement and that s precisely what has happened that s what the trends journal is about you can t make this stuff up where you ve got a bunch of clowns out there talking about bringing democracy to venezuela how many times have i heard that bs in my life oh yeah you re going to do it in iraq right no no it was libya i got it syria assad has to go we need democracy one time after another it s all about oil if their major export was broccoli and not oil there d be no demands by america s presidents obama and bush to spill blood and destroy those oil rich sovereign nations that i named and the same thing about venezuela and if you don t believe me ask the clown that s playing our national security adviser john bolton quote we re in conversation with major american companies now it would make a difference if we could have american companies produce the oil in venezuela it would be good for the people of the united states end quote mike gleason it s kind of what it s all about it s always about oil just follow the oil and sure enough there you go conflict seems to surround it switching gears here a little bit gold and silver prices are certainly holding up well here given the rally in the stock markets and the relative strength in the us dollar it s hard to have too much confidence in the paper prices of metals as we ve talked about before there s been a too much evidence of rigging and cheating by the bullion banks with the tacit blessing of the regulators including the fed we don t think they can control the markets forever particularly the physical bullion markets there is an ongoing investigation by the department of justice into the metals rigging and the fbi is getting cooperation from a former jp morgan trader as well as the documents and recordings turned over by deutsche bank a couple of years ago and there are some civil class action suits pending attorneys there are watching the progress for the criminal investigation licking their chops so this is new territory please give us your thoughts if you would if you ve been following the story at all and then please tell us what you think generally about the metals markets here gerald gerald celente it will be like everything else you know what i mean look at the bankers that were convicted of fraud outright fraud five major banks did you see any heads roll did anything change nothing will change it ll come in and go out however what the central banks are doing as you well know is they bought more gold in 2018 than they did in a half century so they know this whole ponzi scheme of a 250 trillion debt bubble is going to explode the reality is no one knows when we can make the forecast based on the current events forming future trends but again what happened was out of nowhere the federal reserve chairman comes out on a day where the employment numbers come out on january 4th and we created over 300 000 jobs and it showed that the yearly increases of wages was the best in 10 years two reasons not to be patient with interest rates they should have raised them with that kind of data what i m saying mike is you never know what s going to bring this market down as we see it is a wildcard event that s what s going to do it something that you can t predict be it a war with well look at the war now you know the war talk going on and the bombing runs committed by pakistan and india what if those two nuclear armed countries go at it what happens if the push for war with iran that keeps heating up is ignited you ll see oil prices go 100 a barrel you kiss the markets and world economies goodbye so that s where gold comes in it s the safe haven asset i ve been on your show a lot of times and i ve been saying for i don t know how long that the bottom price of gold is 1 200 i said it all of 2018 i believe it hit 1 185 for a day or two and now it s over 1 300 an ounce we keep saying it has to break over 1 385 to gain strength and the breakout point is 1 450 i ve been saying that for nearly it s going on six years almost and it hasn t done that when it breaks over the 1 450 mark we believe it will spike to the 2 000 mark mike gleason getting back to something you touched on earlier with the federal reserve likely not looking to raise interest rates this year at all maybe even cutting when the markets sort of start to realize that that s what s happening is that maybe one of those kind of explosive situations for precious metals once the real interest rates actually turn negative gerald celente it ll put more cheap money into the system but it will be positive for gold because the more expensive that dollar gets the opportunity holding of course of gold becomes less attractive the cheaper the dollar the lower the dollar the lower interest rates the more attractive gold becomes again we don t see at this point despite the pressures going on globally with japan and europe and china and an economic slowdown we don t see a recession right now in the united states particularly because they are going to do everything they can to generate a moderately strong economy prior to the 2020 elections mike gleason well finally as we close here do you have any final thoughts for investors about any other trends that you may be watching that we perhaps didn t touch on then also anything else that you care to mention as we wrap up here today gerald celente well yeah the things to look at where the markets are also going of course are copper prices doctor copper it s called in the trade that means that copper is an indicator of the health of the global economy right now we re seeing copper having about a 12 increase this year it s still relatively low but it s up from july 2018 again at 12 hit this year and it s showing strength and china is one of the largest purchases of copper they get over 50 of the new stuff developed so it shows us that yes there s going to be a slowdown again but not a decline one of the big trends that we keep watching and we ve been on this one of the first with the trends journal and that s the whole cannabis trend this is just the beginning of it we re in 1933 and they just lifted prohibition and everybody s getting any alcohol business but this is even much bigger because not only the cannabis in terms of hemp being legalized and all the medical benefits of cannabis are going to be explored more and more as i say if the planet could feed us could it heal us the irony of all this by the way is the same criminals that criminalized it that ruined the lives of millions of people for smoking a joint to getting caught selling an ounce and throwing them in jail and three strikes they re out the millions when you add up the families that were destroyed probably the tens of millions if not hundreds of millions over the decades these are the same criminals now that are giving us the regulations to de legalize god s plant and of course the only reason this political mafia is involved in it is because they want their cut that s called taxes you have places like new jersey over here where they re going to put 42 an ounce tax on it it s a criminal operation and that s the only reason they re legalizing it should have always been legal but the reason they re legalizing it is just to get more money from taxes because we re talking about that debt bubble and you got one blowing up everywhere they need more money and will do anything they can to get it you re going to see this whole cannabis trend continuing to explode globally mike gleason well we ll leave it there for now gerald we really appreciate the time once again today and before we let you go please fill folks in on what s going on there at the trends journal and the trends research institute what they need know and how they can start getting the wonderful information that you put out there on a regular basis gerald celente well they can go to trendsjournal com and of course we put out the monthly trends journal trends alerts each week trends in the

northjersey lieutenant governor oliver senate president sweeney speaker coughlin majority leaders weinberg and greenwald minority leaders kean and bramnick and members of the 218th legislature former governors chief justice rabner judge grant members of the cabinet faith leaders honored guests friends and fellow new jerseyans our license plates say new jersey the garden state but even more than that new jersey is the middle class state we are all in this together and coming together is how we succeed so today i am presenting a budget that is a blueprint for how we continue to build a more secure and inclusive middle class in new jersey this budget is how we make real the promise of a stronger and fairer state that works for every family and it builds on the progress we have already made together we are paving the way for countless families like the family i grew up in who want nothing more than to move into the middle class and we are smoothing the path for those already there together just a month ago we put our state on a path to a 15 an hour minimum wage this path is the on ramp that more than one million new jerseyans will use to ultimately move into the middle class the economic activity they will power will make those already in the middle class more secure watch live phil murphy unveils nj budget nj tax increase coming phil murphy plans second push to raise rates on millionaires it s here best of bergen 2019 results announced but it s about more than just economics the new york times said it best the 15 minimum wage doesn t just improve lives it saves them it goes further a living wage is an antidepressant it is a sleep aid a diet a stress reliever it is a contraceptive preventing teenage pregnancy it prevents premature death it shields children from neglect if anyone in this chamber ever questions whether what we do matters simply think of the families striving to join the middle class those whose paths have been blocked because of a yawning racial wealth gap and the alice families working hard but falling behind and then look to this achievement or to this one two weeks ago we expanded paid family leave to make an even greater difference for families who need time off from work to welcome a new baby or care for a sick loved one and one week ago today workers who had never before had the ability to take a paid sick day finally began to enjoy this basic benefit so many of us take for granted together we are beginning to properly fund our public schools strengthening a public education engine that is the foundation for the middle class and at the same time providing much needed property tax relief together we are fundamentally redefining public education with greater access to pre k and by beginning to make community college tuition free these are landmark achievements in strengthening the middle class and making new jersey a national leader together we are making health insurance more affordable and finally funding planned parenthood steps that take some of the edge off the high costs of health care together we are rebuilding nj transit directly benefiting everyone who commutes to work and school and making our state more competitive together we are making real differences in the everyday lives of millions of people together we are making new jersey stronger and fairer for all of this i thank you but we must be clear where this journey started this administration and this legislature inherited a state hollowed out by eight years of wrong headed and short sighted decisions it was eight years of shutting out middle class new jersey families and shutting the door on those struggling to get there new jersey lagged the nation in economic growth and in creating jobs eleven credit downgrades drove up costs and pushed down our reputation critical infrastructure projects were abandoned nj transit was gutted and commuters were literally left behind public schools and pensions were underfunded year after year again and again new jersey s middle class paid the price of course we heard the word affordability a lot over those eight years but as with so many things over those years the rhetoric and the reality didn t connect affordability was only defined in narrow partisan terms for eight long years the politics of division failed new jersey just as the politics of division are today failing our nation today in new jersey we are climbing our way out of a deep hole but in new jersey we don t give up we just work harder so together let s get to work in this budget affordability is about the smart and honest investment of our resources where they will do the most good where they can create broad opportunity for many as opposed to just rewarding a privileged few where they can rebuild our middle class rather than milk it and affordability is about being good stewards of every taxpayer dollar and working together to find savings that no one had thought possible that is why this budget is rooted in over 1 1 billion in real and sustainable savings including nearly 800 million in public employee health benefit cost savings and another 200 million plus in departmental savings you heard that number right over 1 1 billion in real and sustainable savings much of these significant savings were achieved through cooperation with our public employees rather than through confrontation these savings were achieved through the power of working together these savings will allow us to take the steps we need to move new jersey forward growing up in our family the only way we could spend money is if we saved money i know a lot of new jerseyans understand that of course no one especially not me questions that taxes are a big piece in new jersey s affordability puzzle that is why slowing the growth of property taxes to a record low matters that is why our expansion of the earned income tax credit matters that is why restoring the homestead property tax benefit matters that is why tax fairness for middle class families seniors and small and medium sized businesses matters this budget continues us down this path but growing our economy and investing in the things that will make life better for our middle class and those who aspire to join it are equally important each of us came here to make things better to meet our responsibilities and to serve our constituents this is a chamber filled with good people with good intentions yet here we are paying the price for past years of pushing problems down a broken road that is why this blueprint for the middle class matters this budget is built upon four elements one doing the hard work to realize over 1 1 billion in sustainable savings two stabilizing new jersey s credit worthiness through responsible fiscal stewardship three maintaining and growing our investments in education infrastructure in particular nj transit and an innovation driven economy that reaches deep into every neighborhood four ensuring tax fairness for our middle class we must remember that each number we write into the budget is a face the face of one of millions of new jerseyans looking to us to put aside our differences to overcome our challenges several of these faces are here with us today guests of the lieutenant governor and the first lady they are committed to being part of a better future and they are the people this budget invests in among them are tawana watkins of east orange who is part of the new class of nj transit engineers and who will play a big part in once again making nj transit the envy of the nation lindenwold s aurelio sotelo is a finance student at rutgers camden thanks in part to the educational opportunity fund because of the eof aurelio is well on his way to achieving his dream of owning his own clothing company and stacey barrio lothrop and jans heinsohn of carbon22 an innovative medical device manufacturer which is taking root at the kearny point incubator space carbon22 is also the very first company to take advantage of the investment we are making in our startup culture through nj ignite the eda s collaborative workspace rent initiative in our work to reclaim our dominance in the innovation economy people like stacey and jans and companies like carbon22 will lead the charge their faces those of the other special guests with us today and the millions of others like them across our state are why the most important investment in this budget is in the middle class and in those who dream to join its ranks we are as committed to them as we are to our principles but as i have said before we can compromise on policy without compromising either our principles or our commitment to our people i understand the budget i am proposing today will not be identical to the one i will ultimately sign we will talk we will negotiate and we will compromise that is as it should be that is how our system works best we will have to make hard choices but that is different from false choices we need to be stronger and fairer we can t have economic progress without social progress and we can t have social progress without economic progress because when we remember that success and fairness are not mutually exclusive we can do big things last year our administration worked with our public employees to strike an agreement that is saving state and local taxpayers 500 million across two years while protecting the health care of the men and women of state and local government our educators and our police fire and ems first responders but that was not an end it was just a beginning and our conversations never stopped we continued to present new ideas to hear theirs and to talk as partners instead of as adversaries negotiations and progress flow from mutual trust they go nowhere when there is only mutual suspicion that s the old way that s the failed way and those days are over in total our budget contains roughly 800 million in real and lasting savings in the delivery of public employee health care in the coming fiscal year a 16 percent year over year decrease from the current budget importantly the reforms we have agreed upon and those we continue to work toward in good faith will allow our taxpayers to keep hundreds of millions of dollars in their pockets their impact on local and school budgets is also expected to deliver more than 400 million in property tax relief and it will save money for those who serve our state our communities and our schools while maintaining the high quality health care they deserve it will make new jersey more affordable across the board half of these savings we will be able to implement administratively while others will be realized through collective bargaining and the work of the plan design committees that craft the policies available to our public workforce our public workers are not the enemy they are our neighbors they are also taxpayers they are the heart of our middle class it is not pandering to stand with them it is doing our jobs we accomplished this with the same mindset in which we worked to save residents an average of more than nine percent on individual health care policies by protecting the affordable care act the aim isn t to offer lesser care it s to provide high quality care at a lower cost and we are doing that we are doing it without yelling threatening or calling people names and i will continue to work in partnership and in good faith with our partners in the public workforce on ways we can collectively ensure greater progress and greater relief for our taxpayers as i mentioned we have also identified another 200 million plus in departmental savings opportunities throughout the budget which we will apply this year i thank treasurer liz muoio and her team for their hard work work that has added up to over 1 1 billion in savings by anybody s standard over 1 1 billion in sustainable savings is real and substantial i also thank human services commissioner carole johnson for her knowledgeable leadership in finding an additional quarter of a billion dollars in recoverable medicaid funds plus millions more in other efficiencies that will allow us to maximize our federal dollars while protecting beneficiaries we are building a stronger fiscal house for new jersey we are replacing gimmicks with stability for example the projected surplus of the budget i signed last year was 765 million a vast improvement over prior budgets but through careful management and keeping an eye on every dollar we have grown our surplus by one third over the year and are now set to close fiscal 2019 with a surplus of over 1 billion this budget will grow our surplus even more in fiscal 2020 to nearly 1 2 billion i ask you to find the last time we had consecutive years of billion dollar plus surpluses last year i proposed a budget that significantly cut back on the use of one shots and this budget once again maintains that example one shot revenues are down to only 1 7 percent a decrease of one third over the current budget and half the average yearly amount across the prior administration and in this budget we are significantly curtailing fund diversions we are eliminating entirely the diversion from the affordable housing trust fund so lieutenant governor oliver and her team at dca can do more to ensure the accessibility of safe and affordable housing and through the clean energy fund we will put more than 70 million back to work to make critical investments in our clean energy economy this shows how far we have already come in fixing the structural problems that years of past fiscal decisions had created and we know there s still work to do especially with our surplus we must remain vigilant to safeguard these funds and not to view them as just extra cash laying around to be raided for any number of programs or projects no matter how well intentioned reducing our reliance on one shots and diversions means greater year over year fiscal predictability and reliability but the real value is that they allow us to make the investments we need to make new jersey a stronger and fairer state for every family and reaching these fiscal mileposts will not go unnoticed by the rating agencies with whom i will visit later this week and whose decisions greatly impact our future sustainability because with a more sustainable fiscal future we can make more sustainable investments in our future last year we began the process of finally fulfilling our obligations to our public schools increasing our investment in k through 12 classrooms by more than 350 million let there be no doubt this investment is one reason why 2018 saw the lowest increase in the average statewide property tax bill not just in the last nine years but on record and the work to modernize our formula to meet the on the ground needs of districts today led by senate president sweeney is ensuring that school funding dollars are more efficiently and effectively following our children we also increased investment in high quality pre k programs today in 64 additional school districts more than 4 400 three and four year olds now have access to pre k they lacked just one year ago this budget maintains this commitment to our kids and our public schools starting with an additional 206 million to ramp up to the full k through 12 formula funding there is 68 million more to not only maintain but to expand pre k these commitments mean we can continue to be a national leader in the delivery of high quality public education and our budget continues our computer science for all initiative this gives more high school students especially minority students access to an advanced computer science course so they can earn college credits and industry credentials and go on to increase the diversity of our innovation economy our budget includes 5 million more for tuition aid grants and an additional 2 25 million to support the educational opportunity fund this is the 50th year in which accomplished students like aurelio are benefitting from eof it is the greatest legislative legacy of former governor tom kean who sponsored the original bill let s ensure it continues to write new chapters for our students last year we inaugurated a grant program that in concert with eof and tag and other available aid is helping 13 000 qualified students to pursue an associate s degree tuition free at one of 13 community colleges this budget will grow our investment in community college opportunity grants to reach a total of 18 000 students in the 2019 2020 academic year at every community college and more of them will be pursuing a degree full time and our budget looks to a new way to help our four year public colleges and universities we propose 20 million in new formula driven aid based on what is needed to ensure the best outcomes for all students and reflect the diversity of our state this is a first step in funding higher education through fairness and not politics it is part of the broader state plan which higher education secretary zakiya smith ellis will be releasing in the near future last year we enhanced and refocused our investment in workforce development and apprenticeship programs we awarded grants expanding opportunities for thousands more to learn and master the skills that will lead them into good paying family supporting careers this budget continues this commitment our blueprint for the middle class through its investments in education and workforce development will continue to make a more competitive and more affordable new jersey in our current budget we restored direct property tax relief to thousands of middle class families who were cut off by the prior administration i thank speaker coughlin for leading the fight to restore this relief and this budget maintains our commitment with 283 million in direct property tax relief for our middle class families and seniors in a state with an unmatched location and a regional economy built on moving people and goods there is no higher priority than fixing nj transit we owe our commuters a transportation system that makes their lives smoother rather than harder they deserve a system that is safer more reliable and customer oriented our current budget began the long process of turning around an agency that had been hollowed out by years of disinvestment and mismanagement leaving customers as second class citizens and hurting our economic well being last year commuters were spared a fare hike and if we pass this budget s investment there won t be one this year either through our current investment nj transit has moved ahead with procurement of new rail cars and buses to build capacity and relieve overcrowding we are rebuilding the gutted ranks of rail engineers and bus operators needed to keep the lines running and i cannot wait to welcome our first class of new train engineers later this spring because of our investment nj transit was able to push forward to meet the federal government s december 31 2018 deadline on positive train control a feat almost no one outside our administration and i mean almost no one thought possible on friday i signed legislation that expands a commuter tax cut allowing more commuters to directly benefit from pre tax savings accounts to pay for their rail or bus fares this can keep hundreds of extra dollars a year in their pockets nj transit has also reached agreement with amtrak on millions of dollars worth of back payments they are now working together on joint investments in infrastructure and renovations at new york penn station that will improve the customer experience this budget maintains all of this progress it will provide 407 million in general fund support to nj transit this 100 million increase will replace 75 million in fund diversions in addition to providing 25 million in new direct funding this keeps nj transit on the path to being the turnaround story of the nation it keeps rebuilding the ranks of professionals needed to keep our system running and most importantly it keeps improving service to our commuters it s this simple an investment in nj transit is a direct investment in our economy our business environment and our commuters it s an investment in hard working people like tawana and in the people she will take to and from work every day and we will responsibly invest in meeting our pension obligation and continuing the progress to bringing the pension funds back to health with a second straight record setting payment this year s totaling 3 8 billion our pension obligation like many of our challenges nj transit and school funding among others did not spring up overnight it grew because decisions made by both parties allowed it to grow i know this particular challenge well perhaps better than many i studied it in depth more than a decade ago when governor codey asked me to chair the first pension and benefits task force but the message our task force put forward nearly a decade and a half ago is just as true today we cannot look for quick outs or easy fixes because they simply don t exist it took us years to get to this point and it will take years of good faith efforts efforts that must include our public employees our educators and our first responders to successfully get past it and that is why we are making this record 3 8 billion pension contribution to keep our promises and to meet our fiscal challenges head on we must ensure that our commitment to affordable high quality health care and evidence based policymaking remains as strong as ever our current budget restored funding for planned parenthood and women s health care as a result of that investment over 10 000 more patients both women and men were served in 2018 compared to 2017 at the national level president trump and his administration are continuing their assault on title x putting the health of millions of women across the country at risk for starkly partisan and political reasons in new jersey we re showing the better way forward last year four clinics were added where residents could receive family planning services and an entirely new health clinic opened at rutgers newark patients gained access to 8 000 additional hours to receive vital services including potentially life saving cancer screenings more than 40 critical staffing roles were filled more than 80 000 std tests were provided free of charge and today more women have access to long acting birth control this budget maintains our commitment so we can continue to build upon this progress over the past year the first lady has taken on the growing racial disparity in maternal health alongside twelve of our commissioners leaders in our health care and faith communities legislators and many others i want to give a special shout out to health commissioner dr shereef elnahal children and families commissioner christine norbut beyer and human services commissioner carole johnson the facts are jarring new jersey ranks 45th in the nation yes 45th in maternal death rate nearly double the national average even worse 60 percent of new mothers who die because of complications from childbirth are women of color a black baby in new jersey is three times more likely to die in his or her first year of life than a white baby the widest racial disparity in the nation to combat this the first lady and our administration inaugurated the nurturenj campaign to raise awareness of our maternal and child mortality crisis and to develop a comprehensive interagency plan this budget will support these efforts to bring together more experts and residents in the search for lasting solutions and our budget will provide 1 million through our medicaid program for doulas who play a critical role in reversing these statistics medicaid covers 40 percent of all childbirths in new jersey and these babies deserve a chance as much as any other these babies are far from the only vulnerable new jerseyans this budget seeks to help while we will maintain our commitment to emergency aid for homeless residents this budget also recognizes that money alone is not an answer to this vexing problem we ll take a broader approach through the creation of an office of homelessness initiatives in the department of community affairs to act as a hub for more strategic and coordinated efforts where we use data and analytics to create and implement solutions to address people s housing needs especially among our veterans from prevention to emergencies to permanency and our budget will provide critical resources to allow individuals with both developmental disabilities and mental health challenges to thrive in their communities in addition we will do more to alleviate the costs pushed onto our medicaid system by large employers who leave workers to rely on medicaid instead of offering a health care plan this budget will ask employers with 50 or more employees on medicaid to pay a small corporate responsibility fee of 150 for each one of these employees they should share in the burden of paying for their employees care rather than leaving it to the rest of us and our budget will maintain our commitment to working families in other ways including continuing the child and dependent care tax credit we passed together last year which is benefitting more than 74 000 new jersey families we are continuing to support smart compassionate and just prisoner reentry efforts i commend governor mcgreevey and our faith based communities for all their great work on the front lines our budget this year will increase investments in programs proven to decrease rates of recidivism and will support the ability of incarcerated individuals to continue their education so they can find second chances when they come back to our communities in every respect we commit to reforming our criminal justice system for the better in our current budget we set aside 100 million to directly combat our opioid epidemic through carefully designed programs and thoughtful data driven analysis to put resources where they are most needed we are ever mindful that the opioid epidemic was ravaging our cities long before it made headlines this budget maintains our commitment and proposes increasing fees on opioid drug distributors and manufacturers to help support our fight against the opioid epidemic other states red and blue alike are taking similar steps let s join them let s send a clear message that we should be working together to end our national addiction to opioids not to continue feeding it as we look to building the new jersey of the future we must be mindful of our ability to continue these investments well into our future in my budget address one year ago i called for us to enact a new way in which we provide the tax incentives that help us attract and retain businesses i spoke directly to it in october when i released my economic master plan and i reiterated this call in my state of the state address seven weeks ago there are many opinions on our current system of open ended corporate tax breaks but here is a simple fact the potential impact of past corporate tax breaks on corporate business tax collection in the coming fiscal year surpasses 1 billion and it will remain over 1 billion annually for at least the next three fiscal years the simple fact is that we are currently obligated i repeat obligated to corporate tax breaks totaling 11 billion through at least fiscal year 2031 and lest we forget for all of these incentives before this administration took office new jersey was 42nd in job growth and 49th in wage growth while key investments in education and infrastructure like a tunnel under the hudson river never happened even under a capped program yes we would see some loss in corporate business tax revenues but it would be predictable and sustainable we can provide strategic incentives without hurting our ability to reinvest in the things that bolster our economy and help our businesses like education and property tax relief workforce development and nj transit that tunnel to new york would be nice too tax incentives transparent and accountable smartly devised and strategically deployed have a vital role to play in a focused economic growth plan they are a needed step in undertaking structural fiscal reform and restoring middle class affordability i am a pro growth progressive i want the world s biggest and best technology clean energy and life sciences companies to come and expand here but i am even more committed to the next generation being born and growing here reforming how we jumpstart job creation needs to be about both creating jobs and more wisely investing taxpayer money the companies dreaming of making it big in new jersey like carbon22 deserve our support we must be smart and strategic about how we encourage new startups and entrepreneurs about how we nurture more businesses owned by women by persons of color and by veterans and about how we lead the world in clean energy solutions like offshore wind we can reclaim and dominate all aspects of the innovation economy that s why we need innovative incentive programs to be pro business in the 21st century you need to be agile and creative just like the businesses we want to grow our current programs expire june 30 along with the current budget i ask you to join me now with renewed purpose in creating the new suite of smart focused and capped incentive programs we need to boost our people and our economy without compromising our ability to invest in our people and our economy we can do this on a parallel track as we work on our final budget and we can enact them together in fact we must because together we enacted a responsibly balanced budget that invests in our people and our infrastructure and which stands for fairness for our middle class new jersey s priorities stand proudly in contrast with those of president trump and his administration right now across the state countless middle class families are doing their taxes and wondering where the tax cuts they were promised by president trump and his enablers went many barely felt the impact in their take home pay and now they re getting less back in their refunds many others because of their now limited state and local tax deduction are actually paying more our new congressional delegation along with those from our neighboring states democrats and republicans alike announced legislation to restore the full middle class salt deduction by in part simply asking the wealthiest to go back to paying what they paid in 2017 i commend their efforts and give them my full support and ten days ago i joined with governors from other states adversely impacted by the salt cap to announce our concerted efforts to have it reversed but while those efforts are ongoing and while our middle class is trying to figure out where their tax relief went those at the very top are shouldering less and less of their fair share of the tax burden that s the opposite of tax fairness let s work together to apply the millionaire s tax to every millionaire by doing so we can do more to relieve the burden on middle class taxpayers and senior citizens who are taking it on the chin from the trump administration s tax scam let s be absolutely clear this is not a tax that will be paid by anyone in the middle class period full stop but it is revenue that is necessary to strengthen and expand the middle class as i have underscored we have done a great deal of work to save money 1 1 billion in this budget in order to address our fiscal challenges and we must have the same commitment to support the middle class and those aspiring to get there our taxpayers overwhelmingly support this across party lines and across the state we should listen to them and do this together and we know they also support our work to legalize and regulate adult use marijuana i thank senate president sweeney speaker coughlin and senator scutari for their partnership i know we re not across the finish line yet but we are closer than ever before most importantly this is the right step for eliminating decades old and persistent racial and social inequities but it is also our chance to create an entirely new state based industry with the potential to create thousands of good paying jobs expand opportunities for minority business owners and jumpstart billions of dollars in new economic activity i will only sign this if it expunges the records of those who have been put through our criminal justice system for prior marijuana offenses this is an unfinished item from last year s to do list let s commit to completing this effort together and i renew my call for us to increase the fees for gun licenses and handgun permits it was long past time we did this last year when we took so many steps to restore our standing as a national leader in gun safety and it s even more past time today our gun fees were set in 1966 when governor richard hughes worked in this building it s now 2019 it is actually cheaper to get a permit to purchase a handgun 2 than it is to get a dog license in many of our communities this is what s needed to support the efforts of attorney general gurbir grewal our state troopers and county and local law enforcement to fight crime and track gun violence and to combat the trafficking of illegal guns into our state in 2018 roughly 80 percent of guns used in the commission of a crime came from out of state as with our other efforts i know the people of new jersey will support us this budget isn t about getting us through the next year it s about putting ourselves on a trajectory to be that new jersey we want to be in ten years we all must be part of this no one should be pointing from the sidelines and leaving the hard work of governing to others we must all find ourselves with some dirt on our uniforms it was one of our greatest presidents teddy roosevelt who told us the credit goes to those actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood i am proud of everyone who over the course of this past year has joined me in rolling up their sleeves and jumping into the arena to help with the hard work of restoring new jersey senate president sweeney and assembly speaker coughlin many of you seated here in this chamber our cabinet and team led by lieutenant governor oliver elected officials all across our state mayors council members boards of education county officials faith leaders the men and women of organized labor first responders our active duty military and our veterans our lgbtq community business leaders educators communities of color countless advocates and the thousands of everyday new jerseyans i have met all across our state this really is about achieving big things by working together and i thank you this budget continues our work to invest in the single most consequential asset in new jersey our people this budget doubles down on the middle class and all those dreaming to get there just as my family was when i was growing up this budget is the blueprint for building this new jersey it is about value for our middle class it is about our middle class values we are the middle class state and when we listen to both the dreams and the concerns of our middle class families we can find the answers that help all of new jersey move forward because when people prosper new jersey prospers when families can move forward new jersey moves forward when seniors are more secure new jersey is more secure when we foster a better future for young people young people will build their future here when we open our doors to innovative new businesses those businesses will power our economy my vision for new jersey has never wavered we need to continue to build an economy that works from the middle class out and from the bottom up we need an economy that embraces the future but stays true to the values of rewarding hard work creating opportunity and providing the tools people need to succeed thank you may god continue to bless the great people and state of new jersey and the united states of america
northjersey lieutenant governor oliver senate president sweeney speaker coughlin majority leaders weinberg and greenwald minority leaders kean and bramnick and members of the 218th legislature former governors chief justice rabner judge grant members of the cabinet faith leaders honored guests friends and fellow new jerseyans our license plates say new jersey the garden state but even more than that new jersey is the middle class state we are all in this together and coming together is how we succeed so today i am presenting a budget that is a blueprint for how we continue to build a more secure and inclusive middle class in new jersey this budget is how we make real the promise of a stronger and fairer state that works for every family and it builds on the progress we have already made together we are paving the way for countless families like the family i grew up in who want nothing more than to move into the middle class and we are smoothing the path for those already there together just a month ago we put our state on a path to a 15 an hour minimum wage this path is the on ramp that more than one million new jerseyans will use to ultimately move into the middle class the economic activity they will power will make those already in the middle class more secure watch live phil murphy unveils nj budget nj tax increase coming phil murphy plans second push to raise rates on millionaires it s here best of bergen 2019 results announced but it s about more than just economics the new york times said it best the 15 minimum wage doesn t just improve lives it saves them it goes further a living wage is an antidepressant it is a sleep aid a diet a stress reliever it is a contraceptive preventing teenage pregnancy it prevents premature death it shields children from neglect if anyone in this chamber ever questions whether what we do matters simply think of the families striving to join the middle class those whose paths have been blocked because of a yawning racial wealth gap and the alice families working hard but falling behind and then look to this achievement or to this one two weeks ago we expanded paid family leave to make an even greater difference for families who need time off from work to welcome a new baby or care for a sick loved one and one week ago today workers who had never before had the ability to take a paid sick day finally began to enjoy this basic benefit so many of us take for granted together we are beginning to properly fund our public schools strengthening a public education engine that is the foundation for the middle class and at the same time providing much needed property tax relief together we are fundamentally redefining public education with greater access to pre k and by beginning to make community college tuition free these are landmark achievements in strengthening the middle class and making new jersey a national leader together we are making health insurance more affordable and finally funding planned parenthood steps that take some of the edge off the high costs of health care together we are rebuilding nj transit directly benefiting everyone who commutes to work and school and making our state more competitive together we are making real differences in the everyday lives of millions of people together we are making new jersey stronger and fairer for all of this i thank you but we must be clear where this journey started this administration and this legislature inherited a state hollowed out by eight years of wrong headed and short sighted decisions it was eight years of shutting out middle class new jersey families and shutting the door on those struggling to get there new jersey lagged the nation in economic growth and in creating jobs eleven credit downgrades drove up costs and pushed down our reputation critical infrastructure projects were abandoned nj transit was gutted and commuters were literally left behind public schools and pensions were underfunded year after year again and again new jersey s middle class paid the price of course we heard the word affordability a lot over those eight years but as with so many things over those years the rhetoric and the reality didn t connect affordability was only defined in narrow partisan terms for eight long years the politics of division failed new jersey just as the politics of division are today failing our nation today in new jersey we are climbing our way out of a deep hole but in new jersey we don t give up we just work harder so together let s get to work in this budget affordability is about the smart and honest investment of our resources where they will do the most good where they can create broad opportunity for many as opposed to just rewarding a privileged few where they can rebuild our middle class rather than milk it and affordability is about being good stewards of every taxpayer dollar and working together to find savings that no one had thought possible that is why this budget is rooted in over 1 1 billion in real and sustainable savings including nearly 800 million in public employee health benefit cost savings and another 200 million plus in departmental savings you heard that number right over 1 1 billion in real and sustainable savings much of these significant savings were achieved through cooperation with our public employees rather than through confrontation these savings were achieved through the power of working together these savings will allow us to take the steps we need to move new jersey forward growing up in our family the only way we could spend money is if we saved money i know a lot of new jerseyans understand that of course no one especially not me questions that taxes are a big piece in new jersey s affordability puzzle that is why slowing the growth of property taxes to a record low matters that is why our expansion of the earned income tax credit matters that is why restoring the homestead property tax benefit matters that is why tax fairness for middle class families seniors and small and medium sized businesses matters this budget continues us down this path but growing our economy and investing in the things that will make life better for our middle class and those who aspire to join it are equally important each of us came here to make things better to meet our responsibilities and to serve our constituents this is a chamber filled with good people with good intentions yet here we are paying the price for past years of pushing problems down a broken road that is why this blueprint for the middle class matters this budget is built upon four elements one doing the hard work to realize over 1 1 billion in sustainable savings two stabilizing new jersey s credit worthiness through responsible fiscal stewardship three maintaining and growing our investments in education infrastructure in particular nj transit and an innovation driven economy that reaches deep into every neighborhood four ensuring tax fairness for our middle class we must remember that each number we write into the budget is a face the face of one of millions of new jerseyans looking to us to put aside our differences to overcome our challenges several of these faces are here with us today guests of the lieutenant governor and the first lady they are committed to being part of a better future and they are the people this budget invests in among them are tawana watkins of east orange who is part of the new class of nj transit engineers and who will play a big part in once again making nj transit the envy of the nation lindenwold s aurelio sotelo is a finance student at rutgers camden thanks in part to the educational opportunity fund because of the eof aurelio is well on his way to achieving his dream of owning his own clothing company and stacey barrio lothrop and jans heinsohn of carbon22 an innovative medical device manufacturer which is taking root at the kearny point incubator space carbon22 is also the very first company to take advantage of the investment we are making in our startup culture through nj ignite the eda s collaborative workspace rent initiative in our work to reclaim our dominance in the innovation economy people like stacey and jans and companies like carbon22 will lead the charge their faces those of the other special guests with us today and the millions of others like them across our state are why the most important investment in this budget is in the middle class and in those who dream to join its ranks we are as committed to them as we are to our principles but as i have said before we can compromise on policy without compromising either our principles or our commitment to our people i understand the budget i am proposing today will not be identical to the one i will ultimately sign we will talk we will negotiate and we will compromise that is as it should be that is how our system works best we will have to make hard choices but that is different from false choices we need to be stronger and fairer we can t have economic progress without social progress and we can t have social progress without economic progress because when we remember that success and fairness are not mutually exclusive we can do big things last year our administration worked with our public employees to strike an agreement that is saving state and local taxpayers 500 million across two years while protecting the health care of the men and women of state and local government our educators and our police fire and ems first responders but that was not an end it was just a beginning and our conversations never stopped we continued to present new ideas to hear theirs and to talk as partners instead of as adversaries negotiations and progress flow from mutual trust they go nowhere when there is only mutual suspicion that s the old way that s the failed way and those days are over in total our budget contains roughly 800 million in real and lasting savings in the delivery of public employee health care in the coming fiscal year a 16 percent year over year decrease from the current budget importantly the reforms we have agreed upon and those we continue to work toward in good faith will allow our taxpayers to keep hundreds of millions of dollars in their pockets their impact on local and school budgets is also expected to deliver more than 400 million in property tax relief and it will save money for those who serve our state our communities and our schools while maintaining the high quality health care they deserve it will make new jersey more affordable across the board half of these savings we will be able to implement administratively while others will be realized through collective bargaining and the work of the plan design committees that craft the policies available to our public workforce our public workers are not the enemy they are our neighbors they are also taxpayers they are the heart of our middle class it is not pandering to stand with them it is doing our jobs we accomplished this with the same mindset in which we worked to save residents an average of more than nine percent on individual health care policies by protecting the affordable care act the aim isn t to offer lesser care it s to provide high quality care at a lower cost and we are doing that we are doing it without yelling threatening or calling people names and i will continue to work in partnership and in good faith with our partners in the public workforce on ways we can collectively ensure greater progress and greater relief for our taxpayers as i mentioned we have also identified another 200 million plus in departmental savings opportunities throughout the budget which we will apply this year i thank treasurer liz muoio and her team for their hard work work that has added up to over 1 1 billion in savings by anybody s standard over 1 1 billion in sustainable savings is real and substantial i also thank human services commissioner carole johnson for her knowledgeable leadership in finding an additional quarter of a billion dollars in recoverable medicaid funds plus millions more in other efficiencies that will allow us to maximize our federal dollars while protecting beneficiaries we are building a stronger fiscal house for new jersey we are replacing gimmicks with stability for example the projected surplus of the budget i signed last year was 765 million a vast improvement over prior budgets but through careful management and keeping an eye on every dollar we have grown our surplus by one third over the year and are now set to close fiscal 2019 with a surplus of over 1 billion this budget will grow our surplus even more in fiscal 2020 to nearly 1 2 billion i ask you to find the last time we had consecutive years of billion dollar plus surpluses last year i proposed a budget that significantly cut back on the use of one shots and this budget once again maintains that example one shot revenues are down to only 1 7 percent a decrease of one third over the current budget and half the average yearly amount across the prior administration and in this budget we are significantly curtailing fund diversions we are eliminating entirely the diversion from the affordable housing trust fund so lieutenant governor oliver and her team at dca can do more to ensure the accessibility of safe and affordable housing and through the clean energy fund we will put more than 70 million back to work to make critical investments in our clean energy economy this shows how far we have already come in fixing the structural problems that years of past fiscal decisions had created and we know there s still work to do especially with our surplus we must remain vigilant to safeguard these funds and not to view them as just extra cash laying around to be raided for any number of programs or projects no matter how well intentioned reducing our reliance on one shots and diversions means greater year over year fiscal predictability and reliability but the real value is that they allow us to make the investments we need to make new jersey a stronger and fairer state for every family and reaching these fiscal mileposts will not go unnoticed by the rating agencies with whom i will visit later this week and whose decisions greatly impact our future sustainability because with a more sustainable fiscal future we can make more sustainable investments in our future last year we began the process of finally fulfilling our obligations to our public schools increasing our investment in k through 12 classrooms by more than 350 million let there be no doubt this investment is one reason why 2018 saw the lowest increase in the average statewide property tax bill not just in the last nine years but on record and the work to modernize our formula to meet the on the ground needs of districts today led by senate president sweeney is ensuring that school funding dollars are more efficiently and effectively following our children we also increased investment in high quality pre k programs today in 64 additional school districts more than 4 400 three and four year olds now have access to pre k they lacked just one year ago this budget maintains this commitment to our kids and our public schools starting with an additional 206 million to ramp up to the full k through 12 formula funding there is 68 million more to not only maintain but to expand pre k these commitments mean we can continue to be a national leader in the delivery of high quality public education and our budget continues our computer science for all initiative this gives more high school students especially minority students access to an advanced computer science course so they can earn college credits and industry credentials and go on to increase the diversity of our innovation economy our budget includes 5 million more for tuition aid grants and an additional 2 25 million to support the educational opportunity fund this is the 50th year in which accomplished students like aurelio are benefitting from eof it is the greatest legislative legacy of former governor tom kean who sponsored the original bill let s ensure it continues to write new chapters for our students last year we inaugurated a grant program that in concert with eof and tag and other available aid is helping 13 000 qualified students to pursue an associate s degree tuition free at one of 13 community colleges this budget will grow our investment in community college opportunity grants to reach a total of 18 000 students in the 2019 2020 academic year at every community college and more of them will be pursuing a degree full time and our budget looks to a new way to help our four year public colleges and universities we propose 20 million in new formula driven aid based on what is needed to ensure the best outcomes for all students and reflect the diversity of our state this is a first step in funding higher education through fairness and not politics it is part of the broader state plan which higher education secretary zakiya smith ellis will be releasing in the near future last year we enhanced and refocused our investment in workforce development and apprenticeship programs we awarded grants expanding opportunities for thousands more to learn and master the skills that will lead them into good paying family supporting careers this budget continues this commitment our blueprint for the middle class through its investments in education and workforce development will continue to make a more competitive and more affordable new jersey in our current budget we restored direct property tax relief to thousands of middle class families who were cut off by the prior administration i thank speaker coughlin for leading the fight to restore this relief and this budget maintains our commitment with 283 million in direct property tax relief for our middle class families and seniors in a state with an unmatched location and a regional economy built on moving people and goods there is no higher priority than fixing nj transit we owe our commuters a transportation system that makes their lives smoother rather than harder they deserve a system that is safer more reliable and customer oriented our current budget began the long process of turning around an agency that had been hollowed out by years of disinvestment and mismanagement leaving customers as second class citizens and hurting our economic well being last year commuters were spared a fare hike and if we pass this budget s investment there won t be one this year either through our current investment nj transit has moved ahead with procurement of new rail cars and buses to build capacity and relieve overcrowding we are rebuilding the gutted ranks of rail engineers and bus operators needed to keep the lines running and i cannot wait to welcome our first class of new train engineers later this spring because of our investment nj transit was able to push forward to meet the federal government s december 31 2018 deadline on positive train control a feat almost no one outside our administration and i mean almost no one thought possible on friday i signed legislation that expands a commuter tax cut allowing more commuters to directly benefit from pre tax savings accounts to pay for their rail or bus fares this can keep hundreds of extra dollars a year in their pockets nj transit has also reached agreement with amtrak on millions of dollars worth of back payments they are now working together on joint investments in infrastructure and renovations at new york penn station that will improve the customer experience this budget maintains all of this progress it will provide 407 million in general fund support to nj transit this 100 million increase will replace 75 million in fund diversions in addition to providing 25 million in new direct funding this keeps nj transit on the path to being the turnaround story of the nation it keeps rebuilding the ranks of professionals needed to keep our system running and most importantly it keeps improving service to our commuters it s this simple an investment in nj transit is a direct investment in our economy our business environment and our commuters it s an investment in hard working people like tawana and in the people she will take to and from work every day and we will responsibly invest in meeting our pension obligation and continuing the progress to bringing the pension funds back to health with a second straight record setting payment this year s totaling 3 8 billion our pension obligation like many of our challenges nj transit and school funding among others did not spring up overnight it grew because decisions made by both parties allowed it to grow i know this particular challenge well perhaps better than many i studied it in depth more than a decade ago when governor codey asked me to chair the first pension and benefits task force but the message our task force put forward nearly a decade and a half ago is just as true today we cannot look for quick outs or easy fixes because they simply don t exist it took us years to get to this point and it will take years of good faith efforts efforts that must include our public employees our educators and our first responders to successfully get past it and that is why we are making this record 3 8 billion pension contribution to keep our promises and to meet our fiscal challenges head on we must ensure that our commitment to affordable high quality health care and evidence based policymaking remains as strong as ever our current budget restored funding for planned parenthood and women s health care as a result of that investment over 10 000 more patients both women and men were served in 2018 compared to 2017 at the national level president trump and his administration are continuing their assault on title x putting the health of millions of women across the country at risk for starkly partisan and political reasons in new jersey we re showing the better way forward last year four clinics were added where residents could receive family planning services and an entirely new health clinic opened at rutgers newark patients gained access to 8 000 additional hours to receive vital services including potentially life saving cancer screenings more than 40 critical staffing roles were filled more than 80 000 std tests were provided free of charge and today more women have access to long acting birth control this budget maintains our commitment so we can continue to build upon this progress over the past year the first lady has taken on the growing racial disparity in maternal health alongside twelve of our commissioners leaders in our health care and faith communities legislators and many others i want to give a special shout out to health commissioner dr shereef elnahal children and families commissioner christine norbut beyer and human services commissioner carole johnson the facts are jarring new jersey ranks 45th in the nation yes 45th in maternal death rate nearly double the national average even worse 60 percent of new mothers who die because of complications from childbirth are women of color a black baby in new jersey is three times more likely to die in his or her first year of life than a white baby the widest racial disparity in the nation to combat this the first lady and our administration inaugurated the nurturenj campaign to raise awareness of our maternal and child mortality crisis and to develop a comprehensive interagency plan this budget will support these efforts to bring together more experts and residents in the search for lasting solutions and our budget will provide 1 million through our medicaid program for doulas who play a critical role in reversing these statistics medicaid covers 40 percent of all childbirths in new jersey and these babies deserve a chance as much as any other these babies are far from the only vulnerable new jerseyans this budget seeks to help while we will maintain our commitment to emergency aid for homeless residents this budget also recognizes that money alone is not an answer to this vexing problem we ll take a broader approach through the creation of an office of homelessness initiatives in the department of community affairs to act as a hub for more strategic and coordinated efforts where we use data and analytics to create and implement solutions to address people s housing needs especially among our veterans from prevention to emergencies to permanency and our budget will provide critical resources to allow individuals with both developmental disabilities and mental health challenges to thrive in their communities in addition we will do more to alleviate the costs pushed onto our medicaid system by large employers who leave workers to rely on medicaid instead of offering a health care plan this budget will ask employers with 50 or more employees on medicaid to pay a small corporate responsibility fee of 150 for each one of these employees they should share in the burden of paying for their employees care rather than leaving it to the rest of us and our budget will maintain our commitment to working families in other ways including continuing the child and dependent care tax credit we passed together last year which is benefitting more than 74 000 new jersey families we are continuing to support smart compassionate and just prisoner reentry efforts i commend governor mcgreevey and our faith based communities for all their great work on the front lines our budget this year will increase investments in programs proven to decrease rates of recidivism and will support the ability of incarcerated individuals to continue their education so they can find second chances when they come back to our communities in every respect we commit to reforming our criminal justice system for the better in our current budget we set aside 100 million to directly combat our opioid epidemic through carefully designed programs and thoughtful data driven analysis to put resources where they are most needed we are ever mindful that the opioid epidemic was ravaging our cities long before it made headlines this budget maintains our commitment and proposes increasing fees on opioid drug distributors and manufacturers to help support our fight against the opioid epidemic other states red and blue alike are taking similar steps let s join them let s send a clear message that we should be working together to end our national addiction to opioids not to continue feeding it as we look to building the new jersey of the future we must be mindful of our ability to continue these investments well into our future in my budget address one year ago i called for us to enact a new way in which we provide the tax incentives that help us attract and retain businesses i spoke directly to it in october when i released my economic master plan and i reiterated this call in my state of the state address seven weeks ago there are many opinions on our current system of open ended corporate tax breaks but here is a simple fact the potential impact of past corporate tax breaks on corporate business tax collection in the coming fiscal year surpasses 1 billion and it will remain over 1 billion annually for at least the next three fiscal years the simple fact is that we are currently obligated i repeat obligated to corporate tax breaks totaling 11 billion through at least fiscal year 2031 and lest we forget for all of these incentives before this administration took office new jersey was 42nd in job growth and 49th in wage growth while key investments in education and infrastructure like a tunnel under the hudson river never happened even under a capped program yes we would see some loss in corporate business tax revenues but it would be predictable and sustainable we can provide strategic incentives without hurting our ability to reinvest in the things that bolster our economy and help our businesses like education and property tax relief workforce development and nj transit that tunnel to new york would be nice too tax incentives transparent and accountable smartly devised and strategically deployed have a vital role to play in a focused economic growth plan they are a needed step in undertaking structural fiscal reform and restoring middle class affordability i am a pro growth progressive i want the world s biggest and best technology clean energy and life sciences companies to come and expand here but i am even more committed to the next generation being born and growing here reforming how we jumpstart job creation needs to be about both creating jobs and more wisely investing taxpayer money the companies dreaming of making it big in new jersey like carbon22 deserve our support we must be smart and strategic about how we encourage new startups and entrepreneurs about how we nurture more businesses owned by women by persons of color and by veterans and about how we lead the world in clean energy solutions like offshore wind we can reclaim and dominate all aspects of the innovation economy that s why we need innovative incentive programs to be pro business in the 21st century you need to be agile and creative just like the businesses we want to grow our current programs expire june 30 along with the current budget i ask you to join me now with renewed purpose in creating the new suite of smart focused and capped incentive programs we need to boost our people and our economy without compromising our ability to invest in our people and our economy we can do this on a parallel track as we work on our final budget and we can enact them together in fact we must because together we enacted a responsibly balanced budget that invests in our people and our infrastructure and which stands for fairness for our middle class new jersey s priorities stand proudly in contrast with those of president trump and his administration right now across the state countless middle class families are doing their taxes and wondering where the tax cuts they were promised by president trump and his enablers went many barely felt the impact in their take home pay and now they re getting less back in their refunds many others because of their now limited state and local tax deduction are actually paying more our new congressional delegation along with those from our neighboring states democrats and republicans alike announced legislation to restore the full middle class salt deduction by in part simply asking the wealthiest to go back to paying what they paid in 2017 i commend their efforts and give them my full support and ten days ago i joined with governors from other states adversely impacted by the salt cap to announce our concerted efforts to have it reversed but while those efforts are ongoing and while our middle class is trying to figure out where their tax relief went those at the very top are shouldering less and less of their fair share of the tax burden that s the opposite of tax fairness let s work together to apply the millionaire s tax to every millionaire by doing so we can do more to relieve the burden on middle class taxpayers and senior citizens who are taking it on the chin from the trump administration s tax scam let s be absolutely clear this is not a tax that will be paid by anyone in the middle class period full stop but it is revenue that is necessary to strengthen and expand the middle class as i have underscored we have done a great deal of work to save money 1 1 billion in this budget in order to address our fiscal challenges and we must have the same commitment to support the middle class and those aspiring to get there our taxpayers overwhelmingly support this across party lines and across the state we should listen to them and do this together and we know they also support our work to legalize and regulate adult use marijuana i thank senate president sweeney speaker coughlin and senator scutari for their partnership i know we re not across the finish line yet but we are closer than ever before most importantly this is the right step for eliminating decades old and persistent racial and social inequities but it is also our chance to create an entirely new state based industry with the potential to create thousands of good paying jobs expand opportunities for minority business owners and jumpstart billions of dollars in new economic activity i will only sign this if it expunges the records of those who have been put through our criminal justice system for prior marijuana offenses this is an unfinished item from last year s to do list let s commit to completing this effort together and i renew my call for us to increase the fees for gun licenses and handgun permits it was long past time we did this last year when we took so many steps to restore our standing as a national leader in gun safety and it s even more past time today our gun fees were set in 1966 when governor richard hughes worked in this building it s now 2019 it is actually cheaper to get a permit to purchase a handgun 2 than it is to get a dog license in many of our communities this is what s needed to support the efforts of attorney general gurbir grewal our state troopers and county and local law enforcement to fight crime and track gun violence and to combat the trafficking of illegal guns into our state in 2018 roughly 80 percent of guns used in the commission of a crime came from out of state as with our other efforts i know the people of new jersey will support us this budget isn t about getting us through the next year it s about putting ourselves on a trajectory to be that new jersey we want to be in ten years we all must be part of this no one should be pointing from the sidelines and leaving the hard work of governing to others we must all find ourselves with some dirt on our uniforms it was one of our greatest presidents teddy roosevelt who told us the credit goes to those actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood i am proud of everyone who over the course of this past year has joined me in rolling up their sleeves and jumping into the arena to help with the hard work of restoring new jersey senate president sweeney and assembly speaker coughlin many of you seated here in this chamber our cabinet and team led by lieutenant governor oliver elected officials all across our state mayors council members boards of education county officials faith leaders the men and women of organized labor first responders our active duty military and our veterans our lgbtq community business leaders educators communities of color countless advocates and the thousands of everyday new jerseyans i have met all across our state this really is about achieving big things by working together and i thank you this budget continues our work to invest in the single most consequential asset in new jersey our people this budget doubles down on the middle class and all those dreaming to get there just as my family was when i was growing up this budget is the blueprint for building this new jersey it is about value for our middle class it is about our middle class values we are the middle class state and when we listen to both the dreams and the concerns of our middle class families we can find the answers that help all of new jersey move forward because when people prosper new jersey prospers when families can move forward new jersey moves forward when seniors are more secure new jersey is more secure when we foster a better future for young people young people will build their future here when we open our doors to innovative new businesses those businesses will power our economy my vision for new jersey has never wavered we need to continue to build an economy that works from the middle class out and from the bottom up we need an economy that embraces the future but stays true to the values of rewarding hard work creating opportunity and providing the tools people need to succeed thank you may god continue to bless the great people and state of new jersey and the united states of america

in operation will remain unchanged no locality should take any measure that increases the burden on small and micro enterprises when reforming their collection systems or require on their own that long standing arrears be paid off in a lump sum including the cut in the social security contribution rate total tax cuts this year would amount to 2 trillion yuan us 298 billion li said analysts have

and risk prevention are the focus of this year analysts at morgan stanley believe that in practise the government s fiscal leeway will be larger than indicated by the official budget deficit target

northjersey lieutenant governor oliver senate president sweeney speaker coughlin majority leaders weinberg and greenwald minority leaders kean and bramnick and members of the 218th legislature former governors chief justice rabner judge grant members of the cabinet faith leaders honored guests friends and fellow new jerseyans our license plates say new jersey the garden state but even more than that new jersey is the middle class state we are all in this together and coming together is how we succeed so today i am presenting a budget that is a blueprint for how we continue to build a more secure and inclusive middle class in new jersey this budget is how we make real the promise of a stronger and fairer state that works for every family and it builds on the progress we have already made together we are paving the way for countless families like the family i grew up in who want nothing more than to move into the middle class and we are smoothing the path for those already there together just a month ago we put our state on a path to a 15 an hour minimum wage this path is the on ramp that more than one million new jerseyans will use to ultimately move into the middle class the economic activity they will power will make those already in the middle class more secure watch live phil murphy unveils nj budget nj tax increase coming phil murphy plans second push to raise rates on millionaires it s here best of bergen 2019 results announced but it s about more than just economics the new york times said it best the 15 minimum wage doesn t just improve lives it saves them it goes further a living wage is an antidepressant it is a sleep aid a diet a stress reliever it is a contraceptive preventing teenage pregnancy it prevents premature death it shields children from neglect if anyone in this chamber ever questions whether what we do matters simply think of the families striving to join the middle class those whose paths have been blocked because of a yawning racial wealth gap and the alice families working hard but falling behind and then look to this achievement or to this one two weeks ago we expanded paid family leave to make an even greater difference for families who need time off from work to welcome a new baby or care for a sick loved one and one week ago today workers who had never before had the ability to take a paid sick day finally began to enjoy this basic benefit so many of us take for granted together we are beginning to properly fund our public schools strengthening a public education engine that is the foundation for the middle class and at the same time providing much needed property tax relief together we are fundamentally redefining public education with greater access to pre k and by beginning to make community college tuition free these are landmark achievements in strengthening the middle class and making new jersey a national leader together we are making health insurance more affordable and finally funding planned parenthood steps that take some of the edge off the high costs of health care together we are rebuilding nj transit directly benefiting everyone who commutes to work and school and making our state more competitive together we are making real differences in the everyday lives of millions of people together we are making new jersey stronger and fairer for all of this i thank you but we must be clear where this journey started this administration and this legislature inherited a state hollowed out by eight years of wrong headed and short sighted decisions it was eight years of shutting out middle class new jersey families and shutting the door on those struggling to get there new jersey lagged the nation in economic growth and in creating jobs eleven credit downgrades drove up costs and pushed down our reputation critical infrastructure projects were abandoned nj transit was gutted and commuters were literally left behind public schools and pensions were underfunded year after year again and again new jersey s middle class paid the price of course we heard the word affordability a lot over those eight years but as with so many things over those years the rhetoric and the reality didn t connect affordability was only defined in narrow partisan terms for eight long years the politics of division failed new jersey just as the politics of division are today failing our nation today in new jersey we are climbing our way out of a deep hole but in new jersey we don t give up we just work harder so together let s get to work in this budget affordability is about the smart and honest investment of our resources where they will do the most good where they can create broad opportunity for many as opposed to just rewarding a privileged few where they can rebuild our middle class rather than milk it and affordability is about being good stewards of every taxpayer dollar and working together to find savings that no one had thought possible that is why this budget is rooted in over 1 1 billion in real and sustainable savings including nearly 800 million in public employee health benefit cost savings and another 200 million plus in departmental savings you heard that number right over 1 1 billion in real and sustainable savings much of these significant savings were achieved through cooperation with our public employees rather than through confrontation these savings were achieved through the power of working together these savings will allow us to take the steps we need to move new jersey forward growing up in our family the only way we could spend money is if we saved money i know a lot of new jerseyans understand that of course no one especially not me questions that taxes are a big piece in new jersey s affordability puzzle that is why slowing the growth of property taxes to a record low matters that is why our expansion of the earned income tax credit matters that is why restoring the homestead property tax benefit matters that is why tax fairness for middle class families seniors and small and medium sized businesses matters this budget continues us down this path but growing our economy and investing in the things that will make life better for our middle class and those who aspire to join it are equally important each of us came here to make things better to meet our responsibilities and to serve our constituents this is a chamber filled with good people with good intentions yet here we are paying the price for past years of pushing problems down a broken road that is why this blueprint for the middle class matters this budget is built upon four elements one doing the hard work to realize over 1 1 billion in sustainable savings two stabilizing new jersey s credit worthiness through responsible fiscal stewardship three maintaining and growing our investments in education infrastructure in particular nj transit and an innovation driven economy that reaches deep into every neighborhood four ensuring tax fairness for our middle class we must remember that each number we write into the budget is a face the face of one of millions of new jerseyans looking to us to put aside our differences to overcome our challenges several of these faces are here with us today guests of the lieutenant governor and the first lady they are committed to being part of a better future and they are the people this budget invests in among them are tawana watkins of east orange who is part of the new class of nj transit engineers and who will play a big part in once again making nj transit the envy of the nation lindenwold s aurelio sotelo is a finance student at rutgers camden thanks in part to the educational opportunity fund because of the eof aurelio is well on his way to achieving his dream of owning his own clothing company and stacey barrio lothrop and jans heinsohn of carbon22 an innovative medical device manufacturer which is taking root at the kearny point incubator space carbon22 is also the very first company to take advantage of the investment we are making in our startup culture through nj ignite the eda s collaborative workspace rent initiative in our work to reclaim our dominance in the innovation economy people like stacey and jans and companies like carbon22 will lead the charge their faces those of the other special guests with us today and the millions of others like them across our state are why the most important investment in this budget is in the middle class and in those who dream to join its ranks we are as committed to them as we are to our principles but as i have said before we can compromise on policy without compromising either our principles or our commitment to our people i understand the budget i am proposing today will not be identical to the one i will ultimately sign we will talk we will negotiate and we will compromise that is as it should be that is how our system works best we will have to make hard choices but that is different from false choices we need to be stronger and fairer we can t have economic progress without social progress and we can t have social progress without economic progress because when we remember that success and fairness are not mutually exclusive we can do big things last year our administration worked with our public employees to strike an agreement that is saving state and local taxpayers 500 million across two years while protecting the health care of the men and women of state and local government our educators and our police fire and ems first responders but that was not an end it was just a beginning and our conversations never stopped we continued to present new ideas to hear theirs and to talk as partners instead of as adversaries negotiations and progress flow from mutual trust they go nowhere when there is only mutual suspicion that s the old way that s the failed way and those days are over in total our budget contains roughly 800 million in real and lasting savings in the delivery of public employee health care in the coming fiscal year a 16 percent year over year decrease from the current budget importantly the reforms we have agreed upon and those we continue to work toward in good faith will allow our taxpayers to keep hundreds of millions of dollars in their pockets their impact on local and school budgets is also expected to deliver more than 400 million in property tax relief and it will save money for those who serve our state our communities and our schools while maintaining the high quality health care they deserve it will make new jersey more affordable across the board half of these savings we will be able to implement administratively while others will be realized through collective bargaining and the work of the plan design committees that craft the policies available to our public workforce our public workers are not the enemy they are our neighbors they are also taxpayers they are the heart of our middle class it is not pandering to stand with them it is doing our jobs we accomplished this with the same mindset in which we worked to save residents an average of more than nine percent on individual health care policies by protecting the affordable care act the aim isn t to offer lesser care it s to provide high quality care at a lower cost and we are doing that we are doing it without yelling threatening or calling people names and i will continue to work in partnership and in good faith with our partners in the public workforce on ways we can collectively ensure greater progress and greater relief for our taxpayers as i mentioned we have also identified another 200 million plus in departmental savings opportunities throughout the budget which we will apply this year i thank treasurer liz muoio and her team for their hard work work that has added up to over 1 1 billion in savings by anybody s standard over 1 1 billion in sustainable savings is real and substantial i also thank human services commissioner carole johnson for her knowledgeable leadership in finding an additional quarter of a billion dollars in recoverable medicaid funds plus millions more in other efficiencies that will allow us to maximize our federal dollars while protecting beneficiaries we are building a stronger fiscal house for new jersey we are replacing gimmicks with stability for example the projected surplus of the budget i signed last year was 765 million a vast improvement over prior budgets but through careful management and keeping an eye on every dollar we have grown our surplus by one third over the year and are now set to close fiscal 2019 with a surplus of over 1 billion this budget will grow our surplus even more in fiscal 2020 to nearly 1 2 billion i ask you to find the last time we had consecutive years of billion dollar plus surpluses last year i proposed a budget that significantly cut back on the use of one shots and this budget once again maintains that example one shot revenues are down to only 1 7 percent a decrease of one third over the current budget and half the average yearly amount across the prior administration and in this budget we are significantly curtailing fund diversions we are eliminating entirely the diversion from the affordable housing trust fund so lieutenant governor oliver and her team at dca can do more to ensure the accessibility of safe and affordable housing and through the clean energy fund we will put more than 70 million back to work to make critical investments in our clean energy economy this shows how far we have already come in fixing the structural problems that years of past fiscal decisions had created and we know there s still work to do especially with our surplus we must remain vigilant to safeguard these funds and not to view them as just extra cash laying around to be raided for any number of programs or projects no matter how well intentioned reducing our reliance on one shots and diversions means greater year over year fiscal predictability and reliability but the real value is that they allow us to make the investments we need to make new jersey a stronger and fairer state for every family and reaching these fiscal mileposts will not go unnoticed by the rating agencies with whom i will visit later this week and whose decisions greatly impact our future sustainability because with a more sustainable fiscal future we can make more sustainable investments in our future last year we began the process of finally fulfilling our obligations to our public schools increasing our investment in k through 12 classrooms by more than 350 million let there be no doubt this investment is one reason why 2018 saw the lowest increase in the average statewide property tax bill not just in the last nine years but on record and the work to modernize our formula to meet the on the ground needs of districts today led by senate president sweeney is ensuring that school funding dollars are more efficiently and effectively following our children we also increased investment in high quality pre k programs today in 64 additional school districts more than 4 400 three and four year olds now have access to pre k they lacked just one year ago this budget maintains this commitment to our kids and our public schools starting with an additional 206 million to ramp up to the full k through 12 formula funding there is 68 million more to not only maintain but to expand pre k these commitments mean we can continue to be a national leader in the delivery of high quality public education and our budget continues our computer science for all initiative this gives more high school students especially minority students access to an advanced computer science course so they can earn college credits and industry credentials and go on to increase the diversity of our innovation economy our budget includes 5 million more for tuition aid grants and an additional 2 25 million to support the educational opportunity fund this is the 50th year in which accomplished students like aurelio are benefitting from eof it is the greatest legislative legacy of former governor tom kean who sponsored the original bill let s ensure it continues to write new chapters for our students last year we inaugurated a grant program that in concert with eof and tag and other available aid is helping 13 000 qualified students to pursue an associate s degree tuition free at one of 13 community colleges this budget will grow our investment in community college opportunity grants to reach a total of 18 000 students in the 2019 2020 academic year at every community college and more of them will be pursuing a degree full time and our budget looks to a new way to help our four year public colleges and universities we propose 20 million in new formula driven aid based on what is needed to ensure the best outcomes for all students and reflect the diversity of our state this is a first step in funding higher education through fairness and not politics it is part of the broader state plan which higher education secretary zakiya smith ellis will be releasing in the near future last year we enhanced and refocused our investment in workforce development and apprenticeship programs we awarded grants expanding opportunities for thousands more to learn and master the skills that will lead them into good paying family supporting careers this budget continues this commitment our blueprint for the middle class through its investments in education and workforce development will continue to make a more competitive and more affordable new jersey in our current budget we restored direct property tax relief to thousands of middle class families who were cut off by the prior administration i thank speaker coughlin for leading the fight to restore this relief and this budget maintains our commitment with 283 million in direct property tax relief for our middle class families and seniors in a state with an unmatched location and a regional economy built on moving people and goods there is no higher priority than fixing nj transit we owe our commuters a transportation system that makes their lives smoother rather than harder they deserve a system that is safer more reliable and customer oriented our current budget began the long process of turning around an agency that had been hollowed out by years of disinvestment and mismanagement leaving customers as second class citizens and hurting our economic well being last year commuters were spared a fare hike and if we pass this budget s investment there won t be one this year either through our current investment nj transit has moved ahead with procurement of new rail cars and buses to build capacity and relieve overcrowding we are rebuilding the gutted ranks of rail engineers and bus operators needed to keep the lines running and i cannot wait to welcome our first class of new train engineers later this spring because of our investment nj transit was able to push forward to meet the federal government s december 31 2018 deadline on positive train control a feat almost no one outside our administration and i mean almost no one thought possible on friday i signed legislation that expands a commuter tax cut allowing more commuters to directly benefit from pre tax savings accounts to pay for their rail or bus fares this can keep hundreds of extra dollars a year in their pockets nj transit has also reached agreement with amtrak on millions of dollars worth of back payments they are now working together on joint investments in infrastructure and renovations at new york penn station that will improve the customer experience this budget maintains all of this progress it will provide 407 million in general fund support to nj transit this 100 million increase will replace 75 million in fund diversions in addition to providing 25 million in new direct funding this keeps nj transit on the path to being the turnaround story of the nation it keeps rebuilding the ranks of professionals needed to keep our system running and most importantly it keeps improving service to our commuters it s this simple an investment in nj transit is a direct investment in our economy our business environment and our commuters it s an investment in hard working people like tawana and in the people she will take to and from work every day and we will responsibly invest in meeting our pension obligation and continuing the progress to bringing the pension funds back to health with a second straight record setting payment this year s totaling 3 8 billion our pension obligation like many of our challenges nj transit and school funding among others did not spring up overnight it grew because decisions made by both parties allowed it to grow i know this particular challenge well perhaps better than many i studied it in depth more than a decade ago when governor codey asked me to chair the first pension and benefits task force but the message our task force put forward nearly a decade and a half ago is just as true today we cannot look for quick outs or easy fixes because they simply don t exist it took us years to get to this point and it will take years of good faith efforts efforts that must include our public employees our educators and our first responders to successfully get past it and that is why we are making this record 3 8 billion pension contribution to keep our promises and to meet our fiscal challenges head on we must ensure that our commitment to affordable high quality health care and evidence based policymaking remains as strong as ever our current budget restored funding for planned parenthood and women s health care as a result of that investment over 10 000 more patients both women and men were served in 2018 compared to 2017 at the national level president trump and his administration are continuing their assault on title x putting the health of millions of women across the country at risk for starkly partisan and political reasons in new jersey we re showing the better way forward last year four clinics were added where residents could receive family planning services and an entirely new health clinic opened at rutgers newark patients gained access to 8 000 additional hours to receive vital services including potentially life saving cancer screenings more than 40 critical staffing roles were filled more than 80 000 std tests were provided free of charge and today more women have access to long acting birth control this budget maintains our commitment so we can continue to build upon this progress over the past year the first lady has taken on the growing racial disparity in maternal health alongside twelve of our commissioners leaders in our health care and faith communities legislators and many others i want to give a special shout out to health commissioner dr shereef elnahal children and families commissioner christine norbut beyer and human services commissioner carole johnson the facts are jarring new jersey ranks 45th in the nation yes 45th in maternal death rate nearly double the national average even worse 60 percent of new mothers who die because of complications from childbirth are women of color a black baby in new jersey is three times more likely to die in his or her first year of life than a white baby the widest racial disparity in the nation to combat this the first lady and our administration inaugurated the nurturenj campaign to raise awareness of our maternal and child mortality crisis and to develop a comprehensive interagency plan this budget will support these efforts to bring together more experts and residents in the search for lasting solutions and our budget will provide 1 million through our medicaid program for doulas who play a critical role in reversing these statistics medicaid covers 40 percent of all childbirths in new jersey and these babies deserve a chance as much as any other these babies are far from the only vulnerable new jerseyans this budget seeks to help while we will maintain our commitment to emergency aid for homeless residents this budget also recognizes that money alone is not an answer to this vexing problem we ll take a broader approach through the creation of an office of homelessness initiatives in the department of community affairs to act as a hub for more strategic and coordinated efforts where we use data and analytics to create and implement solutions to address people s housing needs especially among our veterans from prevention to emergencies to permanency and our budget will provide critical resources to allow individuals with both developmental disabilities and mental health challenges to thrive in their communities in addition we will do more to alleviate the costs pushed onto our medicaid system by large employers who leave workers to rely on medicaid instead of offering a health care plan this budget will ask employers with 50 or more employees on medicaid to pay a small corporate responsibility fee of 150 for each one of these employees they should share in the burden of paying for their employees care rather than leaving it to the rest of us and our budget will maintain our commitment to working families in other ways including continuing the child and dependent care tax credit we passed together last year which is benefitting more than 74 000 new jersey families we are continuing to support smart compassionate and just prisoner reentry efforts i commend governor mcgreevey and our faith based communities for all their great work on the front lines our budget this year will increase investments in programs proven to decrease rates of recidivism and will support the ability of incarcerated individuals to continue their education so they can find second chances when they come back to our communities in every respect we commit to reforming our criminal justice system for the better in our current budget we set aside 100 million to directly combat our opioid epidemic through carefully designed programs and thoughtful data driven analysis to put resources where they are most needed we are ever mindful that the opioid epidemic was ravaging our cities long before it made headlines this budget maintains our commitment and proposes increasing fees on opioid drug distributors and manufacturers to help support our fight against the opioid epidemic other states red and blue alike are taking similar steps let s join them let s send a clear message that we should be working together to end our national addiction to opioids not to continue feeding it as we look to building the new jersey of the future we must be mindful of our ability to continue these investments well into our future in my budget address one year ago i called for us to enact a new way in which we provide the tax incentives that help us attract and retain businesses i spoke directly to it in october when i released my economic master plan and i reiterated this call in my state of the state address seven weeks ago there are many opinions on our current system of open ended corporate tax breaks but here is a simple fact the potential impact of past corporate tax breaks on corporate business tax collection in the coming fiscal year surpasses 1 billion and it will remain over 1 billion annually for at least the next three fiscal years the simple fact is that we are currently obligated i repeat obligated to corporate tax breaks totaling 11 billion through at least fiscal year 2031 and lest we forget for all of these incentives before this administration took office new jersey was 42nd in job growth and 49th in wage growth while key investments in education and infrastructure like a tunnel under the hudson river never happened even under a capped program yes we would see some loss in corporate business tax revenues but it would be predictable and sustainable we can provide strategic incentives without hurting our ability to reinvest in the things that bolster our economy and help our businesses like education and property tax relief workforce development and nj transit that tunnel to new york would be nice too tax incentives transparent and accountable smartly devised and strategically deployed have a vital role to play in a focused economic growth plan they are a needed step in undertaking structural fiscal reform and restoring middle class affordability i am a pro growth progressive i want the world s biggest and best technology clean energy and life sciences companies to come and expand here but i am even more committed to the next generation being born and growing here reforming how we jumpstart job creation needs to be about both creating jobs and more wisely investing taxpayer money the companies dreaming of making it big in new jersey like carbon22 deserve our support we must be smart and strategic about how we encourage new startups and entrepreneurs about how we nurture more businesses owned by women by persons of color and by veterans and about how we lead the world in clean energy solutions like offshore wind we can reclaim and dominate all aspects of the innovation economy that s why we need innovative incentive programs to be pro business in the 21st century you need to be agile and creative just like the businesses we want to grow our current programs expire june 30 along with the current budget i ask you to join me now with renewed purpose in creating the new suite of smart focused and capped incentive programs we need to boost our people and our economy without compromising our ability to invest in our people and our economy we can do this on a parallel track as we work on our final budget and we can enact them together in fact we must because together we enacted a responsibly balanced budget that invests in our people and our infrastructure and which stands for fairness for our middle class new jersey s priorities stand proudly in contrast with those of president trump and his administration right now across the state countless middle class families are doing their taxes and wondering where the tax cuts they were promised by president trump and his enablers went many barely felt the impact in their take home pay and now they re getting less back in their refunds many others because of their now limited state and local tax deduction are actually paying more our new congressional delegation along with those from our neighboring states democrats and republicans alike announced legislation to restore the full middle class salt deduction by in part simply asking the wealthiest to go back to paying what they paid in 2017 i commend their efforts and give them my full support and ten days ago i joined with governors from other states adversely impacted by the salt cap to announce our concerted efforts to have it reversed but while those efforts are ongoing and while our middle class is trying to figure out where their tax relief went those at the very top are shouldering less and less of their fair share of the tax burden that s the opposite of tax fairness let s work together to apply the millionaire s tax to every millionaire by doing so we can do more to relieve the burden on middle class taxpayers and senior citizens who are taking it on the chin from the trump administration s tax scam let s be absolutely clear this is not a tax that will be paid by anyone in the middle class period full stop but it is revenue that is necessary to strengthen and expand the middle class as i have underscored we have done a great deal of work to save money 1 1 billion in this budget in order to address our fiscal challenges and we must have the same commitment to support the middle class and those aspiring to get there our taxpayers overwhelmingly support this across party lines and across the state we should listen to them and do this together and we know they also support our work to legalize and regulate adult use marijuana i thank senate president sweeney speaker coughlin and senator scutari for their partnership i know we re not across the finish line yet but we are closer than ever before most importantly this is the right step for eliminating decades old and persistent racial and social inequities but it is also our chance to create an entirely new state based industry with the potential to create thousands of good paying jobs expand opportunities for minority business owners and jumpstart billions of dollars in new economic activity i will only sign this if it expunges the records of those who have been put through our criminal justice system for prior marijuana offenses this is an unfinished item from last year s to do list let s commit to completing this effort together and i renew my call for us to increase the fees for gun licenses and handgun permits it was long past time we did this last year when we took so many steps to restore our standing as a national leader in gun safety and it s even more past time today our gun fees were set in 1966 when governor richard hughes worked in this building it s now 2019 it is actually cheaper to get a permit to purchase a handgun 2 than it is to get a dog license in many of our communities this is what s needed to support the efforts of attorney general gurbir grewal our state troopers and county and local law enforcement to fight crime and track gun violence and to combat the trafficking of illegal guns into our state in 2018 roughly 80 percent of guns used in the commission of a crime came from out of state as with our other efforts i know the people of new jersey will support us this budget isn t about getting us through the next year it s about putting ourselves on a trajectory to be that new jersey we want to be in ten years we all must be part of this no one should be pointing from the sidelines and leaving the hard work of governing to others we must all find ourselves with some dirt on our uniforms it was one of our greatest presidents teddy roosevelt who told us the credit goes to those actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood i am proud of everyone who over the course of this past year has joined me in rolling up their sleeves and jumping into the arena to help with the hard work of restoring new jersey senate president sweeney and assembly speaker coughlin many of you seated here in this chamber our cabinet and team led by lieutenant governor oliver elected officials all across our state mayors council members boards of education county officials faith leaders the men and women of organized labor first responders our active duty military and our veterans our lgbtq community business leaders educators communities of color countless advocates and the thousands of everyday new jerseyans i have met all across our state this really is about achieving big things by working together and i thank you this budget continues our work to invest in the single most consequential asset in new jersey our people this budget doubles down on the middle class and all those dreaming to get there just as my family was when i was growing up this budget is the blueprint for building this new jersey it is about value for our middle class it is about our middle class values we are the middle class state and when we listen to both the dreams and the concerns of our middle class families we can find the answers that help all of new jersey move forward because when people prosper new jersey prospers when families can move forward new jersey moves forward when seniors are more secure new jersey is more secure when we foster a better future for young people young people will build their future here when we open our doors to innovative new businesses those businesses will power our economy my vision for new jersey has never wavered we need to continue to build an economy that works from the middle class out and from the bottom up we need an economy that embraces the future but stays true to the values of rewarding hard work creating opportunity and providing the tools people need to succeed thank you may god continue to bless the great people and state of new jersey and the united states of america
president donald j trump delivers the state of the union address as vice president mike pence left and speaker of the house nancy pelosi react at the capitol in washington dc us 5 february 2019 photo epa efe doug mills pool if the trends of the past year and economists expectations hold true trade data to be released wednesday will show the u s s deficit in goods and services with the world topped 600 billion in 2018 that means trump s presidency will have seen the u s trade shortfall the main metric by which he judges countries to be winning or losing grow by more than 100 billion put another way by trump s own benchmark the u s is 20 percent worse off than it was at the end of 2016 just before he took office economists don t like to dwell too much on the u s trade balance it is by and large an accounting measure that often moves in directions inverse to the health of the economy the u s trade deficit s biggest contraction on record came in 2009 when it shrank by more than 300 billion in a single year as a result of the recession then under way and the resulting collapse in u s demand for imported goods as a result largely of that slump the u s s goods and services deficit with the world contracted by more than 200 billion over president barack obama s eight years in office this is a major reason why economists say you really don t want this as your scorecard said phil levy a former senior economist for trade with president george w bush s council of economic advisers it s not an accident when things are booming we consume more imports despite the name trade deficits tend to have less to do with trade policy than broader macroeconomic policy the main long term driver of persistent trade deficits since 1975 has been the gap between the u s s low savings rate and its attractiveness as an investment destination fueled partly by the dollar s role as the world s reserve currency that in turn leads to a stronger dollar which in itself helps increase the trade deficit by lowering the real cost of imports and increasing the local currency cost of american goods in overseas markets in the first 11 months of 2018 the u s deficit in goods and services with the world increased 52 billion or about 10 percent from the same period in 2017 if that pattern holds in the december data released wednesday and economists surveyed by bloomberg predict it will the deficit will have widened to about 610 billion in 2018 in 2016 it was 502 billion the immediate drivers of the surge in the trade deficit under trump have been the fiscal expansion resulting from the tax cuts he pushed through congress and the stronger dollar that resulted partly from the juiced economy that expansion helped create trump s supporters insist he s tackling that via his trade negotiations with china and other u s trading partners they also point to his renegotiation of nafta as something that will help reduce the u s trade deficit in the long run but trump s trade policy also contributed materially to the growth of the trade deficit in 2018 the tariffs he threatened and then imposed on chinese imports caused a rush by importers to get ahead of the new duties that fueled an increase in incoming traffic at west coast ports last year the retaliatory tariffs trump provoked from china also hit major u s agricultural exports such as soybeans moreover his attacks and threats to impose tariffs on trading partners from china to the european union has also contributed to the slowdown in those economies and therefore their demand for american goods trump and his supporters have cast the blame in part on the federal reserve arguing that its decisions to hike rates last year contributed to the strengthening of the dollar trump has complained that a stronger dollar has weakened his hand in his trade wars and put a damper on u s growth but advocates of a stronger u s currency policy argue that trump himself carries plenty of blame robert scott senior economist at the left leaning economic policy institute said trump s failure to tackle what he sees as a global misalignment in currencies that requires a depreciation of the dollar has been the main cause of a rising trade deficit even trump s attempts to deal with currency issues in trade negotiations with china or his public complaints about a strong dollar seem unlikely to change anything the strong dollar matters because it has led to near record deficits in manufactured goods and non oil goods that are being masked by increases in exports of oil and services scott said to his mind that means the u s s trade balance is worse than even the official data reflects there s a lot going on below the surface here he said dm

here is the full text as prepared for delivery of gov phil murphy s second annual state budget address which he is delivering at the statehouse in trenton on tuesday lieutenant governor oliver senate president sweeney speaker coughlin majority leaders weinberg and greenwald minority leaders kean and bramnick and members of the 218th legislature former governors chief justice rabner judge grant members of the cabinet faith leaders honored guests friends and fellow new jerseyans our license plates say new jersey the garden state but even more than that new jersey is the middle class state we are all in this together and coming together is how we succeed so today i am presenting a budget that is a blueprint for how we continue to build a more secure and inclusive middle class in new jersey this budget is how we make real the promise of a stronger and fairer state that works for every family and it builds on the progress we have already made together we are paving the way for countless families like the family i grew up in who want nothing more than to move into the middle class and we are smoothing the path for those already there together just a month ago we put our state on a path to a 15 an hour minimum wage this path is the on ramp that more than one million new jerseyans will use to ultimately move into the middle class the economic activity they will power will make those already in the middle class more secure gov phil murphy center on tuesday delivers his second state budget address at the statehouse in trenton behind him is state assembly speaker craig coughlin left and state senate president stephen sweeney right nj advance media for nj com but it s about more than just economics the new york times said it best the 15 minimum wage doesn t just improve lives it saves them it goes further a living wage is an antidepressant it is a sleep aid a diet a stress reliever it is a contraceptive preventing teenage pregnancy it prevents premature death it shields children from neglect if anyone in this chamber ever questions whether what we do matters simply think of the families striving to join the middle class those whose paths have been blocked because of a yawning racial wealth gap and the alice families working hard but falling behind and then look to this achievement or to this one two weeks ago we expanded paid family leave to make an even greater difference for families who need time off from work to welcome a new baby or care for a sick loved one and one week ago today workers who had never before had the ability to take a paid sick day finally began to enjoy this basic benefit so many of us take for granted together we are beginning to properly fund our public schools strengthening a public education engine that is the foundation for the middle class and at the same time providing much needed property tax relief together we are fundamentally redefining public education with greater access to pre k and by beginning to make community college tuition free these are landmark achievements in strengthening the middle class and making new jersey a national leader together we are making health insurance more affordable and finally funding planned parenthood steps that take some of the edge off the high costs of health care together we are rebuilding nj transit directly benefiting everyone who commutes to work and school and making our state more competitive together we are making real differences in the everyday lives of millions of people together we are making new jersey stronger and fairer for all of this i thank you but we must be clear where this journey started this administration and this legislature inherited a state hollowed out by eight years of wrong headed and short sighted decisions it was eight years of shutting out middle class new jersey families and shutting the door on those struggling to get there new jersey lagged the nation in economic growth and in creating jobs eleven credit downgrades drove up costs and pushed down our reputation critical infrastructure projects were abandoned nj transit was gutted and commuters were literally left behind public schools and pensions were underfunded year after year again and again new jersey s middle class paid the price of course we heard the word affordability a lot over those eight years but as with so many things over those years the rhetoric and the reality didn t connect affordability was only defined in narrow partisan terms for eight long years the politics of division failed new jersey just as the politics of division are today failing our nation today in new jersey we are climbing our way out of a deep hole but in new jersey we don t give up we just work harder so together let s get to work in this budget affordability is about the smart and honest investment of our resources where they will do the most good where they can create broad opportunity for many as opposed to just rewarding a privileged few where they can rebuild our middle class rather than milk it and affordability is about being good stewards of every taxpayer dollar and working together to find savings that no one had thought possible that is why this budget is rooted in over 1 1 billion in real and sustainable savings including nearly 800 million in public employee health benefit cost savings and another 200 million plus in departmental savings you heard that number right over 1 1 billion in real and sustainable savings much of these significant savings were achieved through cooperation with our public employees rather than through confrontation these savings were achieved through the power of working together these savings will allow us to take the steps we need to move new jersey forward growing up in our family the only way we could spend money is if we saved money i know a lot of new jerseyans understand that of course no one especially not me questions that taxes are a big piece in new jersey s affordability puzzle that is why slowing the growth of property taxes to a record low matters that is why our expansion of the earned income tax credit matters that is why restoring the homestead property tax benefit matters that is why tax fairness for middle class families seniors and small and medium sized businesses matters this budget continues us down this path but growing our economy and investing in the things that will make life better for our middle class and those who aspire to join it are equally important each of us came here to make things better to meet our responsibilities and to serve our constituents this is a chamber filled with good people with good intentions yet here we are paying the price for past years of pushing problems down a broken road that is why this blueprint for the middle class matters this budget is built upon four elements one doing the hard work to realize over 1 1 billion in sustainable savings two stabilizing new jersey s credit worthiness through responsible fiscal stewardship three maintaining and growing our investments in education infrastructure in particular nj transit and an innovation driven economy that reaches deep into every neighborhood four ensuring tax fairness for our middle class we must remember that each number we write into the budget is a face the face of one of millions of new jerseyans looking to us to put aside our differences to overcome our challenges several of these faces are here with us today guests of the lieutenant governor and the first lady they are committed to being part of a better future and they are the people this budget invests in among them are tawana watkins of east orange who is part of the new class of nj transit engineers and who will play a big part in once again making nj transit the envy of the nation lindenwold s aurelio sotelo is a finance student at rutgers camden thanks in part to the educational opportunity fund because of the eof aurelio is well on his way to achieving his dream of owning his own clothing company and stacey barrio lothrop and jans heinsohn of carbon22 an innovative medical device manufacturer which is taking root at the kearny point incubator space carbon22 is also the very first company to take advantage of the investment we are making in our startup culture through nj ignite the eda s collaborative workspace rent initiative in our work to reclaim our dominance in the innovation economy people like stacey and jans and companies like carbon22 will lead the charge their faces those of the other special guests with us today and the millions of others like them across our state are why the most important investment in this budget is in the middle class and in those who dream to join its ranks we are as committed to them as we are to our principles but as i have said before we can compromise on policy without compromising either our principles or our commitment to our people i understand the budget i am proposing today will not be identical to the one i will ultimately sign we will talk we will negotiate and we will compromise that is as it should be that is how our system works best we will have to make hard choices but that is different from false choices we need to be stronger and fairer we can t have economic progress without social progress and we can t have social progress without economic progress because when we remember that success and fairness are not mutually exclusive we can do big things last year our administration worked with our public employees to strike an agreement that is saving state and local taxpayers 500 million across two years while protecting the health care of the men and women of state and local government our educators and our police fire and ems first responders but that was not an end it was just a beginning and our conversations never stopped we continued to present new ideas to hear theirs and to talk as partners instead of as adversaries negotiations and progress flow from mutual trust they go nowhere when there is only mutual suspicion that s the old way that s the failed way and those days are over in total our budget contains roughly 800 million in real and lasting savings in the delivery of public employee health care in the coming fiscal year a 16 percent year over year decrease from the current budget importantly the reforms we have agreed upon and those we continue to work toward in good faith will allow our taxpayers to keep hundreds of millions of dollars in their pockets their impact on local and school budgets is also expected to deliver more than 400 million in property tax relief and it will save money for those who serve our state our communities and our schools while maintaining the high quality health care they deserve from left to right former new jersey governors jon corzine jim florio and richard codey talk before current gov phil murphy delivers his annual state budget address nj advance media for nj com it will make new jersey more affordable across the board half of these savings we will be able to implement administratively while others will be realized through collective bargaining and the work of the plan design committees that craft the policies available to our public workforce our public workers are not the enemy they are our neighbors they are also taxpayers they are the heart of our middle class it is not pandering to stand with them it is doing our jobs we accomplished this with the same mindset in which we worked to save residents an average of more than nine percent on individual health care policies by protecting the affordable care act the aim isn t to offer lesser care it s to provide high quality care at a lower cost and we are doing that we are doing it without yelling threatening or calling people names and i will continue to work in partnership and in good faith with our partners in the public workforce on ways we can collectively ensure greater progress and greater relief for our taxpayers as i mentioned we have also identified another 200 million plus in departmental savings opportunities throughout the budget which we will apply this year i thank treasurer liz muoio and her team for their hard work work that has added up to over 1 1 billion in savings by anybody s standard over 1 1 billion in sustainable savings is real and substantial i also thank human services commissioner carole johnson for her knowledgeable leadership in finding an additional quarter of a billion dollars in recoverable medicaid funds plus millions more in other efficiencies that will allow us to maximize our federal dollars while protecting beneficiaries we are building a stronger fiscal house for new jersey we are replacing gimmicks with stability for example the projected surplus of the budget i signed last year was 765 million a vast improvement over prior budgets but through careful management and keeping an eye on every dollar we have grown our surplus by one third over the year and are now set to close fiscal 2019 with a surplus of over 1 billion this budget will grow our surplus even more in fiscal 2020 to nearly 1 2 billion i ask you to find the last time we had consecutive years of billion dollar plus surpluses last year i proposed a budget that significantly cut back on the use of one shots and this budget once again maintains that example one shot revenues are down to only 1 7 percent a decrease of one third over the current budget and half the average yearly amount across the prior administration and in this budget we are significantly curtailing fund diversions we are eliminating entirely the diversion from the affordable housing trust fund so lieutenant governor oliver and her team at dca can do more to ensure the accessibility of safe and affordable housing and through the clean energy fund we will put more than 70 million back to work to make critical investments in our clean energy economy this shows how far we have already come in fixing the structural problems that years of past fiscal decisions had created and we know there s still work to do especially with our surplus we must remain vigilant to safeguard these funds and not to view them as just extra cash laying around to be raided for any number of programs or projects no matter how well intentioned reducing our reliance on one shots and diversions means greater year over year fiscal predictability and reliability but the real value is that they allow us to make the investments we need to make new jersey a stronger and fairer state for every family and reaching these fiscal mileposts will not go unnoticed by the rating agencies with whom i will visit later this week and whose decisions greatly impact our future sustainability because with a more sustainable fiscal future we can make more sustainable investments in our future last year we began the process of finally fulfilling our obligations to our public schools increasing our investment in k through 12 classrooms by more than 350 million let there be no doubt this investment is one reason why 2018 saw the lowest increase in the average statewide property tax bill not just in the last nine years but on record and the work to modernize our formula to meet the on the ground needs of districts today led by senate president sweeney is ensuring that school funding dollars are more efficiently and effectively following our children we also increased investment in high quality pre k programs today in 64 additional school districts more than 4 400 three and four year olds now have access to pre k they lacked just one year ago this budget maintains this commitment to our kids and our public schools starting with an additional 206 million to ramp up to the full k through 12 formula funding there is 68 million more to not only maintain but to expand pre k these commitments mean we can continue to be a national leader in the delivery of high quality public education and our budget continues our computer science for all initiative this gives more high school students especially minority students access to an advanced computer science course so they can earn college credits and industry credentials and go on to increase the diversity of our innovation economy our budget includes 5 million more for tuition aid grants and an additional 2 25 million to support the educational opportunity fund this is the 50th year in which accomplished students like aurelio are benefitting from eof it is the greatest legislative legacy of former governor tom kean who sponsored the original bill let s ensure it continues to write new chapters for our students last year we inaugurated a grant program that in concert with eof and tag and other available aid is helping 13 000 qualified students to pursue an associate s degree tuition free at one of 13 community colleges this budget will grow our investment in community college opportunity grants to reach a total of 18 000 students in the 2019 2020 academic year at every community college and more of them will be pursuing a degree full time and our budget looks to a new way to help our four year public colleges and universities we propose 20 million in new formula driven aid based on what is needed to ensure the best outcomes for all students and reflect the diversity of our state this is a first step in funding higher education through fairness and not politics it is part of the broader state plan which higher education secretary zakiya smith ellis will be releasing in the near future last year we enhanced and refocused our investment in workforce development and apprenticeship programs we awarded grants expanding opportunities for thousands more to learn and master the skills that will lead them into good paying family supporting careers this budget continues this commitment our blueprint for the license through its investments in education and workforce development will continue to make a more competitive and more affordable new jersey in our current budget we restored direct property tax relief to thousands of middle class families who were cut off by the prior administration i thank speaker coughlin for leading the fight to restore this relief and this budget maintains our commitment with 283 million in direct property tax relief for our middle class families and seniors in a state with an unmatched location and a regional economy built on moving people and goods there is no higher priority than fixing nj transit we owe our commuters a transportation system that makes their lives smoother rather than harder they deserve a system that is safer more reliable and customer oriented our current budget began the long process of turning around an agency that had been hollowed out by years of disinvestment and mismanagement leaving customers as second class citizens and hurting our economic well being last year commuters were spared a fare hike and if we pass this budget s investment there won t be one this year either through our current investment nj transit has moved ahead with procurement of new rail cars and buses to build capacity and relieve overcrowding we are rebuilding the gutted ranks of rail engineers and bus operators needed to keep the lines running and i cannot wait to welcome our first class of new train engineers later this spring because of our investment nj transit was able to push forward to meet the federal government s december 31 2018 deadline on positive train control a feat almost no one outside our administration and i mean almost no one thought possible on friday i signed legislation that expands a commuter tax cut allowing more commuters to directly benefit from pre tax savings accounts to pay for their rail or bus fares this can keep hundreds of extra dollars a year in their pockets nj transit has also reached agreement with amtrak on millions of dollars worth of back payments they are now working together on joint investments in infrastructure and renovations at new york penn station that will improve the customer experience this budget maintains all of this progress it will provide 407 million in general fund support to nj transit this 100 million increase will replace 75 million in fund diversions in addition to providing 25 million in new direct funding this keeps nj transit on the path to being the turnaround story of the nation it keeps rebuilding the ranks of professionals needed to keep our system running and most importantly it keeps improving service to our commuters it s this simple an investment in nj transit is a direct investment in our economy our business environment and our commuters it s an investment in hard working people like tawana and in the people she will take to and from work every day and we will responsibly invest in meeting our pension obligation and continuing the progress to bringing the pension funds back to health with a second straight record setting payment this year s totaling 3 8 billion our pension obligation like many of our challenges nj transit and school funding among others did not spring up overnight it grew because decisions made by both parties allowed it to grow i know this particular challenge well perhaps better than many i studied it in depth more than a decade ago when governor codey asked me to chair the first pension and benefits task force but the message our task force put forward nearly a decade and a half ago is just as true today we cannot look for quick outs or easy fixes because they simply don t exist it took us years to get to this point and it will take years of good faith efforts efforts that must include our public employees our educators and our first responders to successfully get past it and that is why we are making this record 3 8 billion pension contribution to keep our promises and to meet our fiscal challenges head on we must ensure that our commitment to affordable high quality health care and evidence based policymaking remains as strong as ever our current budget restored funding for planned parenthood and women s health care as a result of that investment over 10 000 more patients both women and men were served in 2018 compared to 2017 at the national level president trump and his administration are continuing their assault on title x putting the health of millions of women across the country at risk for starkly partisan and political reasons in new jersey we re showing the better way forward last year four clinics were added where residents could receive family planning services and an entirely new health clinic opened at rutgers newark patients gained access to 8 000 additional hours to receive vital services including potentially life saving cancer screenings more than 40 critical staffing roles were filled more than 80 000 std tests were provided free of charge and today more women have access to long acting birth control this budget maintains our commitment so we can continue to build upon this progress over the past year the first lady has taken on the growing racial disparity in maternal health alongside twelve of our commissioners leaders in our health care and faith communities legislators and many others i want to give a special shout out to health commissioner dr shereef elnahal children and families commissioner christine norbut beyer and human services commissioner carole johnson the facts are jarring new jersey ranks 45th in the nation yes 45th in maternal death rate nearly double the national average even worse 60 percent of new mothers who die because of complications from childbirth are women of color a black baby in new jersey is three times more likely to die in his or her first year of life than a white baby the widest racial disparity in the nation to combat this the first lady and our administration inaugurated the nurturenj campaign to raise awareness of our maternal and child mortality crisis and to develop a comprehensive interagency plan this budget will support these efforts to bring together more experts and residents in the search for lasting solutions and our budget will provide 1 million through our medicaid program for doulas who play a critical role in reversing these statistics medicaid covers 40 percent of all childbirths in new jersey and these babies deserve a chance as much as any other these babies are far from the only vulnerable new jerseyans this budget seeks to help while we will maintain our commitment to emergency aid for homeless residents this budget also recognizes that money alone is not an answer to this vexing problem gov phil murphy left shakes hands with state senate president stephen sweeney before his speech nj advance media for nj com we ll take a broader approach through the creation of an office of homelessness initiatives in the department of community affairs to act as a hub for more strategic and coordinated efforts where we use data and analytics to create and implement solutions to address people s housing needs especially among our veterans from prevention to emergencies to permanency and our budget will provide critical resources to allow individuals with both developmental disabilities and mental health challenges to thrive in their communities in addition we will do more to alleviate the costs pushed onto our medicaid system by large employers who leave workers to rely on medicaid instead of offering a health care plan this budget will ask employers with 50 or more employees on medicaid to pay a small corporate responsibility fee of 150 for each one of these employees they should share in the burden of paying for their employees care rather than leaving it to the rest of us and our budget will maintain our commitment to working families in other ways including continuing the child and dependent care tax credit we passed together last year which is benefitting more than 74 000 new jersey families we are continuing to support smart compassionate and just prisoner reentry efforts i commend governor mcgreevey and our faith based communities for all their great work on the front lines our budget this year will increase investments in programs proven to decrease rates of recidivism and will support the ability of incarcerated individuals to continue their education so they can find second chances when they come back to our communities in every respect we commit to reforming our criminal justice system for the better in our current budget we set aside 100 million to directly combat our opioid epidemic through carefully designed programs and thoughtful data driven analysis to put resources where they are most needed we are ever mindful that the opioid epidemic was ravaging our cities long before it made headlines this budget maintains our commitment and proposes increasing fees on opioid drug distributors and manufacturers to help support our fight against the opioid epidemic other states red and blue alike are taking similar steps let s join them let s send a clear message that we should be working together to end our national addiction to opioids not to continue feeding it as we look to building the new jersey of the future we must be mindful of our ability to continue these investments well into our future in my budget address one year ago i called for us to enact a new way in which we provide the tax incentives that help us attract and retain businesses i spoke directly to it in october when i released my economic master plan and i reiterated this call in my state of the state address seven weeks ago there are many opinions on our current system of open ended corporate tax breaks but here is a simple fact the potential impact of past corporate tax breaks on corporate business tax collection in the coming fiscal year surpasses 1 billion and it will remain over 1 billion annually for at least the next three fiscal years the simple fact is that we are currently obligated i repeat obligated to corporate tax breaks totaling 11 billion through at least fiscal year 2031 and lest we forget for all of these incentives before this administration took office new jersey was 42nd in job growth and 49th in wage growth while key investments in education and infrastructure like a tunnel under the hudson river never happened even under a capped program yes we would see some loss in corporate business tax revenues but it would be predictable and sustainable we can provide strategic incentives without hurting our ability to reinvest in the things that bolster our economy and help our businesses like education and property tax relief workforce development and nj transit that tunnel to new york would be nice too tax incentives transparent and accountable smartly devised and strategically deployed have a vital role to play in a focused economic growth plan they are a needed step in undertaking structural fiscal reform and restoring middle class affordability i am a pro growth progressive i want the world s biggest and best technology clean energy and life sciences companies to come and expand here but i am even more committed to the next generation being born and growing here reforming how we jumpstart job creation needs to be about both creating jobs and more wisely investing taxpayer money the companies dreaming of making it big in new jersey like carbon22 deserve our support we must be smart and strategic about how we encourage new startups and entrepreneurs about how we nurture more businesses owned by women by persons of color and by veterans and about how we lead the world in clean energy solutions like offshore wind we can reclaim and dominate all aspects of the innovation economy that s why we need innovative incentive programs to be pro business in the 21st century you need to be agile and creative just like the businesses we want to grow our current programs expire june 30 along with the current budget i ask you to join me now with renewed purpose in creating the new suite of smart focused and capped incentive programs we need to boost our people and our economy without compromising our ability to invest in our people and our economy we can do this on a parallel track as we work on our final budget and we can enact them together in fact we must because together we enacted a responsibly balanced budget that invests in our people and our infrastructure and which stands for fairness for our middle class new jersey s priorities stand proudly in contrast with those of president trump and his administration right now across the state countless middle class families are doing their taxes and wondering where the tax cuts they were promised by president trump and his enablers went many barely felt the impact in their take home pay and now they re getting less back in their refunds many others because of their now limited state and local tax deduction are actually paying more our new congressional delegation along with those from our neighboring states democrats and republicans alike announced legislation to restore the full middle class salt deduction by in part simply asking the wealthiest to go back to paying what they paid in 2017 i commend their efforts and give them my full support and ten days ago i joined with governors from other states adversely impacted by the salt cap to announce our concerted efforts to have it reversed but while those efforts are ongoing and while our middle class is trying to figure out where their tax relief went those at the very top are shouldering less and less of their fair share of the tax burden that s the opposite of tax fairness let s work together to apply the millionaire s tax to every millionaire by doing so we can do more to relieve the burden on middle class taxpayers and senior citizens who are taking it on the chin from the trump administration s tax scam let s be absolutely clear this is not a tax that will be paid by anyone in the middle class period full stop but it is revenue that is necessary to strengthen and expand the middle class as i have underscored we have done a great deal of work to save money 1 1 billion in this budget in order to address our fiscal challenges and we must have the same commitment to support the middle class and those aspiring to get there our taxpayers overwhelmingly support this across party lines and across the state we should listen to them and do this together and we know they also support our work to legalize and regulate adult use marijuana i thank senate president sweeney speaker coughlin and senator scutari for their partnership i know we re not across the finish line yet but we are closer than ever before most importantly this is the right step for eliminating decades old and persistent racial and social inequities but it is also our chance to create an entirely new state based industry with the potential to create thousands of good paying jobs expand opportunities for minority business owners and jumpstart billions of dollars in new economic activity i will only sign this if it expunges the records of those who have been put through our criminal justice system for prior marijuana offenses this is an unfinished item from last year s to do list let s commit to completing this effort together and i renew my call for us to increase the fees for gun licenses and handgun permits it was long past time we did this last year when we took so many steps to restore our standing as a national leader in gun safety and it s even more past time today our gun fees were set in 1966 when governor richard hughes worked in this building it s now 2019 it is actually cheaper to get a permit to purchase a handgun 2 than it is to get a dog in many of our communities this is what s needed to support the efforts of attorney general gurbir grewal our state troopers and county and local law enforcement to fight crime and track gun violence and to combat the trafficking of illegal guns into our state in 2018 roughly 80 percent of guns used in the commission of a crime came from out of state as with our other efforts i know the people of new jersey will support us this budget isn t about getting us through the next year it s about putting ourselves on a trajectory to be that new jersey we want to be in ten years we all must be part of this no one should be pointing from the sidelines and leaving the hard work of governing to others we must all find ourselves with some dirt on our uniforms it was one of our greatest presidents teddy roosevelt who told us the credit goes to those actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood i am proud of everyone who over the course of this past year has joined me in rolling up their sleeves and jumping into the arena to help with the hard work of restoring new jersey senate president sweeney and assembly speaker coughlin many of you seated here in this chamber our cabinet and team led by lieutenant governor oliver elected officials all across our state mayors council members boards of education county officials faith leaders the men and women of organized labor first responders our active duty military and our veterans our lgbtq community business leaders educators communities of color countless advocates and the thousands of everyday new jerseyans i have met all across our state this really is about achieving big things by working together and i thank you this budget continues our work to invest in the single most consequential asset in new jersey our people this budget doubles down on the middle class and all those dreaming to get there just as my family was when i was growing up this budget is the blueprint for building this new jersey it is about value for our middle class it is about our middle class values we are the middle class state and when we listen to both the dreams and the concerns of our middle class families we can find the answers that help all of new jersey move forward because when people prosper new jersey prospers when families can move forward new jersey moves forward when seniors are more secure new jersey is more secure when we foster a better future for young people young people will build their future here when we open our doors to innovative new businesses those businesses will power our economy my vision for new jersey has never wavered we need to continue to build an economy that works from the middle class out and from the bottom up we need an economy that embraces the future but stays true to the values of rewarding hard work creating opportunity and providing the tools people need to succeed thank you may god continue to bless the great people and state of new jersey and the united states of america

bahamas and the soesâ debt also entails increasing contingent liabilities for the central government â historically successive governments have not had the effective means to evaluate the fiscal stewardship of soes some 15 4 percent of the government recurrent expenditure is allocated to these soes which translates to some 398 million yet even as their share of the public purse has grown the framework to obtain the timely and consistent information necessary to assess the value for money obtained by these soes simply has not been developed â he said â the government is moving in an aggressive way to address this issue in the mid term budget statement i announced that the government is kicking off a project this month that will result in the formation of a comprehensive strategy to cost rationalization and cost recovery for soesâ in line with international best practicesâ as well as an efficient financial and management reporting model the project will also include the implementation of the strategic model and the roll out of new budgeting accounting and performance management for soes the dpm said the bahamas does better than comparator regions including the organization for economic co operation and development â the share of individuals between 25 and 65 years old in the bahamas with no education or incomplete primary or secondary education is the lowest among all the groups studied the country has the second highest share of population between 25 and 65 years old with tertiary education among the caribbean 6 the bahamas barbados jamaica guyana

stewardship of soes some 15 4 percent of the government recurrent expenditure is allocated to these soes which translates to some 398 million yet even as their share of the public purse has grown the framework to obtain the timely and consistent information necessary to assess the value for money obtained by these soes simply has not been developed â he said â the government is moving in an

by stefan gleason the 22 trillion official national debt is a much discussed problem even as politicians exhibit zero motivation to do anything about it but as big an economic overhang as it is government debt isn t likely to trigger the next financial crisis yes servicing the growing federal debt bubble will depress gdp growth cause the value of the dollar to drop and raise inflation risks but the bubble itself won t necessarily burst not anytime soon as long as politicians face no political consequences for deficit spending and as long as the federal reserve keeps the treasury bond market propped up then many more trillions can be added to the national debt meanwhile more fragile debt bubbles exist in the private sector unlike government debt which carries the implicit backing of the fed s unlimited printing press debts incurred by corporations investors consumers and students can default globally there exists 250 trillion in debt against economic assets of around 100 trillion the notional value of all derivatives now approaches a quadrillion dollars it s been called the everything bubble and it could soon lead to the everything bust u s household debt rose to a record 13 5 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2018 mortgages student loans car loans and credit cards represent enormous burdens even during a good economy these burdens will prove unbearable for millions of americans in the years ahead for many the financial crisis is already here pending home sales have fallen on a year over year basis for 13 consecutive months farm loan delinquencies recently hit their highest level in 9 years more than 7 million americans are delinquent on their auto loan payments an all time record some 5 1 million people are in default on their student loans student loans now rank as the second largest biggest category of american consumer debt just behind mortgages the cruel reality is that many of these gender studies and art history type degrees will never be worth as much in the job market as they cost to obtain the main consequence of the government subsidized student loan bubble is to enable college tuitions and fees to rise at a much higher rate than salaries it s not that universities have had to raise costs to pay for top notch professors instead the biggest growth in university hiring has been for administrators and diversity indoctrinators who get fancy titles and plush salaries while providing little to no useful instruction it s just one example of how easy money and distorted government incentives lead to malinvestment another example of course is the stock market investors in search of returns have bid up stocks to bubble heights following years of artificially depressed interest rates big corporations have tried to manipulate their own share prices higher by engaging in leveraged stock buybacks even at lofty recent valuations warren buffett defended stock buybacks of berkshire hathaway in his latest letter to shareholders while noting such practices can be destructive if done regardless of value we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us assuming that we buy at a discount to berkshire s intrinsic value which certainly will be our intention repurchases will benefit both those shareholders leaving the company and those who stay obviously repurchases should be price sensitive blindly buying an overpriced stock is value destructive a fact lost on many promotional or ever optimistic ceos a composite of equity leverage including margin accounts and leveraged exchange traded products shows total leverage at an all time high last december a deleveraging event started to take hold into christmas until the u s treasury secretary convened the plunge protection team and federal reserve chairman jerome powell turned dovish the fed faces another potential deleveraging event just around the corner in the corporate bond market the u s investment grade corporate bond market has swelled to about 5 2 trillion according to bloomberg that represents an increase of more than 3 trillion over the last 10 years even more alarming around half of these investment grade bonds are just one tier away from being rated as junk between now and 2021 an unprecedented spike in outstanding commercial debt comes due that could be a disaster especially if credit spreads widen and or interest rates go up across the board investment grade debt maturing billions source wells fargo securities bloomberg another potential bubble unwinding to come is in stock market index funds passively managed index funds have grown from 4 5 of total u s stock market assets in 2002 to 17 in 2018 the late john bogle founder of vanguard and index investing pioneer turned skeptical on the outsized growth of index funds prior to his death perhaps these vehicles had become too successful for its own good he said the fundamental problem is that index funds assume an underlying efficient market where securities analysis and market discovery takes place when the largest shareholders of all the blue chip stocks are index funds valuations can get distorted the share prices of bad companies can get artificially propped up during bull markets and during bear markets when scared investors are selling index funds solid companies can be unfairly marked down high frequency program trading has come to dominate stock picking and when the algorithms turn bearish on market trends they can all follow each other in triggering cascading sell orders the next stock market crash could initially bring down all markets including commodities but any threat of deflation will trigger a massive inflationary response from the federal reserve inflationary assets such as precious metals stand to benefit gold in particular will also tend attract safe haven demand and hold up better than risk assets when the everything bubble bursts
northjersey lieutenant governor oliver senate president sweeney speaker coughlin majority leaders weinberg and greenwald minority leaders kean and bramnick and members of the 218th legislature former governors chief justice rabner judge grant members of the cabinet faith leaders honored guests friends and fellow new jerseyans our license plates say new jersey the garden state but even more than that new jersey is the middle class state we are all in this together and coming together is how we succeed so today i am presenting a budget that is a blueprint for how we continue to build a more secure and inclusive middle class in new jersey this budget is how we make real the promise of a stronger and fairer state that works for every family and it builds on the progress we have already made together we are paving the way for countless families like the family i grew up in who want nothing more than to move into the middle class and we are smoothing the path for those already there together just a month ago we put our state on a path to a 15 an hour minimum wage this path is the on ramp that more than one million new jerseyans will use to ultimately move into the middle class the economic activity they will power will make those already in the middle class more secure watch live phil murphy unveils nj budget nj tax increase coming phil murphy plans second push to raise rates on millionaires it s here best of bergen 2019 results announced but it s about more than just economics the new york times said it best the 15 minimum wage doesn t just improve lives it saves them it goes further a living wage is an antidepressant it is a sleep aid a diet a stress reliever it is a contraceptive preventing teenage pregnancy it prevents premature death it shields children from neglect if anyone in this chamber ever questions whether what we do matters simply think of the families striving to join the middle class those whose paths have been blocked because of a yawning racial wealth gap and the alice families working hard but falling behind and then look to this achievement or to this one two weeks ago we expanded paid family leave to make an even greater difference for families who need time off from work to welcome a new baby or care for a sick loved one and one week ago today workers who had never before had the ability to take a paid sick day finally began to enjoy this basic benefit so many of us take for granted together we are beginning to properly fund our public schools strengthening a public education engine that is the foundation for the middle class and at the same time providing much needed property tax relief together we are fundamentally redefining public education with greater access to pre k and by beginning to make community college tuition free these are landmark achievements in strengthening the middle class and making new jersey a national leader together we are making health insurance more affordable and finally funding planned parenthood steps that take some of the edge off the high costs of health care together we are rebuilding nj transit directly benefiting everyone who commutes to work and school and making our state more competitive together we are making real differences in the everyday lives of millions of people together we are making new jersey stronger and fairer for all of this i thank you but we must be clear where this journey started this administration and this legislature inherited a state hollowed out by eight years of wrong headed and short sighted decisions it was eight years of shutting out middle class new jersey families and shutting the door on those struggling to get there new jersey lagged the nation in economic growth and in creating jobs eleven credit downgrades drove up costs and pushed down our reputation critical infrastructure projects were abandoned nj transit was gutted and commuters were literally left behind public schools and pensions were underfunded year after year again and again new jersey s middle class paid the price of course we heard the word affordability a lot over those eight years but as with so many things over those years the rhetoric and the reality didn t connect affordability was only defined in narrow partisan terms for eight long years the politics of division failed new jersey just as the politics of division are today failing our nation today in new jersey we are climbing our way out of a deep hole but in new jersey we don t give up we just work harder so together let s get to work in this budget affordability is about the smart and honest investment of our resources where they will do the most good where they can create broad opportunity for many as opposed to just rewarding a privileged few where they can rebuild our middle class rather than milk it and affordability is about being good stewards of every taxpayer dollar and working together to find savings that no one had thought possible that is why this budget is rooted in over 1 1 billion in real and sustainable savings including nearly 800 million in public employee health benefit cost savings and another 200 million plus in departmental savings you heard that number right over 1 1 billion in real and sustainable savings much of these significant savings were achieved through cooperation with our public employees rather than through confrontation these savings were achieved through the power of working together these savings will allow us to take the steps we need to move new jersey forward growing up in our family the only way we could spend money is if we saved money i know a lot of new jerseyans understand that of course no one especially not me questions that taxes are a big piece in new jersey s affordability puzzle that is why slowing the growth of property taxes to a record low matters that is why our expansion of the earned income tax credit matters that is why restoring the homestead property tax benefit matters that is why tax fairness for middle class families seniors and small and medium sized businesses matters this budget continues us down this path but growing our economy and investing in the things that will make life better for our middle class and those who aspire to join it are equally important each of us came here to make things better to meet our responsibilities and to serve our constituents this is a chamber filled with good people with good intentions yet here we are paying the price for past years of pushing problems down a broken road that is why this blueprint for the middle class matters this budget is built upon four elements one doing the hard work to realize over 1 1 billion in sustainable savings two stabilizing new jersey s credit worthiness through responsible fiscal stewardship three maintaining and growing our investments in education infrastructure in particular nj transit and an innovation driven economy that reaches deep into every neighborhood four ensuring tax fairness for our middle class we must remember that each number we write into the budget is a face the face of one of millions of new jerseyans looking to us to put aside our differences to overcome our challenges several of these faces are here with us today guests of the lieutenant governor and the first lady they are committed to being part of a better future and they are the people this budget invests in among them are tawana watkins of east orange who is part of the new class of nj transit engineers and who will play a big part in once again making nj transit the envy of the nation lindenwold s aurelio sotelo is a finance student at rutgers camden thanks in part to the educational opportunity fund because of the eof aurelio is well on his way to achieving his dream of owning his own clothing company and stacey barrio lothrop and jans heinsohn of carbon22 an innovative medical device manufacturer which is taking root at the kearny point incubator space carbon22 is also the very first company to take advantage of the investment we are making in our startup culture through nj ignite the eda s collaborative workspace rent initiative in our work to reclaim our dominance in the innovation economy people like stacey and jans and companies like carbon22 will lead the charge their faces those of the other special guests with us today and the millions of others like them across our state are why the most important investment in this budget is in the middle class and in those who dream to join its ranks we are as committed to them as we are to our principles but as i have said before we can compromise on policy without compromising either our principles or our commitment to our people i understand the budget i am proposing today will not be identical to the one i will ultimately sign we will talk we will negotiate and we will compromise that is as it should be that is how our system works best we will have to make hard choices but that is different from false choices we need to be stronger and fairer we can t have economic progress without social progress and we can t have social progress without economic progress because when we remember that success and fairness are not mutually exclusive we can do big things last year our administration worked with our public employees to strike an agreement that is saving state and local taxpayers 500 million across two years while protecting the health care of the men and women of state and local government our educators and our police fire and ems first responders but that was not an end it was just a beginning and our conversations never stopped we continued to present new ideas to hear theirs and to talk as partners instead of as adversaries negotiations and progress flow from mutual trust they go nowhere when there is only mutual suspicion that s the old way that s the failed way and those days are over in total our budget contains roughly 800 million in real and lasting savings in the delivery of public employee health care in the coming fiscal year a 16 percent year over year decrease from the current budget importantly the reforms we have agreed upon and those we continue to work toward in good faith will allow our taxpayers to keep hundreds of millions of dollars in their pockets their impact on local and school budgets is also expected to deliver more than 400 million in property tax relief and it will save money for those who serve our state our communities and our schools while maintaining the high quality health care they deserve it will make new jersey more affordable across the board half of these savings we will be able to implement administratively while others will be realized through collective bargaining and the work of the plan design committees that craft the policies available to our public workforce our public workers are not the enemy they are our neighbors they are also taxpayers they are the heart of our middle class it is not pandering to stand with them it is doing our jobs we accomplished this with the same mindset in which we worked to save residents an average of more than nine percent on individual health care policies by protecting the affordable care act the aim isn t to offer lesser care it s to provide high quality care at a lower cost and we are doing that we are doing it without yelling threatening or calling people names and i will continue to work in partnership and in good faith with our partners in the public workforce on ways we can collectively ensure greater progress and greater relief for our taxpayers as i mentioned we have also identified another 200 million plus in departmental savings opportunities throughout the budget which we will apply this year i thank treasurer liz muoio and her team for their hard work work that has added up to over 1 1 billion in savings by anybody s standard over 1 1 billion in sustainable savings is real and substantial i also thank human services commissioner carole johnson for her knowledgeable leadership in finding an additional quarter of a billion dollars in recoverable medicaid funds plus millions more in other efficiencies that will allow us to maximize our federal dollars while protecting beneficiaries we are building a stronger fiscal house for new jersey we are replacing gimmicks with stability for example the projected surplus of the budget i signed last year was 765 million a vast improvement over prior budgets but through careful management and keeping an eye on every dollar we have grown our surplus by one third over the year and are now set to close fiscal 2019 with a surplus of over 1 billion this budget will grow our surplus even more in fiscal 2020 to nearly 1 2 billion i ask you to find the last time we had consecutive years of billion dollar plus surpluses last year i proposed a budget that significantly cut back on the use of one shots and this budget once again maintains that example one shot revenues are down to only 1 7 percent a decrease of one third over the current budget and half the average yearly amount across the prior administration and in this budget we are significantly curtailing fund diversions we are eliminating entirely the diversion from the affordable housing trust fund so lieutenant governor oliver and her team at dca can do more to ensure the accessibility of safe and affordable housing and through the clean energy fund we will put more than 70 million back to work to make critical investments in our clean energy economy this shows how far we have already come in fixing the structural problems that years of past fiscal decisions had created and we know there s still work to do especially with our surplus we must remain vigilant to safeguard these funds and not to view them as just extra cash laying around to be raided for any number of programs or projects no matter how well intentioned reducing our reliance on one shots and diversions means greater year over year fiscal predictability and reliability but the real value is that they allow us to make the investments we need to make new jersey a stronger and fairer state for every family and reaching these fiscal mileposts will not go unnoticed by the rating agencies with whom i will visit later this week and whose decisions greatly impact our future sustainability because with a more sustainable fiscal future we can make more sustainable investments in our future last year we began the process of finally fulfilling our obligations to our public schools increasing our investment in k through 12 classrooms by more than 350 million let there be no doubt this investment is one reason why 2018 saw the lowest increase in the average statewide property tax bill not just in the last nine years but on record and the work to modernize our formula to meet the on the ground needs of districts today led by senate president sweeney is ensuring that school funding dollars are more efficiently and effectively following our children we also increased investment in high quality pre k programs today in 64 additional school districts more than 4 400 three and four year olds now have access to pre k they lacked just one year ago this budget maintains this commitment to our kids and our public schools starting with an additional 206 million to ramp up to the full k through 12 formula funding there is 68 million more to not only maintain but to expand pre k these commitments mean we can continue to be a national leader in the delivery of high quality public education and our budget continues our computer science for all initiative this gives more high school students especially minority students access to an advanced computer science course so they can earn college credits and industry credentials and go on to increase the diversity of our innovation economy our budget includes 5 million more for tuition aid grants and an additional 2 25 million to support the educational opportunity fund this is the 50th year in which accomplished students like aurelio are benefitting from eof it is the greatest legislative legacy of former governor tom kean who sponsored the original bill let s ensure it continues to write new chapters for our students last year we inaugurated a grant program that in concert with eof and tag and other available aid is helping 13 000 qualified students to pursue an associate s degree tuition free at one of 13 community colleges this budget will grow our investment in community college opportunity grants to reach a total of 18 000 students in the 2019 2020 academic year at every community college and more of them will be pursuing a degree full time and our budget looks to a new way to help our four year public colleges and universities we propose 20 million in new formula driven aid based on what is needed to ensure the best outcomes for all students and reflect the diversity of our state this is a first step in funding higher education through fairness and not politics it is part of the broader state plan which higher education secretary zakiya smith ellis will be releasing in the near future last year we enhanced and refocused our investment in workforce development and apprenticeship programs we awarded grants expanding opportunities for thousands more to learn and master the skills that will lead them into good paying family supporting careers this budget continues this commitment our blueprint for the middle class through its investments in education and workforce development will continue to make a more competitive and more affordable new jersey in our current budget we restored direct property tax relief to thousands of middle class families who were cut off by the prior administration i thank speaker coughlin for leading the fight to restore this relief and this budget maintains our commitment with 283 million in direct property tax relief for our middle class families and seniors in a state with an unmatched location and a regional economy built on moving people and goods there is no higher priority than fixing nj transit we owe our commuters a transportation system that makes their lives smoother rather than harder they deserve a system that is safer more reliable and customer oriented our current budget began the long process of turning around an agency that had been hollowed out by years of disinvestment and mismanagement leaving customers as second class citizens and hurting our economic well being last year commuters were spared a fare hike and if we pass this budget s investment there won t be one this year either through our current investment nj transit has moved ahead with procurement of new rail cars and buses to build capacity and relieve overcrowding we are rebuilding the gutted ranks of rail engineers and bus operators needed to keep the lines running and i cannot wait to welcome our first class of new train engineers later this spring because of our investment nj transit was able to push forward to meet the federal government s december 31 2018 deadline on positive train control a feat almost no one outside our administration and i mean almost no one thought possible on friday i signed legislation that expands a commuter tax cut allowing more commuters to directly benefit from pre tax savings accounts to pay for their rail or bus fares this can keep hundreds of extra dollars a year in their pockets nj transit has also reached agreement with amtrak on millions of dollars worth of back payments they are now working together on joint investments in infrastructure and renovations at new york penn station that will improve the customer experience this budget maintains all of this progress it will provide 407 million in general fund support to nj transit this 100 million increase will replace 75 million in fund diversions in addition to providing 25 million in new direct funding this keeps nj transit on the path to being the turnaround story of the nation it keeps rebuilding the ranks of professionals needed to keep our system running and most importantly it keeps improving service to our commuters it s this simple an investment in nj transit is a direct investment in our economy our business environment and our commuters it s an investment in hard working people like tawana and in the people she will take to and from work every day and we will responsibly invest in meeting our pension obligation and continuing the progress to bringing the pension funds back to health with a second straight record setting payment this year s totaling 3 8 billion our pension obligation like many of our challenges nj transit and school funding among others did not spring up overnight it grew because decisions made by both parties allowed it to grow i know this particular challenge well perhaps better than many i studied it in depth more than a decade ago when governor codey asked me to chair the first pension and benefits task force but the message our task force put forward nearly a decade and a half ago is just as true today we cannot look for quick outs or easy fixes because they simply don t exist it took us years to get to this point and it will take years of good faith efforts efforts that must include our public employees our educators and our first responders to successfully get past it and that is why we are making this record 3 8 billion pension contribution to keep our promises and to meet our fiscal challenges head on we must ensure that our commitment to affordable high quality health care and evidence based policymaking remains as strong as ever our current budget restored funding for planned parenthood and women s health care as a result of that investment over 10 000 more patients both women and men were served in 2018 compared to 2017 at the national level president trump and his administration are continuing their assault on title x putting the health of millions of women across the country at risk for starkly partisan and political reasons in new jersey we re showing the better way forward last year four clinics were added where residents could receive family planning services and an entirely new health clinic opened at rutgers newark patients gained access to 8 000 additional hours to receive vital services including potentially life saving cancer screenings more than 40 critical staffing roles were filled more than 80 000 std tests were provided free of charge and today more women have access to long acting birth control this budget maintains our commitment so we can continue to build upon this progress over the past year the first lady has taken on the growing racial disparity in maternal health alongside twelve of our commissioners leaders in our health care and faith communities legislators and many others i want to give a special shout out to health commissioner dr shereef elnahal children and families commissioner christine norbut beyer and human services commissioner carole johnson the facts are jarring new jersey ranks 45th in the nation yes 45th in maternal death rate nearly double the national average even worse 60 percent of new mothers who die because of complications from childbirth are women of color a black baby in new jersey is three times more likely to die in his or her first year of life than a white baby the widest racial disparity in the nation to combat this the first lady and our administration inaugurated the nurturenj campaign to raise awareness of our maternal and child mortality crisis and to develop a comprehensive interagency plan this budget will support these efforts to bring together more experts and residents in the search for lasting solutions and our budget will provide 1 million through our medicaid program for doulas who play a critical role in reversing these statistics medicaid covers 40 percent of all childbirths in new jersey and these babies deserve a chance as much as any other these babies are far from the only vulnerable new jerseyans this budget seeks to help while we will maintain our commitment to emergency aid for homeless residents this budget also recognizes that money alone is not an answer to this vexing problem we ll take a broader approach through the creation of an office of homelessness initiatives in the department of community affairs to act as a hub for more strategic and coordinated efforts where we use data and analytics to create and implement solutions to address people s housing needs especially among our veterans from prevention to emergencies to permanency and our budget will provide critical resources to allow individuals with both developmental disabilities and mental health challenges to thrive in their communities in addition we will do more to alleviate the costs pushed onto our medicaid system by large employers who leave workers to rely on medicaid instead of offering a health care plan this budget will ask employers with 50 or more employees on medicaid to pay a small corporate responsibility fee of 150 for each one of these employees they should share in the burden of paying for their employees care rather than leaving it to the rest of us and our budget will maintain our commitment to working families in other ways including continuing the child and dependent care tax credit we passed together last year which is benefitting more than 74 000 new jersey families we are continuing to support smart compassionate and just prisoner reentry efforts i commend governor mcgreevey and our faith based communities for all their great work on the front lines our budget this year will increase investments in programs proven to decrease rates of recidivism and will support the ability of incarcerated individuals to continue their education so they can find second chances when they come back to our communities in every respect we commit to reforming our criminal justice system for the better in our current budget we set aside 100 million to directly combat our opioid epidemic through carefully designed programs and thoughtful data driven analysis to put resources where they are most needed we are ever mindful that the opioid epidemic was ravaging our cities long before it made headlines this budget maintains our commitment and proposes increasing fees on opioid drug distributors and manufacturers to help support our fight against the opioid epidemic other states red and blue alike are taking similar steps let s join them let s send a clear message that we should be working together to end our national addiction to opioids not to continue feeding it as we look to building the new jersey of the future we must be mindful of our ability to continue these investments well into our future in my budget address one year ago i called for us to enact a new way in which we provide the tax incentives that help us attract and retain businesses i spoke directly to it in october when i released my economic master plan and i reiterated this call in my state of the state address seven weeks ago there are many opinions on our current system of open ended corporate tax breaks but here is a simple fact the potential impact of past corporate tax breaks on corporate business tax collection in the coming fiscal year surpasses 1 billion and it will remain over 1 billion annually for at least the next three fiscal years the simple fact is that we are currently obligated i repeat obligated to corporate tax breaks totaling 11 billion through at least fiscal year 2031 and lest we forget for all of these incentives before this administration took office new jersey was 42nd in job growth and 49th in wage growth while key investments in education and infrastructure like a tunnel under the hudson river never happened even under a capped program yes we would see some loss in corporate business tax revenues but it would be predictable and sustainable we can provide strategic incentives without hurting our ability to reinvest in the things that bolster our economy and help our businesses like education and property tax relief workforce development and nj transit that tunnel to new york would be nice too tax incentives transparent and accountable smartly devised and strategically deployed have a vital role to play in a focused economic growth plan they are a needed step in undertaking structural fiscal reform and restoring middle class affordability i am a pro growth progressive i want the world s biggest and best technology clean energy and life sciences companies to come and expand here but i am even more committed to the next generation being born and growing here reforming how we jumpstart job creation needs to be about both creating jobs and more wisely investing taxpayer money the companies dreaming of making it big in new jersey like carbon22 deserve our support we must be smart and strategic about how we encourage new startups and entrepreneurs about how we nurture more businesses owned by women by persons of color and by veterans and about how we lead the world in clean energy solutions like offshore wind we can reclaim and dominate all aspects of the innovation economy that s why we need innovative incentive programs to be pro business in the 21st century you need to be agile and creative just like the businesses we want to grow our current programs expire june 30 along with the current budget i ask you to join me now with renewed purpose in creating the new suite of smart focused and capped incentive programs we need to boost our people and our economy without compromising our ability to invest in our people and our economy we can do this on a parallel track as we work on our final budget and we can enact them together in fact we must because together we enacted a responsibly balanced budget that invests in our people and our infrastructure and which stands for fairness for our middle class new jersey s priorities stand proudly in contrast with those of president trump and his administration right now across the state countless middle class families are doing their taxes and wondering where the tax cuts they were promised by president trump and his enablers went many barely felt the impact in their take home pay and now they re getting less back in their refunds many others because of their now limited state and local tax deduction are actually paying more our new congressional delegation along with those from our neighboring states democrats and republicans alike announced legislation to restore the full middle class salt deduction by in part simply asking the wealthiest to go back to paying what they paid in 2017 i commend their efforts and give them my full support and ten days ago i joined with governors from other states adversely impacted by the salt cap to announce our concerted efforts to have it reversed but while those efforts are ongoing and while our middle class is trying to figure out where their tax relief went those at the very top are shouldering less and less of their fair share of the tax burden that s the opposite of tax fairness let s work together to apply the millionaire s tax to every millionaire by doing so we can do more to relieve the burden on middle class taxpayers and senior citizens who are taking it on the chin from the trump administration s tax scam let s be absolutely clear this is not a tax that will be paid by anyone in the middle class period full stop but it is revenue that is necessary to strengthen and expand the middle class as i have underscored we have done a great deal of work to save money 1 1 billion in this budget in order to address our fiscal challenges and we must have the same commitment to support the middle class and those aspiring to get there our taxpayers overwhelmingly support this across party lines and across the state we should listen to them and do this together and we know they also support our work to legalize and regulate adult use marijuana i thank senate president sweeney speaker coughlin and senator scutari for their partnership i know we re not across the finish line yet but we are closer than ever before most importantly this is the right step for eliminating decades old and persistent racial and social inequities but it is also our chance to create an entirely new state based industry with the potential to create thousands of good paying jobs expand opportunities for minority business owners and jumpstart billions of dollars in new economic activity i will only sign this if it expunges the records of those who have been put through our criminal justice system for prior marijuana offenses this is an unfinished item from last year s to do list let s commit to completing this effort together and i renew my call for us to increase the fees for gun licenses and handgun permits it was long past time we did this last year when we took so many steps to restore our standing as a national leader in gun safety and it s even more past time today our gun fees were set in 1966 when governor richard hughes worked in this building it s now 2019 it is actually cheaper to get a permit to purchase a handgun 2 than it is to get a dog license in many of our communities this is what s needed to support the efforts of attorney general gurbir grewal our state troopers and county and local law enforcement to fight crime and track gun violence and to combat the trafficking of illegal guns into our state in 2018 roughly 80 percent of guns used in the commission of a crime came from out of state as with our other efforts i know the people of new jersey will support us this budget isn t about getting us through the next year it s about putting ourselves on a trajectory to be that new jersey we want to be in ten years we all must be part of this no one should be pointing from the sidelines and leaving the hard work of governing to others we must all find ourselves with some dirt on our uniforms it was one of our greatest presidents teddy roosevelt who told us the credit goes to those actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and

frankfurt am main afp advertising read more economists believe global headwinds will prompt the european central bank to lower growth and inflation forecasts thursday but the frankfurt institution could also highlight ways of responding to the slowdown expansion in the 19 nation eurozone slowed sharply in 2018 and is forecast to fall further this year as geopolitical uncertainty slowing growth in emerging markets and trade conflicts take their toll despite resilient domestic fundamentals ecb staff could cut their outlook for growth from the 1 7 percent predicted in december by 0 2 or 0 3 percentage points analysts say that would leave the central bank slightly more optimistic than the european commission but less sanguine than the international monetary fund imf both of which have trimmed their expectations since the start of this year any revision which does not go lower than the current consensus of 1 4 percent is simply proof of the ecb s sense of reality and no reason to panic ing diba bank economist carsten brzeski said future growth is difficult to judge for now as the eurozone still wobbles between decent domestic demand and increased external risks he added strong storms strong foundations both soft indicators such as business confidence and hard data like industrial production have fallen in recent months in the single currency area trade conflicts between washington brussels and beijing slowing growth in important export markets like china and looming uncertainty over britain s withdrawal from the european union or brexit have undermined confidence and slowed economic expansion ecb president mario draghi acknowledged in january that risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook have moved to the downside but singled out such external factors as causes for the gloomier picture domestically unemployment held steady in february at 7 8 percent its lowest level since 2008 the eu statistics authority eurostat said last week and wages are rising in countries like germany where shortages of skilled workers are making themselves felt but the stronger labour market has not had the expected impact of boosting inflation towards the ecb s target of close to but below 2 0 percent the core of its mandate to secure price stability over the medium term year on year price growth was just 1 5 percent in february and 1 4 percent in january eurostat said with the core figure ruling out volatile items like food alcohol and energy even lower at 1 0 percent the ecb will likely further reduce its inflation outlook thursday from december s projections which called for the rate to rise from 1 6 percent this year to 1 8 percent by 2021 cheap loans to banks some observers see the ecb blocked from responding to the soft patch in growth after years of crisis firefighting in december it ended more than three years of mass quantitative easing purchases of government and corporate bonds which ultimately amounted to 2 6 trillion euros 3 0 trillion although it will for now replenish its stock as bonds mature meanwhile interest rates are fixed at historic lows at least through the summer of 2019 in its regular policy statements leaving little room to stimulate the economy by traditional means the ecb s governing council would be loath to restart bond purchases short of a major crisis and lowering rates still further is unrealistic although the horizon for raising them could be pushed further into the future we suspect that there is still no consensus on the next policy moves among members capital economics analyst andrew kenningham commented one option widely mooted in recent weeks including by ecb board members is a repeat of low cost loans to banks known as targeted long term refinancing operations tltros keeping banks well supplied with cash could prevent a slowdown in lending to the real economy which would in turn hinder growth and inflation rather than take action immediately the march meeting could see draghi tasking the relevant committees again to look into technical options for new tltros to be unveiled in april and implemented in june pictet bank economist fredrik ducrozet suggested 2019 afp
after he had defeated the roman army in two battles in 280 and 279 bc king pyrrhus of the greek state of epirus replied to one that gave him joy of his victory that one other such victory would utterly undo him for he had lost a great part of the forces he brought with him and almost all his particular friends and principal commanders plutarch greek prime minister alexis tsipras could have said the same when eu officials celebrated greece s exit from its eight year adjustment program last august the devastation of the greek economy after the completion of adjustment would have justified it instead he joined in the celebration yet there is very little hope that the greek economy will ever recover from this victory as long as it remains trapped in european monetary and economic union for membership in emu keeps greece locked in deflationary debt and cost reduction with which it cannot cope despite all well intended structural reform phase 1 a mountain of debt when greece joined the emu in 2001 interest rates for private and public borrowers fell to levels never seen before by any living greek citizen as a result private households companies and the government went on a borrowing binge total credit to the non financial sector more than doubled in 2001 2008 increasing by a lot more than nominal gdp interest rates increased a little in 2006 but this was regarded as a normal reaction to the cyclical upswing however conditions began to change in 2007 with the beginning of the financial crisis in the united states risk premia edged up on weaker borrowers and greek borrowers certainly belonged to this category phase 2 deflationary deleveraging in the emu trap the increase in new private borrowing calculated as the year on year change in private sector credit stocks by more than 150 had helped to boost nominal gdp by 60 between the first quarter of 2001 and the third quarter of 2008 however following the intensification of the great financial crisis after the failure of lehman brothers in september 2008 new private borrowing began to fall dragging down nominal gdp in its wake towards the end of 2009 the newly elected socialist greek government shocked eu officials and markets by disclosing a much larger than earlier reported government budget deficit this and subsequent admissions that government budget deficit statistics had been forged for years to gain admission to emu triggered a government debt crisis which quickly mutated into a banking crisis the decline in new private borrowing was briefly interrupted in the first half of 2010 when greece received financial assistance from other euro area countries and the newly created european financial stability facility later merged into the european stability mechanism but it continued thereafter whatever it takes by the third quarter of 2012 new private borrowing had dropped by 167 below its peak although it recovered somewhat in the wake of ecb president draghi s famous assurance to do whatever it takes to save the euro nominal gdp continued to decline until the fourth quarter of 2013 to a level 27 below its peak the continuing recovery of new borrowing helped to stabilize gdp but it was not strong enough to return the economy to healthy growth hence greece experienced cost and price deflation debt cost and price deflation took a heavy toll on the economy greece did not participate in the economic recovery of other emu countries after the great financial crisis and the euro crisis of 2011 12 see chart 5 instead trapped in the emu greece experienced one of the worst deflationary deleveraging crises in history compared to the greek depression the u s depression of the early 1930s appears transitory see chart 6 while it took the united states eight years to get real gdp back to its pre depression peak greek real gdp has remained way below its 2008 peak now for a decade against the background of a weakening euro area economy prospects for the greek economy to ever make up the losses of the past decade do not look good phase 3 the illusion of structural reform few countries have been able to escape deflationary deleveraging and cost reduction without money printing and currency devaluation latvia is one example radical and front loaded cost and debt deflation combined with a high degree of economic flexibility set the state for the subsequent recovery of the economy greece followed a different script policy makers neither allowed it to escape the monetary straightjacket of the currency union nor did they accept radical debt reduction instead they pressed for structural reforms the idea was to build a new economic environment able to attract investors creating new jobs and incomes so that the economy could grow out of its debt burden and overcome its cost disadvantages with the benefit of hindsight it is clear that they overestimated the ability of the greek people to reinvent itself businesses in general and investors in particular enjoy less freedom property rights are weaker and judicial effectiveness is lower than in germany for example to overcome its severe handicaps in the form of excessive debt and high costs greece would need to offer big advantages for business investors in reality however it is still disadvantaged locked in depression despite huge external financial assistance and many years of efforts of reform greece has not escaped depressionary debt and cost deflation the meagre growth of 2017 18 will probably peter out in the looming euro area recession the conclusion is both inevitable and sad as long as greece remains locked in the emu its economic future looks bleak chart 5 chart 6

the call over to mike callahan mike michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thanks les good morning and thank you for joining us today i will begin today s call with a review of our operating highlights and some market commentary and then lynn will cover our financial results in more detail we will then open the line for your questions now turning to slide 3 we were pleased to deliver a solid third quarter highlighted by record net sales and adjusted ebitda for both our reported and base business results our organic sales increase of 6 6 reflects strength and balance in both our product offering and the markets that we serve we did face some challenges on the sales front however including lost shipping days associated with some abnormally wet and extremely cold weather conditions in the quarter and further softening in the canadian single family residential construction market organic revenue growth was broad based across each of our product lines with 3 9 growth in wallboard sales 10 6 growth in ceilings and 13 1 growth in steel framing other product net sales were also up 4 5 organically on the profitability front we generated a 41 5 year over year increase in adjusted ebitda to a record 59 7 million for the third fiscal quarter the increase reflect the contributions from titan increased operating leverage including benefits from the cost savings initiatives undertaken earlier this fiscal year continued pricing improvement and favorable lease accounting let me touch on a few of these areas next in the third quarter there were some further softening in the canadian single family residential market which resulted in sales of our canadian business declining low single digits on a constant currency basis with further impact from about a 5 depreciation in the canadian dollar year over year nonetheless titan continues to be very accretive to our consolidated operating results our long term strategic rationale for the acquisition of titan including increased scale and footprint in north america geographic expansion into the highly attractive and fragmented canadian market and creation of a well balanced platform for growth remains very compelling the integration continues to progress well as we have continued to work closely with our key suppliers to generate purchasing synergies and take advantage of our scale and the power of our north american platform with the commencement of our annual purchasing programs in january 19 we began to realize our purchasing synergies at the run rate associated with our previously announced 10 million target for purchasing synergies and we continue to expect to exceed our original 10 million estimate for fiscal 20 and we continue to look for even more synergies with our cross border suppliers and through other non purchasing initiatives we have also continued to make progress on our previously announced strategic cost reduction initiatives in the us as demonstrated to the 130 basis points of operating leverage achieved during the fiscal third quarter which excludes the impact of the change in lease accounting as expected we achieved full run rate savings as of january 19 and are on track to realize the full 20 million annual benefit of these initiatives in fiscal 20 we generated strong free cash flow of 55 6 million during the quarter which enabled us to reduce our net debt by 32 8 million and repurchase 11 5 million of our common stock under the repurchase authorization announced last quarter we also opened a greenfield location just outside akron ohio and this morning announced the acquisition of commercial builders group llc subsequent to the end of the quarter this tuck in acquisition operates two facilities in the greater new orleans and baton rouge louisiana markets adding coverage of two important top 100 metro areas in the us as evidenced by all of these actions we are executing on our stated and balanced capital allocation strategies of debt reduction disciplined growth through acquisitions and greenfields and opportunistic share repurchases i d now like to spend a few moments explaining our current view of the end markets that we serve now as a reminder we estimate that approximately 55 of our consolidated revenues are to the commercial construction markets and approximately 45 is related to residential construction with just less than half of that 45 related to new single family residential construction since the latter part of calendar 2018 there has been a great deal of speculation with respect to the current macroeconomic outlook and the potential impact on residential and commercial construction from our perspective we remain encouraged by what we re seeing across our business and in the broader economy as it relates to residential construction while it s still early in the traditional spring selling season we believe the late 18 slowdown in new single family residential construction was related to a confluence of factors including a rise in interest rates home price appreciation and resulting affordability issues and geopolitical uncertainty like others while we expect that this market may take a pause we do not currently believe they will be prolonged or particularly deep jobs and income growth remained at very healthy levels and many of the major markets in the us continue to have limited housing supply as building remains below historical averages all of which bodes very well for the mid to long term outlook on the commercial front which represents the majority of our business most indicators and estimates point to continued growth against the backdrop of an economy that remains healthy we are seeing that in our own business with strong backlogs and quote activity in my recent visits to many of our locations in multiple geographies i ve heard from our own people and peak ph commercial customers that pipelines are strong extending through calendar 2019 and in some cases even in calendar 2020 while it s impossible to predict what levels of growth are ultimately realized near term in the markets we serve we remain focused on controlling what we can we believe our market leading position in the distribution of interior building products our balanced product portfolio and our diversified exposure across commercial and residential new and r r construction markets which we believe continue to exhibit healthy long term fundamentals will enable us to continue to take advantage of growth opportunities across our business both now and in the future looking to the balance of fiscal 2019 and beyond we remain committed to growing our business both organically and through selective acquisitions with an emphasis on profitability and free cash flow generation with which reducing debt remains a priority now with that i will turn it over to lynn for a more detailed review of the financial results lynn lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller thanks mike and i would also like to thank you all for joining us on the call today we were pleased to deliver a solid third quarter highlighted by record net sales and adjusted ebitda performance and strong free cash flow generation looking at slide 4 we grew net sales 23 6 to 723 9 million and increased our base business sales during the quarter by 6 6 compared to the third quarter of last fiscal year our wallboard net sales increased 16 to 297 million in the third quarter compared to the same period last year it was driven by acquisitions and pricing the 3 9 growth on an organic basis was comprised of a strong pricing gains of approximately 4 and flat volume the latter of which was due in large part to the lost shipping days in the us and lower sales in canada our third quarter ceiling sales increased by 16 4 year over year to 105 million as a result of pricing improvement higher organic volumes resulting from increased commercial business and the positive benefit of acquisitions the 10 6 organic increase was comprised of price increases of approximately 7 as well as higher volumes of approximately 3 our steel framing sales increased during the quarter by 21 4 year over year to 117 4 million this was driven by strong pricing gains acquisitions and higher organic volumes from greater commercial business the 13 1 organic increase included price gains of approximately 10 and an uptick in volume of approximately 3 our sales of other products which consist of installation joint compound tools inaudible and other complementary products totaled almost 204 million and were up 43 6 compared to the third quarter of last year the recent acquisition of titan have expanded the breadth of our product offerings while at the same time our 4 5 increase in our base business sales of other products reinforces the success of our efforts to continue to grow this other product category our gross profit increased almost 20 to 234 2 million on higher sales including the positive impact from acquisitions our gross margin of 32 4 declined from 33 4 a year ago primarily due to increased product costs as well as changes in product mix also last quarter s third quarter gross margin was a tough comparison being the highest gross margin level of any quarter last fiscal year and positively impacted by a higher level of supplier incentives associated with a larger level of wallboard pre buy rising product costs over the past year included two wallboard increases multiple steel and ceiling grid increases as well as various freight surcharges on a sequential basis gross margin improved 20 basis points from the second quarter and slightly exceeded the 32 2 guidance we indicated in last quarter s call which we continue to believe is a reasonable benchmark for the remainder of this fiscal year related technical difficulty to our ph wallboard increase we believe price cost dynamics turning to slide 5 we reduced our adjusted sg a as a percentage of net sales by 210 ph basis points year over year to 24 2 in the quarter a 130 basis points of the reduction was the result of increased cost efficiencies primarily due to the cost reduction initiatives taken during this fiscal year as well as contributions from the titan acquisition these were partially offset by continuing inflationary pressures primarily in logistics costs as well as higher costs operating with the weather disruptions mike referenced earlier the remaining 80 basis points of the reduction was driven by changes to lease accounting as we ve discussed we ve made significant progress on these reduction initiatives and we continue to find many opportunities to further streamline our business as a result we would expect fourth quarter adjusted sg a as a percentage of sales to decrease year over year at least by the level we experienced in the third quarter we delivered 59 7 million in adjusted ebitda in the third quarter this was up 41 5 year over year from 42 2 million in the prior year quarter adjusted ebitda margin was 8 2 as a percentage of sales or 7 4 if you exclude the impact of our lease accounting which was up 20 basis points from 7 2 a year ago turning to slide 6 during the third fiscal quarter we generated over 55 million of free cash flow this enabled us to reduce our net debt by 33 million as well as repurchase 11 5 million of our common shares as of january 31 our net debt to ltm pro forma adjusted ebitda was 3 8 times this was consistent with the level as of the end of q2 we intend to continue to de lever through strong free cash flow generation and as a reminder our current leverage ratio post titan compares favorably to 2014 when our ratio was six times as well as just prior to our may 2016 ipo when it was 4 3 times additionally of our total long term debt approximately just over 75 is not due until 2025 also in order to hedge against potential future interest rate volatility in february we entered into an interest rate swap agreement this agreement effectively provides a fixed rate on 0 5 billion of our first lien term debt our balance sheet remains healthy with 74 3 million cash on hand and 220 million available under our abl facilities this results in substantial liquidity for the business now let me turn the call back over to mike before we open the line for questions michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thanks lynn just a few additional comments before we open the line for questions we are pleased with our third quarter performance and believe that as the market leading distributor of interior building products with significant scale advantages combined with local expertise we are poised for continued growth our third quarter results provided further evidence of this with sales and adjusted ebitda growth of over 23 and 41 respectively we continue to take advantage of our multiple levers to drive this growth through organic growth greenfields m a and operating leverage we believe our large diverse end markets continue to exhibit healthy fundamentals providing us with significant growth opportunities across our business both now and in the future and then finally and probably most importantly our great network of dedicated gms employees in both the us and canada continue to embrace our strong entrepreneurial culture to deliver the outstanding service to our customers that we believe will deliver profitable growth over time to our shareholders and with that operator we re now ready to open the line up for questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from the line of michael wood with nomura instinet please proceed with your question ryan nomura instinet analyst hey guys this is ryan calling on for mike did logistics surprise you was this sudden and can you just explain how logistics hurt sg a whether this is freight rates or inefficiencies michael callahan president chief executive officer and director well i think the short answer to that is as i mentioned there was definitely some impacts weather related and the reality is that when you re when you re dealing with production challenges just in terms of getting loads out your logistics and efficiency in terms of labor utilization is impacted so i would say that really was a key factor in how logistics impacted us in the quarter ryan nomura instinet analyst okay thank you and then just one follow up how did flat organic wallboard volumes compare to industry sell through in your view lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller yeah thanks for the question in terms of how we compare it to the industry the gypsum association data our read on that data is that we believe that we maintained share we believe that most of the both year to date decline and quarter over quarter decline in the gypsum association was due to the impact of pre buy so looking at that we believe our flat volumes indicate that we are on par with our market share ryan nomura instinet analyst thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of david manthey with baird please proceed with your question david manthey robert w baird co analyst thank you good morning michael callahan president chief executive officer and director hi dave david manthey robert w baird co analyst hey good morning first off you mentioned that your gross margin percentage was lower due partly to higher product costs but clearly your realized selling prices were higher also i guess this implies the price cost relationship is negative could you talk a little bit about that relationship and why you think that happened lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller yeah sure thanks for the question related to the year over year decline in gross margin this was due to like we said some changes in product cost and mix in addition the prior year comp was really impacted by a higher level of volume incentives that we realized in the third quarter of prior year due to the december 2017 pre buy david manthey robert w baird co analyst okay thank you and then second what is your outlook for price in the coming 12 months to 18 months i guess we should assume a little bit less leverage on sg a if your pricing moderates down is that your assumption michael callahan president chief executive officer and director no that s not our assumption at this point i mean as you know dave price in terms of wallboard the price increases literally rolling out as we speak and then it took effect in the first part of march so there have been announced increases as always it takes a period of time for to settle out but our assumption right now is to continue to look through the pending increase of the existing increase and see how it settles in we re not baking in a lower price environment for the year david manthey robert w baird co analyst i just meant more moderate price increases than last year in steel for example michael callahan president chief executive officer and director oh i m sorry i would say yeah probably would say generally speaking i think if you look at steel prices they certainly have moderated kind of flattened out but i think that s a safe assumption yeah the only caveat to that might be insulation i think insulation is still on the bubble as it relates to the inflation david manthey robert w baird co analyst great all right thanks mike michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thanks david operator thank you our next question comes from the line of trey grooms with stephens inc please proceed with your question trey grooms stephens inc analyst hey good morning michael callahan president chief executive officer and director good morning trey trey grooms stephens inc analyst just real quick i guess kind of following up with the last question is the looking out on pricing you mentioned maybe a little bit more moderate price increases were you talking specifically just for clarity around wallboard pricing or and i know you mentioned steel but wallboard pricing or ceilings any is it both or one or the other that you re referring to just for clarity michael callahan president chief executive officer and director i would say that in terms of the pricing going forward wallboard certainly the increase as i said is in the process of rolling out as we speak i think in terms of ceilings as we ve often said ceilings generally tends to price up one to two increases a year it s a 3 to 5 increase generally speaking on ceilings insulation there still seems to be pressure on pricing as far as that goes so i would anticipate maybe be some inflation there and but steel has definitely settled down a bit and i don t see any near term price increases there trey grooms stephens inc analyst all right well thanks for that just hearing that you are expecting more moderate i just was making sure we were fully understanding that comment okay and then secondly is the canadian market is clearly weakened was down this most recent quarter for you guys what are you hearing from your customers there and their outlook for the building season in that market as we re kind of at least starting to come into view with the building season here in canada michael callahan president chief executive officer and director well there is a general backdrop clearly just in this period of time tends to be a seasonal slowdown for canada anyway just based on the snow and cold conditions i would say the outlook right now on the single family side there definitely has been some downward pressure single family detached so the stand alone homes definitely have seen and a lot of that frankly has to do with the mortgage programs they have in place and the stress test that the canadian government essentially has imposed on mortgages so that s definitely had an impact but i would say that the when you look at the commercial high rise and commercial development as well as the commercial multi family and this pretty much goes across the board the market outlook is still very positive so i would say as far as canada is concerned it s pretty well not completely isolated but for the most part it s that single family detached business which is under pressure right now but our view is still positive i mean i think the market overall is sound and the outlook is generally pretty optimistic trey grooms stephens inc analyst okay thank you and last one from me is just on with the increases that are out there especially on wallboard are you guys seeing or are you guys participating in any pre buy of any size at this point lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller no we ve had limited pre buy this season trey grooms stephens inc analyst all right that s it for me i ll pass it on thanks a lot michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thanks trey operator thank you our next question comes from the line of keith hughes with suntrust robinson humphrey please proceed with your question keith hughes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst thank you the ebitda margins were up 20 basis points year over year excluding the change in the leases i assume were your organic margins down given the titan usually mixes you up and if so kind of how much lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller yeah thanks for the question keith we don t break it down by the geographies keith hughes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst okay let me ask you this way on titan you talked about sales being weak if you kind of comment i know you didn t own it last year but just roughly how did their margins look compared to last year given the weak environment lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller yeah keith they were lower and their sg a as a percentage of sales was also impacted by the same weather conditions that we discussed and one thing on a constant currency basis sales were down 2 the canadian dollar did decline about 5 and that resulted in about a little bit less than 1 million impact on their adjusted ebitda keith hughes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst and just one small question on this come up in the fourth quarter the interest expense we saw in the third is that roughly a tax rate is that roughly what we ll see in the fourth quarter leslie h kratcoski vice president of investor relations yes that s a good way to think about the fourth quarter in terms of interest and taxes keith hughes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst okay great thank you michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thanks keith operator thank you our next question comes from the line of matt bouley with barclays please proceed with your question matthew adrien bouley barclays bank plc analyst hi thank you for taking my questions mike are you able to kind of quantify the impact of lost shipping days in the quarter and then maybe provide any comments around what you ve seen i guess in february thus far thanks michael callahan president chief executive officer and director yeah thanks matt you know it s really tough to quantify the bulk of the impact in terms of weather tends to gravitate toward single family and if you look at our numbers overall our mix you re probably looking 22 23 of our business overall is new revenue if you break it down on that basis so when you think about that given the just the magnitude of the impact that had on the single family piece and it is we lost numerous shipping days it s not just the fact that it rains for three or four consecutive days but it s also that you ve got to get the job sites themselves to dry out so while i can t really quantify that i think anybody that s been looking at the news and seeing it from texas all the way to dc that we ve all had to deal with pretty adverse conditions now we ll say that the november december we re under a lot of pressure january we saw a significant pick up in momentum and activity which carried over into february so i would say that the momentum activity in january plus frankly we were delivering on saturdays trying to catch up which also leads to some sg a pressure frankly in terms of overtime and things such as that so if you pick all that together so we re trying to catch up as best we can but fundamentally i think the january february momentum levels give us cause for optimism going into the fourth quarter leslie h kratcoski vice president of investor relations yeah i would note also that our february per day sales is up versus prior year on an organic basis michael callahan president chief executive officer and director that s a good point matthew adrien bouley barclays bank plc analyst okay appreciate that detail excuse me and then secondly just following up on the titan business in canada obviously you called out the challenges on the single family side and that the data seems to be a bit better on the multi family side could you remind us of titan s multi family versus single family exposure and then just maybe put some finer points around what you re seeing on the multifamily side specifically because i do think that the data has been a bit stronger there thank you michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thanks leslie h kratcoski vice president of investor relations yeah there are 40 commercial construction and then 60 resi on the resi side about 40 new and then in that 40 of the total in market and 20 r r and we estimate on the commercial side that there s 10 new and 30 r r matthew adrien bouley barclays bank plc analyst okay appreciate the detail thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of michael dahl with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question michael glaser dahl rbc capital markets analyst good morning thanks for taking my questions michael callahan president chief executive officer and director good morning michael michael glaser dahl rbc capital markets analyst mike i wanted to follow up on the pricing comments again actually two parts of it but first on the wallboard side i think you d ph mentioned not really any pre buy right now and you re talking about seeing how the price increases settle out there early on but is there anything to interpret in terms of how you re viewing the market and the likelihood for price in terms of you guys not participating in pre buy michael callahan president chief executive officer and director well first off the circumstances around pre buy this year different because of the increase itself is pushed out so routinely this is a january increase and it got pushed out this year so and then of course based on some of the conditions relative to deliveries and some of the pressure just to build ability to find a place to put the board was limited based on our inventory positions and delivery lag so the general outlook mike is that we are going to be nimble as the price increase is introduced into the marketplace but it s so we re still early on we don t really know a lot of it has to do with just demand levels and traction and take away from the plants and that literally has taken place as we speak now that the manufacturers continue to talk about escalating cost and inflationary pressures and they re reacting to that with their price increases but the market will dictate just exactly how much of this ultimately is going to be realized and depending on when it settles in first there maybe a second phase to the increases as they always leave the door open for that so i can t really handicap it at this point we are going up as we received higher costs from our manufacturers in many cases where we re quoting commercial work we re quoting escalators based on the projected increase and we have yet to see how it s all going to settle out michael glaser dahl rbc capital markets analyst okay that s helpful the second part of the pricing was really back related to steel and comments about not expecting any further increases i guess given the path of steel pricing when you look out over the next few quarters do you think that we could see price declines actually michael callahan president chief executive officer and director that s really that really is hard for me to call based on the current you know just the current uncertainties around steel in general and tariffs and everything else that s going on what i will tell you though is that we have our purchasing group here has a daily dialog on those with the steel producers and we keep very very close to the ground as to what s going on relative to steel pricing and so are we can move quickly too but based on how we turned our inventories i mean our steel inventories cycle very quickly so even if there is a near term price adjustment up or downwards we re able to cycle through that pretty quickly based on our just on how quickly we cycle the steel inventories so it s tough to handicap right now i would say right now we look at it is kind of flattish and where it goes from here really remains to be seen based on demand levels and just consumption michael glaser dahl rbc capital markets analyst got it if i could fit one more in you made a comment about the fourth quarter gross margin i just wanted to understand or clarify that a little were you saying that the 32 4 seen in 3q was still the reasonable assumption for 4q or was that comment related to your prior 32 2 leslie h kratcoski vice president of investor relations yes no our guidance continues to be the 32 2 michael glaser dahl rbc capital markets analyst okay great thank you michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thanks mike operator thank you our next question comes from the line of kevin hocevar with northcoast research please proceed with your question kevin hocevar northcoast research analyst hey good morning everybody michael callahan president chief executive officer and director hey kevin kevin hocevar northcoast research analyst you mentioned that so 3q 18 had a favorable gross margins for the you mentioned incentives ahead of price increases taking effect on the wallboard side it sounds like you re not really pre buying much ahead of this increase and gross margin expectations are from 3q to 4q relatively similar so can we infer from that that you re not seeing the same level of incentives this year as you saw last year ahead of the price increases leslie h kratcoski vice president of investor relations the favorable the favor ability that we saw in our margin last q3 due to the incentives was simply i think timing of the purchases so in terms of whole dollars or percentage the incentives remained fairly constant if not even a little bit more favorable so no i wouldn t infer that kevin hocevar northcoast research analyst okay okay and then so the largest ph wallboard manufacturers is that can be acquired here sometime in early 2019 so curious if you have any thoughts on that in terms of do you expect that to have any impact on that industry or do you think it will be pretty much business as usual after that transfer takes place michael callahan president chief executive officer and director you know in my view having done business a significant business with both sides of that equation so to speak i think it s going to be business as usual i think it s going to be a very strong and formidable company and they certainly have a very impressive array of products from the insulation side all the way through wallboard and ceiling so from our advantage point it s going to be business as usual and we re going to continue to do business with them as a combined entity just as we have separately in the past kevin hocevar northcoast research analyst got you okay thank you very much michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thanks operator thank you our next question comes from the line of matt mccall with seaport global securities please proceed with your question matt mccall seaport global securities analyst thanks good morning everybody michael callahan president chief executive officer and director good morning matt mccall seaport global securities analyst sorry i lost my voice so mike you made some comments bullish comments about the mid to long term specifically on the residential markets i was curious about more the near term view as you said there may be a pause i m just i m wondering about the impact of kind of the start weakness that we saw in 18 and expected impact on your business to start 19 calendar 19 michael callahan president chief executive officer and director well i mean i think it s logical to say that the same thing that we were talking about in terms of weather impacts on our business has impacts on starts too i mean it s tough to clear a land with a bulldozer when it s going to be submerged in six foot of water it had a subdivision in atlanta georgia so i mean i think the reality is our outlook is that if there is slippage we think it s going to be moderate slippage because there s still a shortage of inventory in just about every major market that we serve so and based on our conversations with the large national homebuilders that we do business with throughout our footprint that house counts generally speaking are up and i think the general attitude of the homebuilders is optimistic as well with the custom builders it s just with the rate increases back at 18 carrying it over under the tough winter i think the data is just kind of noisy right now so as we get deeper into the spring selling season i think all of us will have a little bit better clarity on where this market is going to settle out but a pause i think is the best word because i don t consider to be at a kind of a long term slippage i think it s just a matter of making a temporary market adjustment frankly matt mccall seaport global securities analyst okay thanks that s helpful the detail around the synergies and the cost saves that was also helpful can you it sounds like you re optimistic about meeting or exceeding those goals but can you give us an idea of where you were as of q3 for both the synergies and the cost saves and how we should layer those in over the next i guess four five quarters lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller yes are you referring to the the titan synergies or sg a synergies matt mccall seaport global securities analyst both the cost saves and in the synergies as well lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller yes so on the sg a so i would expect that for q4 that our reduction in sg a as a percentage of sales our sg a leverage is somewhere between where it was q2 over q2 and q3 over q3 matt mccall seaport global securities analyst okay and then does that kind of get you i think you had talked about the total for i think you said through 2020 for both synergies and cost saves so i guess when do we hit the full run rate of each of those both from titan and the sg a or the operational synergies lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller so in terms of the full run rate on the titan synergies we just those will both be 2020 yeah those will both be 2020 michael callahan president chief executive officer and director when we have the 10 million the 10 million full run rate synergies with titan which we expect to exceed those will be fully realized in fiscal 20 which is april of 20 and the same thing on the cost efficiencies or the cost savings of 20 ph matt mccall seaport global securities analyst okay all right thank you operator thank you ladies and gentlemen this concludes our question and answer session i will turn the floor back to mr callahan for any final comments michael callahan president chief executive officer and director well thank you everybody for joining us today we re very excited about where we are today and we look

i d ask that you turn to page 3 which provides some key highlights and updates full year 2018 results reflect our many initiatives to innovate new products manage costs drive productivity and enhance our portfolio during the year we grew sales 3 4 on strong volume growth in luxury vinyl tile or lvt as well as higher selling prices across many product categories on this growth we delivered an adjusted ebitda margin of 7 9 in the face of significant inflationary pressure which continues to impact the industry we delivered another year of positive free cash flow in part helped by the timing of working capital investments and capex spend in december we completed the sale of our wood flooring business at an attractive value representing 7 2 times that former segment s trailing 12 month ebitda and generating net proceeds of 90 million we are pleased to now be operating as a focused resilient flooring company we have a strong portfolio of award winning products which provide us with a more attractive growth trajectory and a stronger margin profile our team is committed to becoming the leader in this attractive area of the flooring industry we ended the year with a strong balance sheet that increases our flexibility to invest in growing our resilient categories that have seen solid returns on our investments in innovation capacity enhancements service and go to market capabilities combined with our focus on rationalizing cost the positive evolution of our company will be increasingly evident as we streamline processes elevate operating performance and deliver on strategic priorities looking at the transformation of our business on page 4 we are confident that fundamentals remain strong for future growth in resilient where we have spent the past several years enhancing our exposure to the right product categories and markets and channels lvt is now our largest product category representing nearly 1 3 of 2018 sales vinyl composition tile which is primarily commercial represents just over 1 4 of our sales commercial and residential sheet together are also around 1 4 of our sales with the mix of our business more heavily weighted toward lvt we expect to better realize a significant growth in that category which continues to take share from all other flooring categories several actions have shifted our business toward commercial in recent years including the purchase of additional vct assets in 2017 and a realignment of our sales and marketing efforts to focus more heavily on commercial and national accounts in 2018 with the completion of the wood sale our sales are now approximately 60 commercial where our margins are generally better we believe our current end market mix is not only more balanced but situates us for stronger and more predictable results roughly 3 4 of our sales are for renovation projects which provides a less cyclical and more stable growth dynamic additionally approximately 75 of our 2018 sales were through distribution where we are able to leverage the local expertise of our distribution partners to get the right products in front of any users with exceptional service moving to our four strategic priorities on page 5 all of these attributes i just described are aligned with our goal of gaining leadership in lvt supported by our growth strategies to drive innovation across our entire product portfolio strengthen our distribution partnerships particularly in commercial categories and leverage our strong position in other commercial categories in lvt we achieved double digit growth for the full year and fourth quarter helped by our new innovative products that have allowed us to grow faster than the market following recent tariff developments we believe there are meaningful opportunities to increase output of our domestically produced lvt primarily through investing in and repurposing existing assets in combination with our strategic sourcing initiatives we are poised to continue taking share in lvt the armstrong flooring lvt portfolio was recognized by floor covering weekly s reco market intelligence report as number one in retail residential brand recognition and by the spec star award by designer pages as the top specified brand by architects in commercial applications these independent recognitions validate our investments in innovation and support our growth objectives in this attractive category innovation remains key to our success in all of our flooring categories including advances in design durability installation maintenance and material composition our proprietary award winning diamond 10 technology continues to have good traction with customers in lvt vct and vinyl sheet three categories which represent collectively about 85 of our sales at the international surfaces event in january we debuted several new products in lvt including larger format alterna plank with diamond 10 technology and exciting new designs across our rigid core portfolio in addition we highlighted our domestic vct with diamond 10 technology which reduces total cost of ownership by 40 beyond these products we have an exciting pipeline and we plan to continue to invest in our broad and compelling portfolio of high demand products in distribution in 2018 we completed our go to market pivot which has allowed us to allocate more of our marketing and sales efforts on commercial and national accounts where we believe we can better leverage our scale we anticipate that our increased exposure to commercial through our exclusive focus on resilient will amplify the benefits of this strategy on the residential side the transition has been smooth and our distributors are in a position to provide the merchandising support for the retail customers customized to their local needs not only will this increase the efficiency of our sales ecosystem but it will also better serve local customers we look forward to gaining additional share of wallet and aligning ourselves with partners who are best positioned to support our growth strategy the shift in distribution is directly aligned with our strategic objective to leverage our strong position in commercial which represents a significant portion of our lvt products and the majority of our traditional categories our team is dedicated to improving our performance in commercial categories through innovation and cost efficiencies to more effectively grow our market presence overall we are actively augmenting our business across our products channels and operations to drive better performance we have simplified our business improved our financial profile and strengthened our balance sheet to take advantage of significant opportunities ahead we are committed to investing in our business to strengthen our position as a leader in resilient flooring i will now turn the call over to doug to walk through the details of our financial performance doug bingham chief financial officer thank you don and good morning to those on the call today i ll begin with the review of our full year results on page 6 as a reminder our results reflect our continuing operations which are purely resilient for the full year 2018 net sales improved 3 4 to 728 million as compared to 704 million in the prior year the improvement in net sales was due to favorable mix and overall higher selling prices in response to inflationary pressure lvt grew double digits helped by new products market gains and the growing popularity of that category overall volume was lower due to softer shipments in traditional categories especially residential sheet which is now roughly 10 of our total sales full year 2018 adjusted ebitda improved 3 3 to 57 5 million as compared to 55 7 million in the prior year the increase in adjusted ebitda was primarily due to higher net sales improved productivity and lower sg a spending which more than offset significant input cost inflation pressure excluding adjustments in connection with the wood flooring business divestiture adjusted ebitda under our prior basis of presentation was 59 million in 2018 now looking at our fourth quarter results on slide 7 in the fourth quarter net sales decreased 3 5 to 154 million as compared to 159 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 the decrease in net sales was primarily attributable to lower volumes partly offset by improved mix and overall higher selling prices in response to inflationary pressure while lvt achieved double digit growth in the fourth quarter our overall volume was impacted by two macro factors particularly into year end we experienced soft end market demand which was further compounded by a departure from normal seasonal trends and the timing of customer purchases this was due to ongoing uncertainty regarding the eventual outcome of us tariff negotiations on chinese imports to explain that a bit more in the third quarter of 2018 we announced price increases on imported product effective october 1 in response to the first round of 10 tariffs on chinese imports we also proactively announced further increases effective january 1 with the expectation that tariffs would increase to 25 as previously announced by the administration the tariffs had a large impact on customer buying behavior across the overall market in the middle of the fourth quarter the january 1 tariff increase was called into question and eventually delayed by the administration this created an air pocket in demand in the fourth quarter as a result of significant customer purchases pulled forward in the third quarter of 2018 ahead of price increases implemented in october this was followed by muted pre buy activity in the fourth quarter due to the delay of our tariff related price increase originally scheduled for january 1 therefore we experienced elevated inventory levels in the distributor channel during the fourth quarter lower sales and increased input cost inflation were the primary drag on adjusted ebitda performance for the fourth quarter partially offset by improved productivity and cost savings turning to our free cash flow and liquidity on slide 8 during 2018 we generated operating cash flow of approximately 63 million consistent with prior year the timing of net working capital movements in q4 was a favorable factor in this performance for the full year we invested 35 million on capex which for a third straight year was below our run rate depreciation overall we were pleased with our free cash flow performance of 27 million for the year in december 2018 we received net proceeds of approximately 90 million upon completing the sale of our wood business as a reminder these proceeds remain subject to a customary net working capital true up in the first quarter in combination with cash generated by operations we ended 2018 with a strong balance sheet and net cash position we have significant resources to invest in ongoing initiatives and pursue additional growth opportunities our capital allocation objectives remain unchanged with our focus on funding internal growth initiatives and pursuing m a opportunities that support our growth strategy in addition we expect to return a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the wood business to investors in a time and manner to be determined by the board turning to our full year outlook on slide 9 with our resilient focus simplified business and refined strategic objectives we are positioned to improve the performance and profitability of our company we expect to continue to grow sales at or above the market rates of growth within each of our respective categories for the full year 2019 we expect adjusted ebitda to be in the range of 58 million to 66 million we continue to experience cost increases in energy transportation raw materials and operating costs which we expect will be a headwind for 2019 we have implemented additional price increases of 4 to 6 based on inflation and freight in select commercial and residential products effective on april 1 our team has done a great job in anticipating and overcoming the challenges presented by inflation we expect the impact of these pricing actions combined with additional productivity gains and other cost savings will help to offset continuing inflationary pressures with this in mind we expect ebitda to be weaker in the first quarter year on year we anticipate full year ebitda growth to be heavily weighted toward the second half of 2019 as the market strengthens and elevated inventory levels in the channel are worked down on the p l our effective tax rate could change significantly quarter to quarter but we expect our tax rate to be approximately 25 in 2019 in regards to cash flow we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of 30 million to 35 million maintenance capex should continue to approximate 2 to 3 of sales with the balance of the spending budget for high return investments as i mentioned earlier our net working capital at year end was better than expected primarily due to the timing of working capital flows particularly receivable collections in addition the timing and uncertainty around the second tariff increase led to softer sales in the latter part of the quarter which resulted in fewer outstanding receivables at year end with this in mind in the first quarter we expect operating cash flow to be significantly negative as we both rebuild working capital off year end lows and also experience normal seasonality of first quarter cash usage while we are not providing a full year 2019 free cash flow outlook we expect to build cash as we move past the first quarter with that i will now hand the call back to don for closing comments don maier chief executive officer thanks doug i d ask you to turn to slide 10 please we are encouraged by our entire team s performance during 2018 along with our brighter prospects of our simplified resilient business we are focused on lvt leadership supported by our strategic priorities to enhance innovation across our award winning portfolio strengthen our distribution partnerships and leverage our number one position in traditional commercial categories combined with ongoing cost savings initiatives we believe we are well situated to generate improved results and drive further returns for our shareholders in 2019 and years to come operator we are now ready to take questions questions and answers operator at this time we ll be conducting a question and answer session operator instructions our first question comes from john baugh stifel please proceed with your question john allen baugh stifel nicolaus company incorporated analyst good morning and thanks for taking my questions maybe doug you could clarify again the product mix of sales in 2018 i guess 30 for lvt 25 for vct and then i kind of missed the rest could you clarify that again doug bingham chief financial officer sure yes so 25 is for sheet products including residential and commercial that breaks out to be about 15 commercial 10 residential and then those three categories that you mentioned lvt at around 30 vct around 25 and sheet at 25 those round numbers kind of add up to be about 85 so the remaining 15 are installation tools adhesives kind of all the other stuff john allen baugh stifel nicolaus company incorporated analyst okay and then you mentioned what that residential sheet was down to 10 of the mix at the end of 18 did i understand that correctly and then what was it say at the beginning of the year doug bingham chief financial officer yes so what we ve said before was that in 2017 it was less than 10 of the total sales when we re about 1 1 billion and now we re saying it s about 10 of resilient only john allen baugh stifel nicolaus company incorporated analyst okay and so if volumes for the year and i understand and appreciate anomalies in the fourth quarter so if volumes for the year were down a couple percent and we assume that the lvt was up low to mid teens or something at 30 of the mix it would imply the other 70 of your sales on a volume basis were down around 10 is that right number one and number two one of the categories is it vct and sheet that are under continued pressure and how do you think the volume with lvt growth in 19 i m sure projected yet continued declines in those categories how does volume shake out in 19 doug bingham chief financial officer yes so roughly speaking we did see declines in volume in residential sheet that s been a consistent theme for a number of years and then as you mentioned we had the offset in lvt and there were a few other kind of puts and takes in other product categories as we look into 2019 at a kind of category level we see the same trends continuing on that we experienced in 2018 lvt expected to continue to grow very strongly res sheet will continue to be challenged and other categories at greater or lesser extents will have similar patterns don maier chief executive officer yes john this is don i think the other piece so i think your math i ll have to work through it is about right on the volume piece that was offset by improvements in price and mix really across i think almost all the categories so that netted out to the 3 4 growth for the year john allen baugh stifel nicolaus company incorporated analyst thanks for that and then my final question is around the inflation stat i guess i d love some details on what you are seeing right now in other words what are the raw material inflation you refer to is sort of in your inventory there and therefore yet to flow through your p l versus maybe what you re buying raws for right now or what you re buying transportation for or energy for are we not going to see some relief on that number at least sequentially if not year over year at some point in 2019 thank you doug bingham chief financial officer sure yes so just as a reminder we saw inflation throughout 2018 which has created these year on your headwinds as we come into 2019 because of that dynamic it s going to be more pronounced the inflationary pressure in the first half and our expectation is that our actions around price mix and productivity should more than offset those john allen baugh stifel nicolaus company incorporated analyst so are we seeing any stabilization of raw materials or transportation costs right now doug bingham chief financial officer we ve seen in some of the i think we purchased now we ve also come out with a 4 to 6 price increase effective april 1 are really geared toward trying to recover some of the inflationary headwinds that we ve experienced john allen baugh stifel nicolaus company incorporated analyst great thanks good luck doug bingham chief financial officer thanks john operator our next question comes from michael wood nomura instinet please proceed with your question ryan cohen nomura securities co ltd analyst this is ryan cohen on for mike sounds like the inventory is go rectify itself by the middle of the year can you just talk about maybe is there elevated inventory outside of lvt or is it almost exclusively related to lvt ahead of these tariffs and price increases don maier chief executive officer yes it varies by category but the q3 activities were largely skewed toward lvt given the tariff impact and then a general price increase we saw softer end markets then through the fourth quarter in which so it didn t sell through at the rates we had anticipated in q4 and so that s left a bit of a hangover as we entered into q1 a couple of our other categories in particular vct i would say inventory levels have returned to more normal levels so we ve seen the sell through work through on the buying activities that were done in advance of the price increase back in q3 ryan cohen nomura securities co ltd analyst okay and then just a follow up there was there any industry lvt price weakness related to this pre buy or was it merely a volume related drag don maier chief executive officer it was really more of a volume related drag and lvt prices in general we haven t seen significant changes in the trends there other than for the tariff related impacts ryan cohen nomura securities co ltd analyst thank you doug bingham chief financial officer thanks ryan operator our next question comes from alvaro lacayo g research please proceed with your question doug bingham chief financial officer good morning alvaro alvaro lacayo g research analyst good morning how are you guys don maier chief executive officer good got real quick on your name there alvaro lacayo g research analyst i know well first congrats doug on becoming cfo just to start us up there and then i appreciate the commentary on the usage of capital now you ve got this big net cash position on the balance sheet maybe can you refresh us on how you re thinking about your leverage target ratios and if there s been any change in terms of how you think about that and then secondly on the term loan portion of the debt outstanding that you guys had at the end of the year would there be any prepayment penalties if you decided to pay off your debt in full don maier chief executive officer good questions let me tackle the leverage question first we have not announced any change to our kind of target leverage ratio i ll tell you a little bit at this point with essentially 75 million of net cash it s a little bit of an academic question for the moment in terms of our ratio ph which is 1 5 to 2 times is what we ve said previously our term loan we are able to prepay that without penalty both the revolver portion as well as the term loan a alvaro lacayo g research analyst great and then with regards to free cash can you maybe talk to us a little bit about provide some color around the growth investments you re making the growth portion of the capex can you maybe walk us through how we should be thinking about working cap as a percent of sales now that you re 100 resilient focused business and then what kind of cash requirements are you going to have with regarding the post retirement liability pension liability that you have on the balance sheet don maier chief executive officer sure so maybe let s start with the capex so as we ve talked about before we tend to have about 2 to 3 of our capital spending is really geared toward maintenance capex the remainder of that is geared for growth initiatives capabilities and capacity things where we expect to generate a return working capital i think you ll be able to see in our financials now that we ve stripped out the wood business working capital is much cleaner than it was before lower levels of working capital and then i will just mention again i mentioned this in the prepared comments that we ended q4 at kind of a low point it was a little odd with the receivables if you look at our ar balance year on year it s down about 15 million and so that kind of gives you a sense of the magnitude of that one but going forward we would expect that working capital would grow roughly in line with sales although we always look for opportunities to efficiencies on that one other cash flow items the retiree medical that liability primarily stayed with the resilient company after the separation we did not attribute very much of that to wood and in 2018 i think the cash outlay on that one was about 8 million alvaro lacayo g research analyst should it be similar in 2019 don maier chief executive officer it will be similar i think it may come down a little bit there was a small portion attributable to the wood business alvaro lacayo g research analyst okay so i guess when you look at the ebitda guide and i know you guys didn t provide directionally what free cash flow will be but i guess what would be the items you would highlight that would change dramatically the ebitda to free cash conversion you guys have historically seen don maier chief executive officer yeah so the capex and i think we ve talked about that one net working capital which again i think we ve addressed that with maybe a bit of an anomaly in q1 of this year but then should behave more normally cash taxes we expected those will be minimal until we burn through the 14 million nol that we have in place and then our new debt facility with a interest rate of just under 5 is what we re paying at current rates on 100 million and you could model that out how interest rates go from here alvaro lacayo g research analyst great thank you very much doug and i m done doug bingham chief financial officer thanks alvaro operator our next question comes from justin speer zelman associates please proceed with your question justin speer zelman associates analyst thanks and good morning thank you for taking the time in terms of your capex it was about 5 million below i think what you expressed last quarter in the fourth quarter and your guidance on capex is a little bit lower than what we were thinking just wanted to get some characterization on a if that s correct and b why don maier chief executive officer yeah so what we had said last quarter was that we d be about 40 million as a combined wood and resilient business i think where we came in was pretty close to that it was a little we saved a little bit on the resilient side and saved a little bit on the wood side resilient specifically last quarter we said would we expected to be about 30 million and we came in relatively close on that justin speer zelman associates analyst got it okay that makes sense and then in terms of the repurposing of assets going forward toward more lvt can you help us understand the mechanics there how much maybe dollar capacity you have or manufacturing capacity you have for lvt purposes and where you can take that by repurposing existing assets doug bingham chief financial officer sure justin look forward to sharing more probably here again in the next subsequent calls but what we have announced is that we are wanting to add capabilities to produce domestic rigid core products that we believe that we can do that with repurposing some existing assets that we have which should shorten the time to implement and obviously reduce the capital requirements and that we have a fairly large engineering team that s been working on this project along with the product to make sure that we are entering the market with a differentiated offering so i m encouraged by the progress that has been made we really don t have anything to announce at this point other than that news should be forthcoming justin speer zelman associates analyst so you source most if not all of this right from asia and if we were to assume a no tariff scenario do you think based on what you can t communicate but i m guessing the fact that you re proceeding means that you believe that you can compete with that on a fully with chinese imports on a fully landed basis excluding tariffs doug bingham chief financial officer yes we believe that we would not only have a competitive advantage from a differentiated polymer and product performance but also at an attractive cost basis justin speer zelman associates analyst we ve seen a couple of competitors who have gone forth with some of their own proprietary approaches to rigid core production in large plants large facilities what distinguishes you from them and do you think that you would see the same kind of like near term setbacks that we ve seen from some of your competitors with rigid production processes in terms of ramping do you expect that your approach will be different doug bingham chief financial officer so i think there s two things that you should consider when looking at that number one is we ve been making resilient hard surface flooring for decades and so our core capabilities center around the processes related to that i would give you a different answer if we were trying to go build a carpet mill somewhere where we don t have a lot of competency number two is as we demonstrated with the stillwater oklahoma repurposing a third benefit to the reduced capital and the reduced time is that you have a significantly lower amount of new processes that need to be tuned in and debugged and worked through so the more repurposing you can do the less troubleshooting and ramp up time that is required with the rigid core it s not going to be as i think as simple and as quick as the stillwater repurposing but certainly is not at the other end of the spectrum as far as a greenfield site and all the challenges that you have with that justin speer zelman associates analyst and all that again that s all within i guess i m assuming that s all 19 but that s captured within your capex guidance the idea of this repurposing effort is captured in the capex guidance for 2019 don maier chief executive officer yes so just to be clear on the 30 million to 35 million of capex guidance that we provided that covers smaller investments if we were to do something large we would disclose and talk about that separately justin speer zelman associates analyst got it okay perfect and in terms of the 4 to 6 price increase my last question the price increase in april is associated with if you could relay that again for us you said transportation costs i believe and something else and then a follow up on that is maybe help us understand the high end and the low end of your guidance range what from a macro standpoint and maybe from this price increase standpoint has to happen or not happen in order to get to the high end or the low end of that range don maier chief executive officer yes so the drivers that we saw throughout the course of 2018 remained the same drivers as doug mentioned they ve abated a bit but are continuing to increase really in three areas transportation and the shortage of transportation is continuing to drive that dynamic raw materials inflation and then energy so those were the real three drivers that we saw those are continuing we are really looking just to offset the inflation with our pricing actions and so to the extent that we see further reductions in inflation that will take pressure off there and obviously it s all dependent upon that what happens in the competitive arena that we participate in so we re obviously focused on letting the market set price and adjusting accordingly so we re looking to offset those costs as we did in 2018 and 2019 and hopefully we ll see a continuation of the trend of inflation tapering off a bit here justin speer zelman associates analyst thank you guys don maier chief executive officer thank you justin operator our next question comes from adam baumgarten macquarie group please proceed with your question adam baumgarten macquarie group analyst thanks guys just on vct i know it s been kind of a tough road for volumes given share gains from other materials and i guess now that you have the diamond 10 vct line out and it s been out for a little bit how has the adoption been and two do expect that to drive overall vct volume growth in 2019 doug bingham chief financial officer yes so we re pretty excited about the diamond 10 story on vct the largest impact to vct has really been staying concrete not the lvt conversion you see in other categories and with the addition of the diamond 10 technology it s changing the overall cost of ownership of that flooring solution by 40 and in essence positions it as a cost advantage now rather than cost disadvantage to stay in concrete so that s been received and is being received extremely well in particular we re seeing on specifications coming in on the larger projects something that maybe was not fully contemplated that another positive is that you do see vct going into a lot of main street applications which are smaller square footage installations and as such the cost and the effort to go in with all of the polishing equipment and what have you on the initial install is fairly disruptive and this diamond 10 technology has created a vct product that doesn t require those processes and as a result is increasing its appeal in the main street applications as well adam baumgarten macquarie group analyst great thanks guys doug bingham chief financial officer thank you adam operator our next question comes from john baugh stifel please proceed with your question john allen baugh stifel nicolaus company incorporated analyst yes thanks for allowing me just one quick follow up i was curious don how conversations now that you have divested wood have perhaps changed with your distributor customers you re certainly more focused but by the same token you have less overall volume with them and i m just curious how you can compare the discussion say pre divestiture post divestiture with your big distributors thank you don maier chief executive officer great question john and i m sure you ll follow up with the distributors directly as well but it s gone extremely well frankly i think they all understand the move that we made in most cases the distributors had alternative wood sources but as well it s been business as usual frankly in the transition of the wood business so we ve really done everything we can and continue to do that through providing the transitional service elements to the wood business to really make this as pain free as possible and then on the plus side it s really allowing us to double down our focus and attention on the areas that we can really add value to our distributors driving that commercial business for them where we have a significant capability with our dedicated sales force and then obviously bringing innovation so that they have a differentiated offering in lvt and all of the other product categories so it is 10 weeks i guess into the into the transition but so far it s gone extremely well and i think is a real credit to all of the work that the team put in advance of this to make sure that we didn t have any drop balls in handing this business off to aip john allen baugh stifel nicolaus company incorporated analyst great thanks good luck don maier chief executive officer thank you john operator we have reached the end of the question and answer session now i d like to turn the call back over to don maier for closing remarks don maier chief executive officer

china lowered its goal for economic growth and announced a major tax cut as policymakers seek to pull off a gradual deceleration while grappling with a debt legacy and the trade standoff with the u s the gross domestic product growth target released tuesday morning in premier li keqiang s annual work report to the national people s congress was set at a range of 6 to 6 5 percent for 2019 the shift to a band from the previous practice of using a point figure gives policy makers room for maneuver and compares with last year s about 6 5 percent goal the lower bound of the gdp target would be the slowest pace of economic growth in almost three decades a consequence of china s long deceleration as policy makers prioritize reining in debt risks cleaning up the environment and alleviating poverty warning of a tough economic battle ahead li announced tax cuts worth 2 trillion yuan 298 billion for the year these targets accommodate structural deceleration but not cyclical which means that policy makers will need to flex their muscles to stimulate the economy said alicia garcia herrero chief asia pacific economist at natixis sa in hong kong it s good news for the market in the short term bad news for china in the medium term as more leverage will need to be piled up what our economists say there are two particularly positive developments in tuesday s announcement wide ranging tax cuts particularly reductions in value added taxes and a signal for targeted monetary support for the economy rather than a flood of liquidity wrote david qu and chang shu in a note the range signals the top leadership s pragmatism in accepting a mild slowdown chinese stocks continued rising on tuesday after climbing to their highest level since june on monday as signs of progress in trade talks buoyed investors other asian indexes fell after the s p 500 index dropped the most in a month economists surveyed by bloomberg see output growth slowing to 6 2 percent this year from 6 6 percent in 2018 before easing further in 2020 and 2021 the report pledged to keep china s leverage ratio basically stable in 2019 policy makers are trying to rekindle lending to the private sector while avoiding an accelerated run up in debt with the total debt pile now approaching 300 percent of gdp unlike in previous years there were no targets for retail sales growth or fixed asset investment in the reports in his speech li said the government would improve the exchange rate mechanism phrasing which was missing from the 2018 and 2017 reports he also pledged to keep the currency generally stable and at an adaptive and balanced level a cut of 3 percentage points to the top bracket of value added tax was announced in a move aimed at benefiting the manufacturing sector that plan was reported by bloomberg news on monday in addition a 1 percentage point cut to the 10 percent vat bracket was announced combined the vat cuts are equivalent to as much as 800 billion yuan and will boost corporate earnings according to morgan stanley the target budget deficit for 2019 was set at 2 8 percent of gdp versus last year s goal of 2 6 percent the report pledged a noticeable decrease in the tax burdens of major industries with the total of reductions in tax and social security fees coming to 2 trillion yuan the more modest growth target paired with further targeted stimulus measures typifies the government s attempt to steady the economy after a bruising 2018 and marks a shift from last year s edition when the emphasis was on reining in financial risks and trimming budget outlays maintaining employment was given a higher priority than last year the report reiterated that monetary policy will remain prudent while fiscal policy will be proactive stronger and more effective further cuts to the required reserves ratio for smaller banks are planned according to the work report the u s and china are close to a trade deal that could lift most or all u s tariffs as long as beijing follows through on pledges ranging from better protecting intellectual property rights to buying a significant amount of american products while that would remove one cloud hanging over the economy debt risks and signs of weakening consumption at home remain china will face a graver and more complicated environment as well as risks and challenges that are greater in number and size li said china must be fully prepared for a tough struggle

canadian environmental assessment agency ceaa in 2018 and after review and public comment ceaa issued the eis federal guidelines for each of the projects baseline environmental studies were completed in fall 2018 to allow for the collection of seasonal data and modelling which are requirements of the eis guidelines the results of those studies are being incorporated into two environmental impact statements eis for the fms and ch gold projects currently in preparation for submission and approval to the federal ceaa and provincial regulators and to the public fms and ch eis submissions are targeted for q2 and q3 2019 respectively once the company submits the fms and ch environmental impact statements and ceaa concludes that they conform to the eis guidelines the 365 day federal review period commences consultation with indigenous peoples who are considered rightsholders is integrated into the ea process the 365 day federal review period for the eis pauses when ceaa submits periodic information requests ir to the company that originate from interested rightsholders stakeholders and regulators typically these information requests result in pauses to the federal review process of between one and two months while the proponent carefully prepares and submits its responses after which the review process recommences it is typical for the proponent to receive two or three rounds of irs during the 365 day federal review process to support our community engagement efforts for ch and fms local offices sherbrooke and sheet harbour ns will soon be opened and members of those communities who have questions or concerns about the project can meet ask questions directly to company representatives and receive technical information the local offices will also provide centres where community members can enquire about jobs and economic opportunities regarding the beaver dam mine project the ceaa 365 day federal review process remains in progress and approvals are anticipated by the end of 2019 or early 2020 exploration update phase 3 expansion drilling program the company has completed its phase 3 expansion program at fifteen mile stream cochrane hill and touquoy with a total of 64 116 metres of resource expansion drilling the objectives of the phase 3 expansion drilling program were to tighten drill spacing within the designed pit limits identify additional mineralization immediately peripheral to the estimated mineral resources at fms and ch potentially support upgrade of some or all of the previously estimated inferred mineral resources to higher confidence categories at ch and at fms particularly at the hudson and plenty zones the phase 3 resource expansion drill programs at the fifteen mile stream and cochrane hill gold deposits between september 2017 and february 2018 successfully identified additional gold mineralization immediately adjacent to previously defined mineral resources at both locations compilation and analysis of the results of these programs determined that in the egerton maclean zone at fifteen mile stream and at cochrane hill there remained potential to extend known mineralization drill programs totaling 11 385 m in 69 drill holes and 16 242 m in 70 drill holes were completed at fifteen mile stream and cochrane hill respectively between mid september and mid december 2018 to test interpreted extensions to the known resources results for these drill campaigns were announced in earlier press releases see news releases dated december 5 2018 january 21 2019 and february 6 2019 and february 21 2019 at touquoy 44 drillholes for 5 264 m were completed to the south and south west of the current resources as reported in the news release of december 5 2018 the company expects to issue updated mineral resource estimates for all deposits in early march 2019 those new resource estimates will form the basis of new mineral reserve estimates and a life of mine plan for all deposits which are expected to be released later in q1 2019 phase 4 corridor regional program the phase 4 corridor regional program was initiated late april 2018 to evaluate the corridor which extends northeast from the touquoy gold deposit at mrc to the beaver dam gold deposit and through to the fifteen mile stream gold deposits in the northeast this corridor is considered to be highly prospective for the same style of argillite hosted mineralization that comprises the known deposits as it is underlain by the same rock sequence the moose river formation and shows the same structural features historically this area has seen comparatively little exploration due to a poor understanding of argillite hosted deposits and lack of bedrock exposure due to thick till cover fifteen drill traverses were located along the 45km target area based on geological interpretation of proprietary airborne geophysical data the program consisted of 199 diamond drill holes for 28 650m of drilling targeting areas with previous indications of mineralization as well as providing geological information in this area of poor exposure the 149 deposit was the first discovery of the corridor regional program and encouraging results were also obtained from the seloam brook mill shaft and cameron flowage traverses 149 deposit encouraging initial results at the 149 deposit were followed up and shallow mineralization was intersected over a strike length of 350m see news release dated june 28 2018 additional infill drilling identified two zones of gold mineralization a shallow generally higher grade axis zone in the core of a tight anticlinal fold which dips 60 75 to the north and a thicker but lower grade limb zone on the over turned limb of the anticline the mineralized zones were extended to over 475m in strike length and were still open to the east see news release dated september 19 2018 in november december 2018 additional drilling was completed to extend the higher grade axis zone to depth and to follow the limb zone closer to surface a total of 2 497m of diamond drilling was completed in 21 drill holes the mineralized zone has now been traced over approximately 500m with closely spaced 25m fences of diamond drilling over a strike length of 300m between section 14400e to 14700e and further wider spaced drilling which has intersected mineralization over an additional 200m to section 14900e see news release dated january 22 2019 drill results have confirmed that the axis zone mineralization continues from surface to depths of approximately 125m vertical and remains open at depth the final phase of the 2018 drilling program focused on evaluating the strike continuity of the limb zone and its projection both up dip to surface and at depth assay results received have confirmed that the lower grade disseminated limb zone mineralization extends to surface and is also open at depth additional drilling is planned to test the eastward continuation of the 149 deposit mineralization particularly between sections 14700e 14900e where some significant intersections have been previously reported in holes 364 16m 1 05g t au from 154m 365 5m 1 12g t au from 62m and 3m 1 55g t au from 71m and 366 1m 17 85g t au from 121m see news release dated september 19 2018 additional drilling is also required to better evaluate the eastern end of both the axis and limb zones of mineralization and to continue to test their down dip extensions interpretation of high resolution aeromagnetic data indicates the potential for similar geological settings to be repeated further to the east and additional reconnaissance spaced drilling will be undertaken to test these zones next steps all deposits remain open along strike and or at depth and further drilling may be undertaken around the designed pit limits in 2019 an exploration review program is currently underway to identify rate and rank targets across atlantic gold s project portfolio to prioritize targets for further exploration including drill testing in 2019 the 2019 program will include the following at cochrane hill the program will focus on further testing of the robust zone of mineralization which is interpreted to be open at depth and to the east in addition improved structural understanding of the cochrane hill deposit will be utilized to identify further prospective zones in the area follow up diamond drilling is underway to test the easterly extension of the 149 gold deposit this was the first discovery of the corridor regional program and an initial program of 6 000m is planned is planned encouraging early results from the seloam brook mill shaft and cameron flowage traverses in the corridor regional program already warrant additional exploration including drill testing elsewhere in the corridor results obtained during 2018 are being used to develop a focused exploration program to make further discoveries in this highly prospective ground initial geological interpretation of atlantic gold s extensive land package in sw nova scotia will be used to develop an exploration strategy tailored to this region that is under explored for disseminated gold deposits qualified persons kodjo afewu phd

compensation expense and gains losses on assets liabilities and investment dispositions adjusted ebitda is a common financial measure used by investors analyst and lenders as an indicator of cash operating performance as well as a valuation metric and as a measure of a company s ability to incur and service debt our calculation of adjusted ebitda excludes items that do not reflect our ongoing cash operations including equity settled share based compensation and charges related to investing decisions and that we believe should not be reflected in a metric used for valuation and debt servicing evaluation purposes while adjusted ebitda is a common financial measure widely used by investors to facilitate an enterprise level valuation of an entity they do not have standardized

chinese premier li keqiang delivers his work report at the opening session of the annual national people s congress in beijing s great hall of the people tuesday march 5 2019 ap photo ng han guan the associated press beijing ap china s government announced a robust annual economic growth target and a 7 5 percent rise in military spending tuesday at a legislative session overshadowed by a tariff war with washington in a bid to defuse u s and european complaints the chinese system is rigged against foreign companies premier li keqiang promised in a speech to the national people s congress they will be treated as equals with chinese competitors li the country s top economic official set this year s growth target at 6 to 6 5 percent reflecting official determination to shore up a cooling state dominated economy and prevent politically dangerous job losses in the face of u s tariff hikes and weaker global demand it is off slightly from last year s 6 6 percent growth a three decade low but would be among the world s strongest if achieved the premier promised to promote china u s trade negotiations but gave no details of talks aimed at ending the fight with president donald trump over beijing s technology ambitions and complaints it steals or pressures companies to hand over technology li pledged higher spending on technology development the ruling communist party sees as a path to prosperity and global influence and more money for education social programs and public works construction li warned the second largest economy faces a graver and more complicated environment and risks that are greater in number and size the two week gathering of the congress s 3 000 plus delegates in the cavernous great hall of the people is china s highest profile event of the year but does little lawmaking work instead it serves as a platform to highlight plans for the year and set the tone for government work president xi jinping s government is expected to use this year s session to announce measures to support economic growth including tax cuts and more support for entrepreneurs who generate china s new jobs and wealth companies and investors are looking for details of how beijing will carry out promises to curb the dominance of state industry legislators also are due to endorse a law that aims to ease tensions with washington and europe by discouraging officials from pressuring foreign companies to hand over technology a gathering of noncommunist groups held at the same time draws tech billionaires movie stars and ethnic minorities to the chinese capital government spending plans reflect emphatic pro growth efforts and a commitment to offset external headwinds said vishnu varathan of mizuho bank in a report proposed tax cuts of up to 2 trillion yuan 300 billion would put significant spending power in the hands of consumers and companies and help to buoy sagging demand for autos household appliances and other goods said varathan the government wants to ensure a soft landing said varathan li the no 2 leader in the ruling party behind xi said beijing will spend more on technology development including artificial intelligence electric cars biotechnology and new materials china s emergence as a competitor in smartphones telecom equipment solar power and other technologies has increased the range of products available to consumers and helped to drive down prices but it rattles washington and other governments that worry chinese competition is a threat to their industries and employment spending on the communist party s military wing the people s liberation army will rise to 1 2 trillion yuan 178 billion according to a separate report issued by the finance ministry china s total military outlay the second largest behind the united states is estimated by independent experts to exceed 220 billion a year when off budget expenses are added in yue gang a military expert and retired chinese army colonel said the relatively modest rise in military spending down from the double digit percentage increases of past years reflected the new economic conditions china is facing it is more urgent for china to prepare for a trade war with the u s instead of a physical war yue said the basic reform of china s military structure and system are almost completed and china needs the money to be used for more urgent matters though smaller than last year s increase the defense budget facilitates a massive naval shipbuilding effort and the purchase of cutting edge aircraft and other high tech weaponry that help china shore up its territorial claims in the south china sea and expand its power abroad li said the central government budget deficit would rise from 2 6 percent of total economic output to 2 8 percent reflecting higher spending to stimulate the economy the tariff fight with trump over beijing s technology ambitions has rattled chinese consumers and investors who also worry about weakening real estate and auto sales that is prompting some to put off spending which could add to downward pressure on economic growth news reports say washington and beijing might be close to an agreement to end the battle but the chief u s envoy trade representative robert lighthizer said earlier the two sides still had much work to do no agreements have been announced on the core of the dispute u s pressure on beijing to

trends and regulatory climate trends what is the current state of the lending market in your jurisdiction and have any new trends emerged over the last 12 months the nigerian lending market has strategically evolved since the country came out of recession in the second quarter of 2017 since then a series of policy measures has been implemented by both the monetary and fiscal authorities to restore growth trajectories although nigeria s lending industry is constantly developing a significant milestone is the central bank of nigeria s partnership with the international finance corporation to establish a national collateral registry with this new centralised system lenders can now register their security interests over movable assets owned by borrowers the credit reporting act 2017 is also a significant reform that has increased stability within the lending industry microfinance lenders are now more actively involved in the industry nigerian banks have been allocating higher credits to different sectors of the economy the central bank of nigeria s credit condition survey report showed that there was an increase in availability of secured credit to households and corporates in the first quarter of 2018 regulatory activity is secured lending a regulated activity in your jurisdiction yes secured lending is regulated under company law and certain commercial legislations the applicability of which depends on the nature of the asset being secured are there any specific regulatory issues which a prospective borrower should consider when arranging or entering into a secured loan facility yes when entering into a secured loan facility a prospective borrower must consider the following corporate authorisations third party consents stamping and perfection modalities and cost corporate authorisationscorporate borrowers should consider what corporate authorisations are required for the transaction this would typically be in accordance with the companies and allied matters act 1990 and the borrower s articles of association typically under nigerian law and company regulations the resolution of the company board of directors is required to authorise the entry into a loan transaction and or creation of security over the assets of the company sometimes the articles of association may contain borrowing limits which may be increased or limits removed via a resolution of the company s shareholders third party consentsboth lenders and borrowers should consider third party consents that may be required this could be under existing loan or other agreements with third party lenders which may have negative pledges or undertakings against creating further security over certain assets or even prohibit further borrowing in addition borrowers in certain sectors eg oil and gas may need to consider whether the borrowing if taken from a foreign lender is within permissible foreign borrowing under the nigerian oil and gas industry content development act 2010 stampingthe borrower should consider how much stamp duty will be payable for the secured lending the nigerian stamp duties act provides that instruments executed in nigeria or relating wheresoever executed to any property situate or any matter or thing done or to be done in nigeria should be duly stamped stamp duty payable ranges from 0 125 for loan agreements and 0 375 of the value of the loan in each case for security documents although for secured lending a payment of the 0 375 for the security covers the other financing documents statutory registrationsborrowers should consider the nature of the asset sought to be used as security to determine the required registrations under relevant nigerian law for instance the companies and allied matters act requires that security created over certain assets must be registered at the corporate affairs commission within 90 days of creation of the security similarly security over land ships and aircraft requires registration in the relevant registries however where registration of charges is required pursuant to the companies and allied matters act such registration is indexed on the domicile of the company and the nature of the asset and not the location of the asset thus where the asset of a nigerian borrower is one which requires registration under nigerian law such asset must be registered even if the asset is not located within nigeria the secured transactions in movable assets act 2017 also established a collateral registry for the registration of security over movable chattels are there any specific regulatory issues which a prospective lender should consider when arranging or entering into a secured loan facility there are some regulatory issues which a lender should consider when arranging or entering into a secured loan facility if it is a foreign lender it should be aware that it may need to obtain a certificate of capital importation cci in respect of funds given to the nigerian borrower a cci is a receipt issued by an authorised dealer a bank or other financial institution registered as such acknowledging that foreign exchange has been brought into nigeria and converted into naira a cci guarantees unconditional transferability and repatriation of the loan and interest including any recoveries from the secured asset on enforcement in addition the following issues should be considered by a lender when entering a secured loan facility type of asset used as security the lender should consider what assets could be used as security for the loan facility security over certain assets trigger registration requirements under nigerian law while some are exempt from registration requirements these would largely depend on what is being financed and the structure of the borrower type of security the lender should consider the type of security that would be most appropriate for the facility and type of asset available possible security interests include mortgages charges fixed and floating pledges liens and hypothecation among others the remedies available on enforcement may influence the lender s consideration of the type of security to be created due diligence of the company and the asset to be used as security the lender should perform due diligence on the company to ascertain the risks inherent in the financing and how best these risks can be mitigated due diligence should involve a search of the company s records at the corporate affairs commission as well as on the security at the relevant registry a commission search should reveal whether the company has any existing registrable security and whether annual returns have been filed by the company up to date lenders should note that failure to be up to date with annual returns filings would adversely affect the lenders ability to register its security where such requires registrations until the returns are brought up to date lenders should also conduct due diligence on the assets to be granted as security in the case of assets with their own registries eg land ships and aircraft searches should also be conducted at the relevant registries due diligence on the company will enable the lender to ascertain the overall financial health of the company and any security that may have priority over the security to be created the lender should also consider tax which is withheld at 10 on interests payable on the loan this is typically addressed in favour of the lender through gross up clauses in the financing and security documents are there plans or proposals for reform or significant changes to the regulatory landscape in this area the lending industry in nigeria has been undergoing extensive business law reforms such reforms include the credit reporting act 2017 which made it easier for credit data gathering and reporting lenders can now obtain credit records on potential borrowers from one of the credit bureaux another reform is the secured transactions in movable assets act 2017 which seeks to enhance financial inclusion in nigeria stimulate responsible lending to micro small and medium sized enterprises facilitate access to credit secured with movable assets facilitate perfection of security interests in movable assets facilitate realisation of security interests in movable assets and establish a collateral registry and provide for its operations the legislative arm of the government is in the last stage of passing a bill to repeal the extant companies and allied matters act 1990 and re enact a new act structuring a lending transaction general who are the active providers of secured finance in your jurisdiction eg international banks local banks or non bank financial institutions the institutions involved in the active provision of secured finance are local and international banks finance companies primary mortgage institutions non bank financial institutions government development banks microfinance banks and private equity and venture capital funds is well established market standard facility documentation used in your jurisdiction for secured lending transactions yes market standard facility documentation is used in nigeria for secured lending transactions a lot of bilateral and syndicated loans in nigeria are modelled on the loan market association forms and precedents the nigeria single currency secured term facility agreement of the loan market association is one of the agreement forms that has been customised for use in the nigerian lending market syndication are syndicated secured loan facilities typical in your jurisdiction yes lending institutions in nigeria engage in syndicated secured lending for large transactions how are syndicated facilities normally structured does the law in your jurisdiction allow a facility agent to be appointed to act on behalf of other banking syndicate members typically the borrower instructs a financial institution to arrange the facility on its behalf the arranger markets the facility and secures the participation of other banks or commercial lenders to make commitments to the facility in some instances some of the proposed syndicate members become co arrangers on the facility the arranger appoints a law firm to act as lender s counsel on behalf of the syndicate of lenders the lender s counsel conducts due diligence on the borrower and drafts the financing and security documents the facility agreement is based on the loan market association form of facility agreement for nigeria an all asset debenture is typically prepared by the lenders counsel the all asset debenture creates security which may consist of mortgages fixed and floating charges and security assignments over the assets of the borrower it is also quite common in nigeria to have the key shareholders of the borrower create a charge over their shares in the borrower the security is typically held by a corporate trustee for and on behalf of the lenders a facility agent is recognised under nigerian law a facility agent is typically appointed as a representative of the lenders subject to the terms of the transaction the arranger or another lender or lenders act as facility agents under the facility agreement facility agents coordinate the loan for the lenders the role typically includes receiving the interest and repayments from the borrower and distributing them to the members of the syndicate monitoring performance by the borrower of its obligations under the facility agreements and acting as liaison between the lenders and the borrower does the law in your jurisdiction allow security and guarantees to be held on trust by a security trustee for the benefit of the banking syndicate yes nigerian law allows security and guarantees to be held on trust by a security trustee for the benefit of the banking syndicate however based on the loan market association facility agreement any guarantees to be provided especially by sponsors of the borrower are typically embedded in the facility agreement where the guarantee is a separate document this can be held by the security trustee on behalf of the syndicate of lenders once the security trustee has been validly appointed the security trustee is recognised as the legal holder of the security on proper perfection of the security the syndicate of lenders can appoint a member of the syndicate or a third party as a security trustee however in nigeria a third party corporate trustee is preferred corporate trustees are regulated by the securities and exchange commission the rights powers and duties of the security trustee are usually regulated by the terms of the trust deed which typically include the rights available to a receiver under the law special purpose vehicle financing is it common in secured finance transactions for special purpose vehicles spvs to be used to hold the assets being financed would security generally be given over the shares in the spv or would lenders require direct asset security it is uncommon in secured finance transactions for special purpose vehicles spvs to be used to hold the assets being financed unless it is a project finance in project finance transactions the assets of the projects are held by spvs which serves to ring fence the assets from the assets of the sponsors however in corporate finance transactions the borrower does not go through the process of setting up an spv to hold the assets but rather grants security over the assets held by it where spvs are used security is typically given over the shares of the spv in addition to direct asset security lenders insist on direct asset security in most instances due to registration requirements and to create a defence against subsequent encumbrancers even where an spv is not used it is becoming more common for lenders to require security over the shares of the borrower where the shareholding of the borrower is closely held and not diverse interest is interest most commonly calculated by reference to a bank base rate or a market standard variable reference rate eg libor euribor or hibor if the latter which is the most commonly used reference rate in your jurisdiction the central bank of nigeria sets the universal base rate for calculating chargeable interest in lending transactions in nigeria local banks sometimes set different benchmarks for local naira denominated loans such as the nigerian interbank offer rate however for foreign currency denominated loans the most common variable reference rate is the libor are there any regulatory restrictions on the rate of interest that can be charged on bank loans yes the central bank of nigeria by virtue of the central bank of nigeria act is the regulatory authority which provides regulatory restrictions on the rate of interest chargeable on bank loans the central bank of nigeria requires banks to give full disclosure on lending rates a circular is issued by the bank from time to time publishing the interest rates that banks can charge the public on loans and advances for different sectors these interest rates are to be used in the offer letters and facility documentation for the loans use and creation of guarantees are guarantees used in your jurisdiction yes guarantees may be given by both legal and juristic persons what is the procedure for their creation a guarantee contract must be evidenced in writing and signed by the guarantor or its agent based on nigerian law of contract which requires that for a contract to be valid it must be backed by consideration or made by deed in the same way as for a loan authorisation for a guarantee provided by a company is by way of a resolution of the company directors where the loan market association agreement is used and the guarantee is to be provided by the parent or majority shareholder of the company such guarantee is embedded in the facility agreement otherwise it is a separate document a guarantee executed in nigeria or relating to a thing to be done in nigeria must be stamped in accordance with the stamp duties act for it to be tendered in evidence do any laws affect or restrict the granting or enforceability of guarantees in your jurisdiction eg upstream guarantees nigerians are generally free to give guarantees to foreign entity however there are certain entities which are restricted from giving guarantees for example banks require the prior written consent of the central bank of nigeria before granting security over their assets or giving guarantees in respect of loans taken from foreign entities other than bank deposits in the ordinary course of business federal government ministries departments and agencies may also not give guarantees without the approval of the federal executive council otherwise there are no restrictions and the enforceability of guarantees in nigeria is largely subject to the laws of contract and commercial transactions subordination and priority describe the most common methods of structuring the priority of debts and security under nigerian law a fixed charge has priority over a floating charge affecting the same property unless the terms on which the floating charge was granted prohibited the company from granting any later charge having priority over the floating charge and the person in whose favour such later charge was granted had actual notice of that prohibition at the time when the charge was granted however the doctrine of constructive notice of registered documents has been abolished so knowledge is not imputed simply because the security document containing a negative pledge was registered at the corporate affairs commission where the equities are equal priority is determined by registration the security registered first by a genuine creditor without notice takes priority over an earlier interest on the same property in relation to a corporate borrower nigerian law recognises the priority of a registered charge as ranking in priority over an unregistered charge where registration of a charge of a corporate borrower is required by law failure to register renders such charge void against the liquidators and any creditor of the company if two security interests granted to two separate creditors are both required to be registered with the corporate affairs commission and are registered as prescribed the security s date of creation rather than its registration determines priority between the security interests nevertheless lenders can contractually structure the priority of debts and security this is done by entering into an intercreditor and security sharing deed between themselves and the trustee where the security is held by a trustee the deed will provide for the terms of sharing of the security and for a lender to turnover any payments it received from the borrower to be shared in accordance with the terms of the deed documentary taxes and stamp duty are any taxes stamp duty or other fees payable on the granting of a loan guarantee or security interest or on its enforcement yes there are some documentary taxes and stamp duties payable on the granting of a loan guarantee or security interest in nigeria these include stamp duty pursuant to the stamp duties act all instruments executed in nigeria or relating wheresoever executed to any property situate or any matter or thing done or to be done in nigeria will not except in criminal proceedings be given in evidence or be available for any purpose whatever unless it is duly stamped thus where loan or security documents fit this bill they will require stamping stamp duty is also typically paid on loan agreements and security documents on an ad valorem basis asset registry fees where the property to be used as security consists of a property with its own registry security over such asset must be registered at the relevant registry and registration and other administrative fees may be payable corporate affairs commission fees for the registration of security at the commission is charged ad valorem on the value of the loan value added tax value added tax is chargeable on fees and other vatable supplies in respect of the loan documentation and perfection of security in addition other fees may be payable on the enforcement of security such fees vary depending on where the security is situated cross border lending governing law is it more common for local law to govern the terms of the facility documentation or is the law of another jurisdiction often elected by the parties eg english law or new york law there is freedom to contract under nigerian law and parties may choose the law that they want to govern their loan documents however english law is the most commonly used governing law for cross border lending in which case the english courts are also typically preferred however there has been an increase in parties opting for arbitration for the settlement of disputes however nigerian law is typically the governing law of security documents in respect of assets located in nigeria restrictions are there any restrictions on the making of loans by foreign lenders or the granting of security or guarantees to foreign lenders a foreign lender should be aware that it may need to obtain a certificate of capital importation cci in respect of fund availed the nigerian borrower a cci is a receipt issued by an authorised dealer a bank or other financial institution registered as such acknowledging that foreign exchange has been brought into nigeria and converted into naira a cci guarantees unconditional transferability and repatriation of the loan and interest including any recoveries from the secured asset on enforcement foreign lenders are unable to hold land and other assets directly in nigeria and must appoint a nigerian entity to act as its security trustee to hold the security interest over the asset to be secured nigerian banks must also seek the consent of the central bank of nigeria before they can give a guarantee to a foreign lender other than in the ordinary course of their business are there any exchange controls that restrict payments to a foreign lender under a security document guarantee or loan agreement yes there are restrictions on payments to a foreign lender under nigerian law repatriation of the principal and interest sum by the foreign lender is regulated by foreign exchange monitoring and miscellaneous provisions act a foreign lender must have obtained a cci at the point of importation of the loan into nigeria the cci grants the lender access to the central bank of nigeria foreign exchange market where the naira is converted to the lender s currency for repatriation to the lender s country however there are some companies which earn foreign exchange eg oil and gas companies which would rather not convert loans to naira and thus make the procurement of a cci impossible this is because they tend to make cash calls and earn revenue in dollars and can pay interest and principal in dollars without recourse to the official foreign exchange market the risk here is that if there is a default and the lender needs to enforce security it may get its proceeds in naira and repatriation would be difficult security general security agreements is it possible to create a security interest over all assets of an entity if so would a single security agreement suffice or is a separate agreement required for each type of asset yes it is possible to create a security interest over all the assets of an entity in this case one security document will suffice typically called an all asset debenture in nigeria release of security what are the formalities for releasing security over the most common forms of assets the lender will execute a deed of release the deed of release is a registrable instrument which must be stamped at the federal inland revenue service and registered at the applicable registries this may include the asset registry the corporate affairs commission and the national collateral registry for movable chattels asset classes used as collateral for security real estate can security be granted over real estate if so what are the most common forms of security granted over real estate and what is the procedure yes security can be granted over real estate the common form of security granted over real estate is a mortgage or charge mortgages must be made in writing and be registered at the land registry where the property is located until registered they will remain inchoate and are equitable mortgages where it is given by a corporate entity it must also be registered with the corporate affairs commission the consent of the governor of the state where the property is located must be obtained for a legal mortgage over real estate to be valid and enforceable and where the land is held by the federal government or any of its agencies the consent of the minister of lands housing and urban development is required machinery and equipment can security be granted over machinery and equipment if so what are the most common forms of security granted over this kind of property and what is the procedure security can be granted over machinery and equipment usually in the form of a mortgage charge or pledge a mortgage or charge over a tangible movable asset eg machinery and equipment is created by a transfer of title to the assets with a provision for re conveyance at discharge similar to creating a mortgage over real estate a pledge is created by depositing the machinery and equipment and in certain cases the title documents to the machinery and equipment with the lender as security for the debt on condition that the pledged machinery and equipment will be returned to the borrower if the debt is discharged or sold if the borrower defaults the essential element of a pledge under nigerian law is actual or constructive possession such security interest when created must be registered with the national collateral registry pursuant to the secured transactions in movable assets act 2017 where it is created by a company it must be registered with the corporate affairs commission receivables can security be granted over receivables if so what are the most common forms of security granted over this kind of property and what is the procedure yes security can be granted over receivables such as debts insurance policies proceeds and contractual rights the common forms of security granted over these kinds of property are assignment of receivables by way of security charges option rights established as security and mortgages in the case of an assignment notice of the assignment must be given to the borrower s

service and registered as a charge at the corporate affairs commission financial instruments and cash can security be granted over financial instruments if so what are the most common forms of security granted over this kind of property and what is the procedure yes security can be granted over financial instruments by way of pledge or charge the most common types of financial instrument

are involved the borrower typically provides the lender with an undated blank share transfer form which are to be dated and the name of the transferee inserted on enforcement as well as board resolution accepting the transfer on enforcement and authorising the transferee s name to be entered in the register of members in respect of the share on enforcement can security be granted over cash deposits if so what are the most common forms of security granted over this kind of property and what is the procedure yes security can be granted over cash deposits the most common forms of security over cash deposits is a charge the charge may be fixed or floating for a charge on cash deposits the borrower and lender enter into a deed of charge and are required to inform the financial institution managing the account on the borrower s behalf of the charge and the lender s interest in some cases the borrower may be required to create an escrow account where such cash deposit is held by a third party for the benefit of the borrower and lender under agreed terms and conditions where the charge over deposits is a fixed charge the deed of charge creating security over cash deposits need not be registered at the corporate affairs commission as it is not a book debt to which the registration requirements apply however where the charge is a floating charge it requires registration at the corporate affairs commission as a floating charge the deed must also be duty stamped at the federal inland revenue service intellectual property can security be granted over intellectual property if so what are the most common forms of security granted over this kind of property and what is the procedure yes nigerian law recognises the grant of security over intellectual property

by the charge holder who seeks to enforce its security and charges whose holder ranks before it for payment of principal or interest and any circumstance occurs which entitles a charge holder which ranks for payment of principal or interest in priority to the charges secured by the general floating charges to realise its security process for enforcement what are the most common procedures for enforcement are there any specific requirements with which lenders must comply in nigeria the common procedures for enforcement in event of default are appointment of a receiver or a receiver and

the united states and taiwan have charted a strong history of trust and cooperation guided by the 1979 taiwan relations act tra today the two nations have more in common than ever before both share values related to democratic principles open and free markets and respect for the rule of law over the past four decades taiwan has proven to be a reliable and strong partner for america in advancing freedom opportunity and prosperity in the region and around the globe more can be accomplished however as the two partners have more to offer to each other in particular the trump administration and congress should continue to advance u s taiwan economic relations by focusing on 1 pursuing a u s taiwan free trade agreement 2 enhancing energy cooperation and 3 advocating taiwan s membership in the three major washington based multilateral financial institutions the taiwan relations act at 40 this year commemorates the 40th anniversary of the tra on which america s unique and secure relationship with taiwan has been grounded the preamble of the tra stipulates that the act is to help maintain peace security and stability in the western pacific and to promote the foreign policy of the united states by authorizing the continuation of commercial cultural and other relations between the people of the united states and the people on taiwan and for other purposes ref the tra is exceptional in purpose and form it is the only law to govern nearly every aspect of u s relations with a foreign government in the absence of formal diplomatic relations it sets forth clear policy goals and establishes an institutional framework to meet those objectives the fact that the tra has been in force without amendment over the past 40 years is remarkable signed into law on april 10 1979 the tra came into existence out of the need for the united states to find a way to protect its significant security and commercial interests in taiwan in the wake of president jimmy carter s termination of diplomatic relations with taiwan as well as a mutual defense treaty dating from the 1949 communist takeover of mainland china members of the house of representatives and senate from both parties worked together to craft a bill passing the tra with a near unanimous vote to set the framework and course for america s ongoing engagement with taiwan over the ensuing decades subsequent congresses whether controlled by democrats or republicans repeatedly have sought to bolster the tra by expressing strong moral and political support for taiwan and urging successive administrations to back up america s commitment to taiwan with tangible support providing policy continuity the tra has survived the test of time in the face of constant and growing criticism from beijing not surprisingly taiwan s support in washington has been strong and is getting stronger over the past year congress has reinforced the tra by enacting two new laws the taiwan travel act that encourages official visits between washington and taipei at all levels of government and the asia reassurance initiative act that reiterates american support for taiwan s key role in its indo pacific strategy taiwan an enduring partner for america in the indo pacific region the tra has played an indispensable role in shaping american policy toward taiwan and u s strategy in asia the united states has clearly recognized that supporting a taiwan that is free to make its own decisions and free from coercion by the people s republic of china is in america s vital national security interest as specified in the preamble of the legislation the tra in fact is explicit about the connection between taiwan and the maintenance of peace security and stability in the western pacific in a testament to that unambiguous geopolitical and economic link taiwan and the united states have become strong allies sharing powerful commitments to the values of democracy the rule of law and free markets the relationship today is a fruitful partnership that delivers measurable and concrete benefits for americans and taiwanese alike in his june 2018 speech at the dedication ceremony of the new american institute in taiwan office complex board chairman james moriarty summed up succinctly as taiwan has transformed itself into a vibrant democracy and a model for the indo pacific region and beyond our relationship has grown into a close partnership based on the unshakable foundation of shared values and interests ref as a country with an impressive record as a constructive member of the world community despite efforts by mainland china to isolate and marginalize it taiwan is providing a positive example for others of a pathway to development and prosperity based on high degrees of both political and economic freedom in its latest edition of freedom in the world an annual report that assesses political rights and civil liberties around the globe freedom house classifies taiwan as a free nation ref on the economic front the heritage foundation s 25threfedition of the index of economic freedom now ranks taiwan as the 10th freest economy in the world ref time to move the tra onward and upward taiwan has been a steadfast partner for america and there is no better way to mark the 40th anniversary of the tra than to reaffirm the u s commitment to taiwan and enhance it with greater practical engagement particularly in the area of economic cooperation as taiwan has developed into one of asia s most vibrant market oriented democracies its economic relationship with the united states has steadily grown stronger becoming one of the most important pillars supporting the vital relationship between the two countries yet more can be done particularly as stipulated by the tra the u s government should promote extensive close and friendly commercial cultural and other relations between the people of the united states and the people on taiwan to that end three initiatives provide significant opportunities for immediate success 1 pursuing an open trade partnership agreement as members of the world trade organization both the u s and taiwan are allowed to negotiate a free trade agreement the already good u s taiwan trade and investment relationship would benefit from such an upgrade the overarching objective of america s strategic economic statecraft in the indo pacific region must be to facilitate the expansion of the open trade and investment networks that provide the best chance of creating new opportunities for innovation and greater prosperity ref a bilateral u s taiwan free trade agreement would be a critical lynchpin for realizing that strategic objective as a recent american enterprise institute research paper pointed out the first new bilateral trade agreement under the trump administration s free and open indo pacific strategy will signal its vision for the region ref a bilateral trade initiative with taiwan would be a strong statement of america s determination to support political and economic freedom and stand as an important bulwark against growing chinese efforts to gain influence 2 enhancing energy cooperation at all levels the united states and taiwan are well situated to advance energy trade and security as a reliable supplier and a strategic buyer respectively advancing energy cooperation between the countries is a natural and constructive step forward given both the demand for energy in taiwan and increased production in the u s there has been a significant increase in taiwan s purchases of u s crude oil and petroleum products over the past few years taiwan has signed a memorandum of understanding to purchase liquefied natural gas from the u s for the next 20 years ref the u s and taiwan should develop a forward looking bilateral strategic energy trade initiative to ensure a durable energy partnership ultimately such an initiative could be developed into a regional energy architecture involving other countries such as korea and japan as well 3 supporting taiwan s membership in the three major washington based multilateral financial institutions the international monetary fund imf the world bank and the inter american development bank despite decades of dynamic economic growth and the emergence of a vibrant democracy and with a population larger than that of australia that makes significant contributions to the world taiwan remains excluded at china s insistence from many international organizations including the imf as a result it is unable to fully participate in and contribute its various resources to multilateral development banks such as the world bank and the inter american development bank in order to become a member of the world bank taiwan must first be admitted to the imf ref u s leadership to convince the nations of the world including china that taiwan has much to contribute on issues of economic development and should no longer be excluded from major dialogues or initiatives in this area would pay big dividends in terms of the bilateral relationship and is the right thing to do for the taiwanese people conclusion taiwan has become one of the principal u s partners in addressing an array of global challenges as well as diplomatic opportunities in his speech to the american chamber of commerce in taipei last year deputy assistant secretary of state alex wong underscored america s enduring partnership with taiwan the u s commitment to taiwan doesn t change from administration to administration or from president to president it doesn t change with the rise or fall of the fortunes of other powers in the region it doesn t change with the emergence of new challenges or new threats because our relationship isn t transactional instead it is undergirded and animated by shared and enduring values the united states has been is and always will be taiwan s closest friend and partner ref the past 40 years of u s taiwan relations under the framework of the tra have been a true partnership for freedom now is the time to take bold steps to ensure that in the next 40 years taiwan remains a reliable and like minded ally for america in advancing freedom opportunity and prosperity in the indo pacific region and beyond anthony b kim is editor of the index of economic freedom and research manager in the center for international trade and economics cite of the kathryn and shelby cullom davis institute for national security and foreign policy at the heritage foundation terry miller is director of cite and mark a kolokotrones fellow in economic freedom
