the prospect is proud to exclusively release the book take back our party restoring the democratic legacy by james kwak we will release one chapter every other day over the next two weeks read the introduction our new choice plainly rejects the old categories and false alternatives they impose liberal or conservative the truth is it s both and it s different bill clinton at the 1991 annual conference of the democratic leadership council i have a poor memory of my own life but i remember where i was when bill clinton was elected president kroeber hall on the campus of the university of california berkeley in the evening of november 3 1992 a friend and i were listening to the radio on a boombox when we heard the news the nightmare of the reagan bush years was over we hugged the democrats were back in power not surprisingly i learned my politics from my parents they came to the united states from south korea as they say in search of a better life my father arrived in san francisco in 1953 on a freight ship that returned to america after delivering food to gis fighting the korean war he then took a train and a bus across the country arriving at wesleyan college two months after the semester started never having received the letter from wesleyan telling him it was too late to come my mother came nine years later to study at the university of michigan from them i learned that the democrats were the party of workers unions and the poor while the republicans were the party of business and the rich the archetypal democratic hero at the time was franklin roosevelt the president of the new deal which included massive public works projects to fight unemployment comprehensive regulation of the financial system and the creation of social security in 1944 he called for a second bill of rights which would guarantee all americans a job basic material necessities housing health care and an education but which never materialized his successor harry truman proposed a universal single payer health care program and in 1964 president lyndon johnson declared unconditional war on poverty pushing forward a legislative agenda that included medicare medicaid food stamps and federal subsidies for schools with poor children that was what the democratic brand still meant in the 1970s when i was a child at that moment however the legacy of the new deal was in danger weakened by the vietnam war and economic stagnation with a growing backlash against regulation high taxes and the civil rights movement the modern american conservative movement which had languished in obscurity as recently as the 1950s was poised to take over the republican party and then the country democrats were aware that president johnson s anti poverty platform was losing viability on the national level jimmy carter represented an alternative to traditional liberalism but he was soundly rejected by voters in 1980 in favor of ronald reagan who gave off an aura of breezy confidence that lower taxes and smaller government would unleash the american innovative spirit and usher in a new age of prosperity the reality of the reagan revolution with its tax cuts for the rich and assault on the welfare state was the fulfillment of democrats worst nightmares after 12 years of reagan and george h w bush we were desperate for change the change that clinton represented however went beyond a simple partisan shift in the white house his historical significance lay in what he did not do he did not reverse the conservative revolution and restore the core values of the new deal instead clinton signaled something far more important a realignment of the traditional account of american politics in which democrats represented wage workers and republicans represented executives and business owners things were never quite so simple of course democrats had long been financially dependent on particular segments of the business class increasingly throughout the 1980s but in general terms the economic identities of the two parties were clear the clinton election was a crucial turning point in a transformation of the democratic party that has lasted to this day more than a quarter of a century later as the republicans shifted to the right metamorphosing from perfunctory defenders of corporate america to rabid zealots for unregulated markets and minimal government the democrats followed in their wake the party that was once our country s closest approximation to social democrats instead became technocratic cheerleaders for the market economy democratic politicians abandoned government policies that directly aided the disabled the unlucky and the poor consoling themselves with the idea that facilitating overall economic growth was the best way to help the less fortunate expand stephan savoia ap photo bill clinton and al gore at a campaign stop in carlisle pennsylvania july 1992 the clinton nomination in 1992 was itself the end product of a concerted effort to move the democratic party away from the left with its embarrassing baggage of welfare programs and labor unions and toward a more modern center in the public s mind republicans had successfully portrayed their opponents as tax and spend liberals who suppressed individual initiative gave handouts to welfare queens coddled criminals and appeased communists instead of trying to stand up for the social safety net and progressive taxes and a humane criminal justice system many democratic leaders and strategists chose to distance themselves from their liberal past accepting the conservative caricature of the new deal and its legacy the new democratic party would be responsible with the nation s finances strong on national defense tough on crime friendly to business unfriendly to unions except at election time and supportive of free markets in other words it would be a lot like the republican party but somehow drawing on the credit it had built up from the 1930s through the 1960s it would still claim to be the party of ordinary people the shift toward a market centric ideology was foreshadowed by president carter s 1980 re election campaign as he unsuccessfully tried to co opt reagan s vocabulary of individual initiative and freedom every day millions of economic decisions are made in factories in automobile showrooms in banks and in brokerage houses on farms and around kitchen tables according to private needs and private individual judgments he said attempting to rebut the charge that democrats represented government control over the economy pressure to move the party to the right increased after carter s stinging loss and the loss of the senate majority for the first time since the eisenhower administration louisiana representative gillis long the new chair of the house democratic caucus sponsored the creation of a new committee on party effectiveness staffed notably by al from this committee began formulating a new platform one focused on increasing private sector competitiveness reducing government spending fighting inflation and strengthening national defense we want to move away from a temporary economic policy of redistribution to a long term policy of growth and opportunity representative tim wirth told reporters in 1982 the takeover of the party began in earnest however after president reagan routed democratic nominee walter mondale in the 1984 presidential election which many people thought demonstrated the impotence of traditional liberalism despite the fact that mondale had promised higher taxes to reduce the national debt only weeks after the election a group of major democratic fundraisers met to discuss how they might use their fund raising skills to move the party toward their business oriented centrist viewpoints the same month at an event held by the centrist coalition for a democratic majority governors bruce babbitt of arizona and charles robb of virginia rejected the new deal and emphasized the need for the party to embrace the business community in 1985 former caucus committee director al from founded the democratic leadership council which rejected the populist economic agenda inherited from roosevelt and johnson in favor of market based solutions that could broaden the party s appeal to the upper middle class and corporate america we cannot afford to become a liberal party from wrote in a memo for long our message must attract moderates and conservatives as well their new message was a paean to growth and opportunity the private sector not government is the primary engine for economic growth from wrote later government s proper role is to foster private sector growth and to equip every american with the opportunities and skills that he or she needs to succeed in the private economy the dlc was one of the central institutions of what came to be known as the new democrats who distinguished themselves from the presumably old democrats by staking out moderate or conservative that is republican positions on issues like defense spending crime inflation budget deficits and free trade the progressive policy institute a think tank spun off from the dlc even adopted one of the conservatives favorite attack lines arguing that the minimum wage harmed poor people by raising prices in 1990 arkansas governor bill clinton became chair of the dlc he later wrote in his memoir the so called new democrat philosophy was the backbone of my 1992 campaign for president clinton spent his term as chair promoting the key themes of economic growth limited government and personal responsibility around the country particularly in key primary states before officially announcing his presidential candidacy in october 1991 he was joined on the campaign trail by bruce reed former dlc policy director who later became head of the president s domestic policy council robert shapiro who moved from the progressive policy institute to become a campaign adviser and later an undersecretary in the commerce department and of course vice presidential nominee al gore a longtime dlc stalwart after the election al from headed domestic policy on the transition team dlc vice chair mike espy was named secretary of agriculture and dlc member lloyd bentsen became treasury secretary in many ways clinton was the perfect standard bearer for the new democrats he was a southern governor apparently unstained by the corruption of the big city or of congress he had an impressive reputation as a policy wonk having won a rhodes scholarship and graduated from the yale law school he could fly back to arkansas during the campaign to order the execution of the mentally disabled ricky ray rector to demonstrate how tough on crime he was he emphasized welfare reform and school choice to highlight his willingness to break with past orthodoxies he openly rejected his own party the choice we offer is not conservative or liberal in many ways it is not even republican or democratic he said accepting the nomination of the democratic party expand joe marquette ap photo president clinton shakes hands with secretary of state madeleine albright before beginning his state of the union address february 4 1997 and yet in public clinton played as a populist he promised opportunity for a middle class that worked hard and played by the rules his optimistic post partisan rhetoric papered over the fact that many of his substantive positions tax cuts smaller government welfare limits increased policing charter schools and so on were taken straight from republicans he was campaigning during the aftermath of a mild recession promising jobs and health care more importantly he could act like a man of the people and like no one else he could feel your pain president clinton sustained that magic throughout his eight years in the white house as his policies became more and more firmly anchored in the center his personal charisma and political gifts preserved his image as a defender of the common man two decades later democrats memories of the clinton administration tend to retain the monica lewinsky scandal eight years of uninterrupted economic expansion and little else but in that period clinton put his stamp on the identity of his party like no president since franklin roosevelt because he wanted to be all things to all people clinton won the 1992 election promising not just welfare reform but also a middle class tax cut health care reform and more jobs even before his inauguration however his economic team sat him down and explained that his top priority would have to be not programs aimed at ordinary americans but the bond market on january 7 1993 the president elect held a meeting with his economic team in little rock arkansas according to his advisers including robert rubin former co chairman of goldman sachs and clinton s choice as director of the national economic council wall street was concerned about the large budget deficits incurred by republican tax cuts and spending increases investors were demanding high interest rates to buy treasury bonds which raised rates throughout the economy making it harder for businesses and households to borrow and constraining growth the solution was to reduce budget deficits which would lower interest rates and encourage more economic activity clinton supposedly responded you mean to tell me that the success of the program and my reelection hinges on the federal reserve and a bunch of fucking bond traders but he sided with the bond market giving up his hoped for domestic programs for a package of tax increases and deficit reduction targets the bill squeaked through congress and helped fuel the republicans sweeping victories in the 1994 midterm elections in retrospect there are arguments in favor of the 1993 tax increase it did reduce budget deficits interest rates did fall and the economy did expand for the next seven years by the time clinton left office the federal government was actually running a surplus on an annual basis still it is impossible to definitively say what policy produced what macroeconomic outcome interest rates were already falling and the economy had already begun growing in march 1991 it is clear however that the decision to focus on deficits left a lasting imprint on the identity of the democratic party the economic boom of the 1990s the longest in modern american economic history at the time and the budget surpluses of clinton s second term allowed his party to claim the high ground when it came to fiscal rectitude and macroeconomic management in the past democrats had been big spenders willing to shove money at the nation s problems while republicans had been the mature adults worrying about deficits now the tables were turned the republican party was in the hands of conservatives who cut taxes at every opportunity fervently insisting that deficits would require spending cuts in the future by contrast clinton and his successors could claim to be the prudent responsible ones who understood how the economy worked this is why democrats have objected to every republican tax cut on the grounds that it would increase deficits and why barack obama made a grand bargain to reduce the national debt a top political priority even while the economy was struggling to recover from the great recession clinton remained determined to follow through on his campaign promise of health care reform one challenge was that he and his team led by hillary clinton wary of undermining their newfound credibility as deficit fighters insisted that their plan had to be budget neutral and could not require additional new taxes beyond those in the 1993 budget bill perhaps more important they rejected the basic model proposed by earlier generations of democrats a universal single payer health insurance program similar to medicare instead they were convinced that managed market competition not a new government entitlement could provide the solution to america s health care problems under the clinton plan consumers would choose their insurance from among plans offered by private insurers either via large employers or via regional health alliances competition the argument went would give insurers the incentive to deliver superior health plans at reasonable prices and insurers would then put pressure on providers to ensure quality and control costs there are many reasons why health care reform suffered an ignominious defeat in congress never even coming up for a vote the episode however was another landmark in the shift of the democratic party toward market based technocratic policies and away from the new deal blueprint of large scale government social programs the political backlash to the clinton tax increase and health care debacle was overwhelming and immediate the 1994 midterm elections gave republicans control of both houses of congress for the first time since the 1950s the president s response was to double down on triangulation staking out a third position on the political landscape distinct from both democrats and republicans and so it was clinton a democratic president who announced in his 1996 state of the union address that the era of big government is over what began as a clever strategy to secure re election in the wake of the crushing midterm defeat has since become the standard playbook of the party splitting the difference between conservative republicans and a caricature of a liberal democratic base whose primary function is to make the party establishment seem reasonable by comparison in most cases triangulation has led to the adoption of positions once characteristic of moderate republicans expand mike albans ap photo new york city police officers stand guard over a wounded man in times square february 1994 one way to seek out the middle was to enact tough on crime bills including the violent crime control and law enforcement act of 1994 which increased funding for police and prisons while lengthening sentences for federal crimes and the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of 1996 which virtually eliminated the ability of the federal courts to review state court decisions particularly in death penalty cases after 1994 the clinton administration s only significant contribution to tax policy was a handout to the rich the reduction in the maximum tax rate on capital gains from 28 percent to 20 percent in 1997 capital gains are the profits realized from selling assets and thus are mainly collected by the wealthy another of the president s meager economic policy achievements was the ratification and implementation of the north american free trade agreement although the effects of nafta on the american economy were relatively slight it helped democrats distance themselves from their traditional roots in labor unions while ingratiating themselves with the business community and burnishing their image as advocates of free trade and it led to more aggressive trade actions like establishing permanent normal trade relations with china which had a far more disastrous impact on the nation s industrial base responsible for an 18 percent reduction in manufacturing employment from 2001 to 2007 at the core of the new democrats agenda was disassociating their party from the welfare state since the 1960s conservatives had criticized government assistance programs for undermining personal responsibility and encouraging dependency on the state by the 1980s association with welfare was an enormous political weakness for democrats republicans successfully popularized the image of the welfare queen and tarred democrats as soft hearted weak minded liberals who raised taxes on people who worked to fund lavish benefits for people who didn t in 1984 charles murray s hugely influential book losing ground written with funding from two conservative think tanks the manhattan institute and the heritage foundation argued that welfare programs harmed poor people by undermining their incentive to work instead of defending the social safety net the new democrats simply co opted the issue adopting the idea that the poor needed better incentives to participate in the labor market in 1986 dlc chair charles robb called for a social policy that rewards self discipline and hard work not one that penalizes individual initiative in his 1992 campaign clinton staked out a position well to the right of president bush promising to end welfare as we know it and to impose a new work requirement that would kick in after two years of government assistance in a 1993 interview clinton said analysis is essentially right although he did not necessarily agree with the author s policy prescriptions once in office clinton backed his words with action after his own welfare reform proposal fizzled out the 1994 elections gave the initiative to congressional republicans while the president attacked some of their more extreme proposals his administration quietly signaled his openness to a bill that he eventually signed into law as the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of 1996 an orwellian name even by washington standards as promised the act completely transformed the welfare system it eliminated aid to families with dependent children which had ensured a federal entitlement to cash support and replaced it with temporary assistance for needy families a new program that allocated money as block grants to states which could spend it more or less however they wished the block grants were also designed to decline over time after accounting for inflation prwora set a lifetime maximum of five years of welfare support from federal funds and placed work requirements on recipients while giving states the latitude to impose their own more onerous restrictions this welfare to work bill also included severe cuts to food stamp benefits and in a premonition of worse things to come cut off most legal immigrants from both food stamps and supplemental security income paid to the disabled and the very poor elderly politically welfare reform paid off handsomely clinton followed through on a 1992 campaign promise just in time for re election while neutering a potent republican attack line by breaking with much of his own party prwora was passed mainly with republican votes while congressional democrats were roughly evenly split the president perfectly executed the triangulation strategy distinguishing himself from both poles of the political system or as republican presidential nominee bob dole put it by selling out his own party bill clinton has proven he is ideologically adrift at the same time by vetoing two earlier more conservative bills clinton could still claim to be the protector of the downtrodden or at least not as bad as the republicans he swept to victory over dole just a few months later while the balance of power in congress remained virtually unchanged seeming to demonstrate the benefits of running to the middle and portraying both liberals and conservatives as out of touch with america welfare reform signaled that the democrats were no longer the party of handouts to the poor instead of cash the new democrats promised to provide opportunity which meant giving people the education necessary to compete in the new economy not surprisingly president clinton saw market incentives as the key to improving the public school system he embraced the idea of accountability which was euphemistic shorthand for making the educational market more competitive his administration supported nationwide k 12 standards and a requirement that states turn around or close schools that failed to meet those standards in theory a way to mimic the competitive forces of capitalism the president also endorsed the budding charter school movement which sought to provide a new source of competition to traditional public schools which would be forced to improve or risk losing their students to the new entrants the federal charter school program created in 1994 provided funds to support the development of charter schools by states and towns when it came to higher education president clinton helped launch the federal direct student loan program under which the government lends directly to students instead of subsidizing and guaranteeing loans made by banks thereby ensuring them risk free profits this was a small step in the right direction but the focus on loan programs typified the new democrats approach to education instead of thinking of a college education as something that an advanced society should provide to its citizens they saw it as an individual s private investment in her human capital the government s role was simply to provide a nudge to make that investment easier to finance at the same time the higher education amendments act of 1998 made it more difficult to discharge student loans in bankruptcy while this provision may have caused banks to lower interest rates on student loans because they now faced less risk of not being paid back it also had the effect of punishing those people who were unable to turn their college studies into higher paying jobs with welfare reform and education policy the new democrats repudiated the vocabulary of social solidarity and economic security in favor of their cherished themes of opportunity accountability and competitiveness but to recast the party as architects of a dynamic fast growing economy it was not enough to simply cut deficits and lower interest rates by explicitly identifying themselves with the financial sector and with wall street in particular the democrats rebranded themselves as the party of an innovative prosperous future this historic rapprochement with the bankers traditionally a republican stronghold began with an open door to financial industry executives unprecedented for a democratic white house expand dennis cook ap photo treasury secretary robert rubin in 1995 robert rubin the former co chair of goldman sachs was clinton s first director of the national economic council and was promoted to treasury secretary in 1995 other wall street appointees included gary gensler of goldman treasury undersecretary roger altman of lehman brothers deputy treasury secretary and lee sachs of bear stearns assistant secretary for financial markets most surprisingly in 1996 and again in 2000 clinton reappointed alan greenspan a libertarian free market ideologue and onetime devotee of conservative intellectual darling ayn rand as chair of the federal reserve board of governors more important clinton definitively reversed the democratic party s historic support for tight financial regulation this dated back to the new deal when the roosevelt administration and congress had imposed sweeping constraints on the industry with the glass steagall act of 1933 the securities act of 1933 and the securities exchange act of 1934 financial deregulation had been one of the top priorities of president reagan but a decade later it was eagerly embraced by democrats in both the white house and congress the clinton years saw the riegle neal act of 1994 which opened the door to interstate banking and a wave of consolidation the gramm leach bliley act of 1999 which dismantled the remaining barriers separating investment banking commercial banking and insurance and the commodity futures modernization act of 2000 which effectively prohibited regulation of financial derivatives all three bills were ultimately passed with major democratic support in congress the clinton administration even suppressed attempts by regulators to monitor excessive systemic risks most famously when rubin deputy treasury secretary lawrence summers and greenspan shut down a 1998 attempt by brooksley born chair of the commodity futures trading commission to study the possibility of increased oversight over derivatives the democrats new love affair with wall street was based on the theory that relaxing the rules governing financial institutions would stimulate innovation and promote the flow of capital to where it would do the most good for the economy in particular deregulation gave democrats a shiny new housing story free from the complications and negative connotations of public housing and section 8 vouchers freeing markets for mortgages and mortgage backed securities would increase the funding available to homebuyers making it possible for more and more people to buy real estate even if their incomes remained stagnant as we know today deregulation also made possible the highly concentrated and unstable financial system that collapsed in 2008 when the world suddenly realized that millions of those same mortgages could never be repaid at the time however catering to the financial industry dramatically increased the flow of campaign donations from wall street historically banks and securities firms had leaned republican but the clinton administration s embrace of deregulation along with the republican party s increasingly hostile stances toward women gays and minorities attracted more and more contributions precisely at the time when shrinking unions were unable to keep the party afloat bill clinton barack obama and hillary clinton were all able to raise as much or more money from the financial sector than their republican opponents for president the reconciliation between the democratic party and the financial industry also successfully redefined the party s economic identity prior to the 1990s democrats were associated with the old economy heavy manufacturing with its smokestacks acid rain and largely unionized workforces but after the stagnation of the 1970s and the invasion by cheap japanese cars the american manufacturing industry was widely perceived to be in decline by contrast finance seemed a hotbed of innovation beginning with the leveraged buyouts and junk bonds that marked the 1980s oliver stone s 1987 movie wall street made corporate raider gordon gekko best known for his greed is good speech a cultural icon in 1989 michael lewis s memoir liar s poker though written as an indictment of finance culture helped make wall street the destination of choice for graduates of america s elite colleges finance was perceived to be clean modern and sophisticated an industry that moved dollars instead of steel that relied on brains instead of brawn once upon a time the democratic party helped the working class by supporting unions and promoting the social safety net now it claimed to help the working class by lubricating the flow of capital which would promote economic growth and eventually create good jobs for everyone tired of being seen as for labor and against capital the party could now be for everyone or in practice it could be for capital while claiming to help labor as well in less than a decade the democrats successfully repositioned themselves as the party of deficit reduction welfare reform market incentives and financial innovation the fact that the clinton presidency coincided with a long economic expansion only sealed the bargain in democrats minds from this point the party s platform would be technocratic management of a growing economy in which markets fulfill everyone s needs the 2000 presidential election demonstrated the weakness of this political strategy al gore was the heir apparent not only the two term vice president but also a fellow overeducated white southerner and a longtime member of the democratic leadership council but when he tried to campaign on the continuation of the clinton years minus the sexual peccadilloes it turned out that no one really knew what that meant without clinton s personal charisma to close the deal it wasn t clear that many voters wanted to buy the new democrat brand or that they could distinguish it from the empty compassionate conservatism that george w bush was peddling in the late stages of the campaign gore tried to reinvent himself as a populist they re for the powerful we re for the people he declared but by that point it was just an empty slogan although overall economic growth had boosted the wages of lower income workers the administration he served in could point to few identifiable accomplishments that benefited the people and while the president himself had the political skill to square that circle his lieutenant did not and so the moderation of the clinton years gave way to the disaster of the bush years two major tax cuts for the rich an all out campaign against economic regulation and the most severe financial crisis and recession for 70 years expand bob childs ap photo al gore and his running mate joseph lieberman during a campaign stop in stamford connecticut august 2000 the new democrats however escaped the shipwreck of gore s defeat with their prestige intact and only flourished during the next eight years indeed they followed the model defined by conservative think tanks decades before creating a network of washington institutions that would house the government in waiting until the next shift in power in addition to the democratic leadership council think tanks such as third way the progressive policy institute the center for american progress and the hamilton project housed at the brookings institution became refuges for clinton administration alumni and sources of policy research favoring market based solutions to economic problems the hamilton project was founded by robert rubin clinton s treasury secretary and the center for american progress by john podesta clinton s chief of staff in congress democrats used their new stature as responsible economic technocrats to criticize president bush s tax cuts on the grounds that they threatened to increase budget deficits for the most part however corruption incompetence and the iraq war tarnished the republican brand enough that democrats could win an emphatic victory in 2006 without having to articulate a coherent economic agenda hillary clinton was the obvious first choice of the democratic establishment for the 2008 presidential nomination but barack obama fit the bill equally well a smart well educated policy wonk who claimed to transcend party divisions there is not a liberal america and a conservative america there is the united states of america he proclaimed as a senate candidate giving the keynote speech at the 2004 democratic national convention after his election obama spoke at the launch of the hamilton project in 2006 obama was arguably the most moderate of the main primary contenders on health care for example he opposed the individual mandate proposed by clinton and later incorporated into obamacare he won the presidency largely on his personal story and charisma an uplifting but vague promise of change and general disaffection with republicans that was exacerbated by the 2008 financial crisis obama s first inaugural address in 2009 was a masterpiece of triangulation stereotyping and discarding both conservative and liberal positions in favor of an idealized center the question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small but whether it works the new president said his economic philosophy was even more squarely in the clinton tradition nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched but this crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye the market can spin out of control in short markets are the source of prosperity and government s role is limited to ensuring that they function properly barack obama borrowed not only bill clinton s ideology but also much of his staff he turned over his transition team to podesta a longtime clinton loyalist several of his senate and campaign economic advisers were sidelined in favor of clinton veterans among those taking top economic positions in the new administration were lawrence summers robert rubin s understudy and successor as treasury secretary in the clinton years timothy geithner an undersecretary to summers and rubin protégé peter orszag a former clinton adviser and director of the hamilton project jason furman director of the hamilton project after orszag michael froman rubin s chief of staff in the treasury department gary gensler undersecretary for domestic finance under summers mary schapiro head of the cftc under clinton neal wolin former general counsel of the treasury department jack lew former head of the office of management and budget and michael barr a deputy assistant treasury secretary under rubin when it came to economic affairs it was clear that the new president was eager to embrace the legacy of the clinton years coming into office in the depths of the great recession obama s first task was to shore up a global financial system that had imploded the previous year and was only functioning thanks to oceans of liquidity provided by the federal reserve at the same time he had to rescue an economy that was shrinking rapidly and shedding jobs by the millions some members of the president s team considered nationalizing some of the sickest megabanks particularly citigroup and bank of america which clearly would have failed without government assistance and whose recklessness had helped produce the financial crisis in the first place but instead the administration continued where its predecessor had left off giving citigroup a third bailout in february 2009 and effectively pledging unlimited support for the megabanks given the close relationships with the financial sector that had been fostered by the clinton administration and maintained during the intervening years the instinct of the obama white house was to ride to the rescue of the banks they knew whereas franklin roosevelt positioned himself as an opponent of wall street obama styled himself as its protector my administration is the only thing between you and the pitchforks he said to the ceos of 13 large banks at the white house in march 2009 as it turned out that was a promise not a threat and obama lived up to it ensuring that the remaining large banks survived the crisis intact with their ceos in place expand charlie neibergall ap photo the obamas at the democratic national convention in boston july 27 2004 the paralysis of the financial system was an unprecedented emergency but the choice to rescue the megabanks that caused the crisis was a natural one for a democratic establishment that prided itself on its sophisticated appreciation of modern finance the obama administration s broader response to the crisis and great recession demonstrated where the party now stood on key economic issues the stimulus bill passed early in 2009 was far better than nothing but it was constrained by the administration s dedication to fiscal responsibility which the clinton veterans saw as the keystone of both the 1990s boom and the democrats return to power to preserve the party s deficit fighting credentials the stimulus had to be coupled with a strategy to return to long term fiscal discipline in furman s words or as rahm emanuel obama s first chief of staff put it no fucking way is this number coming anywhere near a trillion dollars therefore the stimulus was too small to fill the hole created by the recession while also designed to phase out quickly and avoid creating long term government programs that could have had a lasting structural impact on the economy while the 2009 stimulus was merely inadequate the administration s response to the housing crisis was unconscionable the collapse of the housing bubble and the financial system inexorably produced wave after wave of delinquencies and foreclosures as homeowners no longer able to refinance their houses could not make their monthly payments yet the federal government never addressed the problems faced by ordinary families once the backbone of the democratic party with anything like the imagination or financial firepower it used to rescue the big banks president obama failed to follow through on his campaign proposal for mortgage cramdown which would have allowed bankruptcy judges to reduce the principal balance on mortgages a plan by treasury official herb allison to force banks to recognize losses on their bad loans was rejected by higher ups because in allison s words we don t want to appear as though we re socialists allison was himself a seasoned capitalist previously chief operating officer of merrill lynch and ceo of asset management giant tiaa the administration declined to pressure mortgage servicers to reduce the principal owed on mortgages even in federally funded programs purportedly designed to help people stay in their homes any of these ideas would have hurt the banks balance sheets weakening them further instead the administration s main vehicle to help homeowners the home affordable modification program was designed as a voluntary program for mortgage servicers promising them cash subsidies in exchange for reducing borrowers monthly payments another attempt to achieve public ends by giving a gentle nudge to private sector institutions the significant discretion handed to mortgage servicers enabled them to use the program as a predatory lending scheme squeezing extra payments out of struggling borrowers before ultimately pursuing foreclosure as treasury secretary geithner infamously said hamp s real purpose was to foam the runway for that is to space out foreclosures long enough so that banks could absorb their losses without going under in other words the administration s strategy was to let struggling families lose their homes in order to protect banks an approach that clearly showed where their priorities lay in the end only a small fraction of delinquent homeowners received permanent loan modifications under hamp while more than nine million households lost their homes to foreclosure or financial distress in total the treasury department only spent 29 billion on mostly indirect aid to homeowners less than half of what the administration initially promised to put this in context families collectively lost more than 7 trillion in equity in their houses during the financial crisis expand alan diaz ap photo a foreclosed home in homestead florida 2009 the disintegration of the banking system also demonstrated the need and created the opportunity for comprehensive reform of the financial sector it was clear that decades of unchecked innovation rampant deregulation and excessive concentration had produced a financial system in which a handful of colossal banks preyed on unsophisticated borrowers while accumulating risks they scarcely understood forcing the government to come to their rescue when they finally exploded unlike in 1933 however the obama administration and democrats in congress chose not to pursue structural reform of the industry instead the dodd frank act of 2010 re engineered the regulatory framework of the financial sector rearranging and in some cases increasing the powers available to government officials to oversee and potentially intervene in banks operations the administration opposed proposals either to separate investment and commercial banking by repealing the gramm leach bliley act or to impose size limits on banks after an amendment to establish size caps failed in the senate a senior treasury official said if we d been for it it probably would have happened but we weren t so it didn t lobbyists swarmed over capitol hill picking off moderate democrats often longtime recipients of financial industry support to weaken the legislation even further in 1933 franklin roosevelt had shut bankers out of his inner circle by 2010 however the democratic party was locked in a marriage with wall street even if it was going through a rough patch at the time a core tenet of the new democrats was that finance is good and more finance is better and one crisis was not enough to shake that belief the result was a bill that largely preserved the financial system that was responsible for the 2008 crisis and indeed america s largest banks today are even bigger than ever while financial reform was a battle that was thrust upon president obama he always intended health care to be the centerpiece of his legacy the patient protection and affordable care act of 2010 was the clearest demonstration yet of the democratic party s infatuation with market based solutions to broad social problems as late as the 1970s party leaders had been proposing government financed universal health insurance programs even republican senator jacob javits introduced a medicare for all bill in 1970 in 2010 by contrast the party united behind a bill whose centerpiece was exchanges in which insurers would supposedly compete for consumers by providing better health plans at lower prices the administration s experts knew that health insurance markets left on their own would produce unwanted outcomes poor people simply wouldn t be able to afford coverage people might be tricked into buying deceptive policies that turned out to provide minimal benefits when they were actually needed and because of adverse selection insurers would set high prices that only sick people would be willing to pay if they could afford them to address these problems the affordable care act included subsidies for lower income families minimum coverage requirements and the individual mandate which was designed to force healthy people to buy insurance bringing down prices for everyone obamacare as it came to be known was an improvement on the unregulated individual market that preceded it but as an exercise in democratic policymaking it was remarkable for its insistence on using markets and the private sector to achieve public ends which in this case could be much more simply accomplished with a traditional social insurance program such as social security or medicare the root problem with the american health care system is that care is expensive the average total premium for an employer sponsored family plan is more than 20 000 even before deductibles and co payments far more than many workers could afford in a properly functioning market people who can t afford something don t get it but when it comes to health care that s not an outcome we are willing to accept no one will say in public at least that how much you suffer or whether you live or die should depend on how much money you have although in practice that s often how it works instead republicans and democrats agree that all people should have access to decent health care at a price they can afford the most direct way to realize this goal is a universal health insurance plan often known as single payer paid for by a progressive tax system that way everyone has coverage and the amount you pay depends on your income but the core assumption behind the affordable care act was that competitive markets are the best way to provide goods and services and the role of government is limited to ensuring that markets function properly that s why we ended up with a complicated system designed to contort markets into producing socially acceptable outcomes whose features include private insurers whose costs are significantly higher than medicare s complicated risk adjustment mechanisms designed to ensure that insurers aren t profiting by skimming off the healthiest customers subsidies that aren t enough for many families coverage for the poor that is subject to the whims of state governors and legislatures annual negotiations in which insurers threaten to pull out of the exchanges unless they can raise prices and because underlying health care costs continue to rise plans that increasingly require more out of pocket spending by customers despite all the attention paid to the private health insurance exchanges it is telling that the part of the affordable care act that expanded coverage the most was actually an expansion of public insurance the increase in medicaid eligibility up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level this one provision alone gave health insurance to 14 million americans far more than the increase in coverage in the individual market even though many republican governors and legislatures chose not to adopt the medicaid expansion expand charles dharapak ap photo obama is applauded after signing the affordable care act into law march 23 2010 defenders of obamacare point out that there were not enough votes for a universal single payer system but there is no evidence that the architects of the affordable care act would have preferred single payer instead they seem to have been firmly in favor of private markets more to the point the question of votes only deflects the question exactly zero republicans voted for the final version of the affordable care act the health care reform we got was the health care reform that the democratic party wanted whether for ideological reasons or because its members wanted to stay on good terms with the insurance industry the democratic position was once that we should pool our resources to ensure that everyone is protected against certain shared risks including lack of access to health care now the default approach was to assume that markets can provide all good things and then if necessary figure out how to make those markets work better obamacare fit perfectly with the new worldview of democratic insiders who rejected anything that might be seen as socialist and portrayed themselves as sophisticated business friendly architects of enlightened policies informed by the latest economic research although finance and health care dominated president obama s legislative agenda other components of his economic agenda betrayed the same preference for technocratic market based solutions retirement security has been a ticking time bomb for decades made worse by the collapse of home values beginning in 2006 the traditional democratic approach to retirement was social security a mandatory government run program that provides minimum benefits to virtually every worker obama s answer however was a proposal to require companies to automatically enroll their employees into 401 k individual saving plans administered by the private asset management industry this was a classic new democrat proposal giving private markets a nudge to help them achieve public ends in this case a nudge based on the hot new field of behavioral economics it also fit the new democrat mold by failing to address the root cause of retirement insecurity after decades of wage stagnation many people just don t make enough money to save unwilling to propose anything that smacked of redistribution obama was left talking about the power of the stock market to multiply wealth scant consolation to workers who have none to begin with as for social security president obama was willing to offer a major long term reduction in benefits by changing the way cost of living adjustments are calculated in his pursuit of a budgetary deal with republicans when negotiations failed he even included the same benefit reduction in his 2014 budget proposal as a way to reduce long term deficits since the clinton administration democrats way of showing their tough mindedness on economic issues president obama also inherited clinton s market oriented approach to education his administration took up the buzzword of accountability backing the development of the common core standards and providing incentives to states to develop teacher evaluation systems based on standardized test scores the race to the top program dangled money to states strapped for cash after the recession rewarding those that attempted to expand the market share of charter schools obama went one further than clinton in the student loan market completely eliminating federal subsidies to private banks in addition the administration created a new loan repayment plan that links payments to the borrower s income while requiring universities to demonstrate that their graduates were actually able to get jobs and issuing a rule helping people who had been defrauded by for profit institutions these were welcome changes but after a generation of rapidly rising tuition costs and with outstanding loans doubling to 1 4 trillion during the president s tenure they barely made a dent in the ballooning student debt crisis making it a little easier to borrow money was no solution to the fundamental problem that college costs were rising much faster than incomes with time running out on his second term president obama pinned his hopes for one more economic policy victory on the trans pacific partnership a trade agreement negotiated between a dozen countries bordering the pacific ocean for the administration the tpp was simply a matter of basic economics international trade contributes to economic growth creating jobs in export industries and lowering prices for consumers opponents of the agreement obama s team insisted were simply old fashioned protectionists who didn t understand the magic of markets even in the economics textbook however trade creates winners and losers and since the invasion of our markets by chinese exports the united states has not done a good job of protecting the losers primarily people dependent on industries threatened by foreign competition in addition tpp was far more than a free trade agreement among other things its intellectual property rules forced other countries to adopt laws protecting the u s dominated media and pharmaceutical industries and its system for investor state dispute settlement allowed multinational corporations to bypass domestic legal systems fostering the belief that tpp was primarily drafted to benefit big business politically tpp ultimately became a casualty of the populist rebellion of 2016 leaving a democratic president as the last supporter of a trade agreement rejected by both the left and the right an outcome that would have seemed fantastic only 30 years before to be sure there are other voices in the democratic party which has not been entirely taken over by pro business pro market ideas and policies presidents clinton and obama however almost by definition constitute the center of gravity of the party their ideas their legacy and their people make up the current democratic establishment in addition in an age of short memory spans they represent what the party means to most americans today its identity is largely a creation of their words and their actions hillary clinton certainly did little to reposition the democratic party in the eyes of most people her economic platform was a caricature of new democrat technocracy with its catalog of bulleted plans its painstaking care to distinguish itself from opponents on both the right and the left the overbearing sophistication with which it lectured that bernie sanders s proposals were impractical and its lack of any message beyond a promise to create economic growth and good jobs clinton s few faltering endorsements of progressive positions such as her switch from supporting to opposing the tpp only came after considerable pressure from the left and only reinforced the idea that the democratic standard bearer stood for nothing more than grinding out every last vote possible in the upcoming election this brings us to the democratic party of today leaving aside the recent progressive insurrection inspired by sanders and embodied by alexandria ocasio cortez and the squad it is a party devoid of any compelling idea of how to address the fundamental economic challenges our country faces today wage stagnation the rising cost of health care and urban housing the precariousness of most jobs and extreme inequality after defining themselves in opposition to old fashioned government spending programs that smacked suspiciously of redistribution after embracing the doctrine of market based solutions and after insisting for decades that economic growth would solve all problems establishment democrats today have nothing left to offer their economic policy agenda is anemic constrained as it is by the premise that all good things must come from the market infrastructure spending is a perennial favorite because it addresses a market failure private companies have insufficient incentive to build or maintain shared goods like roads and bridges can be touted as a productive long term investment and can be channeled through the private sector job retraining programs are another staple because they promise to help workers adapt to changes in the labor market a promise that unfortunately they often fail to keep otherwise there is precious little the idea of a 15 minimum wage was the product of progressive groups on the state and local levels only later reluctantly embraced by party leaders medicare for all likewise was born on the party s left wing and the establishment currently appears to be trying to figure out how best to squash the idea without being blamed for doing so the idea that the government should increase taxes on the rich and give stuff to ordinary people a college education for example is anathema condemned as class warfare by moderate democrats even more vigorously than by republicans this is the economic vision of their democratic party economic growth is the goal markets are the means and the role of government is to maximize efficiency by correcting for specific market failures the things people actually want such as education jobs housing and health care are a by product of that growth heavy handed attempts to intervene in the economy will only backfire the fact that we would have called this a moderate republican vision only a few years ago doesn t necessarily make it wrong and it isn t nonsensical on its face the problem is that it has failed both as policy and as politics
editor s note this assessment is part of a series of analyses supporting stratfor s 2020 annual forecast these assessments are designed to provide more context and in depth analysis on key developments over the next quarter and throughout the year when he takes office on dec 10 argentina s new president alberto fernandez will quickly find his hands tied having raised expectations of simultaneously increasing government spending while lowering inflation but while those campaign promises may have earned fernandez the seat the international monetary fund imf and the many other foreign creditors who keep argentina s lights on won t tolerate such visions of grandeur without a long term program to solve the country s economic crisis or the cash to make good on its heaping pile of ious buenos aires will likely be forced to once again default on a large part of its debt next year sending the already impoverished country even deeper into a tailspin old economic habits die hard argentina is again up to old tricks that led to eight previous defaults in the country s 200 year history after settling in 2017 with holdout creditors from its most recent default president mauricio macri s administration began borrowing heavily in foreign currencies to help finance government budget deficits a dangerous move economists refer to as original sin as a result the country s external debt grew by 100 billion to 285 billion between 2016 and 2018 nearly doubling as a percentage of gross domestic product gdp to 54 percent the debt incurred by argentina s government and public sector to finance its domestic budget deficits meanwhile rose from less than 53 percent of gdp to 77 percent in the same period given this growing twin debt burden the country s current financial obligations extend far beyond buenos aires ability to pay in june the imf estimated that argentina would need 92 billion in external financial support to make good on its scheduled repayments in 2020 in contrast available resources are insufficient making both the external debt and the public debt including domestic obligations unsustainable for at least the next three to five years argentina is expected to lack either the resources or the ability to earn sufficient funds needed to make repayments while also financing necessary imports such as refined oil and parts for domestic industrial production of the central bank of argentina s 43 billion in foreign currency reserves the bank s usable net reserves likely don t exceed 10 billion less than 15 percent of the total loan repayments buenos aires will owe in 2020 alone amid the uncertainty investors have started pulling their assets from the country and this combined with argentina s meager domestic savings and soaring inflation have continued to stymie economic growth the private sector s distrust of the local currency has also made the argentine economy highly dollarized with people seeing u s currency as a haven for saving and inflation protection nearly 80 percent of the government s domestic debt for example is owed in u s dollars unsurprisingly as argentina s economy continues to spiral both poverty and unemployment levels have skyrocketed and while intended to fight inflation the prohibitively high interest rates set by the central bank of argentina rates have only appreciated the exchange rate for the peso even further another obstruction to the economic growth needed to grow incomes and avoid greater social unrest a return to populism macri had initially opted for a gradual approach to the reduction of the country s deficit and accumulation of debt but financial markets started to catch on that the country was up to its old habit of racking up foreign currency debt without fixing its domestic economic problems macri resorted to imf support in 2018 but a program front loaded with money was back loaded with unpopular fiscal cutback measures that ultimately led to his political demise fernandez will step into this economic maelstrom amid great uncertainty over his leftist economic policies fernandez s recently unveiled cabinet includes martin guzman a professional economist but severe critic of macri s economic policy who will serve as an economy minister a former official of the fernandez de kirchner government meanwhile will serve as the head of the country s central bank fernandez s repeated vague assertions that the debt will be paid caveated by the need to avoid further austerity have fueled anxiety among financial markets more recently fernandez also said public finances were in a deplorable state and that argentina would repay debt only when the economy is growing but if and when that growth will occur of course remains fair from certain in turning argentina s economy around fernandez also has the added challenge of minimizing the role of radical peronistas including his vice president elect the former president cristina kirchner de fernandez and former economy minister axel kicillof whose hard line push for more social spending increasingly resonates among the country s impoverished citizenry both have taken confrontational approaches toward creditors in the past and will probably do so again if given the opportunity implications for the imf loan with argentina s debt selling at distressed prices in secondary markets many creditors are probably steeled at least to extend their maturities but they won t agree to be scalped by accepting large value reductions of their debt or acting without assurances that argentina will eventually pay most of what it owes the imf s endorsement of argentina s economic policies would provide such an assurance by signaling that buenos aires will not repeat its past mistakes ad infinitum and will thus be key to ensure creditor cooperation to salvage its 57 billion agreement with argentina its largest ever loan the imf will probably accept some increased social spending in the short term and may potentially even allow the country to rack up a small fiscal deficit to boost domestic goods and services spending for at least the next year it will not however accept a program built on unrealistically optimistic economic projections instead the imf will demand a credible long term plan consistent with the path macri s administration initially promised in addition to addressing fiscal and structural economic imbalances that impede debt sustainability such a plan would also likely demand reining in public spending to an amount that can be financed without assuming immaculate economic growth with fantasy projections of increased tax revenues fernandez s vision of long term higher spending and by implication increased primary budget deficits will thus prove unacceptable to the imf other potentially problematic policies that fernandez and his advisers have suggested include increasing wages while extending price controls and relying only on social pacts to discourage further wage and price increases this would encourage black market activities by ignoring pent up inflation further discouraging domestic investment this would encourage black market activities by ignoring pent up inflation further discouraging domestic investment promoting exports to improve the exchange rate of the peso without a hard peg to restrain inflation the imf would view this as currency manipulation which is prohibited by its articles of agreement such a move would also result in further flight from pesos into u s dollars or euros increasing the risk of a government default since the majority of its debt obligations are in dollars with its revenues mainly in pesos the imf would view this as currency manipulation which is prohibited by its articles of agreement such a move would also result in further flight from pesos into u s dollars or euros increasing the risk of a government default since the majority of its debt obligations are in dollars with its revenues mainly in pesos financial repression by artificially lowering interest rates this would threaten the health of the country s banking system much of which is funded in u s dollars it s possible fernandez would reinstate a kirchner era requirement for banks to buy government debt regardless of the return this would threaten the health of the country s banking system much of which is funded in u s dollars it s possible fernandez would reinstate a kirchner era requirement for banks to buy government debt regardless of the return a permanent tax on exports to raise revenue macri s export taxes were intended to be only temporary while easy to administer a permanent tax would not only further discourage exports but also create multiple exchange rates that the imf usually opposes a dangerous domino effect fernandez does not have the luxury of time the budget he ll inherit from the macri administration is currently in near balance but not for long many debt payments since september are past due and new ones will follow quickly including a massive 570 million interest payment owed in january some hedge funds in new york and london are already suing buenos aires to recover unpaid claims connected with the country s last debt restructuring in 2005 and further action to seize argentine assets in the coming year is likely but despite these risks fernandez and his political allies are unlikely to have a sudden change of heart that puts the imf program back on track in the medium term instead fernandez is more likely to break decisively with his business friendly predecessor and reinforce his populist credentials by substantially increasing social spending and subsidies killing any potential imf deal and with it any hopes for increased cooperation with other foreign creditors as a result the new president risks leaving argentina with budget deficits that can t be financed without default or other disruptive actions such as forcing banks to buy government debt or forcing conversion of private dollar bank accounts into pesos a default could shut argentina out of international financial markets for the foreseeable future by reinforcing its reputation as an unreliable debtor it could also have regional spillovers at a time when latin american growth is among the most sluggish globally argentina s increased default and credit risks could spill over into higher borrowing costs and added budget expenses for countries such as brazil that are already facing tight domestic constraints amid heightened social unrest moreover with argentina s trade policies becoming more protectionist added tensions within the south american trade bloc mercosur could cause the already troubled union to collapse entirely and inhibit interregional trade even further but if there s one lesson fernandez and his fellow peronist populists have learned from argentina s never ending cycle of debt defaults it s that it s easier to force creditors to bear the burden of economic adjustment than it is to make the tough political choices needed to actually address the country s perennial economic weaknesses and while that lack of political will might prove convenient in the short term a looming return to the disruptions of the kirchner years could very well throw argentina right back into financial chaos

with brent d griffiths the ticker president trump is on track to secure a political victory by forging a breakthrough with congressional democrats to update the north american trade pact but in a sign the agreement has more to do with rebranding than substance economists project the deal will provide a minimal macroeconomic boost studies by both the international monetary fund and the international trade commission conclude the revamped pact won t meaningfully goose economic growth the itc projects it will raise gdp by 0 35 percent after six years and the imf says its broad effects will be negligible indeed economists say the agreement may be most important for what it prevents trump had threatened to pull the united states out of nafta if the three countries couldn t reach a deal that would have spelled a disastrous breakdown in cross border commerce with the two most important u s trading partners at a time when slower global growth rising protectionism lingering policy uncertainty and a strong dollar are constraining activity the deal prevents a negative impact worth 0 5 of gdp from a dissolution of nafta oxford economics chief u s economist gregory daco writes in a

what to expect from the fed what else to watch for today what analysts are saying today required reading bupkis timothy lane has made an interesting observation that demands attention starting in 2010 as the recovery appeared to be under way most major economies began a course of fiscal consolidation the bank of canada deputy governor said last week in canada the government took steps to move the federal budget toward balance he added noting too how the u s brought in a policy of automatic spending cuts under budget law with the benefit of hindsight those moves toward balanced budgets proved to be premature the world was in for several more years of lacklustre growth we re not facing another financial crisis nor are there widespread projections for a recession but economic growth is slowing and economists far and wide are wondering when this historic long running expansion ends and the next slump starts add to that the facts that we have a minority government in ottawa whose economic agenda will have to be backed by another party and the fiscal pullback among some provinces and like i said mr lane s comments take on an added alert spending among our governments is mixed now mr lane also noted while it has been supporting growth recently this support is expected to wane in 2020 as consolidation in ontario and alberta takes hold and the recent strength in quebec and british columbia normalizes he said these dynamics were built into our october projection on the federal side the government s fiscal plans are pending which brings us to the liberal throne speech and tax cut first off that tax cut while expensive and obviously welcome among the 20 million canadians who will get it will have a muted impact providing a small and transitory boost to growth at best said rebekah young bank of nova scotia s director of fiscal and provincial economics depending on household finances she said this will mean an annual tax saving of 300 to 600 when everything is said and done by 2023 putting about 25 billion into the economy over six years multipliers or the ratio by which government spending prompts onward spending will be small ms young said if growth forecasts hold next year the impact would almost be negligible she added in her report even if growth cools substantially the multiplier would still be relatively small across the 20 million canadians affected by the measure there would be some propensity to spend the windfall particularly in light of prolonged affordability challenges and stretched balance sheets but its impact will be weakened by the

economist robert kavcic fundamentally the big picture at the provincial level is that most jurisdictions have tacked to the political and fiscal right even as the federal election result will arguably shift policy further to the left he said in a recent study among the provinces deficits could shrink by about 5 billion next year in turn acting as a partial offset to any federal stimulus mr kavcic said when you factor in alberta s restraint heavy measures and the planned spending of other provinces fiscal year 2020 21 could mark one of the slowest rates of combined provincial program spending growth of the past 20 years at around 1 7 per cent he added that said various tax relief measures corporate tax rate cuts a sales tax reduction and more have begun trickling out and will act as a partial offset but capital spending plans have been scaled back in some provinces and have broadly levelled off all told a provincial fiscal policy shift toward restraint in exchange for some early tax relief will serve to counter some of the shift expected at the federal level the conference board of canada agreed that weakness in government spending will mean less oomph for economic growth if the provinces meet their goals the group said it will mark the slowest pace of growth in real government expenditures since the mid 1990s read more markets at a glance read more back baker s hbc bid

individual central bank officials economists expect no change to interest rates though the incoming data week were on balance positive and certainly wouldn t prompt the sort of material reassessment of the outlook that fed officials have said would be necessary to cut interest rates again said paul ashworth chief north american economist at capital economics markets are still pricing in one final 25 basis point rate cut some time next year but our guess is that signs of a pick up in economic growth early next year will take that possibility off the table he added the bigger point however is that even if that pick up in gdp growth ends up being more pronounced than many expect we strongly doubt that the fed would hike rates even though they would never admit to it in public the chances of fed officials sanctioning a rate hike next year during a politically charged election campaign are close to zero watch too for quarterly results from lululemon athletica inc what analysts are saying today there have been a number of conflicting narratives with respect to whether we get an extension to the 15 december deadline on china tariffs however there does appear to be some money taking a view that the risks to the u s not extending the deadline outweigh the risks of not doing so and thus the deadline is likely to be extended there is still no expectation that we ll see any agreement

tensions linger ahead of sunday deadline the canadian dollar has recovered some of last week s losses after u s officials said the long awaited usmca agreement with mexico and canada had been officially signed tuesday although the canadian currency is tipped to remain shaky ahead of an impending deadline in the u s china trade conflict u s trade representative robert lighthizer said tuesday he has officially signed an update of the north american free trade agreement once described by president donald trump on the campaign trail as the worst deal in history the agreement is a renegotiated nafta pledged by president trump during the 2016 election campaigns and its signing brings onto the horizon the possibility of an end to uncertainty over the trade pact s future which dates all the way back to the beginning of the white house incumbent s tenure with the outlook for u s canada trade becoming a little clearer it is understandable that the canadian dollar would find support on the final signing of the agreement thanks to president trump s leadership we have reached an historic agreement on the usmca after working with republicans democrats and many other stakeholders for the past two years we have created a deal that will benefit american workers farmers and ranchers for years to come this will be the model for american trade deals going forward lighthizer said in statement following the signing above usd cad rate shown at hourly intervals mexican president andres manuel lopes obrador had said earlier on tuesday that a deal had been reached with the u s and canada over labor steel and aluminium just before politico reported that texas representative kevin brady had said in a closed door meeting of republican leaders that lighthizer was en route to mexico in order to sign the new agreement on behalf of the u s the pact was already agreed between signatories in october 2018 but uncertainty about whether it would garner enough support in the ratification stage on the u s side has so far prevented it from being formally signed tuesday s signing means the three countries have a hand shake deal that will be put to a vote in washington over the coming days president donald trump said on tuesday the pact enjoys very good support from the democratic party which now controls the house of representatives a reduction in trade policy uncertainty would be a welcome development for the canadian economy which has started to display more evidence of weakness recently says fritz louw a currency analyst at mufg above pound to canadian

markets will likely be dictated by lingering uncertainty over the trajectory of u s china trade relations which are also important to the canadian dollar outlook as the bank of canada boc has said it will set domestic interest rates according to the impact the ongoing tariff fight is having on canada s economy we think relatively firm crude and cad supportive spreads suggest the cad could be perhaps should be trading a little firmer against the usd these factors should at the very least limit usd upside to the upper 1 32s low 1 33s says shaun osborne chief fx strategist at scotiabank the usd closed out the week overall with a loss that really should imply limited upside potential and more downside risk going forward above usd cad rate shown at daily intervals the rise in the canadian dollar on tuesday follows a dissapointing jobs report out last friday that sent the canadian dollar into retreat allowing the pound to canadian dollar exchange rate to climb to its highest level since mid may canadian employment shrank by 71 2k jobs in november and the unemployment rate rose 40 basis points to 6 3 in a straight line just days after the boc surprised markets by junking its earlier pessimism and sounding an almost hawkish tone as far as the outlook goes canada s jobs data was out at exactly the same time the u s bureau of labor statistics dumped a blowout nonfarm payrolls report on the wires which showed the u s economy created more jobs in november than it has in any other month since december 2018 that and a multi decade low for the jobless rate has boosted the greenback and lifted usd cad but the most important factor in determining the trajectory of the latter in the months ahead will be the boc weaker employment data though will keep alive expectations that the boc may still have to cut rates in 2020 mufg s louw writes in a note to clients it leaves the canadian dollar struggling for direction in the near term as usd cad contuse to trade in line with its average since the summer of around 1 3240 usd cad would have to break out from its current trading range between 1 3150 and 1 3350 to trigger more excitement that the current consolidation phase is ending above canadian dollar performance vs major rivals in 2019 source pound sterling live louw says the signing of the usmca deal could help to soften the blow of last friday s jobs report for the canadian dollar especially as it relates to interest rates at the boc which has put trade conflicts at the centre of deliberations on monetary policy because of the impact that adverse developments on that field can have on economic growth and inflation however he also says usd cad should remain confined in weeks ahead to the 1 3150 to 1 3350 range that s prevailed for much of the time since august the pound to canadian dollar rate is a different story because its fortune will be made or lost by voters in thursday s uk general election thursday s outcome which will become known in the early hours of friday could be the difference between the gbp usd rate finishing the year at 1 20 and 1 35 with implications of a similar order for the gbp cad rate above pound to canadian dollar rate shown at

following the great recession europe is once again debating the use of fiscal instruments for macroeconomic stabilisation with the experience of a monetary union with common fiscal shock absorbers such as in the us as a reference research on fiscal stabilisation and risk sharing in the us was originally a reference for economic and monetary union emu sachs and sala i martin 1992 von hagen 1992 and bayoumi and masson 1995 proposed different approaches to quantify the role of fiscal transfers in the us for redistribution and risk sharing and to draw lessons for the forthcoming emu but the emu does not represent one country or a political union and so the option of fiscal transfers is constrained our recent work nikolov and pasimeni 2019 expands this research in three ways we measure stabilisation not only as inter state risk sharing of asymmetric shocks but also as intertemporal stabilisation of common shocks we do this for several items in the us federal budget both on the revenue and on the expenditure side we also measure the impact of the federal system of unemployment benefits and of its extension as a response to the great recession stabilisation of common and asymmetric shocks the stabilisation from market mechanisms and other existing instruments is limited and this is the economic rationale for fiscal stabilisation in a monetary union factor mobility helps to smooth the effect of large shocks asdrubali et al 1996 nikolov 2016 but the great recession showed that market stabilisation is generally inadequate berger et al 2018 because markets tend to behave pro cyclically furceri and zdzienicka 2015 ferrari and rogantini picco 2016 when shocks affect the whole area monetary policy can stabilise the economy problems arise when the interest rate is close to the effective lower bound and there are decreasing returns from using further unconventional tools blanchard et al 2015 national structural reforms and fiscal policies can address country specific situations but critically they are subject to coordination problems and have limits structural reforms have important short term costs eggertsson et al 2014 particularly when they are implemented during negative cyclical conditions oecd 2015 and when monetary policy is already constrained vogel 2014 posing a drag on aggregate demand duval and furceri 2017 when there is a large shock market pressure can force national fiscal policies in a monetary union to behave pro cyclically limiting their capacity to stabilise therefore it is difficult to rule out the role of a common stabilisation capacity in a monetary union on one hand the less a monetary union relies on a fiscal capacity for stabilisation of asymmetric shocks cross country risk sharing the more it needs structural reforms and prudent fiscal policies to enhance the adjustment capacity and build fiscal buffers at the national level this may create stronger deflationary pressure on the whole area oecd 2015 duval and furceri 2017 and stronger pressure on monetary policy to counteract that deflationary pressure corsetti et al 2019 meaning it approaches its effective lower bound faster consequently there is a greater need for a fiscal instrument to provide intertemporal stabilisation to support monetary policy on the other hand the less we use a common fiscal capacity for intertemporal stabilisation of common shocks the more we need to rely on monetary policy to counteract the common shock the closer monetary policy gets to its limits the higher the short term costs of structural reforms and fiscal consolidation eggertsson et al 2014 oecd 2015 and the lower their effectiveness there is a greater the need for a fiscal instrument for cross country stabilisation of asymmetric shocks in other words there is a trade off when we do not use a fiscal instrument for these two objectives the less we are willing to use a common fiscal instrument for intertemporal stabilisation of common shocks the more we will have to resort to it for cross country stabilisation of asymmetric ones the impact of different items in the budget emu does not have a common budget and the eu budget has very limited stabilisation impact pasimeni and riso 2018 but the us has a federal budget larger than 20 of its gdp and can run deficits and borrow collect taxes directly and give direct transfers to states and individuals we have evaluated the net stabilisation impact of the different items in the federal budget on the revenue and expenditure side overall the us federal budget despite not being primarily designed to achieve macroeconomic stabilisation is able to stabilise about 21 of macroeconomic shocks through its system of federal to state net transfers including interstate stabilisation of asymmetric shocks about 10 and inter temporal stabilisation of common shocks about 11 different items have different stabilisation properties independent of their size figure 1 intertemporal and interstate stabilisation through fiscal channels in the us source nikolov and pasimeni 2019 the stabilisation impact of each item is not directly related to its size meaning that even small items can have an impact social security benefits and federal personal income taxes are the most effective stabilisers against asymmetric shocks federal corporate income taxes although quite small are the most effective intertemporal stabilisers for common shocks and their small size implies they are also one of the most efficient ways to provide stabilisation corporate income taxes are generally collected with longer lags than other taxes this is consistent with the finding that this item in the federal budget provides sensible stabilisation over time but it is not particularly relevant for cross country risk sharing the role of emergency unemployment insurance the us system of unemployment insurance is a joint federal state programme that provides direct support to eligible workers during a spell of unemployment the support can be extended when there is an increase in the unemployment rate above certain thresholds all states must have an unemployment benefit scheme in place but there are large differences in coverage replacement rates and generosity fischer 2017 in principle the extended benefit programme is jointly funded at the state and the federal level but in practice during the deepest recessions the federal share of the total unemployment benefit cost increases enormously o leary 2013 this system leads to permanent transfers under the extended benefit programme if a state unemployment benefit scheme is underfunded and cannot afford full coverage the state can borrow from the federal government to prevent moral hazard this borrowing must be paid back in two years otherwise the compulsory federal tax rate of 0 6 under the futa can be increased by 0 03 but this incentive is extremely weak and states show a clear preference for maintaining a low tax rate so that firms do not relocate to other states meaning that unemployment benefits are underfunded fischer 2017 in nikolov and pasimeni 2019 we measure the stabilisation effect of an ad hoc response to high unemployment during the great recession the emergency unemployment compensation euc08 programme operated between mid 2008 and end 2013 it extended federal benefits to individuals who were still eligible and had exhausted other options this programme was fully funded by the federal budget and supported by its borrowing capacity we condition on the number of euc08 claims per state as a proxy for state need we find that the programme raised the fiscal smoothing of common shocks for the average state by approximately 6 percentage points this can be interpreted as its marginal role for stabilisation the federal system of unemployment insurance in the us played an important stabilisation role in particular when enhanced by the discretionary programme of extended benefits conclusion in the emu fiscal transfers are constrained by the lack of a political union but we find that fiscal stabilisation through a common budget is relevant in a monetary union there is a case for addressing both common and asymmetric shocks but the instruments we choose will have different capacities to address these stabilisation needs the design of the budget in particular the balance of revenue and expenditure can maximise its stabilisation effect the key is to bridge the gap between higher mobility of capital and lower mobility of labour by collecting revenues based on the income of the most mobile factor corporate income tax and providing support to the income of the least mobile factor social security a discretionary program of extended unemployment benefits mainly funded by the federal level and supported by the borrowing capacity of the federal government proves a powerful example of a timely and effective stabilisation instrument when we require a specific contingent

in the weeks following dramatic new restrictions regarding the acquisition of both bitcoin and usd in argentina the local crypto community has reacted in a number of interesting ways showing both the possibilities of bitcoin as a financial tool in the face of government constraints as well as the decentralized crypto asset s resilience to measures against it the evolving bitcoin landscape in argentina the temperature has steadily been rising in the argentinian crypto space for several months of 2019 creating a clear timeline for the increased acceptance of bitcoin and other alternative assets the nation s economy and fiat currency have been especially wobbly since august 2019 as the stock market hemorrhaged during an upset presidential election in addition to damaging the return value on investments this also caused the peso s value to plummet very soon after this initial trigger the relative valuation and trading volume of bitcoin spiked to levels comparable to conflict stricken regions like hong kong the central bank of argentina run by the national government attempted to stabilize the situation first by imposing limitations on the purchase of usd beginning by limiting argentinians to only 10 000 in purchases per month in september 2019 the bank added additional restrictions on october 31 2019 in addition to limiting the amount of usd that a citizen can acquire per month to 200 the bank also announced that bitcoin could only be purchased by means of funds transferred from a bank account since this time the relative valuation and trade volume of bitcoin have spiked yet again in argentina even compared to the initial increase when the peso first hit shaky territory thebitcoin pricewas reported to reach as high as 12 759 on an argentinian exchange in november 2019 marking a 38 percent premium compared to other exchanges around the world in that same month argentina exchanged an estimated 19 4 million pesos on localbitcoins to make better sense of the dynamics of these changes bitcoin magazine reached out to several argentinian bitcoiners to learn more about their firsthand experiences santiago siri is the founder of the democracy earth foundation and has been involved in both crypto related political activism and the largestbitcoin exchangein latin america bitex for several years having moved to new york from argentina siri has maintained a base of connections across the international crypto space and particularly in his country of origin lautaro dragan on the other hand is the lead developer for decentralized media protocol po et and has in depth experience with both the argentinian banking system and the situation on the ground as he lives in buenos aires searching for alternatives siri claimed that there is a direct correspondence between the suppression of the dollar and the rise of bitcoin in argentina since the peso is a currency that lacks trust from the people due to its high inflation rate about 50 precent most people save money in dollars siri said but keeping dollars in the bank can be risky since this is not the first time this happens back in 2001 the country lived one of its most traumatic days when a similar limit was imposed the growth of adoption in bitcoin is a no brainer to most censorship resistant money that cannot be taken by the government matters to the average argentine that does not want to see their money being taken away by the government this dynamic is of particular importance to regions of global instability he added when people start stashing cash that also increases the risk of violent assaults and overall insecurity of the country siri explained back in 2001 a rise in express kidnapping emerged from criminals chasing people taking their money out of the bank so the ability to keep the money in an immutable ledger and protected by a code no one can break is also very beneficial there dragan concurred with this analysis but also added some sobering commentary it s a bittersweet feeling he claimed because even though we re happy we have bitcoin to help us in this situation nobody is happy about the restrictions since they affect everyone for the worse and are a symptom of deeply rooted economic issues dragan said that hyperinflation in the argentine peso has been a regular feature of the country for his entire life since reading my high school history book and seeing in it a black and white picture of a panettone selling for 1 million pesos and up on stories of people losing most of their savings due to them being force converted to ars and inflation immediately striking afterwards or hyper inflation rendering your entire salary worthless he explained that many argentinians turn to alternative currencies as a chance to access the most basic features of financial security the sad truth is that as things are most people can t save a single cent dragan said the ones who can save buy usd to prevent their savings from being eaten by hyperinflation and the lucky ones who work digitally look for remote work paid in usd gbp or eur to prevent their salaries from being eaten by hyperinflation after many personal difficulties with regularly using foreign fiat currencies or opening up a u s bank account dragan said that he began to turn increasingly to cryptocurrency even though bitcoin is too volatile to be a good store of value right now it s possibly the best means of transferring value humanity has ever seen he said and that alone is such a powerful tool that makes a case for crypto on its own but it will probably also ensure it will live long enough for it to become a good store of value too argentina s bitcoin community siri described the argentinian cryptocurrency space as a very active community that has grown big very fast while noting that there is room for bitcoin to grow probably we are still a long way from making bitcoin a mainstream thing but you ll probably find among the hacker culture of buenos aires some of the best cryptocurrency engineers in the world siri said it s worth noticing the emergence of startups like zeppelin leading smart contract auditors in the world or rsk smart contracts with a btc sidechain that emerge from that hacker culture i m currently helping to bring devcon 6 the annual event held by the ethereum foundation to buenos aires in 2020 dragan concurred with this assessment in argentina we have had a few small businesses accept bitcoin for several years but we re now seeing larger businesses joining too he said last year garbarino viajes one of argentina s biggest travel agencies took the lead on this accepting bitcoin as a means of payments this year mercado libre an argentine company that operates in all of latin america started accepting bitcoin in brazil more large business are sure to follow dragan added that more institutional adoption could be forthcoming i m confident we will see more of this in the 2020s and traditional banks will start feeling the pressure and want in he said to this end bitex the latin american cryptocurrency exchange that siri is a partner in has facilitated smoother entry of private banks into the wider crypto economic system the regulation announced by the central bank specifically forbid buying cryptocurrency with credit cards but said nothing about direct bank transfers siri said bitex has been one of the pioneering bitcoin exchanges in the local market there and has been able to establish solid relations with banks in the country still a lot of bank managers due to age or lack of information are a bit skeptical about accepting services willing to operate using btc but thankfully this is beginning to change thanks to the reputation built by companies like bitex dragan also noted some mixed institutional progress in bitcoin adoption noting the potential for regulatory clarity from the administración federal de ingresos públicos afip argentina s revenue service though with some skepticism about how much of a help this will ultimately be for local bitcoiners i know the afip our tax authority is working on ways to properly support cryptocurrencies and the new policies and laws make it clear that the government is aware they need to do something about it but they still don t understand it well and isn t a high priority given all the issues our country is facing so adoption grows slowly but steadily he said of course the cryptocurrency space in argentina is not only turning to bitcoin largely due to the perception dragan highlighted that the asset is better at transferring value than storing it long term the ethereum based stablecoin dai dragan claimed has been growing like crazy in argentina siri agreed with this telling us most people cannot afford big swings on their savings that s why adoption of dai is growing in argentina you want a currency that cannot be taken away by a bank that is pegged to the dollar and that is stable in order to be able to use it for saving bitcoin as a financial battleground siri also commented on how crackdowns on bitcoin can play out on a global economic stage it s interesting to see how bitcoin is being weaponized by nation state actors he said because bitcoin can be used either for good or for bad we can find some extreme cases on how various sanctioned nations like venezuela and north korea have tried to use cryptocurrency both within their own borders and when dealing with other nations i m not stating all this to say bad things about bitcoin i m a long time hodler myself siri continued but it is important to understand how bitcoin is becoming the battleground of a financial battle that is being pushed by the usa and its economic sanctions mechanism even with the price already rising in argentina due to these internal pressures we can already see how this bitcoin as a financial battleground thesis has played out more recently on december 2 2019 u s president donald trump announced a new set of tariffs on metal products especially steel and aluminum from argentina on december 9 2019 the argentinian president appointed a new economy minister to his cabinet who has repeatedly voiced skepticism of institutions like the international monetary fund with close ties to u s international economic designs whether motivated directly by these developments or not fears of further peso inflation and economic downturn have likely caused bitcoin s value in argentina to spike yet again localbitcoins trading volume in argentina reached a new all time high of 22 million ars in the first week of december 2019 as a parting sentiment siri wanted audiences abroad to appreciate argentina s unique and valuable relationship with financial assets across the board argentina will break every single financial system you can think of he claimed whether it s the argentine peso the us dollar bitcoin ethereum or anything that ends up coming next we argentines are going to make sure we figure out how to hack it while it s noteworthy that for the average citizen a stablecoin like dai might be a more reliable way to protect paychecks and savings than either the fiat currency or bitcoin the past few months of increasing bitcoin trading volume and adoption among economic uncertainty in argentina illustrate a real life use case for the technology if bitcoin is to supplant the usd i m sure it won t happen for decades dragan concluded but the key takeaway here is that we don t need it to bitcoin is an excellent means of transferring value as it is even in the hypothetical case that we discovered it is impossible for it to scale it already is good enough the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and

included 33 million for cerro pelon and la yaqui grande production from the mulatos district is expected to total 150 000 to 160 000 ounces of gold in 2020 consistent with long term guidance ore will be mined and stacked from multiple sources in 2020 including the mulatos el victor and san carlos open pits as well as new production coming from cerro pelon and the processing of surface stockpiles construction of cerro pelon is now complete on budget and ahead of schedule the crushing and stacking of surface stockpiles will ramp up through the year as mining activities wind down in the san carlos and el victor pits in the first half of 2020 total cash costs are expected to increase slightly from 2019 reflecting the processing of lower recovery stockpiles which carry historical inventory costs resulting in a higher cash cost per ounce these inventory costs have been incurred in previous years and have the impact of increasing total cash costs across all mulatos production by approximately 25 per ounce mine site all in sustaining costs are also expected to increase due to higher sustaining capital mainly related to waste stripping activities at cerro pelon capital spending across all of the mulatos district deposits is expected to total 20 to 25 million the majority of which is sustaining capital the company expects to make a construction decision on the la yaqui grande project during the first half of 2020 la yaqui grande is fully permitted having received the approval of the environmental impact assessment mia during the second quarter of 2019 and the change in

construction 2020 exploration budget the 2020 global exploration budget is 36 million up from the 2019 budget of 33 million reflecting increased exploration spending at island gold and mulatos as well the initiation of underground exploration drilling at young davidson island gold remains the primary focus of exploration with 21 million budgeted up from the 2019 budget of 19 million mulatos and lynn lake remain the other two areas of focus with 7 million and 5 million budgeted respectively approximately 70 of the 2020 budget will be capitalized island gold a total of 21 million has been budgeted in 2020 for surface and underground exploration at island gold with a focus on continuing to define new near mine mineral resources across the two kilometre long island gold main zone the 2020 exploration budget includes 46 000 metres m of surface directional drilling 30 000 m of underground exploration drilling and 900 m of underground exploration development to extend drill platforms on the 620 790 and 840 levels drilling completed in 2019 was successful in extending high grade gold mineralization laterally and down plunge of the island gold deposit across all three areas of focus including the main western and eastern extensions in addition drilling in 2019 intersected high grade mineralization over a lateral extent of 300 m within a previously untested area between the eastern and main extensions continued lateral and down plunge drilling within these areas will be the focus of surface and underground exploration drilling in 2020 a regional exploration program which includes 10 000 m of drilling is also planned in 2020 focused on evaluating and advancing exploration targets outside the main island gold mine area on the 9 750 hectare island gold property mulatos a

cash working capital is a non gaap performance measure that could provide an indication of the company s ability to generate cash flows from operations and is calculated by adding back the change in non cash working capital to cash provided by used in operating activities as presented on the company s consolidated statements of cash flows free cash flow is a non gaap performance measure that is

of cash flows and that would provide an indication of the company s ability to generate cash flows from its mineral projects mine site free cash flow is a non gaap measure which includes cash flow from operating activities at less capital expenditures at each mine site return on equity is defined as earnings from continuing operations divided by the average total equity for the current and previous year mining cost per tonne of ore and cost per tonne of ore are non gaap performance measures that could provide an indication of the mining and processing efficiency and effectiveness of the mine these measures are calculated by dividing the relevant mining and processing costs and total costs by the tonnes of ore processed in the period cost per tonne of ore is usually affected by operating efficiencies and waste to ore ratios in the period total cash costs per ounce all in sustaining costs per ounce and mine site all in sustaining costs as used in this analysis are non gaap terms typically used by gold mining companies to assess the level of gross margin available to the company by subtracting these costs from the unit price realized during the period these non gaap terms are also used to assess the ability of a mining company to generate cash flow from operations there may be some variation in the method of computation of these metrics as determined by the company compared with other mining companies in this context total cash costs reflects mining and processing costs allocated from in process and dore inventory associated and associated royalties with ounces of gold sold in the period total cash costs per ounce are exclusive of exploration costs all in sustaining costs per ounce include total cash costs exploration corporate and administrative share based compensation and sustaining capital costs mine site all in sustaining costs include total cash costs exploration and sustaining capital costs for the mine site but exclude an allocation of

this article is more than 4 years old diego levy 2016 bloomberg finance lp after four short years argentina is back to being a default risk and a distressed asset investor s delight other than venezuela which is banned from being traded in the u s anyway there is no place in latin america that s as deeply discounted as this sorry market new president alberto fernandez took over on tuesday his new economic minister martin guzman has floated the idea of a two year debt moratorium on argentina s unpayable 56 billion loan to the international monetary fund the first major principal payment on that loan comes due in 2022 what you got to do is get the imf to extend maturities because they don t give haircuts on principal says james barrineau a bond fund manager with schroders in new york at least that will keep the capital markets open for argentina an extension on imf loans would amount to a moratorium on that portion of the country s debt but not the rest held by the local banks and foreign bond lords who have to agree to a debt extension they d have to renegotiate all hoping that fernandez can get this pterodactyl of an economy flying again i still think it s the best performing sovereign bond market over the next 12 months says jan dehn head of research for the ashmore group a 95 billion asset manager in london dehn thinks the market is already pricing in a 60 haircut putting prices on argentina s so called century bond at around 35 that s fine for newcomers buying now it s not so fine for those who have been invested in argentina since mauricio macri was president macri was elected to clean up cristina kirchner s mess ironically or not this is argentina after all cristina is back in power as a vice president sarah pabst 2019 bloomberg finance lp argentina will start 2020 to take from a tommy petty and the heartbreakers tune into the great wide open they look to the left nothing they look to the right nothing in front of them nothing behind them nothing well not really behind them is a train wreck if the experience of mexico and brazil the two big examples of latin america s anti incumbency wave is anything to go by the new government should in theory have some time to find its feet before voter dissatisfaction kicks in the economist intelligence unit said in a note yesterday on latin america political risk in 2020 they think fernandez and kirchner s ties to labor unions could help produce some sort of tripartite accord among government business and the public sector workers on austerity measures that will give the new government some wiggle room with creditors in his first few months as it is guzman is already warning that if the government cannot get a debt extension from the imf by march it sets them up for a default on some foreign debts fernandez promised to restore economic growth by slashing onerous interest rates of around 60 per year to do that they would have to install price controls to cut inflation not just curb it argentina s 12 month rolling inflation rate is over 40 many wealthy argentinians and indeed some sectors of the economy like exports and real estate are not so worried about the economic recession s grip on the country because they exist largely in a dollarized world the cheaper the peso the richer they are in the local market for the newly inaugurated administration there is now little time to act if argentina is to avoid a disorderly default the eiu s latin america analysts believe another default would be hugely damaging to the economy and prove an almost certain trigger for political instability yet again in 2020 there are some bondholders that may provide some initial flexibility to avoid a painful reduction on principal but it s difficult to believe that consensus among investors would reach a qualified majority the imf may also show some flexibility providing the economic program is biased in favor of higher tax revenues and not just promises to spend a little less local headlines suggest that the majority of bondholders are on the same page as fernandez and don t want to send argentina to another default rumor has it that some have not only agreed to extend maturity dates but are also fine with providing the fernandez government with new money to once again keep the government solvent this extraordinary flexibility from bondholders seems almost too good to be true says siobhan morden head of fixed income latin america at amherst pierpont securities in new york the proposal to forfeit capital debt payments near term without any good faith for future debt payments seems already aggressive but to provide fresh capital seems almost impossible

bulawayo zimbabwe every morning just before the daily power cut kicks in juliet gumbo enters her kitchen to start preparing her meal it will be her only food for the day but she will have it hours later when she returns to her electricity lacking home after a day spent farming or hawking goods on the streets of bulawayo zimbabwe s second largest city gumbo a 52 year old widow lacking a steady job is just one of many zimbabweans struggling to cope with a scorching drought and economic instability that have pushed millions to the brink of famine i eat what i can get gumbo said more nearly half of zimbabweans face hunger starvationcyclone idai thousands still struggling to copezimbabwe s food crisis food security is national security zimbabwe is in the grip of its worst economic crisis in 10 years with inflation soaring to 300 percent and the population suffering fuel shortages power rationing and currency woes emmerson mnangagwa who succeeded robert mugabe after a military intervention forced the longtime president to resign has struggled to revive the economy while the long standing financial troubles have been worsened by extreme weather shocks and now zimbabwe is facing major food insecurity as many people do not have enough food to eat or they cannot afford it according to hilal elver the united nations special rapporteur on the right to food the country is on the verge of man made starvation with close to 60 percent of its 14 million population being food insecure juliet gumbo is trying to plant her own food as she can no longer afford to buy maize after an 11 day visit last month to areas hit by the el nino induced drought elver said the crisis affected a staggering 5 5 million people in rural areas and a further 2 2 million in cities these are shocking figures she said adding that notwithstanding the devastating effect of recurrent droughts and powerful cyclones the crisis was partly due to chronic economic mismanagement high unemployment widespread poverty and rampant corruption in her statement elver also suggested economic sanctions by the united states and the european union against officials and entities linked with the ruling zanu pf party over alleged abuses are contributing to zimbabwe s current malaise the government in harare also says sanctions are impeding economic growth and hurting ordinary zimbabweans but the us embassy refutes the claim the government of zimbabwe s failed economic policies not sanctions hinder zimbabwe s economic growth the embassy s press office said in a statement to al jazeera billions of dollars have been lost due to decades of corruption and harmful economic policies which have culminated in the current economic crisis implementation of economic and political reforms are the key to improving zimbabwe s trajectory analysts say years of shifting policies on land reform and food subsidies under mugabe and mnangagwa are also partly to blame for zimbabwe s food scarcity the country s agro based economy began to collapse following the state s violent seizure in the 2000s of an estimated 10 million hectares 25 million acres for redistribution from white commercial farmers to resettle the landless black majority mugabe s government over the years resorted to price controls and money printing to tackle skyrocketing inflation and food shortages but the measures impoverished local state owned agricultural companies and contributed to the collapse of the local currency in 2009 191201110911512 although the removal of sanctions is a key demand of the post mugabe government s re engagement with the west the country is battling to stabilise its economy as it transitions from a decade of using the us dollar as part of its multiple currency system but the reintroduction of a local currency at the end of february and more recently the reversal of a decision to remove a government subsidy on maize have failed to ease the situation last week finance minister mthuli ncube said the government is making perfect efforts to reform the economy and attribute the larger part of the crisis to natural disasters and bad luck who gets a cyclone and then another then drought then power outages ncube told reporters on wednesday referring to this year s farmland ravaging cyclone idai and cyclone kenneth that followed it that is a classic example of being unlucky on thursday the government announced that the price of a 10kg 22 pounds bag of maize meal selling for at least 105 zimbabwean dollars 6 32 would drop to 50 zimbabwean dollars 3 32 but some consumers are doubtful if price controls will have any effect on escalating costs for gumbo her monthly state grant of 45 zimbabwean dollars 2 71 of her late husband s benefits is inadequate to meet her living needs with the price of mealie meal a staple food made from milled corn beyond her reach she opts to plant maize hoping that she will be able to yield a harvest in march that could help her to survive a further six months i still can t afford it today they will say it s 50 zimbabwean dollars but the price will still go up in the shops said gumbo a sometimes seasonal farmer i d rather plant and hope the rains will improve so i can have something to eat farmer sikhumbuzo mlilo says he has been threatened with eviction by the government zimbabwe s food scarcity problems however are not recent once a regional breadbasket the country over the past 10 years has been hit by rising food insecurity partly due to the fast track land reform programme that saw a drop in agricultural production mainly of dairy beef and wheat 191128194417897 while those who took over the white owned farms have contributed significantly to the domestic consumption of corn production remains insufficient to build up a store of grain reserves and now even some of the resettled face eviction in the southern district of umguza an area 500km 311 miles south of the capital where some of the earliest resettlements took place sikhumbuzo mlilo and his partner buyiswa moyo live on a plot apportioned from a white owned commercial farm the pair who have been farming the land since 2000 allege that in october they were issued with an eviction notice we need to eat so we can survive but if they tell us to leave this land after being here for so long how do we plant our crops where are supposed to go and find new land he told al jazeera the 44 year old said the order made an already tough situation even worse for his farming dependent family last season we did not reap much from the harvest because the rains came late so we ve had to buy maize meal in town but now it s so expensive it s hard for us he added we just can t afford it following the toppling of mugabe after 37 years in power mnangagwa pledged to end eviction of white commercial farmers while maintaining there was no going back on land reform though seldom eviction of white farmers still occurs while resettled black farmers who are not productive on their land have been warned of expulsion mlilo denies underutilisation and suggests the plots of those threatened with expulsion could be earmarked for a larger farming project for those with money and good government connections a fear also echoed by other resettled farmers since the land seizures zimbabwe depends on production by subsistence farmers to provide the bulk of its maize needs but local wheat production is inadequate as a result the country suffers from a cereal deficit with current production falling short of 761 000 metric tonnes needed for 2019 20 according to regional statistics from the un office for humanitarian affairs cereals and pulses such as wheat and soya beans are largely imported but due to chronic shortages of foreign currency the government has struggled to pay for importation which has resulted in periodic shortages of bread and cooking oil government approved prices for basic goods often do not match those in supermarkets meanwhile over the past year the price of bread has increased more than four times as bakers and millers struggle to keep pace with the quickly eroding value of the local currency against the us dollar 191114143045516 mangaliso ndlovu the former minister of trade and industry and current environment and tourism minister acknowledged that inflation has drastically reduced the purchasing power of many zimbabweans despite regular adjustments of civil servants salaries the wages have not been aligned to the exchange rate and that has been the major challenge which we are gradually addressing he said there is a challenge when it comes to food security and that is why we have put a flash appeal to the united nations when we talk of people going hungry we are literally talking about food on the table and this is a direct impact from the drought and this has stretched government s social protection programme nokusila ndlovu goes without food to make sure her children have enough to eat making a regional version of doughnuts when bread becomes too expensive in an effort to combat escalating prices the government has launched the national bakeries programme a series of community initiatives around the country where entrepreneurs use wood fired ovens to make a cheaper version of bread the lower standard of homemade bread has not caught on however as the small bakeries struggle to produce enough to compete with bigger competitors 190902192154717 instead of buying bread nokusila ndlovu 27 an unemployed mother of four who lives on the outskirts of bulawayo has resorted to making vetkoeks a regional version of doughnuts on an open fire to feed her children i can go without food the whole day sometimes i eat one meal but my children can t so i have to find cheaper alternatives to bread the price is just too much for me so whenever i have money i buy flour to make vetkoeks to keep them full she said in an attempt to plug the nutritional gap faced by low income households the world food programme hopes to deliver more than 240 000 metric tonnes of essentials during the first half of 2020 but the un food agency faces a colossal task the wfp has appealed for nearly 300m to meet zimbabwe s emergency needs but less than 30 percent of funding has so far been guaranteed funds are required immediately for wfp to meet the growing needs of the hardest hit zimbabweans it said in a statement
share entrenched corporates are destroying innovation in both the eu and china entrenched corporates are destroying innovation in both the eu and china china has not become more liberal but the west has become more authoritarian china has not become more liberal but the west has become more authoritarian what good is a cheap washing machine if you can t afford a home to put it in in london last week nato leaders discussed for the first time the challenges and opportunities posed by china there is every reason china discussions are moving from narrow trade forums to hard power organisations that are not even traditionally focused on the pacific what james mann of johns hopkins university has called the soothing scenario of peaceful rise then liberal democratic transition long part of respectable opinion is suddenly being called anachronistic even by the european council on foreign relations according to scholars like michael pillsbury authoritarian resilience has set in the question for a post brexit uk is how to use its capabilities for the century s defining trade and strategic challenge with the full suite of diplomatic and trade tools soon at our disposal once more strategic nous may indeed be returning to downing street but to understand how to deploy them we might recall that the china scenario we face was not meant to happen what was success supposed to look like in his recent book china trade and power stewart paterson suggests that in trade success would have included substantially increased incomes in the west as well as china and western companies frequently owning chinese counterparts in china itself it would have meant a freer press separation of party from judiciary and state perhaps some democratic choice the belief that this was inevitable saw china admitted to the wto without commitments like capital account convertibility and a floating exchange rate to limit the supply side shock of exported deflation letting almost a billion low wage workers into the global economy in the largest labour market arbitrage in history without these commitments left the west carrying the can its central bank inflation targeting cutting many real incomes with asset bubbles benefiting the already well off it is not hard to see who lost and who gained and if low interest rates are suddenly less effective in correcting slowdown china s renminbi intervention has hindered exchange rate adjustment our low nominal rates drive house price rises that discredit free markets especially in an anglosphere where property ownership is closely connected to participatory democracy and adult dignity itself as paterson has asked what good is a cheap washing machine if you can t afford a home to put it in globalisation never had to be this divisive this was all meant to push china towards a liberal end of history instead support for authoritarianism in the west is demonstrably increasing the liberal political order such as it is risks being up ended hundreds of millions of chinese have been raised from poverty a market triumph that can hardly be overstated but the mercantilist economic nationalism we permitted has been a jackpot for the party state whose control has gone from shaky to almost total the precise opposite of the aim of western engagement productivity growth is on hold and global investment prefers cheap labour to the innovation on which developed economies depend industrial regions have increasingly been gutted and the immunity of financial and civil service jobs so far has helped drive a culture war between the west s metropoles and provinces that china s export boom has not seen any concurrent rise in global productivity suggests it is using not the comparative advantage that would mean more efficient resource allocation but a strategy deleterious to others growth the results of our engagement so far are increasingly hard to explain to the western public the evidence also points to growing expansionism abroad and authoritarianism at home the rise of xi jinping and with him more centralised decision making abolished term limits and an orwellian social credit system using algorithms to assess every chinese citizen s behaviour means a steadily more autocratic polity is projected into the world recent activities in hong kong are a wake up call as pillsbury describes in his book the hundred year marathon xi jinping s first speech as leader in 2013 contained three words strong nation dream that as a pla veteran and former secretary to the defence minister xi knew his allies would understand immediately the concept is linked to the china dream by colonel liu mingfu of beijing s national defence university a 2009 bestseller which is recommended reading in state bookstores including the first public discussion of the hundred year marathon china surpassing the us as hegemon by 2049 a century after the founding of the people s republic it describes this new order as just because beating the united states will be china s greatest contribution to humanity in his speech xi also stated that the dream will be realised in 2049 if the china dream is a strategy one belt one road is a core tactic increasingly internationalising china s currency denominating investment in renminbi the infrastructure will rely on the asian infrastructure investment bank aiib and the silk road fund with 100bn and 40bn authorised capital respectively to invest along these corridors both are emerging as potential rivals to the imf world bank and international finance corporation until recently mainstream western scholarship dismissed more hawkish statements as a fringe view but this has changed since xi took over he has made clear that china merely wants to command a third of the world economy its position four hundred years ago to note a relative lack of military power would also miss the point china prefers to invest in asymmetric systems anti satellite technology cyber intrusion for bang for the buck and to avoid premature provocation the fate of the ussr bankrupted by trying to outspend the us on its forces informs the no provocation approach but as paterson has stated johnnie worker red labial scotch whisky is amusing crust toothpaste is probably not as good as crest the remarkable similarity between nato s f35 stealth jet fighter and the chinese j 31 is more sobering a defense science board study found that cyber intruders had hacked the patriot missile system aegis missile defence system the f a 18 fighter the v 22 osprey multirole combat aircraft the littoral combat ship the us intellectual property commission found infringement costs the us economy 225bn to 600bn annually again these tactics are widely discussed in books that became mainstream in china at latest when xi took charge when the new york times beijing bureau chief patrick taylor stated in 1999 that china little expertise and few resources to build the industrial base necessary to become a modern military power he missed the point we had the resources china the capacity to learn in the 1970s deng xiaoping asked president carter to agree the first 7 000 visiting science students which carter understood as an act of goodwill backing chinese entry to international associations for astronautics and nuclear physics his presidential directive 43 began tech transfer programmes in geosciences energy space in 1985 president reagan arranged the sale of six major weapons systems to china helping beijing build research centres for robotics supercomputers and lasers once the soviets had allowed massive tech transfer to china as an ally against the west believing china wished only to be remade in their image then china became an ally against the soviets after all given the right terms of trade at the wto political liberalisation would soon be underway instead china s tech strategy is more developed than any uk equivalent one part the 863 programme named for its march 1986 founding is intended to end china s foreign technological dependence it has already seeded tianhe supercomputers and shenzhou spacecraft for my part i spent two years in beijing researching a phd on this strategy s impacts in an industry meant to be the next big thing for the west solar photovoltaics as i began start ups were appearing across western europe and north america four years later eight of the top ten producers were chinese our industry pulverised by a sector uk aid helped launch western governments had subsidised their own countries installation driving down prices early and before natural consolidation around technological leaders china took advantage subsidising the low quality product that flooded in some chinese firms those with dominant private and foreign shareholdings were beginning to innovate but state backed competitors clearly received free land water and other resources this also serves to disincentivise chinese entrepreneurs who investment in innovation is essential if china is to escape the middle income trap will china s strategy work it is not easy for the chinese entrepreneur to generate economically disruptive ideas in a state increasingly typified by fear or defend ip from a state owned enterprise soe in a chinese courtroom the risk is not that this will work china becoming a prosperous liberal state would be a triumph it is that it will fail over the course of a century dragging down and possibly ending the fragile and highly unusual age of growth that began with the industrial revolution this age of dynamism has depended on a very specific environment in the wealth explosion stephen davies compares china historically unified as one polity with europe whose islands peninsulas and mountain ranges led to the competing polities vital to success many have tried to unify europe the habsburgs came close in the 1500s but a series of gunpowder revolutions saw nation states assert themselves as local elites realised that their survival required flourishing innovation this was unusual innovation means new money new threats to an elite s power china experienced a promising period in the 1200s but the ming inward turn stifled innovation and outside contact so the persecuted european innovator of ideas and machines could flee to a nearby competitor in china then and now no such escape is available getting and staying rich means nurturing innovators not entrenching incumbents whether chinese soes or sluggish european corporates only one of the world s ten most innovative firms is eu based even that listed in new york as a unified elite destroys innovative challengers with hyper regulation in china crony capitalist soes promote their standards abroad through emerging authoritarian institutions into this system of which wto director general azevedo has said we are heading in the wrong direction and we seem to be speeding up enters the newly independent uk where growth began if we do nothing organisations like the shanghai cooperation organisation a club for autocracies whose members are china kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan uzbekistan and russia hint at the risks india is now an observer and dangers for hearts and minds were captured in a grimly obsequious recent article in hong kong s south china morning post by indian anti democrat deep k datta ray india proves democracy is no longer fit for purpose odious tactics are democracy s leitmotif globally and china is moral for delivering freedom it is now time for indians to reassess their inheritance and for the chinese to disseminate the truth about democracy xi jinping s political system unparalleled success at bettering not just chinese citizens but also mankind what is to be done instead of demanding things that won t happen on currency policy we might break down our response into three areas first trade and the commonwealth second hard security and defence third the concept of national competitiveness strategy the trump administration has begun confronting china with cross category tariffs but this is relatively crude and self harming the uk should use the wto dispute settlement system to push compliance working with allies to develop new rules for soes where the office of the us trade representative ustr has been gathering troves of information and it is important to grasp that a deeper trade deal with china is a longer term project within this strategy elsewhere the uk and us should make it harder to sell back to us products based on infringed ip using the wto agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property rights trips to address attempts to force our companies to turn it over the pivot back to our neglected commonwealth allows us to promote the rule of law entrepreneurship and private property rights through asia and the pacific alongside membership of the vital comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership in hard security the upcoming decision on huawei is a test but a broader strategic revamp is needed nasa is now prohibited from joint chinese scientific activities we should ask questions of the uk universities that have let in five hundred chinese military personnel in the last decade there is also a strong case for preventing firms such as huawei employing parliamentarians meanwhile we only need consider huawei for 5g because we maintain innovation reducing quasi monopolists like bt openreach china annually analyses its competitiveness versus other countries we don t even as our productivity stagnates in 1982 andrew marshall director of the pentagon s office of net assessment noted of the ussr a major component of any assessment of the adequacy of the strategic balance should be our best approximation of a soviet style assessment this must not be the standard us calculations done with slightly different assumptions ather structured as the soviet would structure it as michael pillsbury has suggested our time could be compared to the launch of sputnik which allowed a re organisation of innovation that led ultimately to the digital revolution itself pushing china towards more liberalism with targeted penalties for both autocratic expansionism and the gaming of world trade will be useful but a new trade strategy is merely an offshoot of renewed national strategy for growth itself and that could hardly be more urgent for our security for the chinese people themselves and for growth everywhere click here to subscribe to our daily briefing the best

bulawayo zimbabwe every morning just before the daily power cut kicks in juliet gumbo enters her kitchen to start preparing her meal it will be her only food for the day but she will have it hours later when she returns to her electricity lacking home after a day spent farming or hawking goods on the streets of bulawayo zimbabwe s second largest city gumbo a 52 year old widow lacking a steady job is just one of many zimbabweans struggling to cope with a scorching drought and economic instability that have pushed millions to the brink of famine i eat what i can get gumbo said more nearly half of zimbabweans face hunger starvationcyclone idai thousands still struggling to copezimbabwe s food crisis food security is national security zimbabwe is in the grip of its worst economic crisis in 10 years with inflation soaring to 300 percent and the population suffering fuel shortages power rationing and currency woes emmerson mnangagwa who succeeded robert mugabe after a military intervention forced the longtime president to resign has struggled to revive the economy while the long standing financial troubles have been worsened by extreme weather shocks and now zimbabwe is facing major food insecurity as many people do not have enough food to eat or they cannot afford it according to hilal elver the united nations special rapporteur on the right to food the country is on the verge of man made starvation with close to 60 percent of its 14 million population being food insecure juliet gumbo is trying to plant her own food as she can no longer afford to buy maize after an 11 day visit last month to areas hit by the el nino induced drought elver said the crisis affected a staggering 5 5 million people in rural areas and a further 2 2 million in cities these are shocking figures she said adding that notwithstanding the devastating effect of recurrent droughts and powerful cyclones the crisis was partly due to chronic economic mismanagement high unemployment widespread poverty and rampant corruption in her statement elver also suggested economic sanctions by the united states and the european union against officials and entities linked with the ruling zanu pf party over alleged abuses are contributing to zimbabwe s current malaise the government in harare also says sanctions are impeding economic growth and hurting ordinary zimbabweans but the us embassy refutes the claim the government of zimbabwe s failed economic policies not sanctions hinder zimbabwe s economic growth the embassy s press office said in a statement to al jazeera billions of dollars have been lost due to decades of corruption and harmful economic policies which have culminated in the current economic crisis implementation of economic and political reforms are the key to improving zimbabwe s trajectory analysts say years of shifting policies on land reform and food subsidies under mugabe and mnangagwa are also partly to blame for zimbabwe s food scarcity the country s agro based economy began to collapse following the state s violent seizure in the 2000s of an estimated 10 million hectares 25 million acres for redistribution from white commercial farmers to resettle the landless black majority mugabe s government over the years resorted to price controls and money printing to tackle skyrocketing inflation and food shortages but the measures impoverished local state owned agricultural companies and contributed to the collapse of the local currency in 2009 191201110911512 although the removal of sanctions is a key demand of the post mugabe government s re engagement with the west the country is battling to stabilise its economy as it transitions from a decade of using the us dollar as part of its multiple currency system but the reintroduction of a local currency at the end of february and more recently the reversal of a decision to remove a government subsidy on maize have failed to ease the situation last week finance minister mthuli ncube said the government is making perfect efforts to reform the economy and attribute the larger part of the crisis to natural disasters and bad luck who gets a cyclone and then another then drought then power outages ncube told reporters on wednesday referring to this year s farmland ravaging cyclone idai and cyclone kenneth that followed it that is a classic example of being unlucky on thursday the government announced that the price of a 10kg 22 pounds bag of maize meal selling for at least 105 zimbabwean dollars 6 32 would drop to 50 zimbabwean dollars 3 32 but some consumers are doubtful if price controls will have any effect on escalating costs for gumbo her monthly state grant of 45 zimbabwean dollars 2 71 of her late husband s benefits is inadequate to meet her living needs with the price of mealie meal a staple food made from milled corn beyond her reach she opts to plant maize hoping that she will be able to yield a harvest in march that could help her to survive a further six months i still can t afford it today they will say it s 50 zimbabwean dollars but the price will still go up in the shops said gumbo a sometimes seasonal farmer i d rather plant and hope the rains will improve so i can have something to eat farmer sikhumbuzo mlilo says he has been threatened with eviction by the government zimbabwe s food scarcity problems however are not recent once a regional breadbasket the country over the past 10 years has been hit by rising food insecurity partly due to the fast track land reform programme that saw a drop in agricultural production mainly of dairy beef and wheat 191128194417897 while those who took over the white owned farms have contributed significantly to the domestic consumption of corn production remains insufficient to build up a store of grain reserves and now even some of the resettled face eviction in the southern district of umguza an area 500km 311 miles south of the capital where some of the earliest resettlements took place sikhumbuzo mlilo and his partner buyiswa moyo live on a plot apportioned from a white owned commercial farm the pair who have been farming the land since 2000 allege that in october they were issued with an eviction notice we need to eat so we can survive but if they tell us to leave this land after being here for so long how do we plant our crops where are supposed to go and find new land he told al jazeera the 44 year old said the order made an already tough situation even worse for his farming dependent family last season we did not reap much from the harvest because the rains came late so we ve had to buy maize meal in town but now it s so expensive it s hard for us he added we just can t afford it following the toppling of mugabe after 37 years in power mnangagwa pledged to end eviction of white commercial farmers while maintaining there was no going back on land reform though seldom eviction of white farmers still occurs while resettled black farmers who are not productive on their land have been warned of expulsion mlilo denies underutilisation and suggests the plots of those threatened with expulsion could be earmarked for a larger farming project for those with money and good government connections a fear also echoed by other resettled farmers since the land seizures zimbabwe depends on production by subsistence farmers to provide the bulk of its maize needs but local wheat production is inadequate as a result the country suffers from a cereal deficit with current production falling short of 761 000 metric tonnes needed for 2019 20 according to regional statistics from the un office for humanitarian affairs cereals and pulses such as wheat and soya beans are largely imported but due to chronic shortages of foreign currency the government has struggled to pay for importation which has resulted in periodic shortages of bread and cooking oil government approved prices for basic goods often do not match those in supermarkets meanwhile over the past year the price of bread has increased more than four times as bakers and millers struggle to keep pace with the quickly eroding value of the local currency against the us dollar 191114143045516 mangaliso ndlovu the former minister of trade and industry and current environment and tourism minister acknowledged that inflation has drastically reduced the purchasing power of many zimbabweans despite regular adjustments of civil servants salaries the wages have not been aligned to the exchange rate and that has been the major challenge which we are gradually addressing he said there is a challenge when it comes to food security and that is why we have put a flash appeal to the united nations when we talk of people going hungry we are literally talking about food on the table and this is a direct impact from the drought and this has stretched government s social protection programme nokusila ndlovu goes without food to make sure her children have enough to eat making a regional version of doughnuts when bread becomes too expensive in an effort to combat escalating prices the government has launched the national bakeries programme a series of community initiatives around the country where entrepreneurs use wood fired ovens to make a cheaper version of bread the lower standard of homemade bread has not caught on however as the small bakeries struggle to produce enough to compete with bigger competitors 190902192154717 instead of buying bread nokusila ndlovu 27 an unemployed mother of four who lives on the outskirts of bulawayo has resorted to making vetkoeks a regional version of doughnuts on an open fire to feed her children i can go without food the whole day sometimes i eat one meal but my children can t so i have to find cheaper alternatives to bread the price is just too much for me so whenever i have money i buy flour to make vetkoeks to keep them full she said in an attempt to plug the nutritional gap faced by low income households the world food programme hopes to deliver more than 240 000 metric tonnes of essentials during the first half of 2020 but the un food agency faces a colossal task the wfp has appealed for nearly 300m to meet zimbabwe s emergency needs but less than 30 percent of funding has so far been guaranteed funds are required immediately for wfp to meet the growing needs of the hardest hit zimbabweans it said in a statement
the great american shakedown by chris hedges december 09 2019 information clearing house the democratic party and its liberal supporters are perplexed they presented hours of evidence of an impeachable offense although they studiously avoided charging donald trump with impeachable offenses also carried out by democratic presidents including the continuation or expansion of presidential wars not declared by congress exercising line item veto power playing prosecutor judge jury and executioner to kill individuals including u s citizens anywhere on the planet violating due process and misusing executive orders because civics is no longer taught in most american schools they devoted a day to constitutional scholars who provided the civics 101 case for impeachment the liberal press cheerleading the impeachment process saturated the media landscape with live coverage interminable analysis constant character assassination of trump and giddy speculation and yet it has made no difference public opinion remains largely unaffected perhaps supporters of impeachment argue they failed to adopt the right technique perhaps journalists by giving voice to opponents of impeachment who do indeed live in a world not based in fact created a false equivalency between truth and lies maybe as bill grueskin a professor at the columbia university journalism school writes impeachment advocates should spend 1 million to produce a kind of movie trailer for all those who did not sit through the hours of hearings to boil down the essentials of the film and provide a quick but intense insight into the characters setting the scene with vivid imagery to entice people to come back to the theatre a month later for the full movie or perhaps they need to keep pounding away at trump until his walls of support crumble the liberal class and the democratic party leadership have failed even after their defeat in the 2016 presidential election to understand that they along with the traditional republican elites have squandered their credibility no one believes them and no one should are you tired of the lies and non stop propaganda get your free daily newsletter they squandered their credibility by promising that the north american free trade agreement nafta would as claimed by president bill clinton create 200 000 new well paying jobs per year instead several million jobs were lost they squandered it by allowing corporations to move production overseas and hire foreign workers at daily wages that did not equal what a u s unionized worker made in an hour a situation that obliterated the bargaining power of the american working class they squandered it by allowing corporations to use the threat of offshoring production to destroy unions suppress wages extract draconian concessions and push millions of workers into the temp and gig economies where there are no benefits or job security and pay is 60 or less of what a full time employee in the regular economy receives they squandered it by forcing working men and women to take two or three jobs to support a family jacking up household debt to 13 95 trillion they squandered it by redirecting wealth upward so that during the clinton administration alone 45 percent of all income growth went to the wealthiest 1 they squandered it by wiping out small farmers in mexico driving some 3 million of them off their lands and forcing many to migrate in desperation to the united states a human tide that saw the u s right wing and president trump direct mounting rage toward immigrants they squandered it by turning our great cities into urban wastelands they squandered it by slashing welfare and social service programs they squandered it by supporting endless futile wars that have an overall price tag of between 5 trillion and 7 trillion they squandered it by setting up a surveillance system to spy on every american and then lying about it they squandered it by catering to the big banks and gutting financial regulations precipitating the 2008 economic meltdown they squandered it by looting the u s treasury to bail out banks and financial firms guilty of massive financial crimes ordering the federal reserve to hand over an estimated 29 trillion to the global financiers responsible for the crash they squandered it by not using this staggering sum instead to provide free college tuition to every student or universal health care repair our crumbling infrastructure transition to clean energy forgive student debt raise wages bail out underwater homeowners form public banks to foster investments in our communities at low interest rates provide a guaranteed minimum income and organize a massive jobs program for the unemployed and underemployed whose ranks are at least double official statistics they squandered it by cutting child assistance programs most drastically during the clinton administration resulting in 16 million children going to bed hungry every night they squandered it by leaving over half a million americans homeless and on the streets on any given day they squandered it by passing laws that keep students burdened by massive college loan debt that has climbed to 1 4 trillion debt they cannot free themselves from even if they declare bankruptcy they squandered it by militarizing police and building the world s largest system of mass incarceration one with 25 of the world s prison population they squandered it by revoking due process and habeas corpus they squandered it by passing massive tax cuts for the rich and for corporations many of which such as amazon pay no federal income tax ballooning the federal deficit now at 779 billion and climbing they squandered it by privatizing everything from intelligence gathering to public education to swell corporate bank accounts at taxpayer expense they squandered it by permitting corporate money an estimated 9 9 billion will be spent this presidential election cycle on political advertising to buy politicians in a form of legalized bribery that sees corporate lobbyists write legislation and create laws they squandered it by doing nothing to halt the looming ecocide the problem is not messaging the problem is the messenger the mortal wounds inflicted on our democratic institutions are bipartisan the traditional republican elites are as hated as the democratic elites trump is vile imbecilic corrupt and incompetent but for a largely white working class cast aside by austerity and neoliberalism he at least taunts the elites who destroyed their communities and their lives the shakedown that trump clumsily attempted to orchestrate against the president of ukraine in the hope of discrediting joe biden a potential rival in the 2020 presidential election pales beside the shakedown orchestrated by the elites who rule over america s working men and women this shakedown took from those workers their hope and more ominously their hope for their children it took from them security and a sense of place and dignity it took from them a voice in how they were governed it took from them their country and handed it to a cabal of global corporatists who intend to turn them into serfs this shakedown plunged millions into despair it led many to self destructive opioid alcohol drug and gambling addictions it led to increases in suicide mass shootings and hate crimes this shakedown led to bizarre conspiracy theories and fabrications peddled by a neofascist right wing deceptions bolstered by the lies told by those tasked with keeping the society rooted in truth and verifiable fact this shakedown led to the end of the rule of law and the destruction of democratic institutions that if they had continued to function could have prevented the rise to power of a demagogue such as trump there is zero chance trump will be removed from office in a trial in the senate the democratic party elites have admitted as much they carried out they argue their civic and constitutional duty but here again they lie they picked out what was convenient to impeach trump and left untouched the rotten system they helped create the divisions among americans will only widen the hatreds will only grow and tyranny will wrap its deadly tentacles around our throats chris hedges spent nearly two decades as a foreign correspondent in central america the middle east africa and

on the verge of man made starvation with close to 60 percent of its 14 million population being food insecure juliet gumbo is trying to plant her own food as she can no longer afford to buy maize after an 11 day visit last month to areas hit by the el nino induced drought elver said the crisis affected a staggering 5 5 million people in rural areas and a further 2 2 million in cities these are shocking figures she said adding that notwithstanding the devastating effect of recurrent droughts and powerful cyclones the crisis was partly due to chronic economic mismanagement high unemployment

agro based economy began to collapse following the state s violent seizure in the 2000s of an estimated 10 million hectares 25 million acres for redistribution from white commercial farmers to resettle the landless black majority mugabe s government over the years resorted to price controls and money printing to tackle skyrocketing inflation and food shortages but the measures impoverished

re engagement with the west the country is battling to stabilise its economy as it transitions from a decade of using the us dollar as part of its multiple currency system but the reintroduction of a local currency at the end of february and more recently the reversal of a decision to remove a government subsidy on maize have failed to ease the situation last week finance minister mthuli ncube

bulawayo zimbabwe every morning just before the daily power cut kicks in juliet gumbo enters her kitchen to start preparing her meal it will be her only food for the day but she will have it hours later when she returns to her electricity lacking home after a day spent farming or hawking goods on the streets of bulawayo zimbabwe s second largest city gumbo a 52 year old widow lacking a steady job is just one of many zimbabweans struggling to cope with a scorching drought and economic instability that have pushed millions to the brink of famine i eat what i can get gumbo said more nearly half of zimbabweans face hunger starvationcyclone idai thousands still struggling to copezimbabwe s food crisis food security is national security zimbabwe is in the grip of its worst economic crisis in 10 years with inflation soaring to 300 percent and the population suffering fuel shortages power rationing and currency woes emmerson mnangagwa who succeeded robert mugabe after a military intervention forced the longtime president to resign has struggled to revive the economy while the long standing financial troubles have been worsened by extreme weather shocks and now zimbabwe is facing major food insecurity as many people do not have enough food to eat or they cannot afford it according to hilal elver the united nations special rapporteur on the right to food the country is on the verge of man made starvation with close to 60 percent of its 14 million population being food insecure juliet gumbo is trying to plant her own food as she can no longer afford to buy maize after an 11 day visit last month to areas hit by the el nino induced drought elver said the crisis affected a staggering 5 5 million people in rural areas and a further 2 2 million in cities these are shocking figures she said adding that notwithstanding the devastating effect of recurrent droughts and powerful cyclones the crisis was partly due to chronic economic mismanagement high unemployment widespread poverty and rampant corruption in her statement elver also suggested economic sanctions by the united states and the european union against officials and entities linked with the ruling zanu pf party over alleged abuses are contributing to zimbabwe s current malaise the government in harare also says sanctions are impeding economic growth and hurting ordinary zimbabweans but the us embassy refutes the claim the government of zimbabwe s failed economic policies not sanctions hinder zimbabwe s economic growth the embassy s press office said in a statement to al jazeera billions of dollars have been lost due to decades of corruption and harmful economic policies which have culminated in the current economic crisis implementation of economic and political reforms are the key to improving zimbabwe s trajectory analysts say years of shifting policies on land reform and food subsidies under mugabe and mnangagwa are also partly to blame for zimbabwe s food scarcity the country s agro based economy began to collapse following the state s violent seizure in the 2000s of an estimated 10 million hectares 25 million acres for redistribution from white commercial farmers to resettle the landless black majority mugabe s government over the years resorted to price controls and money printing to tackle skyrocketing inflation and food shortages but the measures impoverished local state owned agricultural companies and contributed to the collapse of the local currency in 2009 191201110911512 although the removal of sanctions is a key demand of the post mugabe government s re engagement with the west the country is battling to stabilise its economy as it transitions from a decade of using the us dollar as part of its multiple currency system but the reintroduction of a local currency at the end of february and more recently the reversal of a decision to remove a government subsidy on maize have failed to ease the situation last week finance minister mthuli ncube said the government is making perfect efforts to reform the economy and attribute the larger part of the crisis to natural disasters and bad luck who gets a cyclone and then another then drought then power outages ncube told reporters on wednesday referring to this year s farmland ravaging cyclone idai and cyclone kenneth that followed it that is a classic example of being unlucky on thursday the government announced that the price of a 10kg 22 pounds bag of maize meal selling for at least 105 zimbabwean dollars 6 32 would drop to 50 zimbabwean dollars 3 32 but some consumers are doubtful if price controls will have any effect on escalating costs for gumbo her monthly state grant of 45 zimbabwean dollars 2 71 of her late husband s benefits is inadequate to meet her living needs with the price of mealie meal a staple food made from milled corn beyond her reach she opts to plant maize hoping that she will be able to yield a harvest in march that could help her to survive a further six months i still can t afford it today they will say it s 50 zimbabwean dollars but the price will still go up in the shops said gumbo a sometimes seasonal farmer i d rather plant and hope the rains will improve so i can have something to eat farmer sikhumbuzo mlilo says he has been threatened with eviction by the government zimbabwe s food scarcity problems however are not recent once a regional breadbasket the country over the past 10 years has been hit by rising food insecurity partly due to the fast track land reform programme that saw a drop in agricultural production mainly of dairy beef and wheat 191128194417897 while those who took over the white owned farms have contributed significantly to the domestic consumption of corn production remains insufficient to build up a store of grain reserves and now even some of the resettled face eviction in the southern district of umguza an area 500km 311 miles south of the capital where some of the earliest resettlements took place sikhumbuzo mlilo and his partner buyiswa moyo live on a plot apportioned from a white owned commercial farm the pair who have been farming the land since 2000 allege that in october they were issued with an eviction notice we need to eat so we can survive but if they tell us to leave this land after being here for so long how do we plant our crops where are supposed to go and find new land he told al jazeera the 44 year old said the order made an already tough situation even worse for his farming dependent family last season we did not reap much from the harvest because the rains came late so we ve had to buy maize meal in town but now it s so expensive it s hard for us he added we just can t afford it following the toppling of mugabe after 37 years in power mnangagwa pledged to end eviction of white commercial farmers while maintaining there was no going back on land reform though seldom eviction of white farmers still occurs while resettled black farmers who are not productive on their land have been warned of expulsion mlilo denies underutilisation and suggests the plots of those threatened with expulsion could be earmarked for a larger farming project for those with money and good government connections a fear also echoed by other resettled farmers since the land seizures zimbabwe depends on production by subsistence farmers to provide the bulk of its maize needs but local wheat production is inadequate as a result the country suffers from a cereal deficit with current production falling short of 761 000 metric tonnes needed for 2019 20 according to regional statistics from the un office for humanitarian affairs cereals and pulses such as wheat and soya beans are largely imported but due to chronic shortages of foreign currency the government has struggled to pay for importation which has resulted in periodic shortages of bread and cooking oil government approved prices for basic goods often do not match those in supermarkets meanwhile over the past year the price of bread has increased more than four times as bakers and millers struggle to keep pace with the quickly eroding value of the local currency against the us dollar 191114143045516 mangaliso ndlovu the former minister of trade and industry and current environment and tourism minister acknowledged that inflation has drastically reduced the purchasing power of many zimbabweans despite regular adjustments of civil servants salaries the wages have not been aligned to the exchange rate and that has been the major challenge which we are gradually addressing he said there is a challenge when it comes to food security and that is why we have put a flash appeal to the united nations when we talk of people going hungry we are literally talking about food on the table and this is a direct impact from the drought and this has stretched government s social protection programme nokusila ndlovu goes without food to make sure her children have enough to eat making a regional version of doughnuts when bread becomes too expensive in an effort to combat escalating prices the government has launched the national bakeries programme a series of community initiatives around the country where entrepreneurs use wood fired ovens to make a cheaper version of bread the lower standard of homemade bread has not caught on however as the small bakeries struggle to produce enough to compete with bigger competitors 190902192154717 instead of buying bread nokusila ndlovu 27 an unemployed mother of four who lives on the outskirts of bulawayo has resorted to making vetkoeks a regional version of doughnuts on an open fire to feed her children i can go without food the whole day sometimes i eat one meal but my children can t so i have to find cheaper alternatives to bread the price is just too much for me so whenever i have money i buy flour to make vetkoeks to keep them full she said in an attempt to plug the nutritional gap faced by low income households the world food programme hopes to deliver more than 240 000 metric tonnes of essentials during the first half of 2020 but the un food agency faces a colossal task the wfp has appealed for nearly 300m to meet

11 12 2019 listen in an effort at regarding ghana as a self reliant nation minister for trade and industry alan kwadwo kyerematen has revealed that president akufo addo has articulated the vision of a new ghana beyond aid designed at making the country self sustaining anchored on inclusive growth and shared prosperity according to him ghanaians will realize this vision through industrial transformation particularly if it works towards creating an integrated market for africa and for all africans speaking on the theme industrialising ghana beyond aid for an integrated africa the trade and industry minister said our focus will be on industrialisation and how it feeds into the ghana beyond aid agenda and which will propel us to take advantage of the continental free trade arrangement he also added that it is an incontestable fact that no country has developed without industrialization hon kyerematen further added that it is therefore not by accident that the ten largest economies i e united states china japan germany and united kingdom among others in the world are the most industrialized economies the trade and industry minister said in 1959 104 out of 234 firms which operated in the immediate independent era were established before 1950 in the then gold coast ewusi 1981 most of these firms were in the wood and cork industries located mainly in the forest zones ashanti and western regions of the country he revealed that the first conscious effort on the part of the gold coast government in the course of industrialisation was the enactment of the gold coast industrial act of 1947 which established the industrial development corporation idc he further disclosed that the objective of the act was to formulate policies and drive the industrial development of the then gold coast adding that the idc operated largely as a loan agency focusing on privately conceived projects speaking on the state led import substitution industrialisation between 1960 and 1983 hon kyerematen disclosed that the declaration of the first republic in 1960 ushered in a new model of industrialisation backed by socialist ideals and principles nkrumah believed that the local private sector lacked the required capacity to promote the industrial development agenda under his regime and that the state needed to play a catalytic and interventionist role to promote industrial development he stated the trade and industry minister revealed that late nkrumah s approach to industrialization was therefore purely state led adding that it required intensive design of industrial programmes and massive investments into industries by the central government he however mentioned that under the approach the government established the volta aluminium company valco smelter sawmills and timber processing cocoa processing breweries textiles and garment cement meat processing and tomato processing killick 1978 hon kyerematen stressed that the convention people s party cpp government led by nkrumah used the state led industrialization approach as a means for economic empowerment of the new ghanaian through job and wealth creation the approach generated significant positive results for economic development of the country for example the manufacturing output increased by about 13 in the 1960s whiles total employment in the sector grew by over 90 within the same period he stated speaking on the industrialisation under the economic recovery programme erp between 1984 to 2000 hon kyerematen disclosed that the inception of the economic recovery programme erp by the bretton woods institutions in 1983 improved the supply of foreign exchange abolished the import licensing regime removed price controls and created the opportunity for imported machinery among others he said the approach to industrial development sought to create an enabling environment for the development of small scale manufacturing and value addition he emphasized that the macro economic stability between the early 80s and early 90s led to increased capacity utilization rising steadily to about 40 percent in 1989 he noted that the combined effect of import competition and financial sector reforms under the structural adjustment programme sap significantly affected the industrial sector performance during the period he further explained that the industrial sector growth rate between 1985 and 1994 fell from 17 6 to a paltry of 3 1 adding that the ghanaian private sector failed to withstand the pressure of global competition and inherent local structural constraints such as unreliable power supply he said poor business related infrastructure price distortions and inadequate government support made matters worse government s attempt to mitigate the adverse effect of erp sap on domestic enterprises was mired by implementation inefficiencies anchored on nepotism and political patronage the trade and industry minister mentioned that despite these attempts by the jerry rawlings government and development partners to deal with the industrial productivity bottlenecks the industrial sector experienced marginal growth between 1995 and 2000 with an average growth rate of 4 3 these programmes and projects to a large extent could not achieve the desired results due to implementation inefficiencies in addition to the above the market liberalisation had exposed the local manufacturing firms to keen competition from both matured and emerging markets such as europe the usa and india he noted he lauded the kufuor administration between 2000 and 2008 for focusing on a private sector led model of industrial development through the application of science and technology under the growth and poverty reduction strategies gprs i 2003 2005 and gprs ii 2006 2009 he stressed that attempts under the administration were geared towards the promotion of value addition in the agro processing sector for export and domestic consumption he added that other measures focused on improving agricultural productivity market access and promoting industrial sub contracting and partnership exchange spx these strategic interventions stimulated growth of the industrial sector starting from the year 2002 with a growth rate of 4 7 from 2 9 in 2001 and further to 5 1 in 2003 and 2004 he said the kufuor government also crafted and started the implementation of the district industrialization programme dip as an integral part of the agenda for industrialization for value addition and job creation speaking on industry value added annual growth 2009 to 2016 hon kyerematen stated that it is not surprising that the manufacturing sub sector declined in growth whiles the overall industrial sector experienced sharp decline at 1 1 in both 2014 and 2015 fiscal years touching on the akufo addo led industrial transformation agenda he mentioned that the npp s plan for jobs called for a structured and strategic response to the challenges facing ghanaian industries in the npp manifesto for election 2016 a number of strategic interventions were designed to address these challenges the interventions include the one district one factory 1d1f initiative the national industrial revitalisation programme nirp the establishment of industrial parks and special economic zones ipsez export development and sme development he revealed he also noted that the programmes initiatives were designed to address the challenge of lack of capacity utilisation in the industrial sector dealing with severe poverty and under development in rural communities through the establishment of an institutional framework that will attract private sector investments into the rural economy speaking on one district one factory 1d1f initiative he said since the inception of the programme in 2017 business promoters in 112 out of the 260 districts have received support from the government and participation financial institutions pfis he added that a total of 181 projects

dynamic entrepreneurs across the country speaking on the national industrial revitalization programme stimulus package he mentioned that the ministry is providing targeted support to ten 10 large

states of the organization of african unity oau envisioned the establishment of an african economic community one of the building blocks for the establishment of this community was the creation of a continental free trade area for africa he also noted that the realization of the vision of a single market did not materialize until the au summit of heads of states and government in january 2012

culminated in the current economic crisis implementation of economic and political reforms are the key to improving zimbabwe s trajectory analysts say years of shifting policies on land reform and food subsidies under mugabe and mnangagwa are also partly to blame for zimbabwe s food scarcity the country s agro based economy began to collapse following the state s violent seizure in the 2000s of an estimated 10 million hectares 25 million acres for redistribution from white commercial farmers to resettle the landless black majority mugabe s government over the years resorted to price controls and money printing to tackle skyrocketing inflation and food shortages but the measures impoverished local state owned agricultural companies and contributed to the collapse of the local currency in 2009 191201110911512 although the removal of sanctions is a key demand of the post mugabe government s re engagement with the west the country is battling to stabilise its economy as it transitions from a decade of using the us dollar as part of its multiple currency system but the reintroduction of a local currency at the end of february and more recently the reversal of a decision to remove a government subsidy on maize have failed to ease the situation last week finance minister mthuli ncube said the government is making perfect efforts to reform the economy and attribute the larger part of the crisis to natural disasters and bad luck who gets a cyclone and then another then drought then power outages ncube told reporters on wednesday referring to this year s farmland ravaging cyclone idai and cyclone kenneth that followed it that is a classic example of being unlucky on thursday the government announced that the price of a 10kg 22 pounds bag of maize meal selling for at least 105 zimbabwean dollars 6 32 would drop to 50 zimbabwean dollars 3 32 but some consumers are doubtful if price controls will have any effect on escalating costs for gumbo her monthly state grant of 45

hoping that she will be able to yield a harvest in march that could help her to survive a further six months i still can t afford it today they will say it s 50 zimbabwean dollars but the price will still go up in the shops said gumbo a sometimes seasonal farmer i d rather plant and hope the rains will improve so i can have something to eat zimbabwe s food scarcity problems however are not recent once a regional breadbasket the country over the past 10 years has been hit by rising food insecurity partly due to the fast track land reform programme that saw a drop in agricultural production mainly of dairy beef and wheat 191128194417897 while those who took over the white owned farms have contributed significantly to the domestic consumption of corn production remains insufficient to build up a store of grain reserves and now even some of the resettled face eviction in the southern district of umguza an area 500km 311 miles south of the capital where some of the earliest resettlements took place sikhumbuzo mlilo and his partner buyiswa moyo live on a plot apportioned from a white owned commercial farm the pair who have been farming the land since 2000 allege that in october they were issued with an eviction notice we need to eat so we can survive but if they tell us to leave this land after being here for so long how do we plant our crops where are supposed to go and find new land he told al jazeera the 44 year old said the order made an already tough situation even worse for his farming dependent family last season we did not reap much from the harvest because the rains came late so we ve had to buy maize meal in town but now it s so expensive it s hard for us he added we just can t afford it following the toppling of mugabe after 37 years in power mnangagwa pledged to end eviction of white commercial farmers while maintaining there was no going back on land reform though seldom eviction of white farmers still occurs while resettled black farmers who are not productive on their land have been warned of expulsion mlilo denies underutilisation and suggests the plots of those threatened with expulsion could be earmarked for a larger farming project for those with money and good government connections a fear also echoed by other resettled farmers since the land seizures zimbabwe depends on production by subsistence farmers to provide the bulk of its maize needs but local wheat production is inadequate as a result the country suffers from a cereal deficit with current production falling short of 761 000 metric tonnes needed for 2019 20 according to regional statistics from the un office for humanitarian affairs cereals and pulses such as wheat and soya beans are largely imported but due to chronic shortages of foreign currency the government has struggled to pay for importation which has resulted in periodic shortages of bread and cooking oil meanwhile over the past year the price of bread has increased more than four times as bakers and millers struggle to keep pace with the quickly eroding value of the local currency against the us dollar 191114143045516 mangaliso ndlovu the former minister of trade and industry and current environment and tourism minister acknowledged that inflation has drastically reduced the purchasing power of many zimbabweans despite regular adjustments of civil servants salaries the wages have not been aligned to the exchange rate and that has been the major challenge which we are gradually addressing he said there is a challenge when it comes to food security and that is why we have put a flash appeal to the united nations when we talk of people going hungry we are literally talking about food on the table and this is a direct impact from the drought and this has stretched government s social protection programme in an effort to combat escalating prices the government has launched the national bakeries programme a series of community initiatives around the country where entrepreneurs use wood fired ovens to make a cheaper version of bread the lower standard of homemade bread has not caught on however as the small bakeries struggle to produce enough to compete with bigger competitors 190902192154717 instead of buying bread nokusila ndlovu 27 an unemployed mother of four who lives on the outskirts of bulawayo has resorted to making vetkoeks a regional version of doughnuts on an open fire to feed her children i can go without food the whole day sometimes i eat one meal but my children can t so i have to find cheaper alternatives to bread the price is just too much for me so whenever i have money i buy flour to make vetkoeks to keep them full she said in an attempt to plug the nutritional gap faced by low income households the world food programme hopes to deliver more than 240 000 metric tonnes of essentials during the first half of 2020 but the un food agency faces a colossal task the wfp has appealed for nearly 300m to meet

bulawayo zimbabwe every morning just before the daily power cut kicks in juliet gumbo enters her kitchen to start preparing her meal it will be her only food for the day but she will have it hours later when she returns to her electricity lacking home after a day spent farming or hawking goods on the streets of bulawayo zimbabwe s second largest city gumbo a 52 year old widow lacking a steady job is just one of many zimbabweans struggling to cope with a scorching drought and economic instability that have pushed millions to the brink of famine i eat what i can get gumbo said more nearly half of zimbabweans face hunger starvationcyclone idai thousands still struggling to copezimbabwe s food crisis food security is national security zimbabwe is in the grip of its worst economic crisis in 10 years with inflation soaring to 300 percent and the population suffering fuel shortages power rationing and currency woes emmerson mnangagwa who succeeded robert mugabe after a military intervention forced the longtime president to resign has struggled to revive the economy while the long standing financial troubles have been worsened by extreme weather shocks and now zimbabwe is facing major food insecurity as many people do not have enough food to eat or they cannot afford it according to hilal elver the united nations special rapporteur on the right to food the country is on the verge of man made starvation with close to 60 percent of its 14 million population being food insecure juliet gumbo is trying to plant her own food as she can no longer afford to buy maize after an 11 day visit last month to areas hit by the el nino induced drought elver said the crisis affected a staggering 5 5 million people in rural areas and a further 2 2 million in cities these are shocking figures she said adding that notwithstanding the devastating effect of recurrent droughts and powerful cyclones the crisis was partly due to chronic economic mismanagement high unemployment widespread poverty and rampant corruption in her statement elver also suggested economic sanctions by the united states and the european union against officials and entities linked with the ruling zanu pf party over alleged abuses are contributing to zimbabwe s current malaise the government in harare also says sanctions are impeding economic growth and hurting ordinary zimbabweans but the us embassy refutes the claim the government of zimbabwe s failed economic policies not sanctions hinder zimbabwe s economic growth the embassy s press office said in a statement to al jazeera billions of dollars have been lost due to decades of corruption and harmful economic policies which have culminated in the current economic crisis implementation of economic and political reforms are the key to improving zimbabwe s trajectory analysts say years of shifting policies on land reform and food subsidies under mugabe and mnangagwa are also partly to blame for zimbabwe s food scarcity the country s agro based economy began to collapse following the state s violent seizure in the 2000s of an estimated 10 million hectares 25 million acres for redistribution from white commercial farmers to resettle the landless black majority mugabe s government over the years resorted to price controls and money printing to tackle skyrocketing inflation and food shortages but the measures impoverished local state owned agricultural companies and contributed to the collapse of the local currency in 2009 191201110911512 although the removal of sanctions is a key demand of the post mugabe government s re engagement with the west the country is battling to stabilise its economy as it transitions from a decade of using the us dollar as part of its multiple currency system but the reintroduction of a local currency at the end of february and more recently the reversal of a decision to remove a government subsidy on maize have failed to ease the situation last week finance minister mthuli ncube said the government is making perfect efforts to reform the economy and attribute the larger part of the crisis to natural disasters and bad luck who gets a cyclone and then another then drought then power outages ncube told reporters on wednesday referring to this year s farmland ravaging cyclone idai and cyclone kenneth that followed it that is a classic example of being unlucky on thursday the government announced that the price of a 10kg 22 pounds bag of maize meal selling for at least 105 zimbabwean dollars 6 32 would drop to 50 zimbabwean dollars 3 32 but some consumers are doubtful if price controls will have any effect on escalating costs for gumbo her monthly state grant of 45 zimbabwean dollars 2 71 of her late husband s benefits is inadequate to meet her living needs with the price of mealie meal a staple food made from milled corn beyond her reach she opts to plant maize hoping that she will be able to yield a harvest in march that could help her to survive a further six months i still can t afford it today they will say it s 50 zimbabwean dollars but the price will still go up in the shops said gumbo a sometimes seasonal farmer i d rather plant and hope the rains will improve so i can have something to eat farmer sikhumbuzo mlilo says he has been threatened with eviction by the government zimbabwe s food scarcity problems however are not recent once a regional breadbasket the country over the past 10 years has been hit by rising food insecurity partly due to the fast track land reform programme that saw a drop in agricultural production mainly of dairy beef and wheat 191128194417897 while those who took over the white owned farms have contributed significantly to the domestic consumption of corn production remains insufficient to build up a store of grain reserves and now even some of the resettled face eviction in the southern district of umguza an area 500km 311 miles south of the capital where some of the earliest resettlements took place sikhumbuzo mlilo and his partner buyiswa moyo live on a plot apportioned from a white owned commercial farm the pair who have been farming the land since 2000 allege that in october they were issued with an eviction notice we need to eat so we can survive but if they tell us to leave this land after being here for so long how do we plant our crops where are supposed to go and find new land he told al jazeera the 44 year old said the order made an already tough situation even worse for his farming dependent family last season we did not reap much from the harvest because the rains came late so we ve had to buy maize meal in town but now it s so expensive it s hard for us he added we just can t afford it following the toppling of mugabe after 37 years in power mnangagwa pledged to end eviction of white commercial farmers while maintaining there was no going back on land reform though seldom eviction of white farmers still occurs while resettled black farmers who are not productive on their land have been warned of expulsion mlilo denies underutilisation and suggests the plots of those threatened with expulsion could be earmarked for a larger farming project for those with money and good government connections a fear also echoed by other resettled farmers since the land seizures zimbabwe depends on production by subsistence farmers to provide the bulk of its maize needs but local wheat production is inadequate as a result the country suffers from a cereal deficit with current production falling short of 761 000 metric tonnes needed for 2019 20 according to regional statistics from the un office for humanitarian affairs cereals and pulses such as wheat and soya beans are largely imported but due to chronic shortages of foreign currency the government has struggled to pay for importation which has resulted in periodic shortages of bread and cooking oil government approved prices for basic goods often do not match those in supermarkets meanwhile over the past year the price of bread has increased more than four times as bakers and millers struggle to keep pace with the quickly eroding value of the local currency against the us dollar

zimbabweans despite regular adjustments of civil servants salaries the wages have not been aligned to the exchange rate and that has been the major challenge which we are gradually addressing he said there is a challenge when it comes to food security and that is why we have put a flash appeal to the united nations when we talk of people going hungry we are literally talking about food on the table and this is a direct impact from the drought and this has stretched government s social protection programme nokusila ndlovu goes without food to make sure her children have enough to eat making a regional version of doughnuts when bread becomes too expensive in an effort to combat escalating prices the government has launched the national bakeries programme a series of community initiatives around the country where entrepreneurs use wood fired ovens to make a cheaper version of bread the lower standard of homemade bread has not caught on however as the small bakeries struggle to produce enough to compete with bigger competitors 190902192154717 instead of buying bread nokusila ndlovu 27 an unemployed mother of four who lives on the outskirts of bulawayo has resorted to making vetkoeks

by shaun richards if we were to step back in time to when the new qe era began around a decade ago we would not find any central bankers expecting us to be where we are now in a way that is summarised by the fact that the original qe pamphlet of the bank of england from the charlie bean tour of the summer of 2009 has a not found at this address description on the website these days or if we look back this speech from policymaker david miles finishes like this concluding david miles says that quantitative easing will assist spending but also notes it is hard to decide what the appropriate scale of purchases is when the power of the mechanisms at work are difficult to gauge he also notes that the timing and means of reversing this monetary easing will depend on the economic outlook which in turn depends on conditions in financial markets in general and with banks in particular as to the reversing we are still waiting as all we have had is more more more as we note that despite record highs for equity and bond markets financial market conditions are apparently still not good enough switching to the real economy we see that in fact we are back in something of a trough right now we discovered yesterday that the uk is flat lining and we know the euro area is similar and the united states has been slowing down as well the new york fed staff nowcast stands at 0 6 for 2019 q4 and 0 7 for 2020 q1 the numbers are annualised to that we can add japan which faces the impact of the rise in the consumption tax to 10 this quarter next and in some ways most revealingly is the way that qe has acquired a new name in japan it has morphed into qqe or quantitative and qualitative easing at the time purchases of equities and commercial property began since then it has become qqe with yield curve control we await to see if the review being conducted by president lagarde leads to changes at the ecb but we do know this about the us federal reserve from cnbc on the 8th of october powell stressed the approach shouldn t be confused with the quantitative easing done during and after the financial crisis this is not qe in no sense is this qe he said in a question and answer session after the speech the reality is that it fulfils the description of david miles above in the case of the treasury bill purchases with the difference that they have a shorter maturity although of course back then qe was not meant to be long term the bank of england looks ahead last night andrew hauser who is the executive director looked at the state of play before the financial crisis our balance sheet was modest at 4 of gdp since then and in direct response to the crisis that figure has risen to around 30 a more than seven fold increase he then looks ahead and point one covers a lot of ground to say the least the first is that judged by historical standards big balance sheets are here to stay that s not a prediction that qe will never unwind it will but we have a bigger responsibility than we did to provide liquidity to the system in good times and bad and to a wider set of organisations to maintain financial stability and that s not going away it was nice of him to give us a good laugh about it being permanent at least i hope he was joking the liquidity mention doffs it cap to some extent to the mess that the us federal reserve has got itself into as well as the fact that changes to the structure of the system such as banks being required to have more capital have put increased pressure on this area the next point meanders a bit but we eventually get to an estimate of circa 200 billion for a qt target or objective we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us point two is that big doesn t mean outsized so the balance sheet will eventually shrink from where it is today that s something the bank has been stressing for some time but the discussion paper has allowed us to put a tighter range on that forecast and suggests our liabilities probably only need to be half the size they are today to carry out our mission once qt is underway ah eventually also some would think the sort of sum he is thinking of is indeed outsized point three contains some welcome honesty neither we nor the firms who use our liquidity really know what their demand will be when conditions normalise finally we have this the final message therefore is that we must have as our ultimate goal an end state framework that can cope with that ambiguity without shaking itself and us to bits how much the bank of england balance sheet is more than just qe three quarters of the bank s assets is in the form of a loan to the asset purchase facility backing 435bn of gilt holdings and 10bn of corporate bonds while another 127bn has been lent to banks under the term funding scheme a further 13bn of liquidity has been extended under the so called index linked term repo facility part of the sterling monetary framework smf nearly all of that activity has been financed by an increase in central bank reserves he does not point it out but this structure led to another consequence which is that the term funding scheme and some smaller factors adds to the official definition of the national debt raising it by around 8 of gdp hard astern captain i have long considered the bank of england course reversal plan to be unwise and perhaps stupid first the mpc does not intend to begin qt until bank rate has risen to a level from which it could be cut materially if required the mpc currently judges that to be around 1 5 second qt will be conducted over a number of years at a gradual and predictable pace chosen by the mpc in light of economic and financial market conditions at the time third the qt path will take account of the need to maintain the orderly functioning of the gilt and corporate bond markets including through liaison with the debt management office and fourth the qt path can be amended or reversed as required to achieve the inflation target comment frankly the very concept of the bank of england raising interest rates as high as 1 5 is laughable under the present stewardship i have long thought that the plan as described above demonstrates that there is no real intention to reverse qe there are former policymakers who explicitly endorse this such as david blanchflower but there are also implicit issues such as waiting for yields to rise and prices to fall as well as thinking there can be an orderly market when the biggest holder sells when you intervene in a market on such a large scale there is always going to be trouble exiting one answer to that is to not get too exposed in the first place and to me selling when others might be selling because of losses as well is classic ivory tower thinking none of that is andrew hausers fault as he is in this regard merely a humble functionary so we shuld thank him for his thoughts that even if qe somehow was teleported away things would still be different bringing all this together our conversations with firms suggest the current sterling pmrr is of the order of 150 250bn meanwhile if livesquawk are correct switzerland might be adding more not less extraordinary monetary action also the original reason was external swiss franc whereas now it seems to have spread oxley said there is good reason to take the snb s forecasts seriously it has not tended to change its policy stance in the past unless its inflation forecast foresees deflation at some point over its three year horizon if the bank crosses the deflationary rubicon again this would lend support to our below consensus view that the bank will end up cutting the policy rate to 1 00pct in the first half of 2020

brexit uncertainty causes london to fall to 140th in global rankings down 94 places since the 2016 referendum brits travelling and working abroad will find japan switzerland and turkmenistan particularly expensive due to comparably weak pound contributor steven kilfedder production manager eca international a weak german economy and a strong us dollar deliver a double hit to eurozone countries with only 8 locations remaining in the top 100 compared to 22 in 2014 north american locations account for almost a third of the top 100 most expensive locations compared to only nine in 2014 eca international eca latest cost of living report has revealed that cities in the uk dropped eight places on average over the last 12 months with central london 140th posting its lowest ever position in the global rankings according to the report continuing uncertainty surrounding brexit and the fallout from the us china trade war has had a negative impact on value of the pound making it cheaper for visitors and international expats working and living in the uk the decline of cost of living in central london which has seen the location fall 130 places from its highest recorded position of 10th in 2007 means that it is now more expensive for british expats to travel to the us australia and certain non eurozone locations steven kilfedder production manager at eca international said the uk is the cheapest it has been for foreign workers but figures suggest that this is not leading to an influx of investment because of the uncertainty over brexit meanwhile it has become more expensive for uk firms to send staff abroad while uncertainty may decrease after the election and push up the value of pound there could be years of complicated trade talks ahead so expect the uk to see more fluctuations in the ranking in years to come conversely a weakened euro combined with slow growth particularly in germany which narrowly avoided recession has seen almost all eurozone locations drop in rankings with seven locations tumbling out of the top 100 including major european cities such as the hague lyon rome berlin and munich despite dublin dropping 10 places in the global rankings ireland s capital remains in the top 100 87th ahead of all uk cities including central london 140th edinburgh 156th and manchester 162nd in contrast some european locations outside of the eurozone saw significant rises in the relative cost of living as russian and ukrainian locations registered big rises kiev 198th witnessed the biggest increase in europe rising 38 places over the last 12 months whilst moscow 114th and st petersburg 168th increased their ranking 29 and 24 places respectively meanwhile switzerland continues to have the highest cost of living in europe with four locations in the top 10 making the country one of the most expensive locations in the world for businesses to send brits a strong performance from the us dollar has seen all us locations rise by an average of 18 places with eight locations featured in the top 50 and new york returning to the global top 20 for the first time in four years global top 20 most expensive locations for expatriates north america dominates top 100 most expensive locations in the world the continuing strength of the us dollar has seen all locations in the us increase by an average of 18 places with new york 15th and honolulu 20th in hawaii both entering the global top 20 this continues a trend which has seen 28 us locations enter the top 100 compared to just five in 2014 canadian locations also saw big increases rising 20 places on average with vancouver 91st and ottawa 96th returning to the top 100 toronto 101st and montreal 124th remain outside the top 100 but did increase 23 and 12 places respectively north america now accounts for almost a third of the top 100 most expensive locations in the world with 30 cities located in either the usa or canada overtaking asia which has 28 the continent s strong performance has also seen seven european locations drop out of the top 100 most expensive in eca s cost of living ranking kilfedder said the strength of the us dollar has made the us more expensive for workers and businesses looking to move to the country with 28 cities in the top 100 more than five times as many as five years ago on the other hand us companies are benefitting from the cheaper cost of sending staff abroad to locations in europe and china weak australian dollar sees all australian cities drop in ranking while sydney 79th and melbourne 94th still rank in the top 100 the average cost of living has continued to fall across australia with perth 113th brisbane 118th and canberra 120th all dropping out of the global top 100 however the cost of living in these cities is still more expensive than major european capitals including central london 140th madrid 150th and lisbon 158th harare cost of living continues to fluctuate dropping 159 places in 12 months the zimbabwean capital harare saw the biggest drop in ranking over the last 12 months dropping 159 places to 206th the mix of high inflation and depreciating currency after the reintroduction of the zimbabwean dollar has seen the cost of living for foreigners in harare has fluctuated over the last five years peaking at 47th place in 2018 elsewhere in africa the egyptian capital cairo 208th saw the biggest increase rising 38 places whilst the continent s highest cost of living can be found in kinshasa 19th in the democratic republic of the congo kilfedder said in june the zimbabwean government reintroduced the dollar which had been abandoned in 2009 during the last bout of hyperinflation and banned foreign currency being used as legal tender in in the hope that this would stabilise the economy unfortunately the currency lost half of its value against the euro in the first three months and inflation has continued to soar tel aviv enters the top 10 for the first time as middle east locations see increases locations in the middle east all rose in the rankings except for erbil in iraq 189th and jerusalem 12th in israel increasing 11 places on average a strong performance from the shekel has seen tel aviv enter the top 10 most expensive locations for the first time this continues a trend that has seen the city ranking rise a little in each of the last five years from 22nd to 9th now muscat in oman saw the biggest increase rising 37 places to 97th whilst abu dhabi 40th entered the top 50 for the first time israeli cities have been slowly rising up our ranking for the last five years thanks to the strength of the local economy boosting the shekel and making the country more expensive for expatriates added kilfedder hong kong falls to third most expensive location in asia remains sixth most expensive in the world cost of living in hong kong remains steady retaining its position as the sixth costliest location in the world however the region has slipped from second to third in asia following a strong performance by the yen seeing tokyo rise six places to second place in the world meanwhile singapore frequently seen as a rival to hong kong s claim as being asia s premier financial hub saw its ranking increase five places to 13th eleven places higher than five years ago in 2014 kilfedder said hong kong s place in the rankings has remained stable this year with the city continuing to be the sixth most expensive location in the world for expatriates despite the ongoing socio political upheavals and the fact that the economy is in recession we have yet to see a real impact in the cost of living in the city inflation remains high relative to many other locations that occupy the upper reaches of our rankings indeed hong kong has only been overtaken by tokyo due to the strong performance of the japanese yen throughout 2019 which has moved many japanese cities up the rankings furthermore we expect prices in japan to increase further owing to the recent increase in consumption tax while next year s olympics in tokyo are likely to have further inflationary effects as such we expect tokyo to remain above hong kong into 2020 added kilfedder cost of living in thailand increases sees bangkok entering the top 50 for the first time a strong performance by the baht has seen all thai locations increase by an average of 42 places with bangkok rising 43 places to 47th this continues an upwards trend in cost of living which has seen the thai capital rise 114 places in the last five years kilfedder explained bangkok long seen as a cheap destination for holidaymakers and businesses alike has seen a huge rise in the cost of living for people from other countries over the past few years the strong economy has pushed up the value of the thai baht and made the country more expensive for expatriates we have seen thai cities moving significantly up the rankings over the past few years bangkok has moved up 75 places in the last two years alone and chiang mai has moved up 56 places in the same period

to factory owners and that machines impoverished workers he had a point many of the early machines undercut the costs of the home working artisanal producers the new factories were not only much more productive but the equipment could be operated by young often very young newly trained workers although some artisans did find work in the new factories their wages were often lower in subsequent waves of the industrial revolution the benefits of automation were more clearly spread but the broader benefits did not stop workers from objecting generally through strikes rather than by smashing machines some of the more colourful strikes included 1900 new york streetlamp lighters strike policemen tried climbing up and lighting the gas lamps but children went along behind them turning them off again policemen tried climbing up and lighting the gas lamps but children went along behind them turning them off again 1926 the general strike an attempt to prevent lower pay and worsening

operators strike office workers either had to climb the stairs of the empire state building it has 102 floors or go home the owners brought forward plans to install automated lifts office workers either had to climb the stairs of the empire state building it has 102 floors or go home the owners brought forward plans to install automated lifts 1958 us longshoremen s campaign against containerisation a resolution was agreed with unions but the global introduction of shipping containers could not be stalled a resolution was agreed with unions but the global introduction of shipping containers could not be stalled 1968 us telephone operators strike 160 000 operators refused to place calls but automated boards were already sufficiently widespread to enable management and their allies to handle most calls none of these strikes could stall the adoption of new technology indeed they often had the opposite effect encouraging owners to accelerate automation the sector that has seen the greatest change from the introduction of machinery has been agriculture from the 1930s to the 1960s the share of farms using tractors rose from 17 to 80 with a parallel collapse in the use of horses without horses to feed and groom farmers saw their productivity rise by 30 improved ploughing sowing and automation of the food manufacturing chain brought further leaps in productivity between 1870 and 2015 the percentage of the us population working in agriculture fell from 46 to just 1 you ve never had it so good obviously periods of adjustment to new working practices were distressing for those whose skills had been superseded many especially the old struggled to fit into the new economy overall however society benefited technology brought electric light cheaper food and the opportunities of travel it took much of the drudgery out of housework and laundry displaced gas lamp lighters farmhands buggy drivers and housemaids often found new roles in more salubrious conditions new products produced by technology spawned entirely new industries cars and aeroplanes stimulated the development of tourism and road haulage nearly half of current american employment is in jobs that simply did not exist in 1870 technology also eventually improved incomes the productivity gains from the second industrial revolution from 1870 through to 1914 led to rapidly rising real wages across much of society this trend continued for most of the 20th century strong returns from equity markets show that capitalists continued to reap the financial benefits too those who adapted better to the change tended to be the better educated and those able to learn new skills this effect led to class which used to be defined by job manual labour professional coming to be defined by educational level degree or no degree chart explosion of average wages driven by industrial revolutions source angus maddison s world population gdp and per capita gdp 1 2003 ad chart displays world average gdp per capita 1500 to 2003 the computer age in my own working lifetime technology has continued to have an impact when i first worked in the city i was unusual in having a pocket calculator most offices used slide rules and log tables younger generations struggle to imagine life without computers but you do not have to have been working long to see how the rapidly increasing power and decreasing cost of computers is threatening to put skilled jobs at risk today chart explosion of computing power since 1980 source cielotech wordpress com 05 11 2016 understandably in a time of rapid change people are nervous and it is easy to over simplify as politicians do when they decry lost jobs once proven new technologies will be deployed somewhere even if politicians try to slow their adoption history suggests computers won t make us redundant but there will be winners and losers the uses and limitations of technology technological advances are seeing robotics being applied in a range of new sectors most industrial robots are currently used in automotive manufacturing making repeat movements with metal components improved sensors and smaller robot arms allow automation to be used in sectors such as food handling textiles and even surgery this automation seems mainly of the productivity enhancing type rather than the labour replacing type though some low skilled jobs such as fruit sorting will undoubtedly be lost but the new wave of automation also extends computing power into artificial intelligence it does not mean that computers are starting to think more like people but they are now faster at reaching the same conclusions their growing ability to learn from human generated patterns is powering translation software and the development of things like autonomous driving here again they are often faster than humans but only when faced with patterns they recognise the moravec paradox reflects some of these limitations it tells us that computers are great at doing things we find difficult but can struggle with tasks a toddler can do so they can beat us at chess but can t put the pieces back in the box afterwards they follow rules while we follow patterns the henn na hotel in nagasaki recently disposed of its robots they were waking up guests who were heavy snorers and asking them to repeat their requests recently computer scientists have looked at various jobs and tried to analyse how much they rely on logical processing and how much on value judgment the aspect that computers find hard the idea is not so much that computers should replace humans but supplement them impact of computers on jobs since the 1980s computerisation has widened divisions in the labour market and the distribution of incomes in the us income inequality has increased particularly over the past 20 years blue collar manufacturing workers have been especially affected and this trend will continue the list of at risk trades for the next wave of automation includes farming transportation food preparation retail and construction the number of jobs that require little further education has remained the same catering security guards and so on but workers in professions that require value judgments have become more productive thanks to the support of computing where such value judgments represent the larger part of the job this has sometimes led to higher pay but where the computerisation allows more candidates to qualify for the job pay has tended not to rise job numbers in these areas have all risen as the improved product attracts greater demand sectors where automation may create more jobs than it destroys include healthcare financial and legal services political responses as in the past automation is creating friction perhaps for political convenience attention is being deflected towards china with accusations of unfair trading it is hard to separate the two issues as offshore manufacturing savings increasingly come from automation in those locations rather than simply from low wages tariffs are unlikely to offset them with us unemployment currently low and wage inflation rising we may see this issue as a more modest vote winner in the 2020 elections than it was for trump in 2016 in the 1920s john maynard keynes predicted that productivity would rise eightfold over the next century and that the working week would therefore shrink to 15 hours in fact productivity has risen nine fold but the working week has not shrunk rather than opting for greater leisure as incomes have risen we have found new things to buy the jobs that the new wave of automation challenges may well extend further into white collar than earlier waves politicians threatening to tax robots may have misunderstood the situation computing power is hard to tax and there is little point in slowing the use of robots in manufacturing unless the chinese and others promise to do so too many jobs will be challenged many of our children and grandchildren will need to retrain mid career some have argued that as wealthier families invest more in their children s education they will cope better with the changing job market than others this seems a strong argument for the state to improve education for all and throughout life as skill levels and adaptability challenges rise social mobility may be further reduced how we invest around these trends in the artemis global select fund automation has been one of our largest investment themes for some time one of our larger investments is a medium sized osaka based business little known among investors but well known in retail and distribution as the global leader in warehouse automation while we remain excited about technical developments in this area it has been a poor performer over recent years as the us china trade dispute has made multinational companies slow to implement their capital investment plans this however is merely delaying the inevitable companies with global supply chains are recognising the need to revisit and extend their plans for automation to help reduce offshore manufacturing costs and accommodate recently introduced tariffs it is unlikely that president trump intended to stoke a boom in the automation sector where most of the leading companies are japanese but we hope to thank him for it despite sales of advanced automation being sluggish most of our investments across the rest of the portfolio continue to benefit from technological change most obviously companies in our online services theme are driven by increased computing power especially chip design companies in our screen time theme we invest in companies that connect digital networks in scientific equipment we invest in makers that are using big data to anticipate changing consumer trends most of the companies we invest in use modern technology to plan and drive their growth for some companies the threats and challenges seem larger than the opportunities we are for instance avoiding the banking sector at present some banks have cleaned up their balance sheets and are finally seeing some loan growth but the traditional banking model faces challenges from new financial operators using low cost technology based systems banks are trying to keep up with modern technologies but institutional sluggishness and the concern of cannibalising existing profit centres often hold them back conclusion we are investing during a period of unusually rapid technological change companies that make the most of the opportunities will no doubt thrive and provide strong investment returns for years to come we suspect those that can t should be avoided even when they look cheap technology does not depend on economic cycles nor particularly on trade deals we hope our politicians will embrace the technological advances and anticipate the various challenges and pressures that may result in the long run a more productive economy can be good for

so that we can understand the financial and banking challenges ahead of us this article provides an historical and technical background but we must first get an important definition right and that is the cause of the periodic cycle of boom and bust the cycle of economic activity is not a trade or business cycle but a credit cycle it is caused by fractional reserve banking and by banks loaning money into existence the effect on business is then observed but is not the underlying cause modern banking has its roots in england s bank charter act of 1844 which led to the practice of loaning money into existence commonly described as fractional reserve banking fractional reserve banking is defined as making loans and taking in customer deposits in quantities that are multiples of the bank s own capital case law in the wake of the 1844 act having more regard for the status quo as established precedent than for the fundamentals of property law ruled that irregular deposits deposits for safekeeping were no different from a loan judge lord cottenham s ruling in foley v hill 1848 2 hlc 28 is a judicial decision relating to the fundamental nature of a bank which held in effect that the money placed in the custody of the banker is to all intents and purposes the money of the banker to do with it as he pleases he is guilty of no breach of trust in employing it he is not answerable to the principal if he puts it into jeopardy if he engages in haphazardous speculation this was undoubtedly the most important ruling of the last two centuries on money today we know of nothing else other than legally confirmed fractional reserve banking however sound or honest banking with banks acting as custodians had existed in the centuries before the 1844 act and any corruption of the custody status was regarded as fraudulent this decision has shaped global banking to this day it created a fundamental flaw in the gold backed sound money system whereby the bank of england as a prototype central bank could only issue extra sterling backed entirely by gold while a commercial bank could loan money into existence the drawdown of which created deposit balances the creation of these deposits on a systemwide basis meant that any excesses and deficiencies between banks were easily reconciled through interbank lending bankers groupthink and the credit cycle while an individual bank could expand its balance sheet the implications of all banks doing the same may have escaped the early banking pioneers operating under the 1844 act thus when their balance sheets expanded to a multiple of the bank s own capital there was little cause for concern after all so long as a bank paid attention to its reputation it would always have access to the informal interbank market and so long as it could call in its loans at short notice the duration mismatch between funding by cash deposits and its loan book would be minimized since the bank charter act experience has shown that the expansion of bank credit leads to a cycle of credit expansion overexpansion and then sudden contraction the scale of bank lending was determined by its management with lenders tending to be as much influenced by their own crowd psychology as by a holistic view of risk of course the expansion of bank credit inflates economic activity spreading a warm feeling of improving economic prospects and feeding back into increasing the bankers confidence even further it then appears safe and reasonable to take on yet more lending business without increasing the bank s capital with profits rapidly increasing due to lending being a multiple of the bank s own capital confident bankers begin to think strategically they reduce their lending margins to attract business they believe to be important to their bank s long term future knowing they can expand credit further against a background of improving economic conditions to compensate for lower margins they begin to protect margins by borrowing short from depositors and offering businesses term loans reaping the benefits of a rising slope in the yield curve the availability of cheap finance encourages businesses to enhance their profits in turn by increasing the ratio of debt to equity and by funding expansion through debt by this point a bank is likely to be raking in net interest on loan business amounting to eight or ten times its own capital this means that an interest margin of a net two percent is a 20 percent return to the bank s shareholders there is nothing like profitable success to boost confidence and the line between it and overconfidence is naturally fuzzed by hubris the crowd psychology fueled by a successful banking business leads to an availability of credit too great for decent borrowers to avail themselves of so inevitably credit expansion becomes a financing opportunity for poorly thought out loan propositions having oversupplied the market with credit banks begin to expand their interests in other directions they finance businesses abroad oblivious to the fact that they have less control over collateral and legal redress generally they expand by entering other lines of banking related business assuming that their skills as bankers can be extended into those other business lines profitably a near contemporary example was deutsche bank s failed expansion into global investment banking and principal trading in foreign securities and commodities and who can forget royal bank of scotland s bid for abn amro just as the credit cycle peaked before the last credit crisis at the time when their balance sheets have expanded to many multiples of their own capital the banking crowd finds itself with lending margins too low to compensate for risk bad debts arising from their more aggressive lending decisions begin to materialize one bank beginning to draw in its horns as it perceives it is out on a limb can probably be weathered by the system but other bankers will stop and think about their own risks bearing in mind that operational gearing works two ways operational gearing may be marked by an unexpected event or just an apparent loss of bullish momentum with bad debts beginning to have an impact groupthink quickly takes bankers from being greedy for more business to fearful of it initially banks stop offering circulating credit the overdraft facility that lubricates business activity but when the credit tap is turned off former lending decisions begin to be exposed as bad and investments in foreign lands begin to reflect their true risks lending in the interbank market dries up for the banks with poor or marginal reputations and banks begin to report losses greed turns rapidly to fear the cycle of bank credit expansion then descends into a lending crisis with increasing numbers of banks exposed as having taken on bad loans and becoming insolvent a slump in business activity ensues with frightening rapidity all the hope and hype created by monetary expansion is destroyed by its contraction before central banking evolved into acting as the representative and regulator for licensed banks the credit cycle described above threw up some classic examples overend gurney and company was the largest discount house in the world trading in bills of exchange before it made long term investments and became illiquid when the railway boom faltered in 1866 it collapsed the bank rate rose to 10 percent and there were widespread failures then there was the baring crisis in 1890 poor investments in argentina led to the bank s near bankruptcy the argentine economy slumped as did the brazilian one which had been experiencing its own credit bubble this time a consortium of other banks rescued barings nathan rothschild remarked that if barings hadn t been rescued the entire banking system in london would have collapsed out of barings came the precedent of a central bank acting as lender of last resort famously foreseen and promoted by walter bagehot in the nineteenth century it became clear that crowd psychology in the banks the balance of greed and fear over lending drove a repeating cycle of credit boom and slump with the passage of time bankers recovering their poise from the previous slump forgot its lessons and rhymed the same mistakes all over again analysts promoting theories of stock market cycles and cycles of economic activity need look no further for the underlying cause in the absence of credit expansion businesses would come and go in random fashion the coordinated expansion of credit changed that with businesses being bunched into being created at the same time and then all failing at the same time the process of creative destruction went from unnoticed market evolution to becoming a periodic violent event monetary institutions still ignore the benefits of events being random instead they double down coordinating their interventions on a global scale with the inevitable consequence of making the credit cycle even more pronounced it is a huge mistake to call this repeating cycle a business cycle the name implies that it comes down to the failure of free markets of capitalism when in fact it is entirely due to monetary and credit inflation licensed and promoted by governments and central banks the rise of central banking following the barings crisis of 1890 the concept of a lender of last resort was widely seen to be a solution to the alleged extremes of free markets initially this meant that the bank nominated by the government to represent it in financial markets and to oversee the supply of bank notes took on a role of coordinating the rescue of a bank in difficulty in order to prevent a full blown financial crisis when the gold standard applied however it comprised the practical limitation of a central bank this was the general situation before the first world war but in fact even under the gold standard there was significant inflation of base money occurring in the background between 1850 and 1914 aboveground gold stocks increased from about five thousand tons to nearly twenty four thousand tons not all of it became monetary gold but the amount that did was decided by the economic actors that used money not the monetary planners as is the case today it was against this background that the us federal reserve bank was founded in december 1913 following world war i the federal reserve became a powerful institution under the leadership of benjamin strong those early postwar years were turbulent due to wartime inflationary financing wholesale prices doubled in the us between 1914 and 1920 while the uk s trebled this was followed by a postwar slump and by mid 1921 unemployment in the uk had soared to 25 percent in the us the fordney mccumber tariffs of 1922 restricted european debtors from trading with america which was necessary to pay down their dollar debts a number of countries descended into hyperinflation and the dawes plan designed to bail out the europeans followed in 1924 although america remained on a gold standard britain had suspended it only going back to it in 1925 while the politicians decided overall policy it was left to central bankers such as strong at the fed and montague norman at the bank of england to manage the fallout their relationship was the most tangible evidence of central banks beginning to collaborate in the interests of mutual financial stability with the backing of ample gold reserves strong advocated for price targeting through the management of the money supply particularly following the 1920 21 slump his inflationary policies assisted in the management of the dollar sterling exchange rate supporting sterling which at that time was not backed by gold strong also made attempts to develop a discount market in the us which inflated credit markets further one way and another with the fed following expansionary money policies and commercial bankers becoming more confident in lending prospects monetary inflation fueled what came to be known as the roaring twenties that came to a sharp halt in october 1929 when the credit cycle turned and the stock market crashed top to bottom that month saw the dow fall 35 percent the trigger was congress agreeing to the smoot hawley tariff act on october 30 widely recognized at the time as a suicide note for the economy and markets since it raised trade tariffs to an average of 60 percent from the fordney mccumber average of 38 percent president hoover signed it into law the following june and by mid 1932 wall street had fallen 89 percent with such a clear signal to the bankers it is not surprising that they drew in their horns contracting credit and indiscriminatingly bankrupting their customers all the expansion of bank credit since 1920 was reversed by 1934 small banks went bankrupt in the thousands overwhelmed by bad debts particularly in the agricultural sector as well as through loss of confidence among their depositors the depression of the 1930s overshadowed politics in the capitalist economies for the next forty years instead of learning the lessons of the destruction wrought through cycles of bank credit economists doubled down arguing that more monetary and credit inflation was the solution to help economic sentiment recover keynes favored deficit spending by governments to take up the slack he recommended a move away from savers being the suppliers of capital for investment in favor of the state taking a more active role in managing the economy through deficit spending and monetary inflation the printing of money particularly dollars continued under the guise of gold convertibility with the postwar bretton woods system america accumulated enormous gold reserves by 1957 they amounted to over twenty thousand tons one third of estimated aboveground gold stocks at that time it felt secure in financing first the korean and then the vietnam war by printing dollars for export unsurprisingly this led to the failure of the london gold pool in the late 1960s and to president nixon suspending the fig leaf of dollar convertibility into gold in august 1971 once the dollar was freed from the discipline of gold the repeating cycle of bank credit was augmented by the unfettered inflation of base money a process that has continued to this day
by howard schneider washington reuters federal reserve chair jerome powell has taken a glass half full view of the u s economy but the trouble may be that the glass has gotten smaller and has a few cracks over the next week it risks losing a few drops as deadlines approach for the united states to impose new tariffs on china british voters decide what has been called a nightmare election between far left and far right candidates and other central banks take stock of what seems an increasingly turgid global economy powell offered the upbeat assessment two weeks ago at a speech in rhode island james mccann senior global economist with aberdeen standard investments said the metaphor is apt given the resilience of the u s labor market but only to a point our broad view is that the global economy has a lower speed limit that is setting in and which may constrain the united states even if the trade war eases he said even in emerging markets the speed limit is slowing with china and other large developing countries no longer the dependable props for global demand they were at the end of the 2007 to 2009 economic crisis the federal reserve meets this week and is likely to leave interest rates unchanged after cutting them three times this year policymakers on wednesday will also provide updated projections for the u s economy and interest rates their clearest statement yet of whether they think the rate cuts approved so far are enough to keep the economy rolling for another year in their last set of projections in september policymakers at the median saw the u s economy growing 2 next year roughly at trend and officials have noted that markets that are sensitive to interest rates such as housing and autos have strengthened in october at his last press conference powell spoke of the makings of a possible settlement in the united state s trade dispute with china other sources of trouble such as the possibility of a disruptive hard departure of britain from the european union also seemed less threatening economic analysts looking ahead to next year also have been generally optimistic that 2019 will be seen as the year when growth and trade risks became their most acute with the likelihood of a u s recession now easing still waiting but the global economy is slowing the international monetary fund at its semi annual meeting in october cut its world growth forecasts for this year and next and said the outlook remained precarious and there s still no deal between the united states and china while u s import levies due to take effect on dec 15 now appear likely to be postponed they are not expected to be canceled outright pushing that set of risks off into 2020 the next round of tariffs is to include many consumer products that have been excluded from the import tax so far to try to limit price rises at the shopping mall on the upside however it appears a long elusive deal to overhaul the nafta trade pact is now in reach with an agreement struck tuesday and lawmakers in the united states mexico and canada all poised to ratify yet as with the up and down negotiations over brexit still unresolved and with the country s political leadership now up for grabs the weeks since powell s last press conference have shown how shaky any forecast may be that depends on elected officials to lower political risk uncertainty over trade policy was a key reason the fed cut rates this year worried that businesses were scaling back investment plans to such a degree it could slow the economy overall unless the central bank took steps to counter it since then negotiations have dragged on and in addition trump announced plans for new tariffs on metals from argentina and brazil and threatened them on an array of french products in japan the outlook has taken such a turn that the government rolled out a 120 billion fiscal stimulus program justified by both the short term damage from the trade war and a generically weak outlook for 2020 short step to big slide perhaps the biggest risk is that china s economy will slow regardless of what happens in the trade spat with the united states as chinese officials try to slash the country s debts to more sustainable levels and spending falls as a result we ll likely see overseas growth stagnate for most of 2020 said yoshiki shinke chief economist at japan s dai ichi life research institute other central banks have been acting to try to counter concerns of a sort of creeping stagnation last week s surprisingly strong u s jobs report bolstered the case that the united states was so far immune from much of what may ail the world be it europe s endemic slow growth to the fallout of the very trade war that the united states initiated but bnp paribas chief economist daniel ahn says it is a short step from a worse than expected trade outcome or a bit of bad economic data to the sort of stock market volatility that ends up hurting the broader economy when household wealth takes a hit ahn said he is already expecting monthly u s job growth to slow next year and dip below 100 000 a level fed officials often cite as the breakeven between a labor market absorbing new job market entrants and one that is effectively sidelining people who want to work that could also hurt consumption the economy s key prop at this point and keep u s growth stuck at around 1 through early next year ahn said it would be the sort of material change in the economic outlook that powell has said might prompt more rate cuts bnp is expecting two cuts early next year sentiment may have gotten a little bit ahead of itself ahn said of the broad consensus that the united states and china were poised for a trade breakthrough a conclusion partly based on the notion that president donald trump will want the issue resolved at some point during an election year we think markets should be not quite as sanguine reporting by howard schneider additional reporting by leika kihara in tokyo editing by andrea

world the economics of climate action have improved dramatically since then solar and wind power are now cheaper than coal and increasingly cheaper than natural gas electric vehicle technology has improved so quickly that some major automakers are planning to stop making internal combustion engines knowledge about how to sequester carbon in trees and soil as well as industrially is advancing rapidly climate solutions are cheaper and more available than ever before at the same time the urgency of the climate crisis is even more stark today more frequent and severe wildfires storms and record heatwaves are devastating communities in the first half of 2019 such events displaced a record 7 million people climate change is disrupting lives and livelihoods with the poorest hit hardest new studies show that even half a degree of warming can lead to millions more people being impacted and much greater economic damage inaction or inadequate action will mean more lives lost mass migration major economic disruptions and worsening inequality the growing urgency of the climate crisis and the more favorable economics of climate action together show the dire need and the incredible opportunity for bold climate action it is increasingly clear that low carbon and resilient economic growth can be an engine to help revitalize global growth contribute to poverty reduction generate jobs and income opportunities all while vigorously countering growing climate risks see box and the public is waking up to the urgency and the opportunity of action more than 7 million people in 185 countries took to the streets last september to demand that their governments step up climate action but there is resistance from vested interests in the old economy that resistance is quick to latch on to the limitations of any climate policies that do not put people first where there are genuine concerns by citizens these can and must be addressed social unrest in france chile ecuador and elsewhere has shown that climate action is only politically viable if it delivers clear benefits to the vast majority of people now and it cannot leave vulnerable communities or workers behind to be politically viable corrective measures must accompany any policies that may place a higher burden on low and middle income households the process of developing and implementing these policies is just as important a transparent and deliberative process can help identify political and material risks improve communication between decision makers and the public and give agency to socially and economically marginalized groups fortunately there is ample evidence showing that policies that address climate change developed through inclusive processes can also deliver immediate benefits to people we call this people centered climate action people centered climate action does three things through an inclusive process it purposefully identifies and unlocks social and economic benefits it targets these benefits to further equity and it ensures a just and well managed transition away from a high carbon economy examples of people centered climate action include using the revenues from carbon pricing or savings from cuts in fossil fuel subsidies to support low income or vulnerable communities employing innovative financing to boost energy access through distributed solar power and restoring ecosystems in ways that also raise rural incomes the transition to a low carbon and climate resilient economy is starting the finance sector is waking up to the risks of high carbon and stranded fossil fuel assets and is rapidly shifting away from them toward green alternatives over 700 major businesses have committed to science based targets for emissions reductions with many now aiming for net zero emissions by 2050 over 100 cities have committed to net zero targets investors are considering how their actions can support rather than hamper inclusive development and a just transition these private sector and sub national leaders are now calling on national governments to follow their lead some governments have committed to mid century net zero emission goals and so far 68 countries have indicated that they will enhance their paris agreement targets in 2020 but these countries are mostly smaller economies often those most vulnerable to climate impacts and together are responsible for only 8 of global emissions leaders of some of the world s major emitter economies are hesitating at a time when they should instead be accelerating action amidst signs of a global economic slow down some leaders are falling back on outdated notions that there is a trade off between climate action on one hand and economic and social progress on the other those resisting the low carbon transition are quick to resurface these notions but as the global transition to a new climate economy progresses the political and policy grip of those with vested interests in the old economy such as the fossil fuel sector will wane they will increasingly be counter balanced by voices from the new climate economy solar companies and consumer goods companies committed to deforestation free supply chains for example central to this rising chorus are the youth and voting public demanding climate action people around the world are also crying out for more equal access to decently paid jobs for health care and education and for a better future for their children the world now stands at a crossroads we can and must deliver both ambitious climate action and better lives for people and there is no viable alternative growth and development benefits will only be sustainable if we tackle climate change and ambitious climate action is only possible if it delivers benefits for people we must take the leap and with people firmly at the center accelerate the transition to the inclusive and sustainable growth story of the 21st century the need for bold and inclusive climate action is more apparent than ever globally we have made remarkable progress in tackling poverty in recent decades due in significant part to robust economic growth despite population growth nearly 1 1 billion fewer people live in extreme poverty today than in 1990 but continued progress is being compromised by growing economic inequality in some countries today the world s 26 wealthiest people own as much in financial assets as the entire poorer half of humanity while unemployment fell in 2018 most of the world s 3 3 billion employed people have jobs that do not offer a decent living economic security or workplace protections as a result people are taking to the streets to call for decent jobs health care and education and for a better future for their children at the same time communities are increasingly facing the devastating impacts of climate change from increasingly severe and frequent storms to hot and dry conditions that fuel wildfires droughts and crippling heatwaves it is the poorest who are most vulnerable to these impacts often lacking the resources to adapt or move they are also often those who have contributed the least greenhouse gas emissions climate change is unfair poor people tend to live in the areas most vulnerable to climate change about 14 of people in developing countries live in low lying coastal zones nearly 29 of the world s population lives in arid regions these communities are particularly susceptible to droughts and floods climate change disproportionately hurts the young and the old and it exacerbates gender inequity as women are usually responsible for fetching water and gathering firewood tasks that climate change makes much harder the more the world falls behind the temperature goals of the paris agreement the more we will see climate impacts hampering development and economic progress we have already witnessed about 1 degree celsius 1 8 f of global warming and by 2030 we are likely to have missed our last chance of meeting the 1 5oc goal for millions of people a half degree change in average global temperature rise makes a world of difference on a planet 1 5 oc warmer 14 of the population will be exposed to extreme heatwaves at least once every five years at 2 oc that rises to 37 of people those who have no choice but to face the heat people who labor outside people without air conditioning bear the brunt of this burden approximately 820 million people worldwide live in coastal areas less than 10 meters 33 feet above sea level more than 10 of the world s population sea level rise has recently accelerated as the warming ocean expands and polar ice sheets melt as a result it is expected that rising seas could impact three times more people by 2050 than previously estimated with 2oc of warming farmers fishing communities and food security will suffer further maize crop losses and fishery declines from climate change will be double those expected from 1 5oc of warming climate action can deliver social and economic benefits with careful design and implementation inclusive climate policies can contribute to higher incomes and living standards more and better jobs and more resources for governments to provide public goods and services other benefits include improved services and infrastructure for deprived populations cleaner air and water better health and protection from the loss of life and livelihoods that accompanies extreme weather research by the new climate economy finds that bold climate action can deliver at least 26 trillion in net global economic benefits through 2030 compared to business as usual as well as a range of employment health and other benefits the social and economic benefits of climate mitigation policies include higher income and living standards clean infrastructure investment is a springboard for rapid gains in incomes poverty reduction and energy access especially in developing countries as well as gains in global equity rapid innovation and the growing cost competitiveness of clean energy make it possible to quickly expand infrastructure for energy access without increasing air pollution efficiency gains in energy and materials use

employment gains cutting carbon emissions increases jobs in green industries while decreasing jobs in high carbon ones in 2018 the renewable energy sector employed at least 11 million people worldwide and is the fastest growing source of jobs in several countries transitioning to a low carbon economy could deliver up to 65 million new low carbon jobs by 2030 more than offsetting a decline of 28 million in high carbon sectors such a significant restructuring of labor markets requires strong labor protections to ensure these jobs are decent and pay appropriate wages countries will need to implement strong proactive policies to assist and help reskill workers in declining sectors and support economic diversification in highly affected communities cutting carbon emissions increases jobs

pollution the global welfare costs of air pollution were estimated to be about 3 trillion in 2015 doubling renewables in the global energy mix by 2030 could save up to 4 million lives since people with lower incomes are typically more exposed to local air pollution they may benefit more from its reduction a gain for social equity moving to plant based diets which are less carbon intensive could also yield large public health benefits particularly in developed and emerging economies where high levels of meat and dairy consumption contribute to poor health outcomes including high rates of heart disease burning fossil fuels creates harmful indoor and outdoor air pollution the global welfare costs of air pollution were estimated to be about 3 trillion in 2015 doubling renewables in the

transport clean infrastructure investments like distributed solar power can also benefit the poor by increasing energy access lowering costs and reducing air pollution and health risks revenues from

natural environment many climate policies contribute to a healthier natural environment for example by reducing deforestation and pollution healthier natural environments can better provide ecosystem services which are the essential support systems for life on earth and the economy and most importantly avoiding environmental damage will benefit all people but particularly the poor and vulnerable people centered climate action is possible solving the climate crisis in an unequal world will require people centered climate action policies that unlock the potential social benefits of climate action policies that address the needs of low income and disadvantaged groups and enhance social equity policies that ensure a well managed and socially just transition with these attributes people centered climate action can gain the public support and political buy in required to make significant and lasting change climate action that exacerbates inequalities on the other hand will not succeed there are emerging examples of people centered climate action in a range of sectors and countries including in spain after intense social dialogue the government struck a deal with trade unions in 2018 to phase out the country s coal industry the plan includes a just transition for coal producing regions with the government pledging 250 million 278 million over the next decade toward professional training social protection and new economic opportunities after intense social dialogue the government struck a deal with trade unions in 2018 to phase out the country s coal industry the plan includes a just transition for coal producing regions with the government pledging 250 million 278 million over the next decade toward professional training social protection and new economic opportunities in canada the 2019 federal carbon tax will return revenues to households and businesses so that most low and middle income households are financially better off with the carbon tax than without it the 2019 federal carbon tax will return revenues to households and businesses so that most low and middle income households are financially better off with the carbon tax than without it costa rica has halted and reversed deforestation while boosting incomes for rural communities the government implemented a series of progressive long term policies including ending cattle subsidies while paying farmers and landowners for ecosystem services provided by their protected land has halted and reversed deforestation while boosting incomes for rural communities the government implemented a series of progressive long term policies including ending cattle subsidies while paying farmers and landowners for ecosystem services provided by their protected land china established a 15 billion fund for retraining reallocation and early retirement of the estimated 5 6 million people who would be laid off as a result of eliminating coal or steel sector overcapacity established a 15 billion fund for retraining reallocation and early retirement of the estimated 5 6 million people who would be laid off as a result of eliminating coal or steel sector overcapacity the kenya based green belt movement has planted millions of trees on degraded land since the 1970s it was founded with explicit goals to improve rural women s lives and livelihoods responding to their need for water food firewood and increased incomes opportunities for people centered climate mitigation this section identifies opportunities for people centered climate action in the key sectors of energy cities and food and land use 1 energy progress in clean energy technologies is transforming our ability to expand access to electricity in ways that also limit air pollution and carbon dioxide co2 emissions this progress is also rapidly reducing costs since 2010 solar panel costs have fallen by 85 and wind power by 49 making clean energy cost competitive with coal and increasingly with natural gas in many regions it would now be cheaper to replace three quarters of existing u s coal plants with wind and solar power than to keep them operating with coal and with falling costs and new developments around battery storage technologies and integration into the grid solutions to the variable supply of renewables are emerging however even the more advanced g7 economies on average produce 19 of their electricity from coal and they provide at least 100 billion per year in subsidies to the coal oil and gas industries slowing the market driven transition it is time for policymakers and investors to focus on clean energy solutions and stop subsidizing coal despite policy barriers the deployment of renewables and the accompanying jobs is accelerating in many regions of the world in the u s alone clean energy employs nearly 3 3 million people outnumbering jobs in the fossil fuel industry 3 to 1 however these are not always good jobs with decent wages benefits and rights at work governments and employers need to do more to ensure job quality some already are the pledge for a just transition to decent jobs encourages renewable energy developers producers and buyers to commit to employment standards including social dialogue labor standards of the international labor organization ilo and social protection for their employees and those of their contractors enel ørsted autodesk safaricom and unilever are among the companies that have signed the pledge in the philippines the green jobs act of 2016 included provisions on workers rights and fair incomes to protect workers in green industries distributed renewable energy systems are quickly creating new opportunities for energy access in developing countries for instance in 2017 off grid solutions provided electricity access to 152 million people up from 20 million in 2011 off grid solar home systems are spreading quickly in some places offering affordable access to limited amounts of electricity for example in many african countries commercial companies are using a pay as you go model to rent solar home systems to consumers who use their mobile phones to make payments until they own the system m kopa one of the biggest companies estimates that each household saves 650 in avoided kerosene costs over the first four years some clean energy opportunities have spurred an increase in women s participation in the energy sector in nigeria tanzania and uganda the women led social enterprise solar sister has built a network of over 2 500 women entrepreneurs that provides clean energy services to more than 350 000 people 2 cities around 900 million people worldwide live in slums without adequate access to water sanitation power and other infrastructure services they are often located in far flung locations exposed to natural hazards compact connected and clean cities can support inclusive growth and broad based improvements in quality of life with major benefits for economic productivity and emissions reduction new analysis conducted for the coalition for urban transitions shows that implementing low carbon measures in cities could support 87 million jobs in 2030 in sectors such as clean energy and public transport furthermore low carbon measures in cities could deliver over half the emission reductions needed to keep global temperature rise below 2 c agglomeration economies mean that the productivity of workers and businesses is higher in larger more densely populated cities particularly those with good public transport networks that enable people to easily reach jobs and services greater compactness allows cities to provide infrastructure and services more cost effectively in sub saharan africa for example the capital costs of providing piped water flush toilets power and landline telephones average 325 per person in the highest density cities but 665 in medium density cities and up to 2 837 in remote rural areas it is estimated that the low carbon investments needed to reduce urban emissions by 90 could collectively pay for themselves and then generate a stream of savings worth 23 9 trillion by 2050 in today s terms higher urban density can also reduce greenhouse gas emissions by cutting transport and residential energy consumption a recent analysis of 120 cities finds that after controlling for per capita income a 10 increase in urban density correlates with a 2 decrease in per capita carbon emissions urban planning and infrastructure policies play a key role in promoting productive urbanization in their absence market failures and bad policies in particular failures to provide critical public goods often contribute to unmanaged sprawl lowered economic productivity growth of slums over reliance on private motor vehicles severe congestion local air pollution inefficient energy use high greenhouse gas emissions and other negative spillovers urban infrastructure policies that provide for efficient mass public transit systems play a major role in averting many of these dysfunctions as well as improving social equity by providing low cost travel for the poor in medellín colombia a cable car system installed in the mid 2000s provided new transport options for slum dwellers living in favelas surrounding the city the cable car was used by about 30 000 favela residents daily enabling access to job or education opportunities in the city while cutting travel times by an hour on average it contributed to massive declines in violent crime and murders in lagos nigeria a low cost bus rapid transit system carries 200 000 passengers a day who enjoy shorter travel times and reduced fares compared to travel on private minibuses road congestion and traffic accidents along the route are down and co2 emissions have fallen by 13 since 2008 similarly in bogotá colombia the construction of a bus rapid transit system benefited poor residents the most with poor commuters saving 18 minutes per trip and average 0 50 in daily savings 8 12 of the average daily income for bogotá s low income population to lift all boats national governments need to proactively plan for a just urban transition which requires far sighted collaboration with local governments for national leaders creating such cities would yield short term political dividends and secure long term national prosperity 3 food and land use improving agricultural practices and land use is a critical aspect of the interrelated challenges of feeding the world ensuring sustainable rural livelihoods and addressing climate change 820 million people are malnourished and regularly go hungry more than two thirds of the global poor more than 500 million people live in rural areas where they often experience inequitable access to land and resources and poor access to markets which can lead to heavy losses of produce before it s even sold by 2050 the world will need to feed nearly 10 billion people the difference between the amount of food produced in 2010 and the amount needed to feed nearly 10 billion people is estimated at 7 400 trillion calories that s a 56 increase from what we produced in in 2010 but we simply cannot use 56 more land instead we must sustainably increase productivity on current agricultural land to avoid further expansion into natural areas a recent report from the food and land use coalition suggests that key improvements in food and land use systems could indeed improve global food security while at the same time leading to doubled rural income growth and over 120 million new jobs in poor rural communities total economic gains from transforming food and land use systems could reach 5 7 trillion a year by 2030 linked to reduced greenhouse gas emissions preservation of natural capital improved human health and gains in agricultural productivity and food distribution systems so called climate smart agriculture covers a myriad of old and new production systems including holistic landscape farming and techniques ranging from intercropping and integrated crop livestock management to improved water soil and nutrient management done effectively climate smart agriculture can lead to higher productivity that creates better jobs and income for farmers mitigates greenhouse gas emissions and increases climate resilience farmers in niger for example have adopted improved landscape management approaches greatly increasing tree and shrub cover on cropland by interplanting nitrogen fixing trees and allowing roots and stumps to regenerate the strategy has substantially increased productivity on 5 million hectares 12 4 million acres of land restored at least 250 000 hectares 617 763 acres of severely degraded land and provided food for 2 5 million people higher productivity on existing lands reduces the pressure to clear forests forests generate multiple social and economic benefits including improved soil quality habitat for biodiversity and regulation of local and global climates forests support a variety of industries from fiber production to ecotourism protecting forests can go hand in hand with protecting people in bolivia brazil and colombia areas managed by indigenous people with secure land rights had two to three times less annual deforestation from 2000 2012 than similar areas of those countries not managed by indigenous people a shift to healthy plant based diets can also have enormous benefits for people and also for the climate shifting the diets of populations who consume high amounts of animal based foods toward plant based foods could result in global health related cost savings of almost 1 trillion per year by 2050 as well as avoiding future emissions related to changing land use by 37 168 gigatons of equivalent co2 gtco2e opportunities for people centered climate adaptation reducing greenhouse gas emissions is essential to avert the threat of catastrophic climate change yet historic emissions have locked in some global warming and climate change is exacting large human and economic costs through heatwaves floods drought storms and other extreme weather events recent analysis by the global commission on adaptation indicates that an investment of 1 8 trillion between 2020 and 2030 could yield benefits of 7 1 trillion over this period these benefits include avoided losses to farmers livelihoods to workers jobs and wages avoided damage to homes businesses and infrastructure and avoided deaths trauma and illness climate adaptation can especially benefit the poor who tend to live in areas more exposed to natural hazards like landslides or flooding the social gains of adaptation will be greater and more equitable if poor and vulnerable populations participate in the planning and design of public policies contributing unique local knowledge and voicing their specific needs five areas of action should be prioritized to strengthen the resilience of our communities and systems to climate change and in some cases also contribute to reducing emissions 1 strengthen early warning systems flooding affects 250 million people each year with around 84 of floods occurring in developing countries floods cause an average of 5 000 6 000 deaths annually and overall economic costs from deaths and direct and indirect economic damages have been estimated to exceed 70 billion per year with over 80 of these costs in developing countries meteorological early warning systems alongside critical infrastructure e g roads and bridges used for evacuation and environmental buffers e g mangrove forests that protect coasts from storm surges can mitigate much of the damage from natural disasters early warning of an approaching flood gives people time to move to safer ground allows authorities to help the most vulnerable and enables businesses to protect property and infrastructure studies suggest that a 24 hour warning can reduce asset damage from floods by around 30 and a 48 hour warning by up to 50 investments to upgrade early warning systems especially in developing countries are expected to have a high benefit cost ratio a 10 billion investment would yield benefits of around 100 billion between 2020 to 2030 in bangladesh better early warning systems combined with civic awareness campaigns cyclone shelters strengthening buildings and improving post disaster recovery have dramatically reduced deaths from cyclones 300 000 people died from cyclone bhola in 1970 but only 5 in the entire country died from cyclone fani in 2019 2 protect mangrove forests mangrove forests extend along 700 000 kilometers roughly 435 000 miles of coastline in 123 countries forming a natural seawall that limits damage from flooding worldwide mangroves reduce the cost of damage to property from coastal flooding by over 80 billion per year while reducing the number of people affected by coastal floods by 18 million other services provided by mangroves include the provision of raw materials and food for coastal communities nurseries for offshore fisheries and recreation opportunities the benefits of mangrove preservation significantly outweigh the value of forgone opportunities such as aquaculture 3 improve dryland crop production dryland farming refers to farming that relies entirely on rainfall undertaken in relatively dry areas of the world drylands cover 41 of the earth s surface and are home to 30 of the human population including the majority of the world s poor dryland agriculture typically produces low and variable yields because of low and erratic rainfall high temperatures poor soil quality and land degradation especially in developing countries in sub saharan africa crop productivity per unit of water consumed is only 20 40 of the world average climate change will likely exacerbate the challenges of dryland farming in sub saharan africa with even higher temperatures more erratic rainfall and more extreme weather events reducing yields by 10 15 investments to increase the adoption of modern farming technologies and practices optimized for dryland conditions could significantly help poor smallholder farmers in developing areas better adapt to climate change increasing incomes and slashing poverty methods include greater uptake of new crop varieties that provide higher yields with limited water improved soil management and more efficient water management such interventions could boost cereal yields in sub saharan africa by 70 140 globally investing 150 billion in dryland agricultural productivity from 2020 to 2030 could generate net economic benefits of over 850 billion 4 manage water resources the impacts of climate change are channeled primarily through the water cycle improved water management can help countries better adapt to water scarcity and more variable supply water service providers have traditionally relied on gray or built infrastructure such as dams and water treatment plants today the water management sector draws increasingly on green infrastructure such as forests farms and floodplains that can increase the quantity and quality of water downstream the returns for investing in water resource management can be substantial especially for green infrastructure new york city s efforts to protect its watershed have cost 1 5 billion since the 1990s but have averted the need to build new water treatment facilities costing 8 billion yielding a benefit cost ratio of 5 1 green infrastructure is likely to have substantial co benefits including carbon sequestration reduced air pollution and improved health healthier ecosystems and recreation opportunities better planning and incentives could dramatically improve the efficiency of water use the world bank estimates that by 2050 policy reforms in water resource management could increase developing regions gdp by 8 20 relative to a business as usual scenario a participatory approach can ensure that individual people and families benefit in togo the government and civil society organizations engaged local women and youth in developing an ecosystem based project to revitalize water reservoirs and build climate resilience the project improved crop yields and created new livelihood opportunities like market gardening fisheries and brick construction all stemming from greater water availability and security 5 build resilient infrastructure any disruptions to power transport water and other infrastructure systems exact heavy costs on households and businesses the economic damages to households and businesses in low and middle income countries from disruptions of power transport and water systems are estimated at 391 647 billion annually in 2007 tropical storm sidr knocked out the entire power grid of bangladesh leaving the country s population without power for up to a week and causing 1 7 billion of economic losses in tanzania firms suffer losses equal to 1 8 of gdp annually due to power transport and water disruptions of which 40 are caused by rain and floods improving the resilience of infrastructure requires action at several levels physical assets such as roads power lines and bridges need strengthening to resist natural hazards recent studies estimate that improving the climate resilience of new infrastructure assets typically costs 2 5 of the total cost of the assets the cost of such investments would be about 1 1 trillion from 2020 to 2030 the benefits include both avoided damage to physical infrastructure and avoided costs of infrastructure disruptions for households and businesses the present value of such benefits over the lifetime of this resilient infrastructure is estimated at around 5 trillion giving a 5 1 ratio of benefits to costs a new decade demands a new approach policymaking can be painstaking and slow good policymaking can be even slower the trials of the process often cause ministers and decision makers to rely too heavily on input from interest groups with enough power and access to make their voices heard in many cases these vested interests have pushed back against climate action and in favor of the status quo as the transition progresses the political and policy grip of the fossil fuel industry and others blocking change will wane to succeed the global transition to a new climate economy needs to be people centered and offer the prospect of a fairer world if it does more and more people will see their future in it and will support change we have not seen the end of the social unrest that erupted in 2019 but 2020 provides leaders with a unique opportunity to train their gaze and focus on social benefits enhanced equity and a just transition as countries revise their climate plans and scale up implementation we know how to develop smart climate programs and policy reforms that improve people s lives and livelihoods immediately while safeguarding development gains and economic growth into the future we can and must get these programs and reforms right the people are watching this

powell s half full u s glass sturdy but still at risk for spills as fed meets by howard schneider washington reuters federal reserve chair jerome powell has taken a glass half full view of the u s economy but the trouble may be that the glass has gotten smaller and has a few cracks over the next week it risks losing a few drops as deadlines approach for the united states to impose new tariffs on china british voters decide what has been called a nightmare election between far left and far right candidates and other central banks take stock of what seems an increasingly turgid global economy powell offered the upbeat assessment two weeks ago at a speech in rhode island james mccann senior global economist with aberdeen standard investments said the metaphor is apt given the resilience of the u s labor market but only to a point our broad view is that the global economy has a lower speed limit that is setting in and which may constrain the united states even if the trade war eases he said even in emerging markets the speed limit is slowing with china and other large developing countries no longer the dependable props for global demand they were at the end of the 2007 to 2009 economic crisis advertisement advertisement the federal reserve meets this week and is likely to leave interest rates unchanged after cutting them three times this year policymakers on wednesday will also provide updated projections for the u s economy and interest rates their clearest statement yet of whether they think the rate cuts approved so far are enough to keep the economy rolling for another year in their last set of projections in september policymakers at the median saw the u s economy growing 2 next year roughly at trend and officials have noted that markets that are sensitive to interest rates such as housing and autos have strengthened in october at his last press conference powell spoke of the makings of a possible settlement in the united state s trade dispute with china other sources of trouble such as the possibility of a disruptive hard departure of britain from the european union also seemed less threatening economic analysts looking ahead to next year also have been generally optimistic that 2019 will be seen as the year when growth and trade risks became their most acute with the likelihood of a u s recession now easing advertisement advertisement still waiting but the global economy is slowing the international monetary fund at its semi annual meeting in october cut its world growth forecasts for this year and next and said the outlook remained precarious and there s still no deal between the united states and china while u s import levies due to take effect on dec 15 now appear likely to be postponed they are not expected to be canceled outright pushing that set of risks off into 2020 the next round of tariffs is to include many consumer products that have been excluded from the import tax so far to try to limit price rises at the shopping mall story continues on the upside however it appears a long elusive deal to overhaul the nafta trade pact is now in reach with an agreement struck tuesday and lawmakers in the united states mexico and canada all poised to ratify yet as with the up and down negotiations over brexit still unresolved and with the country s political leadership now up for grabs the weeks since powell s last press conference have shown how shaky any forecast may be that depends on elected officials to lower political risk uncertainty over trade policy was a key reason the fed cut rates this year worried that businesses were scaling back investment plans to such a degree it could slow the economy overall unless the central bank took steps to counter it since then negotiations have dragged on and in addition trump announced plans for new tariffs on metals from argentina and brazil and threatened them on an array of french products advertisement advertisement in japan the outlook has taken such a turn that the government rolled out a 120 billion fiscal stimulus program justified by both the short term damage from the trade war and a generically weak outlook for 2020 short step to big slide perhaps the biggest risk is that china s economy will slow regardless of what happens in the trade spat with the united states as chinese officials try to slash the country s debts to more sustainable levels and spending falls as a result we ll likely see overseas growth stagnate for most of 2020 said yoshiki shinke chief economist at japan s dai ichi life research institute advertisement advertisement other central banks have been acting to try to counter concerns of a sort of creeping stagnation last week s surprisingly strong u s jobs report bolstered the case that the united states was so far immune from much of what may ail the world be it europe s endemic slow growth to the fallout of the very trade war that the united states initiated but bnp paribas chief economist daniel ahn says it is a short step from a worse than expected trade outcome or a bit of bad economic data to the sort of stock market volatility that ends up hurting the broader economy when household wealth takes a hit ahn said he is already expecting monthly u s job growth to slow next year and dip below 100 000 a level fed officials often cite as the breakeven between a labor market absorbing new job market entrants and one that is effectively sidelining people who want to work advertisement advertisement that could also hurt consumption the economy s key prop at this point and keep u s growth stuck at around 1 through early next year ahn said it would be the sort of material change in the economic outlook that powell has said might prompt more rate cuts bnp is expecting two cuts early next year sentiment may have gotten a little bit ahead of itself ahn said of the broad consensus that the united states and china were poised for a trade breakthrough a conclusion partly based on the notion that president donald trump will want the issue resolved at some point during an election year we think markets should be not quite as sanguine reporting by howard schneider

if the canadian dollar plunges in value your financial future could be at risk stocks like hydro one ltd tsx h can insulate you from volatility in 2020 several headwinds could force the canadian dollar much lower economists and fund managers believe the risk of a recession is at a multi year high while shifting interest rates and oil prices could have an outsized macroeconomic effect a housing bubble looms large over several major cities while ongoing trade wars threaten the health of the entire economy if the loonie plunges your portfolio could be directly at risk want to insulate yourself from volatility sleep easy with the following stocks bulletproof earnings it s always difficult to predict how a company will be impacted by a falling loonie those that import goods and services are usually negatively impacted because they now need to purchase those items with depreciated dollars those that export goods and services typically benefit because international customers will look to take advantage of their relatively cheaper production costs companies that operate completely in canada can be a mixed bag the biggest thing you can do is make sure a company s earnings stream can remain resilient no matter where the underlying currency heads there s no better example of strength than hydro one hydro one distributes energy in eastern canada with transmission lines covering 98 of ontario almost 100 of its earnings are regulated meaning the government guarantees how much it can charge customers because power demand is incredibly stable from year to year hydro one has one of the most predictable revenue streams in the country the stock currently pays a 3 7 dividend and management targets 5 rate base growth over the next five years this stock may only produce annual returns between 5 and 10 but that s acceptable considering shares may barely be affected even during a difficult recession protected from volatility hydro one isn t the only energy related company in canada that can shield you from both economic and currency volatility enbridge tsx enb nyse enb the largest pipeline operator in north america also fits the bill as a pipeline operator enbridge is in an enviable position pipelines are nearly always the number one choice for oil and gas companies to ship their product they re safer cheaper and faster and because they can cost hundreds of millions of dollars and take years to permit and build there s not much competition enbridge has used this bargaining power to greatly reduce its risk while the vast majority of energy companies earn money based on prevailing commodity prices enbridge charges by volumes so no matter how much a barrel of oil trades for enbridge earns the same amount the energy bear market of 2014 is a prime example that year oil prices fell 50 yet enbridge stock gained in value commodity prices were plummeting but volumes kept rising ensuring the company a healthy profit today enbridge pays an impressive 5 8 dividend and because liquids production in canada is expected to grow through 2030 and beyond the company should continuously grow no matter where the loonie heads
it was almost a year ago when a fed meeting helped send stock indices plunging into bear or near bear territory the fed s decision back then to raise rates for a fourth time in 2018 put new interest rate fear into an already shaky market by christmas eve the s p 500 index spx was down nearly 20 from its september high things couldn t be more different approaching today s fed meeting conclusion when the futures market expects no policy changes and the fed is coming off of three consecutive rate cuts the spx is near all time highs up nearly 25 year to date that shows you just how closely monetary policy can affect wall street the major indices appeared to flatline tuesday and that carried over into wednesday s pre market hours in what looks like a typical pre fed announcement trading atmosphere it s possible the slow direction less type of trading could last much of the day until the fed makes itself heard early this afternoon things were pretty quiet early wednesday on the china tariff front but it s possible any headline on that subject could wake up the market the dec 15 tariff deadline is this sunday and looms large some people think a phase one deal could be announced before that but speculating on timing hasn t worked too often in this long trade war today s data included the november consumer price index cpi which rose 0 3 that was a bit more steep than the 0 2 that analysts had expected but below the 0 4 in october core cpi in november which strips out volatile food and energy prices climbed just 0 2 watching beige paint dry ahead of fed so is today s fed meeting a non event quite possibly the futures market puts chances of a rate move pretty close to zero so there s not a lot of drama ahead of the 2 p m et announcement after that fed chairman jerome powell takes the podium and it s hard to imagine what he could say that might move the market the fed has done such a good job of telegraphing its intentions this time around that it seems like there s little powell could say that people don t already know while there s always the chance something new could come up it wouldn t be surprising to hear him go with another version of we re watching the numbers and that downside economic risk still exists despite recent strong data today s fed decision comes at an interesting juncture where the economy really seems to be hopping the question is what powell and the fed will say about current events like strong holiday sales last week s amazing jobs report and great housing numbers which investors saw confirmed by home builder toll brothers inc tol earnings report earlier this week it might be worth watching for any changes in the statement s wording about the economy compared with what the fed said after its last meeting in the lead up to today s fed announcement trading on tuesday was like watching beige paint dry most major indices traded both sides of unchanged most of the day before a late slide there really wasn t much of a pattern in the sector outcomes some of the defensive sectors rose while others fell and the same goes for cyclicals financials which typically have the most to gain or lose from fed action finished right at the flatline could that be a sign of the lack of excitement ahead of the fed meeting very possible remember this meeting brings an updated dot plot from federal open market committee fomc members mapping out where each of them sees rates going in the years ahead that could be one interesting aspect of the meeting and it s probably worth a close comparison to the last dot plot to get a sense of where fomc officials believe the economy might be headed the fed turned dovish in mid 2019 the dot plot might help chart whether the people making rate decisions expect that to last but it s likely going to show some projections for higher rates and some for lower we ll help you connect the dots so to speak in this afternoon s report stay tuned this afternoon for another market update after the fed decision where we ll discuss the possible market implications or lack of implications of the fed s latest words jets and pickups in corporate news meanwhile boeing co ba announced november new orders tuesday and it didn t look particularly good for the jet maker in fact the data were pretty disappointing with 24 jets delivered but the stock fell less than 1 in general ba shares have held up really well this year considering all the company s been through while you never want to forget the tragic events that occurred it s almost like the stock is made of teflon earlier this year some analysts sounded like they thought investors would give up on ba shares but that just hasn t happened one question does come up will ba shares continue to avoid a selloff if the company freezes its dividend a dividend freeze could be on ba s to do list according to the wall street journal ba raised its dividend 20 last year investors could find out next week what will happen with the payout the newspaper reported speaking of payouts ford motor company f now has a 6 yield the stock is under 10 but when you look at 6 vs the 10 year treasury yield of 1 84 as of late tuesday that s pretty dramatic but keep in mind that a high dividend yield relative to treasuries can sometimes be a signal that a stock is at risk that being said td ameritrade clients were net buyers of ford last month as the company announced plans for an electric f 150 pickup truck according to the investor movement index imxsm the imx is td ameritrade s proprietary behavior based index aggregating main street investor positions and activity to measure what investors actually were doing and how they were positioned in the markets meanwhile td ameritrade clients were net sellers of ford competitor tesla inc tsla which is also in the news with an electric pickup truck however tsla shares have been rolling right along lately with the stock recently hitting 350 a share for the first time in nearly a year so maybe it s not surprising to see some investors taking profit and perhaps moving a few dollars into a beaten down auto stock like ford chart of the day pound out bowling euro this three month chart shows the british pound gbp usd candlestick has moved up against the dollar recently while the euro s eur usd purple line generally marched in place this week brings a european central bank ecb meeting and a uk parliamentary election that could have brexit implications source the thinkorswim platform from td ameritrade for illustrative purposes only past performance does not guarantee future results from cars to beer trade deal s potential beneficiaries auto parts makers consumer products manufacturers a railroad even a beer company those are some of the firms whose stocks might have the most to benefit from an agreement reached between congress and president trump on tuesday to move forward on the united states mexico canada agreement usmca briefing com noted the six publicly traded companies with the most exposure to mexico and canada include american axle holdings axl a maker of auto drivetrain and driveline components and systems railroad company kansas city southern ksu auto parts manufacturer magna international inc mga consumer product maker colgate palmolive company cl molson coors brewing company tap and agricultural manufacturing firm agco corporation agco according to a list from briefing com these companies exposure to mexico and canada range from 24 for agco to 53 for axl all of their stocks might be worth a close watch for any impact but looking at their year to date charts the action is all over the place they definitely don t move in step overall for the market having a deal in place would probably be positive in part because it removes a source of uncertainty markets tend to dislike uncertainty you re all playing for second place now in this space we often discuss the market cap race typically about how apple inc aapl and microsoft corporation msft have been duking it out over the past year to claim the top spot while alphabet inc goog and amazon com inc amzn nip at their heels in the third and fourth spots they all dropped one notch this week with the ipo of saudi aramco in its first day of trading shares climbed to the trading limit up 10 which puts the oil giant s market cap just south of 1 9 trillion aapl and msft have market caps in the 1 2 trillion range and googl and amzn have current values in the 900 billion range in other words the top spot seems to be sewn up for the time being it s worth noting however that saudi aramco s valuation does have a bit of an asterisk in that the small free float only 1 5 of the company was released in the ipo is among the tiniest percentages among all publicly held companies in the world according to bloomberg in contrast independent shareholders control over 80 of each of the top four u s firms some 98 of msft shares are held by the public mvp candidate slumps while faangs still get attention other buckets of stocks have often stolen their thunder this year that includes the online payment companies like paypal holdings inc pypl and square inc sq as well as credit card behemoths the full name for the payment basket is mvp which stands for mastercard inc ma visa inc v and pypl when consumers feel positive about the economy they tend to buy more things with credit some mvp names are doing great but sq has generally has had a tough time since its august earnings report when the company missed analysts expectations for gross payments volume for the second straight quarter and delivered lower than expected earnings per share guidance for q3 earnings in q3 looked more solid with sq beating expectations that s helped shares a bit but they re still down nearly 15 from the 52 week high sq remains very popular in some sectors of the economy most cab drivers seem to use it for instance in this kind of economy where consumers are so healthy it seems like a time when

via danielamerman as can be seen in the graph above for the last 12 weeks there has been a stunning visual correlation between the yellow bars of the total weekly funding of deficits by the federal reserve and the green bars of the weekly deficit spending by the united states government total deficit spending the extent to which monies spent by the federal government exceeded taxes collected was a staggering 422 billion in just the last 12 weeks in total 367 billion of the funding for this increase in the national debt was provided at very low interest rates via the mechanism of the federal reserve simply creating the money needed to fund the government spending neither the treasury department nor the federal reserve will admit to what is happening the fed is using two separate programs to accomplish this with a sufficient degree of complexity that it becomes difficult for average citizen to follow where the money is coming in from and what it is being used for in this step by step analysis we will put together the week by week numbers from the fed and the treasury uncover what is being hidden behind a veil of complexity and show the simple truth about 90 of recent federal government deficit spending has effectively been funded at below market rates by simply creating the new money this analysis is part of a series of related analyses which support a book that is in the process of being written some key chapters from the book and an overview of the series are linked here deficit spending has to be funded by somebody as 2019 ends we are in a time of potentially rapid change for markets interest rates investment prices and the funding for the national debt as reviewed in recent analyses we have moved back into a time of 1 trillion annual deficits and this is currently projected by the government to extend into the indefinite future the congressional budget office is projecting over 12 trillion in deficits over the next ten years and for the average person that is such an astoundingly large number that it may sound quite theoretical what needs to be understood about deficits is that they are not the slightest bit theoretical the government spends massive sums of money what it doesn t take in from taxes it has to borrow every one of those 12 trillion dollars shown above has to exist it will be spent at the time it is spent it will be every bit as real as the dollars in your checking account or money market account and those real dollars for new spending have to come in from somebody funding new deficits each week and each year is a very concrete process that is much more dangerous than looking just at the 23 trillion total of the national debt even if most people are not aware of this this money has to be there and it has to be available at abnormally low interest rates or as reviewed in previous chapters market stability is imperiled along with the values of the nation s retirement accounts and homes beginning in october of 2019 the federal reserve made an abrupt turn and for emergency reasons began using monetary creation to get the money to buy 60 billion per month in u s treasury obligations as explored in much more detail in chapter 18 link here the federal reserve does not directly purchase those treasury obligations from the u s treasury department itself nor does it issue press releases talking about how it is creating new money to finance deficit spending and the growth of the u s national debt but effectively that is exactly what it is doing the fed is creating new money and using it to buy massive amounts of government obligations at very low interest rates so that the u s government does not need to raise the money from private parties like it is supposed to who might require higher interest rates now that this astonishing program has been running for going on two months it is worth taking a look at what has been happening in practice as can be seen in the graph above the orange columns represents the net increase in treasury obligations owned by the federal reserve in each week and the green columns represents the increase in the public portion of the u s national debt in that same week as is visually obvious there is a very strong relationship between the treasury getting new money each week to finance government spending that is over and above what taxes pay for and the federal reserve creating new money each week to finance a big chunk of that extra spending the first week when this process really got going was that ending on october 23rd the fed purchased 26 billion in new treasuries through the markets and the treasury sold 26 billion in new debt since neither the federal reserve or the treasury department openly admits what is happening here that is quite the amazing coincidence isn t it of course 60 billion a month in treasuries purchased with created money is not enough to fund a 1 trillion per year deficit so over the following weeks we see a partial funding by the week ending on november 13th the federal reserve had purchased about 78 billion in new treasuries and the treasury department had issued about 129 billion in new debt when we look at the cumulative total through december 4th of 2019 the federal reserve created 137 billion in new money and effectively if not openly used that to finance deficit spending this compares to the treasury spending 229 billion more than it took in so the fed didn t finance everything through this first program but the treasury did on an effective basis only have to find 92 billion in outside money to fund government spending instead of the 229 billion it would have otherwise had to raise while potentially paying higher interest rates to get that money if we look at the effective funding on a cumulative percentage basis then we get the blue bars in the graph above the federal reserve effectively funded 100 of government deficit spending the week ending october 23rd through november 13th the fed funded 61 of the growth in the national debt and through december 4th 60 of the seven weeks of government deficits had been funded by the seven weeks of monetary creation so while the numbers have been bouncing up and down a little bit on a week by week basis it is a fair statement to say that the federal reserve is effectively funding about 60 of the government spending that is in excess of taxes collected the role of repos in funding the national debt there is also the issue of the september crisis in the repo market which has led to a somewhat different and larger round of monetary creation what repurchase agreements are and what happened was explored in detail in chapter 18 as well as in quite a few news articles it is accurate to say there that are multiple sources of the turmoil in the repo market with some of them being closely tied to year end banking reserve requirements or hedge fund activity but it is equally accurate to say that the fed creating money to fund repo loans accomplishes multiple goals what has been missed as the fed has created over 200 billion in new money and used that to extend repo loans while shoring up financial stability is the linkages between the funding of the national debt and the repo market repurchase agreements are usually overnight loans where collateral is sold to the lender with an agreement to buy the collateral back at a slightly higher price the next day and with the difference in price being the overnight interest that is paid that collateral is generally u s treasury obligations to access this market the starting point is for the repo borrower to have the u s treasury obligations to serve as collateral this ownership is effectively paid for on a daily basis as the loan rolls over by the repo lender so when the fed creates 200 billion in new money to extend 200 billion in new loans that are collateralized by 200 billion in treasury obligations the fed is effectively funding those treasury obligations via the new money if the fed weren t doing that then the money to fund that portion of deficit spending would need to come from somewhere else the heart of the repo problem is that that money that had been coming in at very low interest rates stopped coming in this means the daily funding of the ownership of the treasuries stopped and when the fed stepped in using monetary creation it took over the day to day funding of those treasuries at very low interest rates a critical and closely related factor to keep in mind is that the purpose of the ownership of the treasury obligations is in many cases specifically to be able to access the repo market sometimes in the attempt to execute overnight small scale arbitrages using opm other people s money on a frequent basis so if there isn t a source of money for the repo loans there is no reason to buy the treasuries in the first place or to contribute to the ongoing funding of the annual deficits and the growth of the u s national debt taking that a step further this ties into another stability issue that arrived with the september repo crisis in some cases borrower investors such a hedge funds were buying u s treasuries using them as collateral for repo loans taking those loan proceeds using them to buy a second round of u s treasuries using those as collateral for a second repo loan then taking those loan proceeds buying a third round of u s treasuries and then going on to another level and beyond that and beyond that we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us the idea is to leverage at a very low borrowing cost the repo rate and to exploit small daily differentials producing outsize gains on the initial equity invested primarily through using other people s money the very low borrowing cost does not come from the borrower but the very high credit quality of the collateral which is the u s treasury obligations that are the national debt with each round the need is created to buy another round of u s treasury collateral which then funds still more deficit spending in total the repurchase agreement market provides a substantial portion of the domestic private funding for the growth in the national debt and this is not an accident the u s government has created a regulatory framework where the repo market is cheaper and easier to access when u s treasuries are used as the collateral and this then provides an ongoing source of low cost funding for the national debt and the annual deficits there is another crucial layer as well which is that the repo market effectively competes with other markets for the dollars of investors seeking very short term very high quality places to invest money two of the biggest alternatives are the u s treasury obligations and fed funds markets so if repo rates move up on a sustained basis then money is pulled out of the treasury and fed funds markets until those rates move up as well all else being equal while little understood by the general public the massive repurchase agreement market and the ability to use u s treasuries as collateral to reliably obtain very low cost loans is not just crucial for financial stability but is also an important component of the funding of the national debt while being an important influence on the borrowing rate paid by the u s government the combined fed funding of u s deficits via monetary creation the graph above also shows the orange bars from the prior graph of cumulative new purchases of treasury obligations by the federal reserve what is added is the purple bars of new repo loans the new money created by the fed that is used to fund the day to day ownership of treasury obligations by repo borrowers at very low interest rates the starting point of this graph is the september repo crisis so the repo related funding of deficit spending starts much earlier while the significant week to week treasury purchases don t really get going until the week of october 23rd when we combine those two bars we get the yellow bars which are the total federal reserve funding of u s government deficit spending on a cumulative basis this funding was initially high relative to the weekly funding of the deficit as the fed used the new money to deal with a crisis that was threatening via funding the ownership of an increased share of the national debt and creating the money to do so as the crisis grew less urgent the rapid increases in the purple bars of fed repo loans stopped and more or less stabilized while the orange bars of the fed s new policy of creating the money to fund a large component of deficit spending on a weekly basis began to steadily rise it is only when we look at the yellow bars the combination of new repo loans using monetary creation to fund treasury obligations and the fed using monetary creation to buy u s treasury obligations that we can see the full extent of how much of government deficit spending is currently being funded by monetary creation the federal reserve funding of the national debt increased for 12 straight weeks particularly when we focus on the eight weeks between mid october and early december the visual relationship is stunning when we compare the yellow bars of fed monetary creation being used to either purchase treasuries or loan the money to own treasuries it almost exactly equals the green bars of the weekly deficits and the weekly growth in the national debt g on a cumulative basis deficit spending increased the national debt by 422 billion over 12 weeks and the federal reserve effectively funded 367 billion of that deficit spending via monetary creation meaning that 87 of the deficits were funded by monetary creation when we look at the fed s weekly new monetary creation to fund the weekly issuance of new treasury obligations in percentage terms we get the graph above after an initial surge in the height of the attempts to contain the repo crisis cumulative monetary creation has been effectively funding cumulative deficit spending in a more or less stable range for the last eight weeks bouncing up and down around roughly 90 in the last four weeks in particular this is a somewhat fantastic development and over the thousands of years of economic history variations on this theme of just creating the money to spend have been attempted many times in many nations by governments and elites who have seen personal financial or political gains by doing so it has never worked out over the long term not once it is sobering to see the united states not just going down this path but accelerating the journey even if this is not yet being admitted to the public now this does not mean that the relationship shown above will be stable in exactly that range indeed that would be quite unlikely depending on what is happening there is likely to be quite a bit of variability and this is particularly true of weekly deficits due to the timing of government income tax and estimated tax payment receipts however as developed in chapter 18 and shown in the graph above there is a good chance that by the time all is said and done what we are experiencing at the end of 2019 is just a taste of what will be coming in the 2020s what the graph shows with the green bars is government deficits as projected by the congressional budget office and what is shown with the orange bars is simply the indefinite continuation of the federal reserve s current program of purchasing 60 billion a month of treasury obligations using monetary creation the visual resemblance between this look at the next ten years and the graph of what has actually been happening with recent deficits and recent treasury purchases by the fed is remarkable the deeply personal potentially near term implications the problem with great big huge numbers like creating 100 billion in new money out of thin air in a week or a nation planning to spend 12 trillion more in a decade than it has money coming in is that by their nature they will seem quite abstract to most people what could these vast and theoretical numbers have to do with what really matters to most individuals such as what their retirement accounts may be worth next year how much money they will have to spend in retirement or what the value of their home will be the problem and the very personal and direct linkage is that the values of our homes and retirement accounts are all already based upon what the federal reserve has been doing with both very low interest rates and with monetary creation as shown above and as explored in chapter one link here the reason that stock bond and home values are currently at near historic highs are because of those very low interest rates the fundamental problem that emerged in the fall of 2019 and is likely to become more important in 2020 and in each year beyond is that the national debt supercycle has merged with the fed s very low interest rate cycles and created a potentially existential conflict not just for the nation but for the value of everyone s individual homes and retirement accounts the u s government fully intends to spend a staggering amount more than it has coming in from taxes each and every year into the indefinite future that is the plan that is what is in the long term official budgets and projections the money doesn t exist on the private side to do this or at least not at the historically low interest rates that the federal government the federal reserve the financial markets and that individual investors and homeowners are all dependent upon now that this merger has occurred the federal reserve has begun emergency maneuvers to make sure that the federal government can get the vast sums of cash it is currently taking out of the financial system sucking 422 billion in new cash out of the system in just the last 12 weeks without triggering the increase in interest rates that could bring the system crashing down for lack of alternatives that has in practice meant just creating the money even if the federal reserve and treasury department are very careful to never actually admit that the individual stakes are shown in the illustration above from the analysis linked here using the round number illustration of a 1 million net worth a 75 25 allocation of 800 000 in retirement savings between stocks and bonds is assumed as well as ownership of a 500 000 home with a 300 000 mortgage if interest rates were to merely return to average and stock bond and home valuations were to return to long term inflation adjusted averages then as shown above the loss in net worth for the average person could be staggering and it could be immediate yes there are very much long term dangers from the national debt when it comes to inflation and the like but the immediate and near term dangers could instead involve staggering stock and housing losses however that said also keep in mind that as explored in chapter one the results of the federal reserve s heavy handed interventions to date have been some of the highest stock bond and home prices in history and if the fed were to get even more desperate dialing up its degrees of interest rate interventions and monetary creation to deal with ever greater challenges the results could be more of the same there could be potentially much higher stock bond and home prices at least for a time and perhaps for a number of years exploding federal deficits and monetary creation are not at all the sort of issues that most people think about when it comes to retirement planning the value of their retirement accounts or the value of their homes yet the issues discussed in this analysis are already the primary reason that most people are enjoying the stock bond and home prices that they are and this importance is likely to grow even stronger in each successive year as the 2020s unfold as the fed continues its emergency maneuvers these values are all in play and what factors could cause them to plummet downwards or to climb still higher are not part of the usual financial education hopefully this analysis and this book have been helpful to you in understanding these critical new relationships as we begin a new decade that will be quite different from any before it
with the death sunday of former federal reserve chairman paul volcker 1979 1987 the american ruling class has lost one of its most dedicated and ruthless servants under the banner of fighting inflation volcker was the chief architect of the class war against the working class in the united states and internationally that continues and deepens every day all over the world politicians central bankers and the corporate media have hailed his legacy the new york times neil irwin gushed his life is a testament to what dedicated public servants can do when they put their heads down and are guided not by how things worked in the past or how they might wish them to be but by the world as it is and the right answer isn t always the most popular paul volcker the supposedly left democratic presidential candidate elizabeth warren attempted to portray volcker as an opponent of the financial elite tweeting paul volcker fought to rein in wall street banks making risky financial bets and we came together as the volcker rule was signed into law former treasury secretary under bill clinton lawrence summers described him as the model for every financial official who followed him former fed chairman ben bernanke said he personified the idea of doing something politically unpopular but economically necessary bernanke s successor at the fed janet yellen said he was an inspiration to me and the federal reserve the current fed chair jerome powell said his contributions to the nation left a lasting legacy what is this legacy it consists of the destruction of vast swathes of industry and the malignant growth of social evils such as declining life expectancy falling wages rising part time and contingent employment the opioid crisis record suicide rates soaring financial speculation and the accumulation of massive wealth in the hands of a financial oligarchy amid ever widening social inequality the specific mission undertaken by volcker was to jack up interest rates and plunge the country into recession creating mass unemployment as a means of breaking the social resistance of the working class a full accounting would reveal that his policies imposed on behalf of the american ruling class resulted in untold social misery and the premature death of millions of people not only in the us but around the world as he charted the path for ruling classes to follow everywhere the social counterrevolution that he inaugurated was from the start and remains today the bipartisan policy of the entire political establishment volcker embodied the unity of the democrats and republicans on essential issues of economic policy relating to the basic interests of the ruling class a democrat he was appointed fed chairman by a democratic president served under the republican reagan and was brought into the democratic obama administration to help oversee the bailout of the banks and the post 2008 intensification of class war against the working class volcker was named to head the federal reserve on july 25 1979 by president jimmy carter it was a time of immense crisis for us and global capitalism the post war economic boom had ended keynesian policies had failed the bretton woods monetary system had collapsed the us was in the grips of stagflation the dollar was falling and the consequent runaway inflation had led to an upsurge by the working class seeking to defend its living standards in 1977 78 us coal miners struck for 111 days defying a no strike order issued under the taft hartley act miners publicly burned carter s back to work orders on their picket lines the administration drew the conclusion that this was only the start and a war would have to be waged against the working class to ensure the stability of american capitalism the globalization of the world capitalist economy had made it possible for american corporations which were losing market share at home as well as abroad to shift production to cheap labor havens around the world they relied on the nationalist and pro capitalist trade union bureaucracy to pit workers against their class brothers and sisters internationally and push through layoffs and wage cuts to bolster the profits of their us based companies the signal for the start of class war and social counterrevolution came with the election of the thatcher government in britain in may 1979 volcker was appointed less than three months later in an article on volcker s appointment that appeared two days after the event the bulletin the newspaper of the workers league forerunner of the socialist equality party wrote the appointment of conservative banker paul volcker as chairman of the federal reserve board is a declaration of war against the working class he had been installed the article continued to carry out savage tight money policies and impose full scale depression conditions on working class and middle class families that prediction was quickly verified as millions of jobs were axed and the us economy plunged into two recessions the likes of which had not been seen since the 1930s the new regime was soon to make its impact in december 1979 the carter administration organised the bailout of the chrysler corporation in which the company received loan guarantees in return for concessions from the united automobile workers union including direct wage and benefit cuts it was the first time a union had imposed such measures on its members setting the pattern for what was to come throughout the 1980s the instrument for this program was the lifting of interest rates a month after his appointment volcker lifted interest rates twice and by december 1980 the fed s base interest rate was at a record 21 5 percent the result was economic devastation particularly in industrial cities such as detroit buffalo pittsburgh akron youngstown gary and many others a process that has continued to this day the election of reagan following that of thatcher was to see an acceleration of this industrial civil war as the working class fought back in august 1981 reagan ordered the sacking and blacklisting of 12 000 striking air traffic controllers he was able to enforce the firings because the afl cio bureaucracy blocked any effective support for the controllers and allowed their union patco to be destroyed volcker was later to praise reagan for his strikebreaking declaring that the defeat of the patco workers was the most important factor in bringing inflation under control the patco outcome he said was decisive in its psychological effect on the strength of the union bargaining position on other issues whatever the issues were a member of the fed s interest rate setting federal open market committee put the issue even more directly saying at a meeting in february 1981 that inflation would not be securely defeated until all those workers and their unions agreed to accept less if they were not impressed by words perhaps the liquidation of several million more jobs would convince them the patco strike set the pattern for the industrial struggles that followed in the copper mines coal mines meatpacking plants airlines steel mills and auto plants workers fought tenaciously to defend their wages and conditions defying the violence unleashed against them by the government only to be left isolated and defeated by the corporatist trade union bureaucracy which took its philosophy of business unionism to its logical conclusion by openly siding with management and the capitalist state the result was the destruction of the trade unions as organisations for the defence of workers and their transformation into the agencies for the enforcement of the dictates of the corporations and the banks that they are today there is another aspect of volcker s legacy which has assumed ever greater importance with the passage of time the destruction of key sections of industry in the 1980s was the start of a process in which profit accumulation took the form of ever greater financial parasitism such as the buying up of companies in hostile takeovers and then hollowing them out and selling off the component parts the accumulation of wealth was carried out not through productive activity but by means of financial manipulation financed by debt a process that today has reached unprecedented heights volcker finished his term as fed chair in 1987 to be replaced by alan greenspan the consummate representative of the new mode of wealth accumulation for which volcker s class war against the working class had paved the way the greenspan agenda was made clear from the very beginning of his term when in response to the october 1987 stock market crash he declared that the financial spigots of the fed were open to the banks and finance houses a policy continued and deepened by his successors but volcker s role was not finished in november 2008 in the wake of the global financial crash this inveterate enemy of the working class was appointed by president obama to head a white house advisory board to devise measures to deal with the crisis one of its major initiatives was the bailout of chrysler and general motors in collaboration with the uaw which consolidated the now infamous two tier wage system that has slashed the pay of american workers and opened the way for all the precarious working conditions that have since followed in the last period of his life volcker was somewhat critical of the rampant deregulation of the financial system with his eye firmly on the future of the profit system he feared that it could lead to financial instability and an eruption of the class struggle he had sought to suppress however the so called volcker rule which made a very limited attempt to curb some of the more egregious parasitic measures of financial capital is in the process of being scrapped one of the themes of the praise being heaped on volcker upon his death is that he brought stability to the capitalist economy and financial system nothing could be further from the truth american and world capitalism is sitting on a mountain of debt estimated to be 255 trillion or 32 500 for every man woman and child on the planet which threatens to implode and the social inequality that he helped create is bringing about an international upsurge in the class struggle in these new conditions what lessons must be drawn by the american and international working class from the life and times of paul volcker leon trotsky once wrote that in times of crisis when it has its back to the wall the ruling class draws upon all its counterrevolutionary historical experience as it seeks to remain in the saddle such experiences were embodied in volcker s role in the class conflicts of the 1980s now as the class struggle assumes even more explosive and widespread dimensions with the bourgeoisie seeking to develop authoritarian and outright fascist forms of rule to counter it the task facing the working class consists as trotsky wrote in counterposing to the thoroughly thought out counterrevolutionary strategy of the bourgeoisie its own revolutionary strategy likewise thought out to the end

resolution images economic perspectives gross domestic product economic activity in the united states started 2019 on an upbeat note fueled by consumer optimism and business confidence riding the corporate tax restructuring of the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act companies boosted investments and coupled with solid consumer spending led to a 4 1 percent annualized gain in gross domestic product gdp during the first quarter of the year according to the bureau of economic analysis in addition exports outpaced imports during the period leading to expectations of increased trade windfalls however as the year wore on the trade rifts between the us and its trading partners deepened leading to an escalation in tariffs and overall uncertainty while consumer optimism remained unabated leading to a 4 6 percent annualized gain in consumer spending business confidence waned and resulted in a 1 0 percent drop in investment in the second quarter even as government spending picked up the pace the cumulative effect was a mild 2 0 percent gdp gain in the second quarter the loss of momentum was reflected in the third quarter s gdp figure which advanced at an initial estimate of 1 9 percent annual rate the bureau of economic analysis subsequently revised third quarter gdp to 2 1 percent showing stronger business investment the federal reserve concerned about a deteriorating global economic outlook decided to boost liquidity in the financial system in an effort to prevent an economic slide monetary policy the federal reserve moved into 2019 signaling through its forward guidance that as the economy continued on an expansionary track it would maintain a policy focused on monetary tightening markets expected at least two additional short term interest rate increases at the outset of the year towards the midpoint of the year however the central bank s policy shifted in response to global changes while the us economy continued showing signs of growth major economies around the world slowed in response to the slowdown central banks around the world engaged in accommodative monetary responses resorting to cutting rates and purchasing assets in an effort to boost output along with the bank of japan several central banks in europe took interest rates into negative territory attempting to spur investment and liquidity in response world currencies dropped against the us dollar adding pressure on us exporters and sectors sensitive to currency risks the federal reserve decided to change tack in light of these shifts and responded by cutting rates 3 times at the federal open market committee s meetings in july september and october the central bank also expressed that it would move from a longer term outlook to a shorter term horizon assessing incoming economic data through the year to guide its policy actions while the bank s two main objectives stable employment and low inflation remained on track in 2019 the rate cuts seemed aimed at walking a tightrope between maintaining us economic momentum amid a global economic moderation and placating investors expectations for growth employment mirroring the shift in business confidence the pace of employment growth moderated in the first three quarters of 2019 while companies continued adding positions to their payrolls the number of net new jobs totaled 1 45 million during the january to september timeframe 27 percent lower than the same period in 2018 based on data from the bureau of labor statistics the professional and business services sector the main driver of employment growth during the past decade took a back seat to the healthcare and social assistance sector accounting for 311 000 net new jobs a 29 percent decline from 2018 with over 410 000 new jobs added to payrolls the healthcare sector led the pack posting a 19 percent gain compared with the same period in 2018 stemming from solid growth in business travel the lodging and food services sector provided the third largest number of net new jobs in the first nine months of 2019 with 136 000 employees added to payrolls as the corporate outlook dimmed partway through the year employment in manufacturing trade transportation and utilities slowed in addition despite strong demand for housing construction companies hired 58 percent fewer employees in 2019 compared with the prior year the slowdown in hiring was also evident in other sectors such as mining and logging financial activities as well as arts entertainment and recreation government entities also reflected shifting priorities in 2019 after an extended period of flat hiring the federal government added 45 000 new positions during the first nine months of the year local governments enjoying rising property tax revenues also went on a hiring spree adding 91 000 new employees to payrolls a 44 percent increase year over year state governments pared back their hiring adding a more moderate 20 000 new jobs the pace of employment while slower than a year ago pushed the unemployment rate to 3 6 percent in the third quarter of 2019 the same rate last experienced in the second half of 1969 the labor force participation rate reached 62 8 percent in the third quarter of the year slightly below the average rate recorded over the past decade while wages gained ground during 2019 at 3 0 percent during the first half of the year when adjusted for inflation they managed a more modest 1 2 percent year over year average gain consumer confidence consumer confidence spent the better part of 2019 moving sideways despite monthly fluctuations in september the present situation component of the conference board consumer confidence index was unchanged compared with the same month in 2018 however the expectations component dropped 15 percent over the figure from the prior year leading to an 8 percent decline in the overall index and implying that consumers were expecting deteriorating conditions over the next few months 2020 economic outlook as economic momentum moderated through 2019 and global headwinds gather gdp growth is projected to post a modest 1 7 percent advance in 2020 as the housing share of expenses continues rising consumers the largest contributor to output will likely trim back on non housing spending a slowdown in consumer spending coupled with rising global uncertainty and market volatility can be expected to lead companies to contain costs and trim employment goals an employment slowdown will move the unemployment rate from 3 6 percent at the start of 2020 to 3 9 percent by the end of the year a jobless rate still below what would be expected in a healthy economy but a shift in the wrong direction in turn consumer confidence will soften during the year with the conference board s consumer confidence index estimated to decline 21 percent following the federal reserve s monetary accommodation inflation expectations remain modest and well anchored translating into a 2 0 percent year over year increase in 2020 while short term rates remain low economic moderation is likely to impact bond markets leading to mortgage rates moving mostly sideways in 2020 rates for 30 year fixed mortgages are projected to average 3 85 percent during the next year housing trends in 2020 download full resolution images 1 supply housing supply was a tale of two halves in 2019 in the first six months we saw the effect of low affordability which translated into an inventory build up around the country the number of homes available for sale rose rapidly at nearly 7 percent on a yearly basis the fastest pace of growth since 2014 before spring arrived we had already seen the first material move in favor of buyers inventory was on an expansionary path leading to the summer as prices further overheated and frustrated buyers reached a point of exhaustion however the landscape shifted quickly as mortgage rates sank in march the low rate environment gave the housing market a second wind thousands of buyers that were priced out by sky high prices found a way to enter the market by leaning on financing and those that were on the edge of qualifying were suddenly and automatically back in at the start of this year 2 out of 3 of markets were seeing inventory growth as we wrap the year only 1 in 10 are seeing growth placing housing into acute shortage mode the market is still years away from reaching an adequate supply of homes to meet today s demand from buyers despite improvements to new construction and short waves of sellers next year will once again fail to bring a solution to the inventory shortage in 2020 we expect inventory to struggle to grow and could instead reach a historic low level the yearly declines are likely to be moderate and range between 1 to 5 percent for most of the year a steady flow of demand and robust yet declining seller sentiment will combine to ensure there is no surplus adequately priced inventory 2 demand a low rate environment rising rents and the ever expanding millennial population broadened the potential homebuyer pool and maintained a strong demand foundation in 2019 buyer sentiment peaked in the summer and powered sales growth in the fall however it lost momentum later in the year as conditions of low affordability and economic uncertainty persisted overall buyer demand will remain very robust particularly at the entry level in 2020 the largest population cohort in the country those born in 1990 will turn 30 in 2020 accounting for 4 8 million millennials hitting peak home buying age as a group millennials those born 1981 1997 will take more than half of all mortgages next year for the first time ever millennials share of mortgage originations will surpass 50 percent in the spring outnumbering gen x and baby boomers combined the last generation to take more than half of all purchase originations was gen x in 2013 just six years ago accordingly other generations footprint will continue to contract with gen x and baby boomers taking 32 and 17 percent of mortgage originations respectively 3 home sales sales of existing homes declined in 2018 and through the first half of 2019 as tightening inventory squeezed first time buyers while sales experienced a slight rebound in the third quarter of this year elevated by declining mortgage rates the annual pace is likely to be flat at best demand for homes remains solid with younger buyers continuing to vote with their dollars however as consumers indicated that they expect a moderation in economic activity in 2020 the housing market is likely to reflect the economic headwinds sales of existing homes are expected to decline 1 8 percent in 2020 as the continuing supply shortage and moderating price growth will hamper buyers and tamp down sellers expectations the decline in sales is projected to be accompanied by a flattening in price growth with the supply of available homes continuing to balance on a tightrope and the entry level demand expected to remain strong prices are estimated to tick up 0 8 percent in 2020 4 move to affordability a dominant trait of this real estate cycle has been the renaissance of the urban downtowns as younger generations returned to downtown cores employers and developers responded by building offices retail and housing in high density environments however as the costs of development and construction rose so did housing prices especially given the propensity for builders to bring mostly high end luxury products to market over the past decade demand for downtown living trended on an upward curve driven by a desire for proximity and lifestyle amenities especially on the part of millennials however as millennials matured and started families their priorities shifted with the oldest members of the generational cohort reaching 38 years in 2019 millennials broadened their housing horizons beyond the urban core as housing prices outpaced incomes by a wide margin home buyers made a noticeable move toward affordability during the year large expensive coastal markets new york los angeles san francisco began experiencing net migration outflows as buyers flocked to mid sized cities in search of quality of life and amenities at a more affordable price point the move to affordability trend will continue in 2020 fueled by the twin forces of baby boomers retiring and seeking sunnier weather lower taxes and lower cost of living and millennials searching for family friendly lifestyles and affordable housing home buyers are increasingly looking not only at suburban environments near large metropolitan areas but also considering options across state lines cities in arizona nevada and texas will continue to benefit from shoppers looking for more affordable alternatives to california meanwhile shoppers from expensive northeast markets will find the warmer options in the carolinas georgia and florida attractive download full resolution images what will 2020 be like for buyers buying a home in 2020 will offer opportunities for some buyers as the supply of new homes relieves some of the inventory pressures and prices moderate while the inventory of new homes in 2019 remained focused on the high end as the luxury market cools builders signaled their intent to increase offerings in the mid price segment a much needed shift in market dynamics first time buyers will continue to struggle with affordability even with mortgage rates in an approachable range as entry level inventory is expected to remain constrained the broad price moderation will continue to offer opportunities in mid sized markets in the midwest and south what will 2020 be like for sellers sellers in 2020 will contend with flattening price growth and slowing activity requiring more patience and a thoughtful approach to pricing sellers of homes priced for entry level buyers can expect the market to remain competitive and prices to stay firm at the upper end of the price range however properties will take longer to sell and incentives will be needed to close deals as the market moves toward a more balanced scenario sellers who adjust to local market conditions can expect to benefit from continuing demand download full resolution images election will be 2020 wildcard political elections can have an impact on the economy and housing markets while the outcome of elections is not directly tied to the performance of the markets expectations linked to a party s or an administration s likely legislative or regulatory actions can sway confidence and decisions when either party gains control of the legislative and executive branches there s a higher likelihood of seeing shifts in the rule making process and the regulatory environment looking at housing trends over the past three decades the pace of sales price and inventory are intertwined with economic performance employment wages and interest rates the outcome of elections does not weigh directly on trends in housing however business optimism and investments along with consumer optimism and spending do influence economic output and can also influence housing activity the 2020 elections will be closely watched by consumers and businesses for indications of potential changes along with the presidential election there will be candidates running for 35 of the 100 seats in the u s senate along with 435 seats in

why is the world bank loaning money to china president donald trump tweeted on dec 6 can this be possible china has plenty of money and if they don t they create it stop he did so in response to the world bank agreeing to continue lending 1 billion to 1 5 billion a year to china through 2025 the world bank s newly approved country partnership framework with china has met significant criticism from u s stakeholders especially those in washington who recently supported the world bank s capital increase the framework was adopted by the world bank s board on dec 5 despite objections from u s treasury secretary steven mnuchin and members of congress the u s should respond by gathering a coalition of shareholders and asking the world bank board to amend its agreement with china i remain an ardent supporter of the world bank and believe it continues to play a critical role in supporting global development efforts the world bank provides critical research advice and financing for low and middle income countries around the world i have testified to congress in favor of capital increases for the world bank and have been a staunch defender of the research the world bank does such as its doing business indicators i was one of the first people to publicly make the case for why the world should support world bank president david malpass when he was nominated by the united states this being said the world bank has made a mistake and president trump is right to be upset the world bank should stop lending to china and instead direct lending to countries that don t have access to financing it may be a surprise to some but the trump administration has maintained a good relationship with the world bank some criticize the administration s foreign policy as damaging multilateralism and supporting isolationism but this has not been the case in regard to the world bank or regional multilateral institutions first the administration has put forward excellent candidates to lead organizations such as the world food program unicef and the world bank second international development association ida contributions to the world bank i e the arm that supports poorer countries by the u s have remained high third the administration agreed to a new capital increase and committed to doing 1 billion more a year for several years to pay for its share of the capital increase given strong u s support for the bank this newly announced country partnership agreement with china is a provocation this is not the first time that president trump has voiced his frustration when he believed china was receiving special treatment from a multilateral organization in 2018 president trump tweeted china which is a great economic power is considered a developing nation within the world trade organization they therefore get tremendous perks and advantages especially over the u s does anybody think this is fair we were badly represented the wto is unfair to u s similar to the wto china continues to benefit more from the world bank than it contributes it is time for multilateral institutions to no longer consider china a recipient of aid but rather as a donor china is the world s second largest economy it has 3 trillion in foreign currency reserves runs its own global infrastructure bank the asian infrastructure investment bank aiib and has received more than 60 billion in below market rate lending from the world bank since 1981 according to the world bank atlas method of defining global economies china is an upper middle income economy ie countries with gross national income or gni per capita between 3 996 and 12 375 because it had a gni per capita of 9 470 in 2018 china does meet the requirements for graduation which requires a 2017 per capita income threshold above 6 795 further proof that china is one of the leading economies globally is the international monetary fund adding the chinese renminbi to the basket of currencies that make up the special drawing right sdr joining the u s dollar the euro japanese yen and british pound in 2016 while china is required to use the money it receives from the world bank for economic development and lifting citizens out of poverty oversight on how the loans are actually spent has been questioned over the years the world bank recently came under enormous criticism for its 50 million loan to a technical and vocational education and training program in xinjiang china a region where over one million muslim minorities are believed to be held in extrajudicial detention facilities the loans themselves also allow china to allocate additional resources to state owned enterprises defense spending or president xi jinping s belt and road initiative bri in order to more effectively compete with the united states on the international stage china s military spending jumped from 31 2 billion in 1998 to 239 2 billion in 2018 similarly china has promised to spend over 1 trillion of investment as part of the bri and more than 125 countries have already signed bri cooperation documents since 2013 as the largest shareholder in the world bank the united states should not have the taxpayer money it contributes to the bank used to fund a global competitor china should be paying for its own development programs there are several reasons the world bank wants to keep lending to china first china s size and influence make it an interesting case study for further research and testing of development programs second china s excellent credit rating makes it easier for the bank to lend to poorer countries with bad credit ratings effectively cross subsidizing countries while maintaining an overall aaa credit rating third some shareholders would argue that as a poverty agency the world bank should continue to lend to china because of the large number of poor people the country has especially in rural areas none of these reasons are strong enough to justify a 1 billion plus a year lending relationship with china the world bank needs to quickly rethink the newly approved country partnership framework with china and gradually stop all lending to china over the next five years the bank can engage with china around advisory services similar to those with oman but china should not be the recipient of any concessional finance from the world bank senior officials in the u s treasury supported by the white house need to make calls to the 20 largest shareholders of the world bank other than china saying that this plan is not acceptable and ask them to support a scaled back version instead the world bank should establish a much steeper lending glidepath and should cut lending to china to no more than 500 million a year starting now and rapidly decline that over the next five years the number of world bank employees operating in china also should be cut in half over the next five years the u s and its fellow world bank stakeholders should advise china that it is time to transition its relationship with the bank from a recipient country to more of a donor at the same time the world bank should ask china to increase its overall shareholdings in the world bank without exceeding japan s share the world bank remains an important institution but the world bank leadership has made a mistake in offering such a large on going financial relationship with china the world bank should fix this error quickly daniel f runde is a senior vice president and william a schreyer chair in global analysis at the center for strategic and international studies he previously worked for the u s agency for international development the world bank group and in investment banking with experience in africa asia europe latin america and the middle east

the man responsible for the volcker shock has died mario tama getty images history has two components one the men women who are its face and two the men women who make it an example of a historical face is of course martin luther king jr but the man who made the civil rights movement is arguably bayard rustin in 1963 he organized the massive march on washington for jobs and freedom an event that made king an american icon and launched the movement into the mainstream of history it was rustin s genius that made the complicated march a logistical success rather than a nightmare paul volcker is another maker of history this time in economics the face of the tax revolt by the rich after decades of pro labor new deal economics was ronald reagan but the man who made it happen was paul volcker the chairman of the federal reserve between 1979 and 1987 he was a democrat and placed in the chair by a democratic president jimmy carter without volcker the new deal world which boomers mistake for american capitalism also known as the golden age of capitalism 1947 to 1971 when it was in fact american socialism high wages wage escalators job security government investment in suburban mortgages and infrastructure would not have collapsed so spectacularly the way you think about money consumer loans mortgages government deficits bail outs and the like only reveals how your mind and experience of the world was made by volcker this how we become volckerians the 12th head of the federal reserve changed the american economy by shocking it with stunningly high interest rates in march 1980 at the end of carter s presidency at that time the fed funds rate was already high 10 25 percent he doubled it just like that and he pretty much kept the rates above 16 percent until may 1981 today it s only 1 74 percent here is how the mainstream describes the shocker paul a volcker fed chairman who waged war on inflation is dead at 92 new york times remembering paul volcker the man who tamed inflation the hill paul volcker was inflation s worst enemy wall street journal as you can see this man was not unloved at least by the mainstream which speaks for the establishment that in our age is dominated by a sector the volcker shock as it is called empowered finance but not everyone loves volcker many will remember him as a general for the owner classes in a class war between the rich and the working classes here is how the author of the superb but underappreciated 1997 book wall street how it works and for whom doug henwood put it in a december 9 tweet rip paul volcker who said on taking office as fed chair in october 1979 the american standard of living must decline and then did his best to make that happen doug henwood doughenwood december 9 2019 volcker s ferocious attack on a type of inflation that of commodity prices was paid for by a deep recession that with the concrete of unemployment broke the back of labor before the volcker shock rising wages were blamed for rising prices though there were many other factors such as political instability in resource regions and the costs of war after the shock it was not just inflation that was tamed but also wages both have grown slowly ever since but there is also inflation in stock market shares and the inflation of home values these forms inflation have never met a volcker an explanation of the trickle down revolution as an ideology and policy success is not possible without volcker who was returned to the chair by carter s successor ronald reagan nor is the current hegemony of the financial sector at all understandable without the volcker shock his nomination in 1979 signaled the us s transition to a post industrial society that s described by academics on the left as neoliberalism a process that eroded new deal regulations on banks his shock also explains the liberation of the japanese economy in the 1980s and the third world debt crisis that led to the imf s infamous structural adjustment programs and the washington consensus basically the financialization of developing countries whose economies were once protected by capital controls for more on this read ha joon chang s 2002 report kicking away the ladder though the volcker shock stabilized prices and wages it made financial markets much more unstable after volcker left the chair in 1987 his replacement alan greenspan began his long career of putting out financial fire after financial fire with tax payer cash and ultimately transforming the fed into a socialist institution that bailed out not banks per se but their creditors volcker by the way was not an accident of history a man who happened to be in the right place at the right time he pretty much ran the treasury under richard nixon and was responsible for another shock that happened in 1971 and is now called the nixon shock what happened is this from 1969 to 1971 volcker then the undersecretary for nixon s treasury secretary john connally both connally and volcker were democrats was for all purposes the treasury volcker was young in his early 40s and had a thing about gold he did not like it and at the time the us dollar was pinned to gold this meant that anyone in the world with american money could convert it to gold this arrangement emerged from a major conference that took place at bretton woods new hampshire a year before the end of world war ii what was clear to all of the delegates at this conference was the status of a post war us it would replace europe and more specifically the british empire as the center of capitalism the us would anchor the new global economy because it was a surplus nation and its war economy was booming and it had lots of gold for more details about the conference the monetary system it established and the rise of american capitalism please read leo panitch s and sam gindin s the making of global capitalism the political economy of american empire but by the late 1960s the us was no longer a surplus nation it was running huge deficits and its industrial sector faced stiff competition from japan and germany the new surplus nations also there was the ever rising costs of war both hot and cold the convertibility of gold made the us vulnerable and restricted its policy options nixon under the guidance of young volcker closed the gold window and shocked the global economy currencies around the world were suddenly blown from the ancient ground of gold and began floating about the earth in an orbital rondo this economic atmosphere excited speculation and also opened the way for the us to do something that no other capitalist power had ever done before run twin deficits trade and domestic the first shock 1971 began the process of financializing the world the second one 1980 completed the process as a consequence full employment is not a primary concern for the fed this was the case during the new deal period inflation is and so is supporting the value of shares owned by financial institutions that are in fact insolvent remove the political power of wall street and most banks in the us would be what they are in effect nationalized this is all too big fail means you are allowed to make profits as if you are what you are not a solvent concern and then there is the sad story of the euro yanis varoufakis the former finance minister of greece 27 january 2015 6 july 2015 wrote an excellent book in 2016 and the weak suffer what they must about the consequences of the first volcker shock for post war europe indeed he believes that europe has yet to recover from it the euro and all of its problems has volcker as its father and so does the fact that you as an american must now rent your wages in the form of debt rather own them outright as would be the case if wages were permitted to rise when you see your debt bills think of the ghost of volcker he was a tall man
the u s dollar fell on wednesday to a four month low against a basket of currencies after the federal reserve held interest rates steady and fed chair jerome powell said a significant persistent inflation rise would be needed to hike rates the fed left the benchmark overnight lending rate in its 1 50 to 1 75 target range and the u s central bank s rate setting committee said after its two day policy meeting that it expects moderate economic growth and low unemployment through next year s presidential election a fed determined to maintain an accommodative financial environment seems to finally be playing against the greenback said juan perez senior currency trader with tempus inc in washington rate increases are less needed than in the mid 1990 s rate cut cycle powell told a news conference the bar to a rate hike remains higher than the bar to lowering rates further but overall you are looking at a fed that is fairly confident about where the economy is headed and expects inflation to remain under pressure for a prolonged period of time said karl schamotta chief market strategist at cambridge global payments in toronto the dollar index which measures the greenback against six other major currencies was 0 33 lower at 97 095 its lowest since aug 9 market participants are going to keep an eye out for the european central bank meeting tomorrow but mostly will remain focused on what happens on saturday with respect to u s china trade negotiations schamotta said u s president donald trump has set dec 15 as the date to impose tariffs on nearly 160 billion in chinese consumer goods washington is laying the groundwork to delay tariffs a person briefed on the situation told reuters although there is no clarity on what the decision will be if we do see a delay in tariffs that clears the way for other currencies to rise relative to the dollar schamotta said the euro was 0 4 higher ahead of new ecb boss christine lagarde s first policy meeting on thursday investors will scrutinize her every word elsewhere sweden s crown jumped to a more than four month high against the dollar after strong inflation data made it highly likely the country would end negative interest rates the dollar was 1 16 lower against the swedish crown in another notable move the hong kong dollar rallied to its strongest level since july 24 which analysts attributed to the unwinding of bets previously profiting from carry trades borrowing with low interest rates in hong kong to purchase u s dollar denominated assets the greenback was 0 24 lower against the hong kong dollar hong kong s currency is pegged to the greenback at a tight range of 7 75 7 85 per dollar and the city s monetary policy moves lock step with the united states the pound was 0 37 higher in thin trading on the eve of britain s general election shrugging off a poll that showed the ruling conservative party might fail to win a majority by saqib iqbal ahmed
george santayana and winston churchill are remembered for warning that those who fail to learn the lessons of history are doomed to repeat their errors the economist john maynard keynes failed to prevent mistakes being made at the versailles conference following the first world war but ensured that its lessons were recognised after the next great conflagration keynes s the economic consequences of the peace his denunciation of the versailles treaty was published on 12 december 1919 and became an immediate bestseller translated into a dozen languages never out of print it has just been released in a new edition benefitting greatly from a comprehensive introduction by michael cox of the london school of economics keynes who had been a senior member of the british delegation gave an insider s view of the peace conference he was also a member of the bloomsbury group of british intellectuals one of whom recalled that the treaty outraged keynes s sense of humanity he quit his post and retired to an english farmhouse with his bloomsbury friends where over a period of two months he wrote the polemic that would transform him into the world s first celebrity economist the book s serious discussions of economics and international relations was enlivened by vignettes of the leading personalities in this he was influenced by his bloomsbury friend lytton strachey whose iconoclastic eminent victorians had been published the previous year british prime minister david lloyd george keynes wrote was a femme fatale with six or seven senses not available to ordinary men able to manipulate the slow minded and bewildered american president woodrow wilson french prime minister georges clemenceau was a very old man conserving his strength for important occasions as keynes later put it words ought to be a little wild for they are the assault of thoughts upon the unthinking keynes viewed the treaty as abhorrent and detestable both morally wrong and foolish by crippling the economies of the defeated powers the victors would diminish their own living standards and threaten future prosperity moved by insane delusion and reckless self regard he explained the german people had overturned the foundations on which we all lived and built yet the victors he argued run the risk of completing the ruin which germany began by a peace which if it is carried into effect must impair yet further when it might have restored the delicate complicated organisation already shaken and broken by war through which alone the european peoples can employ themselves and live they might invite their own destruction also being so deeply and inextricably intertwined with their victims by hidden psychic and economic bonds nor was keynes concerned solely with the immediate consequences of what he called a carthaginian peace resentment arising from the severe punishment imposed upon the german people could he believed sow the seeds of another war if we aim deliberately at the impoverishment of central europe he wrote vengeance i dare predict will not limp nothing can then delay for very long that final civil war between the forces of reaction and the despairing convulsions of revolution before which the horrors of the late german war will fade into nothing and which will destroy whoever is the victor the civilisation and the progress of our generation keynes then asked in prose of extraordinary eloquence and power must we not base our actions on better expectations and believe that the prosperity and happiness of one country promotes that of others that the solidarity of man is not a fiction and that nations can still afford to treat other nations as fellow creatures the book was well received in britain the economist called it brilliantly presented and closely and lucidly argued in great detail the manchester guardian commented that if many economists had his wit his eloquence his easy address in stating and analysing confused and intricate problems their science would never have been called dismal in australia economist r f irvine writing in the sydney morning herald was particularly impressed by its high literary quality and moral fervour it was also well reviewed by economists in neutral sweden but less warmly in france and the united states sadly though keynes s warnings went unheeded leonard woolf dubbed the author keynessandra and keynes would later employ the same analogy describing his writings as the croakings of a cassandra who could never influence the course of events in time but he had a second chance his experience at versailles undoubtedly explained his determination to play a central role in the planning of the world economy after the second world war even before the outbreak of war his articles in the times devoted to the economics of war finance later published in how to pay for the war provided not only a non inflationary plan for funding it but a strategy to avoid excessive debt thereafter he began to focus more sharply on postwar reconstruction after being shown a copy of the plans for a new order prepared by dr walter funk the german foreign minister to be implemented after germany won the war in november 1940 in a draft reply to funk s new order keynes assumed that this time after the war is over we shall not continue starvation and unemployment as an instrument for enforcing our political settlement he added i cannot see how the rest of europe can expect effective economic reconstruction if germany is excluded from it and remains a festering mass in their midst and an economically reconstructed germany will necessarily resume leadership this conclusion is inescapable unless it is our intention to hand the job over to russia keynes emphasised that the british government was determined not to make the same mistake again the allied countries must make it our business above most other purposes to prevent the starvation of the post armistice period the currency disorders throughout europe and the wide fluctuations of employment markets and prices which were the cause of so much misery in the twenty years between the two wars beyond the immediate ending of the war keynes proposed the establishment of a system of international exchange which will open all our markets to every country great or small alike and will give equal access for each to every source of raw material which we can control or influence on the basis of exchanging goods for goods we pledge ourselves to radical remedies for our own unemployment and to assist the same object in all other countries though he conceded that the process of reconstruction would not be easy he was confident that we have learnt the lesson of the interregnum between the two wars and we know that no escape can be found from the curse which has been lying on europe except by creating and preserving economic health in every country throughout 1941 keynes developed a plan for the centrepiece of his planning for the postwar era an international clearing union instead of countries clearing their external credits and debits with payments in gold and internationally accepted currency such as sterling or the us dollar he proposed the creation of a new unit of account which he called bancor the central banks of member countries forming the clearing union would be allocated bancor on the basis of their international trade before the war to avoid running up excessive credit or debit balances creditor countries would revalue their currencies while debtor countries could devalue here he set out to ensure that both shared in the adjustment process rather than debtor countries being forced to accept the entire burden as had usually been the case a rival plan known as the stabilisation fund was prepared at the same time by a us treasury official harry dexter white in this plan member countries would be required to contribute to an international fund on the basis of their pre war trade the burden of adjustment would fall largely on the debtors though in later versions of the plan they would be permitted to devalue their currencies within tight limits countries in deficit would have drawing rights on the fund but persistent deficits were to be resolved by deflationary measures both keynes and white also recommended special arrangements for funding loans for development programs at bretton woods an international bank later known as the world bank was established for this purpose three years elapsed between the preparation of the initial drafts of the keynes and white plans and the agreement in july 1944 by forty four nations meeting at bretton woods new hampshire to create an international monetary fund and international bank in the result the new international institutions resembled more closely the plans of white than keynes lord halifax a former foreign secretary quipped that while keynes had the brains the us had the money on the final page of the economic consequences of the peace keynes rehearsed the reasons why he wrote the book it was to set in motion those forces of instruction and imagination which change opinion the assertion of truth the unveiling of illusion the dissipation of hate the enlargement and instruction of men s hearts and minds must be the means in the concluding sentence he wrote that the true voice of the new generation has not yet spoken and silent opinion is not yet formed to the formation of the general opinion of the future i dedicate this book thanks largely to keynes the consequences of the peace that was negotiated at versailles in 1919 were recalled by those responsible for planning the post 1945 world

paul volcker center with alan greenspan and ben bernanke in 2014 photo courtesy the paul volcker center with alan greenspan and ben bernanke in 2014 photo courtesy the federal reserve paul volcker was the right man for his moment in history for that my generation the baby boomers will always owe him a great debt but volcker who died on sunday at age 92 returned to public prominence at the height of the 2008 financial crisis long after his moment had passed we boomers may hold warm feelings for the physical and intellectual giant of a man who led the federal reserve in a successful fight against the inflation demon of our youth but our children the millennials don t have the same instinctive regard most would never have heard of volcker at all had he not inspired the volcker rule that tangled financial institutions in the red tape that contributed to the so called new normal of tepid economic employment and wage growth that marked most of the obama administration s tenure volcker an economist alternated between public service and the private sector at chase manhattan bank in the 1950s and 1960s he then joined the nixon administration as a treasury undersecretary this put volcker in the midst of the action in 1971 that pivotal summer richard nixon reordered the global financial system by abandoning the dollar s link to gold and imposing wage and price controls to fight inflation that was in the mid single digits at the time after a brief recession induced respite during gerald ford s tenure in office inflation roared back once jimmy carter entered the white house by that time volcker was president of the federal reserve bank of new york in 1979 as i was in my first full year in the workforce inflation soared into double digits fueled in part by surging oil prices there were renewed calls for price controls as carter geared up for his ultimately unsuccessful reelection campaign but the president whose bias was toward freeing the economy from stifling regulation which he did most notably in the airline and trucking sectors instead called for voluntary restraint carter turned to volcker to chair the federal reserve that summer carter got exactly what he wanted and paid a steep price for it rather than support a return to price controls volcker pushed the fed to greatly tighten the supply of paper money which was fueling inflation in response interest rates soared when i opened my first money market mutual fund account the following year i earned interest of about 12 consumer borrowers including home buyers faced even higher rates by october 1981 the average mortgage rate reached an all time high of over 18 the economy plunged into a double dip recession first in 1980 which helped ronald reagan defeat carter and again early in reagan s first term but the fed had broken inflation s back by 1982 i was writing stories for the associated press about how rapidly price increases were slowing in some instances prices were even falling interest rates gradually came down as well when cooling inflation combined with the tax cuts reagan pushed through congress in his first term the economy began a growth streak that has since been interrupted only by a brief recession in 1991 the tech crash at the start of the millennium and the financial crisis of 2008 apart from these three instances my generation has enjoyed an economy that has mostly produced prosperity especially for those of us who were able to go to college despite his avoidance of price controls when i was a young adult volcker proved over time to be an interventionist at heart like many of his generation even nixon he came of age during the administration of franklin d roosevelt and would have remembered growing up during the great depression the hagiography of that era often paints roosevelt s policies as having overcome the economic downturn which is wrong roosevelt s vast expansion of government s role in economic life certainly reduced the misery of that era for millions of americans for which it deserves credit but it did not restore sustained economic growth the outbreak of world war ii did that some feared at the time that the end of the war would bring a return to depression in reality the country s remaining industrial might amid the rest of the world s devastation eliminated any risk of that outcome i think this chronology helps explain how volcker reemerged amid the 2008 financial crisis and its aftermath as a vocal advocate for restrictions on bank trading activities those restrictions came to be known as the volcker rule codified as part of the dodd frank legislation that congress passed in 2010 volcker was an old school banker he thought banks should stick to the business of taking deposits and making safe loans he detested modern banks inclination to use their cheap government insured deposits to fund risky speculative investments intended primarily to benefit bank shareholders bank risk taking did indeed contribute to the financial crisis a decade ago but not the particular risks to which volcker objected the banks got caught up in a frenzy of making risky mortgage loans to underqualified buyers so they could buy overpriced homes with some notable exceptions most institutions escaped the worst consequences because they quickly sold the majority of those risky loans to nonbank investors profits from the banks other activities actually helped the institutions maintain and rebuild their capital and reduced the costs of dealing with the crisis for the government ultimately the government made money from its bailout of financial institutions including some that regulators forced to take funds they did not need to avoid stigmatizing others that did it took regulators about three years to write regulations implementing the volcker rules in the interim banks were on their own to try to figure out exactly which activities the rules permitted or prohibited and to what extent along with other regulatory burdens that dodd frank imposed volcker rule uncertainty led to a sharp pullback in banks lending activities especially unsecured loans to small businesses it also dried up liquidity in some sectors of the credit markets raising borrowing and transaction costs in his later years volcker continued to insist on the importance of his regulatory legacy and downplayed its burdens these burdens have been eased though not eliminated by the deregulatory priorities of the trump administration not coincidentally although certainly not entirely for this reason both economic and wage growth have accelerated as unemployment has declined to half century lows although he was hardly a partisan warrior and his record commands much respect volcker ended his life in an intellectual space where democrats are generally more comfortable than republicans he came to advocate a national value added tax or vat which is a hallmark of stagnating european economies he was never a loud voice in favor of entitlement reform or broader deregulation in other parts of our economy volcker like all of us was a product of his life and times he reached his professional peak at just the right time for america whatever one thinks of his later contributions we would not have achieved all we have over the past four decades without him

from the eu dominated the domestic agenda during the period sterling served as the bellwether for the perceived likelihood of a no deal exit the value of sterling versus international currencies remained weak with the prorogation of parliament in august pushing the pound to just us 1 20 amid this persistent domestic uncertainty the bank of england s monetary policy committee voted unanimously on four occasions to hold the uk base interest rate at 0 75 latterly officials signalled the potential for a future interest rate cut following the uk s exit from the eu economic data released during the period showed a slowdown in economic growth during the first half of 2019 a result of weaker business investment and slowing global economic growth yet employment data remains robust with the unemployment rate below 4 and more than 800 000 labour market vacancies portfolio review the company s investments have continued to generate meaningful growth in income that has supported the growth in dividends however the capital returns have been disappointing as a consequence of the challenging backdrop facing uk domestically orientated companies some particular stock specific challenges and also the consequences of a large forced seller in the uk equity market the company s net asset value including reinvested dividends provided a return of 3 1 during the period under review compared with a return of 4 6 total return by the ftse all share index the portfolio s core themes have remained consistent over the past six months the tilt towards uk domestic companies has been maintained as persistent negativity towards domestic sectors continues to present compelling opportunities exposure to selective global industries namely oil tobacco remains prominent whilst a significant proportion of the portfolio is also invested in non correlated financials the low correlation of investments held by the company with the ftse all share index affords two important benefits to the portfolio business risk diversification and income diversification this is especially important given the concentration of dividend income in the uk stock market the portfolio s exposure to uk domestic opportunities still supported positive absolute returns over the period bca marketplace and kcom were among the portfolio s top contributors as both companies received private equity bids during the period under review kcom s board of directors recommended a bid in april but later abandoned it in favour of an enhanced all cash offer from a european infrastructure fund meanwhile bca marketplace confirmed in june that it was in advanced discussions with a private equity firm following an all cash offer for the company elsewhere within the portfolio s domestic theme next provided a positive contribution to performance the company released a strong trading statement in july which confirmed better than expected full price sales for the second quarter half year results released in september confirmed double digit growth in online sales whilst management reaffirmed its full year guidance the portfolio s absolute performance was also supported by its exposure to international growth opportunities stock selection within this theme proved decisive as holdings in bae systems and homeserve were amongst the portfolio s best performing stocks over the period homeserve released full year results in may which were ahead of market expectations the company delivered another year of strong organic revenue growth and confirmed a double digit increase in the annual dividend meanwhile bae systems traded well over much of the period the company released supportive half year results in july that showed double digit profit growth fuelled by an increase in us defence spending relative performance also benefitted from the portfolio s zero weighting in the metals mining sector which proved highly volatile amid geopolitical tensions conversely the non inclusion of several highly rated internationally focussed ftse 100 stocks proved to be a drag to relative performance tobacco remains a prominent theme with investments in altria british american tobacco and imperial brands which have delivered exceptional returns for shareholders over the long term however the sector continued to prove challenging for performance investor sentiment towards the tobacco sector was impacted by revived fears around regulation whilst the release of underwhelming sales data for imperial brands next generation technology reignited concerns around the outlook for future revenues the portfolio s significant weighting in the sector proved challenging for relative performance with the impact of negative returns from non uk index stock altria a significant detractor to relative returns despite these persistent concerns the manager remains confident in the outlook for the sector particularly given his view that the headwinds outlined are reflected in depressed valuations across the sector the portfolio s final theme proved the most substantive driver of weakness during the period burford capital was the standout detractor to returns having been a strong contributor to fund performance over many years burford capital provided the portfolio s largest negative return over the period in august 2019 the litigation financer was the subject of a highly critical report from a us firm that specialises in publishing research for short sellers this caused a very material fall in the company s share price burford capital robustly defended itself against the accusations and later announced a series of corporate governance enhancements whilst the share price recovered some losses during september the value of this holding remained significantly lower at period end elsewhere within the non correlated financials holdings amigo also provided a negative contribution to returns the share price was weak towards the end of the period as concerns grew around the regulatory focus for the guarantor backed loan sector the share price fell sharply at the end of august on the release of results for the first quarter when the company cut its full year guidance and announced a change in lending strategy to prioritise new customer lending over repeat customer lending despite these specific challenges there were a number of holdings within this area that performed well over the period notably beazley and hiscox it should also be noted that a small number of holdings saw persistently weak share prices in the absence of any meaningful company news this cohort comprised a number of stocks in which there was a cross holding with a forced seller which further compounded the already depressed market sentiment whilst this short term share price disruption was not isolated to the portfolio of the edinburgh investment trust plc it has proven extremely frustrating we maintain the view that the long term outlook and inherent value of those companies impacted is unchanged portfolio manager outlook the performance of the uk stock market is likely to be determined by the same macroeconomic and political forces which have dominated sentiment for the past few years the political uncertainty in many regions has been especially difficult to navigate recently and has been a major headwind to portfolio performance given the extreme polarisation of company valuations that has emerged it has been commented here previously that this differential between highly rated global non cyclical stocks and depressed domestic economically sensitive shares is substantial this differential sits at a multi year high and offers the most glaring opportunities within the uk stock market the portfolio is positioned to take advantage of this perceived mispricing and retains large portfolio weightings in insurance real estate retail and support services the extent of this mispricing is perhaps most clearly highlighted by the spread between dividend yields and corporate bond yields over the past ten years over this period dividend yields have remained broadly flat whilst corporate bond yields have declined markedly a 650bp shift in the yield differential over the period is notable and represents another strong endorsement of the attraction of equities to an asset neutral investor at the moment it is also very likely a significant factor behind the strong re emergence of merger and acquisition activity in recent months the range and breadth of deals witnessed from industrial and especially financial buyers is clear evidence that there is value available in uk listed companies financed by accessing the debt markets at very attractive yields the portfolio has been a beneficiary of two such deals bca marketplace and kcom that have been announced since the year end and i am confident that there will be more to follow in the coming months there had over the past six years been a modest increase in the number of holdings in the portfolio however more recently this trend has started to reverse accelerating in the period due to two factors the extreme opportunities present within the market and the removal of three holdings due to completed acquisition activity as a result of these changes the portfolio has become slightly more biased towards large companies although the themes expressed in the portfolio namely uk domestic value selective international industries and non correlated financial companies has remained broadly similar to previously the emphasis on cash generative businesses paying sustainable and growing dividends is resolutely unchanged in recent weeks sentiment within the market has been extremely volatile as perceptions around a political deal have shifted this has resulted in a marked change in the composition of the stock and sector leadership which has favoured the current positioning within the portfolio a sense of relief and clarity regarding the outcome of the negotiations with brussels is clearly a benefit to the performance of the uk stock market and especially this portfolio the level of pessimism which is discounted in the valuations of many holdings is anticipated to result in material revaluation opportunities from current levels as and when the political fog clears mark barnett james goldstone portfolio manager deputy portfolio manager 10 december 2019 principal risks and uncertainties the principal risk factors relating to the company can be summarised as follows market risk a fall in the stock market as a whole will affect the performance of the portfolio as well as the performance of individual portfolio investments it also includes interest rate and currency risks market risk may be impacted by increased volatility during the period of uncertainty arising from the brexit negotiations investment performance risk this is the stock specific risk that the stock selection process may not achieve the company s published objectives gearing and borrowing risk in addition to the debenture in issue the company may also borrow money for investment purposes if the investments fall in value the gearing will have an adverse impact on performance if the borrowing facility could not be renewed the company might have to sell investments to repay this income dividend risk investment income may fail to reach the level required to meet the company s income objective share price risk the company s prospects and nav may not be fully reflected in the share price control systems risk the board relies on the effectiveness of the manager s control systems which include control activities in fund management operations financial controls meeting regulatory requirements and managing relations with third parties reliance on manager and other third party providers risk the company has no employees so is reliant upon the performance of third party service providers for it to function particularly the manager depositary custodian and registrar and other risks the company may be affected by other risks such as business cyber security strategic policy and political risks as well as regulatory risks such as an adverse change in the tax treatment of investment companies and the perceived impact of the manager ceasing to be involved with the company a detailed explanation of these principal risks and uncertainties can be found on pages 14 to 16 of the 2019 annual financial report which is available on the company s section of the manager s website at www invesco co uk edinburgh in the view of the board these principal risks and uncertainties are substantially unchanged from the previous year end and are as much applicable to the remaining six months of the financial year as they were to the six months under review as highlighted in the annual financial report the manager s style may result in a concentrated portfolio in addition the manager manages other portfolios holding many of the same stocks as the company which reflects the manager s high conviction style of investment management this could potentially increase liquidity risk under certain scenarios and market conditions investments in order of

concerns over fed govt s 30b loan request the recent 30 billion loan request forwarded to the national assembly by president muhammadu buhari for consideration and approval has continued to raise dust writes sanni onogu the muhammadu buhari administration may go down eventually as one with a very huge appetite for debts lately it forwarded to the federal legislature request to borrow another 30 billion loan and has been going round to convince nigerians that as usual the loan was needed to provide critical national infrastructure but such arguments have refused to jell financial experts labour unions opposition political parties and international financial institutions like the international monetary fund imf and the world bank have all described the growing debt as a death trap and queried the administration s unquenchable thirst for more they alleged that a higher percentage of these loans in the last four years ended up in private pockets they insisted that any loan that is not strictly for the provision of infrastructure is not needed though details of the specific projects the loan is meant to finance are still sketchy it is instructive that previous request which was anchored on the 2016 2018 external borrowing plan of the federal government was rejected by the eighth national assembly in an attached memo president buhari had lamented that though the request was not approved in its entirety by the legislature the outstanding projects in the plan that were not approved by the legislature are critical to the delivery of the government s programmes relating to power mining roads agriculture health water and educational sectors the debt management office dmo put nigeria s debt stock at 81 27 billion as at end of march 2019 the dmo s website shows that as at the end of march 2015 two months before buhari took over on 29 may the country owed a total of n12 trillion at the end of june 2015 barely a month in power the debt rose marginally by n12 1 trillion which is equivalent of 63 8 billion at the old official exchange rate of n196 95 the report added that by the end of june 2018 total public debt had almost doubled to n22 4 trillion the increase according to the dmo comprised a 2 5 billion eurobond issued by the government in february 2018 this took nigeria s total debt to 73 2 billion using the 2018 official exchange rate of n305 to the dollar the nation s total debt stock as at the end of march 2019 according to the dmo stood at 81 27billion in view of additional loans secured by the government while experts have pointed out the unsustainable trajectory of the debt the dmo which coordinates the management of the nation s debt stock however justified the borrowings in its 2017 report while nigeria s total public debt stock is relatively low vis à vis the country s gdp the increased funding requirements needed to sustain the economic recovery address the huge infrastructural gaps as well as meet budget financing requirements would entail enormous funding resources including borrowing the agency had stated however a chieftain of the all progressives congress apc daniel bwala threw his weight behind the federal government s move for more loans bwala a lawyer who spoke as a guest on sunday politics on channel s television said telling a government not to borrow was easier said than done intriguing enough any government that comes to power before coming to power they will kick against borrowing but when they come to power and they are faced with reality they will have to face the issue i am in support of borrowing because if you have infrastructure deficit if you have the problem of managing between that revenue ratio and the borrowing then you have a problem bwala said he further insisted that no economist would argue the fact that a country needs to borrow if it must tackle the problem of infrastructure he nevertheless opined that the government needed to set up a task force as a department in the economic and financial crimes commission efcc to monitor projects which the borrowed money was meant to execute the buhari media organisation bmo had also defended the president s decision to represent the 30billion request to the national assembly the body averred that the request was in the interest of the country the chairman of the bmo niyi akinsiju in a statement in abuja said the funds were necessary in order for the country to bridge the nation s infrastructure gaps akinsiju argued that if the request had been fully granted in 2016 nigerians would have seen more projects at various stages of completion across the country while acknowledging that government officials have over the years misappropriated both internal and external loans the bmo chief said we make bold to say this president is different just in case many are not aware external borrowing is an integral part of the financial plan for the current budget so as it stands the country is committed to doing what is necessary to bridge the country s infrastructural deficit however a former governorship candidate of the action democratic party adp in lagos state mr babatunde gbadamosi urged the federal government to save the nation from sinking gbadamosi who spoke on national television on sunday described those managing the nation s economy as amateur while reacting to the fresh request for the approval of the 2016 2018 external borrowing plan he said stop borrowing open up the economy open the land borders allow trade remove forex restrictions stop trying to micromanage the foreign exchange rates the association of senior civil servants of nigeria ascsn has also opposed the planned borrowing presently on the table of the national assembly ascsn s president comrade bobboi kaigama described the request as both unfortunate and worrisome the ascsn boss warned that there is the need for the government to access well structured public loans that will only be for projects of utmost national importance and for which expected revenues accruable from such projects will be able to repay the loans without saddling coming generations with repayment burden kaigama rued the difficulty in meeting up with debt servicing obligations the lagos chamber of commerce and industry lcci has raised the red flag about nigeria s huge debt profile and its poor capacity to service the debts the director general of lcci mr muda yusuf is worried that whereas nigeria s capital budget in 2019 was n2 9trillion its debt service provision was n2tn this implies that the debt service commitment is 70 per cent of the capital budget allocation yusuf said continuing the lcci chief said the growing national debt is a cause for concern as the debt profile grew from n12 6tn in 2015 to n25tn in 2019 second quarter an increase of 104 per cent there is also a bigger worry about the capacity to service the debt in the 2020 budget debt service commitment and recurrent spending are beginning to crowd out capital expenditure this trajectory is inconsistent with the administration s to build infrastructure and make the economy competitive debt service of n2 45tn is more than the capital budget of n2 14tn in the 2020 budget that is 114 per cent of the capital budget for him pitched against the backdrop of the growing unserviceable debts the new request for 30bn is troubling rising in opposition to further borrowing the director african centre for peace and development senator shehu sani defended the decision of the eighth national assembly to reject buhari s 30billion loan request sani who represented the kaduna central district in the last senate said the legislature did not want the country to sink into a trap of perpetual debt sani was then chairman senate committee on local and foreign debts he insisted that with the current upswing in borrowings nigerians will one day wake up to find that they are now tenants in their own houses we turned down the federal government loan request for 30 billion to save nigeria from sinking into the dark gully of a perpetual debt trap we don t want our country to be re colonised by creditor banks our external debt in 2015 was 10 32billion and it escalated to 22 08 in the second quarter this year which is 114 per cent if we had approved that loan request our external debt would have catapulted to over 52 billion and that is not sustainable with the current escalation in borrowing we will be walking into debt slavery and move from landlords to tenants in our country they will always tell you that even america is borrowing and i don t know how rational is it to keep on borrowing because another country is borrowing if we keep listening to bankers and contractors we will keep borrowing and burying ourselves and leave behind for our children a legacy of the debt burden loans are not charities most of those encouraging more borrowing are parasitic consultants commission agents rent seeking fronts and contractors we must be cautious sani declared former vice president atiku abubakar similarly lamented that the country under buhari has obtained more loans in the last three years than it did in the 30 year period preceding 2016 atiku said this position was revealed by a former chief executive officer nigeria economic summit group nesg prof anya o anya atiku who spoke while delivering a speech at the 14th founders day ceremony of the american university of nigeria in yola the adamawa state capital said that it is troubling that the country recorded such a humongous increase in borrowings but with an unprecedented reduction in investments in education to the chairman senate committee on national planning and economic affairs senator olubunmi adetunmbi it is quite possible that if the country s revenue mobilisation architecture is sufficiently safeguarded against leakages nigeria may not need to borrow as much as it is borrowing adetunmbi who was answering questions from senate correspondents said in the absence of necessary blockages the country should either scale down on its aspirations in terms of what it wants to do or look for alternative means of sourcing funds he would rather want nigerians to follow the money to make sure it is being judiciously utilised by the government rather seeking to know where the money is coming from that is the reality and there is no shying away from the fact it is difficult to say that borrowing is not healthy for the economy because even in corporations there is a difference between equity and loans it is not everything you can do with your own resources and that is why lending institutions are there i think nigerians should begin to get more interested in following the money rather than questioning where the money is coming from i encourage nigerians to follow the money whether it is internally generated or borrowed let s follow the money and make sure that it delivers value to the economy i think that will be a useful way to spend our time whether borrowed money personal money or national money none of it deserves to be wasted it is the duty of the media to ensure that they follow this money and ask questions appropriately adetunmbi said regrettably most nigerians believe the ninth assembly under its present leadership should return the document to buhari without its approval stamp regardless of the dire implications for the future of the very people they represent the mad rush for debts low interest rates and a long moratorium on repayment notwithstanding they argued will leave nigeria and its unborn generations a charred and miserable future nigerians look up to the national assembly will it rise up in their defence

washington cnn the federal reserve has erased nearly half of all the rate increases of the past two years since july but now the central bank is expected to halt any further cuts even as president donald trump continues to push for more the reason it s still not clear where the global economy may be heading next year and any additional rate cuts now will only leave policymakers with fewer tools to help cushion the us if things turn sour federal reserve chairman jerome powell made clear in congressional testimony last month that while the fed is reviewing its recession fighting toolkit now would be a good time for congress to address the nation s ballooning budget deficits in order to be able to use its fiscal firepower when the next downturn hits putting the federal budget on a sustainable path would aid the long term vigor of the us economy and help ensure that policymakers have the space to use fiscal policy to assist in stabilizing the economy if it weakens he told lawmakers in november the former scholar and private equity investor has repeatedly sent a reassuring message that should the economy weaken policymakers would have an array of tools to step in such as resuming bond purchases but powell cautioned that the current low interest rate environment may limit the ability of monetary policy to support the economy in the past the fed has been able to lower its federal funds rate by an average of 5 percentage points in prior downturns he said but now powell said we don t have that kind of room no imminent risks while the fed chairman doesn t envision an imminent risk to the economy now in its 11th year of expansion he has pointed to sluggish global growth and persistent trade uncertainty as two threats it s for those reasons that the fed cut interest rates three times this year starting in july to avoid the us economy from slipping into a recession the fed has learned the hard way that trade policy can change in the speed of a tweet one of the major reasons they were forced to cut rates in 2019 said diane swonk chief economist at grant thornton powell has been under tremendous pressure all year avoiding economic landmines triggered by turbulent trade negotiations between the united states and china while simultaneously dodging trump s persistent attacks to slash interest rates to zero more than three weeks ago the fed chairman was invited to the white house to meet with trump and treasury secretary steven mnuchin the president said in a tweet following the meeting that he protested to powell that interest rates were too high compared to other countries the us competes with trump pushing for lower rates since last year trump has kept up his attacks on his fed chairman whom he nominated for the job more than two years ago in november 2017 especially as he makes the economy a centerpiece of his re election campaign the fed should lower rates there is almost no inflation and loosen making us competitive with other nations and manufacturing will soar dollar is very relative to others trump said in a tweet after data was released in early december showing a fourth straight month decline in us manufacturing activity even so the world s largest economy has been holding up well so far as consumers continue to keep spending and job growth showed signs of strengthening even further in november powell has more recently described the us economy as a star performer and expressed confidence that the expansion can persist his comments have helped to reinforce the message that policymakers plan to wait and see how the us economy evolves as long as it stays on track beyond the december meeting we see a high bar for policy moves in either direction and we expect the funds rate to remain unchanged in 2020 wrote jan hatzius chief economist at investment bank goldman sachs in a note to clients since their last interest rate policy setting meeting in october powell and his colleagues have made the case that monetary policy is in a good place and is unlikely to change for some time unless there is some material change the committee has widely signaled a desire to pause after three rate cuts convinced earlier action is already working to stabilize the economy a thesis further supported by friday s stronger than expected jobs report said lindsey piegza chief economist at stifel fixed income no december change expected fed officials are expected to hold rates at their final december meeting on wednesday leaving them to hover between 1 5 and 1 75 those plans have also been aided by the fact that trade uncertainty has eased this week with a deal on a revised north american free trade agreement on the table and while markets may be pricing in one more rate cut some next year analysts are doubtful over the likelihood that the fed will take action for some time to come even if the economy grows stronger than expected even though they would never admit it to the public the chances of fed officials sanctioning a rate hike next year during a politically charge election campaign are close to zero said paul ashworth chief us economist at capital economics the fed will be in no rush to hike rates again

in 1993 the year before the north american free trade agreement took effect the united states exported to mexico almost 73 billion in today s dollars worth of goods this year u s firms will export roughly four times that amount to mexico and thanks to the deal just unveiled in congress to pass the usmca there s every reason to expect that number will continue to grow free trade has become unfashionable in the trump era with even conservatives talking up the value of industrial policy and trade barriers as economic or national security measures but this welcome deal for passage of the usmca serves as a reminder that even though nafta was not perfect it dramatically improved the lives of the average mexican canadian and american alike this is the way the world works free trade tends to work to everyone s mutual benefit and it will keep doing so despite the various ups and downs that the economy has experienced since nafta took effect in 1994 u s real per capita gdp has increased by 50 mexico s has increased by 26 both nations have seen their living standards improve but the improvements in mexico are more jarring because they started off so much worse mexican living standards firmly in third world territory 25 years ago have risen to the point that mexican illegal immigration is no longer a top tier concern not even for the most hardened immigration hawks according to the world bank the average mexican now produces twice as much net wealth as the average guatemalan or salvadoran and nearly four times as much as the average honduran the fact that mexico has had a closer and longer lasting trading relationship with its northern english speaking neighbors is not coincidental to this development free trade is counterintuitive by the individual primitive survival instinct man strives for some degree of self sufficiency in his dealings but trade has throughout history lifted up and rewarded those nations that dared open themselves up for it the british japanese south koreans americans and chinese each in their own turn have discovered this to their great benefit and other nations such as vietnam continue to do so today likewise there is always a price associated with the abandonment of free trade principles one such price americans are paying right now comes in the form of huge subsidies to farmers these growers were previously capable of paying their own way they fed the world and put food on their own tables in the process but the ongoing tariff war with china has turned them into government dependents at least temporarily conservatives should recognize the tragedy in this example even if the u s dispute with china centers around justifiable national security concerns as some argue it does it is important to acknowledge that it is still making americans poorer those government payments to farmers are a tacit admission by the trump administration that trade protectionism is a natural enemy of jobs and growth the usmca on the other hand represents a win for everyone and especially for president trump it may confer a political benefit on him and his reelection effort but this effect is the result of the common good that the trade deal serves meanwhile trump should continue to negotiate more such deals with china with the pacific nations with continental europe and with post brexit britain as a candidate trump claimed during the 2016 election that he is not against trade deals only dumb trade deals here is his chance to make good on that promise and to make his own reelection more likely in the process
