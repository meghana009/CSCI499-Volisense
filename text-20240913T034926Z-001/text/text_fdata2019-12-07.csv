according to the dictionary the word angst refers to a feeling of deep anxiety or dread typically an unfocused one about the human condition or the state of the world in general it comes from a german word for fear two weeks ago i referred back to my 2017 angst in america series deep anxiety or dread is exactly what i described then and it hasn t improved for most people for some yes life is good and getting better at least financially not so for every american or even most of us yes life could be even harder poverty living standards in the us are better than much of the world knows but that doesn t reduce the angst because we compare our conditions to what we see around us or in the media we consume today i want to bring some focus to this unfocused anxiety we will see that much of it though certainly not all traces back to specific policies of a specific institution that has a specific mission it is failing to achieve furthermore that angst is going to rise up and bite us in our political derrière at some point in the future and that gives me a great deal of personal angst because i don t think the results will be pleasant for anyone before we begin i want to call your attention to an opportunity to get six free months of a newsletter i read every day jared dillian s the daily dirtnap jared s market analysis is almost supernaturally sharp i m genuinely not sure how

for the price of 12 it s a truly wonderful offer click here to join me and thousands of other dirts contrary to popular opinion the federal reserve system is not independent nor does it have to follow the president s orders as much as donald trump wishes it would the fed operates under a legal mandate from congress its monetary policy role is to promote maximum employment stable prices and moderate long term interest rates so how is it doing long term rates are certainly moderate employment is historically high though wages and job quality aren t always great as for that stable prices part it depends on what you are buying as you see below for many goods the price is nowhere near stable unfortunately if you are in the bottom 60 70 of the income brackets these are some of the things you buy the most source sebastian sienkiewicz the fed believes that 2 annual inflation equals stable prices yet that small amount adds up over time to almost 50 in 20 years which is about where cpi lands in this 20 year chart so the fed is succeeding by that yardstick think about that for a second the fed defines stable prices as a 2 average and then another government agency tries to measure those prices often using hedonic quality adjustment to account for changes due to innovation or completely new products so because the car you are buying has new features they conclude it s not more expensive does that match your experience thought so cpi doesn t reflect real life spending for most people prices have risen dramatically more than average for some of life s basic necessities so if you wonder why people are anxious this might be a clue the fed either doesn t see this or doesn t think it is a problem officials have been wringing their hands for years at their inability to make inflation reach that 2 level the financial times reported last week that they may soon change their rules the federal reserve is considering introducing a rule that would let inflation run above its 2 percent target a potentially significant shift in its interest rate policy the fed s year long review of its monetary policy tools is due to conclude next year and according to interviews with current and former policymakers the central bank is considering a promise that when it misses its inflation target it will then temporarily raise that target to make up for lost inflation the idea would be to avoid entrenching low us price growth which has consistently undershot its goal the key here is that 2 average inflation isn t the same as 2 all the time having run below 2 for years fed leaders now want to go above it potentially far above it and for long periods in other words give themselves permission not to worry about the inflation a low rate policy might otherwise cause like what you re

noted yesterday bottom line inflation is not going to be an issue for the fed too high or too low for a while whether looking at cpi or the fed favorite pce it is difficult to see an impending surge in underlying inflation this should help keep longer term yields in check with a pick up in activity in 2020 tariffs are already showing up in the data but do not matter much for the indexes while fed officials may think they have tamed inflation their zirp and qe actually drove real world prices considerably higher than cpi or pce show it showed up mainly in asset valuations like stocks and real estate these in turn drove up other prices like housing aggregate inflation isn t higher because technology and globalization reduced manufactured goods costs and the shale revolution kept energy costs low try to look at this like an average worker your rent keeps rising your kids can t go to college without racking up debt your health insurance is astronomical and your wages while up a bit aren t keeping up with your living costs meanwhile the people who are supposed to be looking out for you keep talking about how the economy is improving thanks to their brilliant policies of course you re angst ridden how could you not be in part 2 of angst in america i talked about the deaths of despair among middle aged white men this alarming and uniquely american trend is getting worse last month an american medical association study found us average life expectancy which had been steadily increasing for decades has now dropped for three consecutive years it actually goes back a little further all cause mortality rates began rising in 2010 for some groups it went back to the 1990s ama zeroes in on the driver a major contributor has been an increase in mortality from specific causes e g drug overdoses suicides organ system diseases among young and middle aged adults of all racial groups with an onset as early as the 1990s and with the largest relative increases occurring in the ohio valley and new england the opioid crisis apparently has a lot to do with this as do the globalization driven factory closures in the midwest and new england economic changes are literally killing us but again think about this from ground level under employed factory workers don t read a lot of economic analysis they just know they can t pay the bills they re in physical pain from a life of hard labor and no one in power seems to care many go on disability which is not even close to minimum wage and massively discouraging for somebody who wants to work for some it leads to depression and tragically overdoses or suicide and it s common enough to bend the curve in national life expectancy stats that had been rising for decades worse it s not like we are powerless to treat these conditions medical science knows what to do and does it pretty well for those with the means to pay for americans that means people who a are over 65 and on medicare or b are poor enough to get medicaid or c get health insurance through their employers everyone else like self employed people or gig workers not so much here s a tweet from my friend luke gromen source luke gromen those prices are pretty typical if you re trying to buy insurance on the obamacare exchanges and you re middle aged and not subsidy eligible for illustration let s apply luke s prices to a hypothetical self employed person making 100 000 a year the 1 286 month premiums add up to 15 432 annually but you get no benefits except a basic wellness exam until you ve spent another 12 500 that totals 27 932 or 27 9 of your gross income that will go to healthcare if anyone in your family gets even a minor illness a lot of angst let s take that a little further this self employed person is paying 12 000 in social security plus another 3 000 in medicare plus federal income tax in addition to state and local taxes which means that if someone in that hypothetical family gets sick the family has to figure out how to make all of their payments on maybe as little as 45 000 net after taxes and healthcare and in that scenario then what spending that much of your income on healthcare means something else must go or it will turn into medical debt and possible bankruptcy even if you have insurance the irony is that much of the country thinks you are rolling in cash and might be inclined to vote for someone who would raise your taxes source dqydj like what you re reading get this free newsletter in your inbox every saturday read our privacy policy here first name this is required email this is required subscribe for free recaptcha the angst isn t just severe it is creeping up the income ladder double that example worker s income to 200 000 and they re still spending 7 7 of it on insurance premiums and potentially another 6 3 to meet the deductible imagine the outcry if we imposed extra income taxes at those rates that s effectively what is happening remember the yellow vest protests in france they were about a new gasoline tax small potatoes really but at the risk of a really bad pun it just threw gasoline onto a stretched too thin public fire at some point we may see the same kind of unrest here and healthcare costs could easily trigger it yes yes i know the us has the best healthcare in the world that s debatable given these latest mortality numbers but we certainly have the most expensive healthcare source forbes by the way this cost difference is roughly the same if you look at it in percent of gdp terms oecd has the data here how do we spend so much and still have people dying from despair that s another topic my point today is that the way we distribute that spending is having seriously negative economic effects we can and should debate reform ideas but this can t go on indefinitely get 6 months of jared dillian s the daily dirtnap for free through december 9 only find out more healthcare is just one source of angst here s another look at inflation which according to the fed is not high enough source lisa abramowicz the education part deserves some comment the narrative goes that today s young people need more education because work is so much more complicated now so we push them to attend college higher demand and slow growing supply raise the cost of college so they and or their families go into debt to pay for it does it pay off sometimes but far from always the chart below breaks down the change in college graduate wages since 2000 by percentile in most cases after that 2 average inflation the fed thinks is too low real wages actually dropped over this period and note this only looks at those who actually earn degrees millions drop out before getting that far but not before racking up debt source economic policy institute so not only is college more expensive the economic benefit you get from it may well be negative this is inflation on steroids let s think about that for a moment you graduated in 2000 at age 22 got married had kids and right about now you re facing college costs what s happened to the price of college up over 130 in 20 years a tad more than 2 inflation look this isn t complicated for most people they need housing somewhere in proximity to their jobs they want their kids to be safe and have opportunities and they need to take care of their health none of those are optional and their costs have risen far more than overall inflation to be clear i m not predicting higher cpi pce inflation even if the fed gets more dovish its present course will more likely produce more of the same an asset bubble lower prices for certain goods and stable rising prices for others it won t solve the problems regular people face and in fairness the fed is not alone in thinking inflation is no problem source donald j trump trump is correct if he means the broad inflation measures like cpi though as we have seen even 2 is not almost no inflation over long periods he s seriously wrong about the things middle class americans including the millions who voted for him must buy just to keep their heads above water those goods are expensive and getting more so what we really need are policies that make middle class life affordable again lower interest rates won t likely do that not when as my friend peter boockvar reported last week the average price of a new car is 34 000 and median household income is 64 000 and it s that high only because millions need those cars to commute to underpaid jobs far far away from the distant suburbs where they can afford to live like what you re reading get

found a fascinating time article by emily guendelsberger who wrote a book called on the clock what low wage work did to me and how it drives america insane she describes her experiences working in warehouses call centers and fast food i have family members who have worked at the places she names and their stories match conditions are more than a little stressful i wasn t prepared for how exhausting working at amazon would be it took my body two weeks to adjust to the agony of walking 15 miles a day and doing hundreds of squats but as the physical stress got more manageable the mental stress of being held to the productivity standards of a robot became an even bigger problem technology has enabled employers to enforce a work pace with no room for inefficiency squeezing every ounce of downtime out of workers days the scan gun i used to do my job was also my own personal digital manager every single thing i did was monitored and timed after i completed a task the scan gun not only immediately gave me a new one but also started counting down the seconds i had left to do it it also alerted a manager if i had too many minutes of time off task at my warehouse you were expected to be off task for only 18 minutes per shift mine was 6 30 a m to 6 p m which included using the bathroom getting a drink of water or just walking slower than the algorithm dictated though we did have a 30 minute unpaid lunch it created a constant buzz of low grade panic and the isolation and monotony of the work left me feeling as if i were losing my mind imagine experiencing that month after month vice is starting a series on what it s like to work at low paying jobs the first installment from a young lady describing her experience working at mcdonald s for 9 30 an hour is deeply troubling you can t read it and not be emotionally moved i mentioned above that even though the poverty level in the us is well above international average incomes people compare their situation to what they see my friend philippa dunne at the liscio report showed two charts demonstrating older generations read boomers are doing much better than gen xers and especially millennials source the liscio report source the liscio report i understand the economic theories that gdp growth will eventually spread widely enough to ease the angst but i am not sure we can wait that long people are hurting now and they are increasingly willing to embrace radical solutions just wait for better times is not cutting it as technology eats into higher paying jobs and aggravates the stress of lower income jobs that s doubly true if the economy weakens some of the data improved a bit in recent weeks the november jobs report showed much stronger growth than we ve seen in a while that s good to see and suggests we might postpone recession past 2020 but merely avoiding recession isn t enough another year of sub 2 growth which is my base case will be another year of suffering for the millions whom this weak recovery hasn t helped and it s not clear that we can avoid a recession one third of economists surveyed by the wall street journal think we will see a recession next year and almost 2 3s see a recession by 2021 source john mauldin danielle dimartino booth whose daily feather is a must read for me showed this yesterday source quill intelligence danielle explains the above chart non manufacturing hours worked have slowed appreciably with growth falling below 2 in the seven months ended october the adp report confirmed the weakness in hours worked and exhibited broad based job declines and slowing across the full spectrum of sectors trade deal headlines and fed liquidity continue to dictate market trading the widening breadth of economic weakness suggests fundamentals will eventually prevail though it will take a weak nonfarm payrolls print to truly get the market s attention no one should be surprised the lower 80 of the income pyramid is anxious and depressed you would be too in their situation and there s a good chance you will be in their situation in a few years because angst ridden people can still vote economic theories aren t relevant to them they look at their own situations and want change history suggests that president trump should win reelection unless recession strikes by next november but even if we avoid a recession in 2020 what happens if there is one in 2021 or 2022 democrats could gain power by 2024 if not sooner the already growing annual budget deficit will soar to over 2 trillion how do we finance that without creating more angst i can easily imagine a populist democrat winning the white house followed by higher taxes and an echo recession then even higher deficits and the national debt spinning out of control the fed will give us massive quantitative easing and zero rates but they may be in fact pushing on a string we don t have much time to get our house in order either in the us or globally everything i ve said today applies to various degrees throughout the developed world thinking that 2 inflation or zero interest rates coupled with massive deficits will somehow help is beyond wishful thinking we can and should take steps to protect our individual families and lives but that s not enough at the national level i m beginning to fear only an enormously stressful great reset will deliver the deep but necessary sacrifices the partisan divide inhibits compromise so nothing happens and the problems grow think about the late 1930s hopefully with just economic turmoil not kinetic war it will be hard but without the kind of motivation i really question whether we will do what it takes sigh normally i end these letters talking about my travels and some personal story but this one has me in a far too reflective

electric cars are perfect for socialists labor plan boosts big gov but worse for co2 pollution coal use and grid labor s electric car plan means higher emissions more pollution more coal use and threatens the grid but it s great for socialists fantasy land labor wants half of all new cars sales to be ev s by 2030 that s a radical change in a big country that loves its cars and drives great distances last year only 0 2 of new car purchases were ev s our grid is already struggling and extra charging cars would push it over the edge and may add something like 20b a year in extra network and generation costs this makes no sense on so many levels in australia ev s are 80 fossil fuel powered and over their lifetime they cause more pollution than internal combustion engines electric vehicles produce more carbon emissions if the grid that charges them is powered by fossil fuels the results reveal that the energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions of a battery electric vehicle production range from 92 4 to 94 3 gj and 15 0 to 15 2 t co 2 eq which are about 50 higher than those of an internal combustion engine vehicle 63 5 gj and 10 0 t co 2 eq this substantial change can be mainly attributed to the production of traction batteries the essential components for battery electric vehicles qiao 2017 an electric car recharged by a coal fired plant produces as much co2 as a gasoline powered car that gets 29 miles per gallon 12 3 km l sivak 2017 in a coal fired country ev s achieve nothing for carbon emissions but over their lifecycle they re worse for human toxicity freshwater eco toxicity freshwater eutrophication and mineral resource depletion hawkins 2012 ev s are so useless for the environment you might wonder why labor and the greens love them take your pick labor green policitians are honest but stupid labor green politicans don t care less about the environment but want a great socialist car with our coal fired grid and long distances the only place on earth less suited to ev s is antarctica where it is too cold for the batteries to work and where people die when they run out of fuel although at least antarcticans won t have to worry about extreme heat setting their batteries on fire electric vehicles in australia are 80 powered by fossil fuels unless our grid power goes nuclear the electricity draining into these cars is 60 coal fired 20 natural gas and diesel powered and 20 renewable the coal percentage would presumably be even higher if they get charged at night like most electric vehicles surely are figures from dept of environment and energy 99 8 of australians don t want an ev this is a wild transformation currently 499 australians out of 500 choose anything but an ev behyad jafari chief executive of the electric vehicle council which worked with labor on the plan said ev sales in australia totalled 2216 last year or about one in 500 cars sold peter hannam smh as i said with the greens policy only one in 4000 cars currently on the road in australia is electric there are about 20 million cars currently registered in australia the total car pool of all electric vehicles sold here since australia was federated is about 5 000 cars making ev s 0 025 per cent of all cars on the road you can see how much we love them the australian energy market commission aemc released a warning in 2013 that electric cars will cost a lot more than just the purchase price and the electricity electric vehicles in particular are another new appliance which is set to place new demands on australia s power system this review has found that each electric vehicle could impose additional network and generation costs from 7500 up to 10 000 per vehicle over the 5 years from 2015 to 2020 in the absence of appropriate pricing signals and efficient charging decisions who pays for the extra generation capacity under current market arrangements all consumers would have to pay this extra cost regardless of whether they owned an electric car using the amex figures if half our 20 million cars were electric that would add another 20 billion dollars a year to network and generation costs and that was in 2013 prices new fat batteries on ev s draw so much current we need a whole new grid new bigger batteries need two days to charge at 7kw which is like adding three new houses to the grid and that s the good option if consumers want to fast charge who wouldn t the 50kw option is like adding 20 homes vector new zealand report 2018 ten million cars fast charging at the same time would be like adding 200 million homes to the grid psycho ev s are perfect for socialists because no one wants them without subsidies all around the world consumers need lavish subsidies and rewards to be coerced into buying ev s governments have to offer subsidies in china india japan denmark norway and practically every country on earth in south korea the subsidy is something like us 12 000 in norway electric vehicles are exempt from purchase taxes which are extremely high for other cars they re also exempt from the annual road tax all public parking fees and toll payments how much icing does that cake need a lot sales of ev s collapsed from 2000 cars to just 32 cars in hong kong when subsidies were withdrawn last year australia s electric vehicle council predicted more than three million electric vehicles could be on australian roads within 12 years that s along way short of ten million the council wants 7000 tax breaks for buyers of electric vehicles ev s in australia just cost too much the mitsubishi imiev

another week and another glut of evidence that the australian economy is flatlining growth figures showed that households have stopped spending and that the economy is being propped up by a few government projects the next day retail sales growth came in at exactly 0 showing that consumers have taken the coalition s tax cuts and used them to pay off debt but as josh frydenberg rebuffs the reserve bank s calls for huge new federal spending and instead trumpets the possibility of returning australia pty ltd to surplus it seems increasingly likely the denizens of martin place will cut the cash rate again in february to kickstart the economy this is starting to feel like groundhog day the rba has already cut rates three times this year in line with similar moves in the united states europe and asia and failed to move the dial on growth most economists doubt that it will make any difference even if the cash rate sinks to 0 25 as many predict but a radically different way of managing the economy is gaining more and more attention and could reshape the way we think about society they talk of surplus as if it s the norm but it isn t prof bill mitchell when alexandria ocasio cortez burst onto the american political scene this year her suggestions for a green new deal became associated with a way of seeing economics known as modern monetary theory mmt one of its leading lights is prof bill mitchell of the university of newcastle who says that in contrast to the prevailing monetarist orthodoxy of the past 40 years countries cannot and should not be run like a corner shop he argues that any country such as australia that issues its own currency can create as much money as it needs to meet the needs of its people and not worry about frydenberg style balancing of the books you can t default on your own debt is the mantra of so called mmters who include high profile economists in the us such as one of bernie sanders 2016 campaign advisers stephanie kelton mitchell who helped develop the idea in the 1990s says the coalition won t make its surplus because the tide has turned on australia view image in fullscreen bernie sanders and alexandria ocasio cortez both associated with mmt photograph chip somodevilla getty images they talk of surplus as if it s the norm but it isn t he says australia has always run a small deficit of 2 3 the only way peter costello delivered a surplus was by deregulating banking so that household debt rose from 60 of disposable income in 1980 to 180 now it was a massive credit binge we have always said it would come unstuck but we just never said when australia s huge household debt means consumers are now fearing unemployment he says and they realise they have to stop spending the last time australia came close to recession after the lehman crash in 2008 the treasury became unbelievably pragmatic and wayne swan switched overnight from fiscal conservatism to pumping funds into the system australia was the only advanced economy to avoid recession mitchell says there is a catch of course which is that a lot of economists don t think mmt would work creating your own money would led to inflation they say and the markets would have a field day by driving down currencies seen as devalued by taking the business of buying and selling debt away from independent central banks the obama era treasury secretary larry summers has called mmt fallacious others have sneeringly dubbed it the magic money tree while nobel laureate paul krugman who is on the left of economics thinking is also highly sceptical mitchell dismisses these concerns and argues that runaway inflation could be curbed by judicious government management and adds that the threat of financial markets is overrated i don t see it as a problem if the currency sold off you can just introduce capital controls and that would be the end of that the legislative system would triumph he says citing iceland s success in forcing us hedge funds to accept losses after the country s banking system collapsed in 2008 instead of taking the neoliberal approach which was being forced on them by the british and the dutch they brought in capital controls and made the hedge funds take a hit markets can only work through the law of the land iceland did the right thing by their citizens the government s job is to protect the citizens not to guarantee private capital it s a powerful example given the mess that the uk and european authorities made of clearing up the global financial crisis after which private losses were essentially assumed by taxpayers who continue to pay the price in austerity even sceptics admit that the crisis proved to some extent that mmt might work the independent australian economist saul eslake says that the key tenet of the central bank effectively writing cheques for the government has to an extent already happened in japan after years of quantitative easing the money creation scheme seen in many countries after the gfc the evidence of the last 10 years can support the idea despite fears about quantitative easing leading to a collapse of the us dollar or runaway inflation this has not happened the problem is that inflation is too low across the western world the country that has come closest is japan where government holds debt equal to about 100 of gdp mitchell notes that what has happened in japan has confounded mainstream economists despite decades of money creation the country has a stable economy with low inflation and low unemployment the bank of japan boj says we are not a mmt laboratory but it makes me laugh he says mainstream economists can t explain any of it but mmt can explain all of it but eslake vice chancellor s fellow at the university of tasmania still thinks there would be a significant risk of a run on currencies and also questions whether the political cycle of regular elections would succeed in managing growth properly if politicians are controlling monetary policy then it can be manipulated for electoral purposes the central bank would not be independent he says many advocates don t think that s a problem but i m a bit more cynical about politicians but i don t dismiss this out of hand it s a legitimate question if there is another downturn there is virtually no room for conventional monetary policy the answer however might come from an unlikely source donald trump for mitchell the 2020 us election will come too early for champions of his thinking to emerge victorious but he believes the current resident of the white house by drastically increasing the us deficit is busy laying waste to the monetarist orthodoxy that has gripped international economic thinking for decades sanders is not really an mmter but he won t win joe biden is still frontrunner but he s a fiscal conservative and another hillary clinton so he won t win i think trump will probably win he says but trump s legacy is that he is destroying the republican party he s destroying the idea that fiscal deficits are bad and that there must be a debt ceiling catastrophist theorists about debt are on the way out trump said we re going to spend we issue the dollar so there s no way we are going to default on our own debt his legacy is not good in other ways but in fiscal terms he has shown that the mainstream economists have got it wrong he s just defied them this in turn will open the way for more radical thinking in the future it opens it up for democrats the likes of aoc will come through over time
the upcoming week is going to be a wild ride for those of us in the uk who are facing the most unpredictable election in modern times one that will dictate not just the domestic agenda over the next five years but also the brexit outcome it s no small issue biggest uk election in decades next week us and china seek deal before 15 december tariffs opec reaches deal on deeper output cuts while it may seem we re already into the holiday season and attention is shifting to office parties and shopping there is no shortage of talking points next week even outside of the uk trade talks between the us and china will continue to be a hot topic as both sides aim to secure a deal before 15 december tariff deadline hong kong protests have created further divisions between the worlds two largest economies and more are expected over the weekend uk election we ve entered the final week of the election campaign and traders are starting to feel a little overconfident whether that s the 10 point margin that the conservatives hold in the polls that would deliver a majority government or donald trump s visit ending without catastrophe confidence is creeping in if we hadn t been in this position before it may be understandable but this premature confidence has been punished before maybe this time they ve got it right there s obviously a risk that they ll be burned again the weekend is always a risky time for uk politics when we re this close to such an incredibly decisive day the prime ministerial debate on friday night is the first chance of the weekend for both to take aim at each other it could be fierce as the clock ticks down to election day with johnson s only aim to come out unscathed having already avoided numerous events including being questions by bbc s andrew neil he may face a number of uncomfortable questions us the biggest risk to the us stock market remains a progressive president currently polls are suggesting that seems to be very unlikely the current focus with us politics remains the impeachment process speaker nancy pelosi seems likely to get the ball going in the house but the senate firmly remains supportive of the president the risks of impeachment getting passed the senate are slim to none hong kong protests have subsided in hong kong this week with the government announcing more spending as the economy is now in a deep recession a march is

risk appetite has been positive this week and for the most part has ignored protest movements in the second part of the week trade optimism could soon turn into pessimism and with it the investors

in signaling they are on hold until any material changes to the outlook the fed is still evaluating what to do regarding the repo market upheaval and we could get an incremental update on the standing repo facility while the fed meeting could be a non event on wednesday we could see the ecb decision see further momentum grow for calls to move away from negative interest rates we are one tweet away from a complete collapse in the us china trade war the latest uncertainty on how hong kong will impact trade negotiations and whether we will see a meaningful rollback with tariffs will determine how much risk appetite we have for global indexes the dollar will remain a key safe haven trade that could see it outperform to the euro and commodity currencies mexican peso the mexican peso has been on an upwards trajectory since trade hopes lifted risk appetite the peso has appreciated more than one percent against the dollar even as the nfp returned some of its strength to the greenback but it was too late to make a difference even if the fed does not cut for a fourth time in december and the mexican central bank does so in the middle of the month the rate differential still favours the peso contagion risk in mexico is low given political stability and a government that after a year in power is coming around to the idea of more private investment the usmca ratification is advancing at a slow rate but it keeps moving forward with the biggest risk not getting it done this year a usmca ratification on an election year would not be impossible but it would get tougher as it would be heavily politicized to further divide voters the currency pair is trading at 19 33 and could break under 19 30 although as the trading session approaches the end investors could try to hedge their dollar positions as much as possible before going into the weekend the liquidity of the peso makes it a vehicle for speculators that want to short the region as colombians took to the streets today to protest labor reforms the precedent set by ecuador bolivia and chile will not be lost in the market as political instability will keep downward pressure on latam markets oil oil prices are up more than 15 since early october buoyed in recent days by efforts by opec and its allies or opec as they ve become known to further rebalance the market after years of oversupply production cuts were increased to 1 7 million barrels per day from 1 5 million previously but concerns about its effectiveness and compliance with the cuts are stopping traders getting carried away still price is continuing to grind higher with brent and wti trading at near three month highs the trade war is the big risk for oil prices in the near term both the us and china want us to believe a phase one deal is close but this was meant to be signed in chile a month ago with 15 december tariff deadline approaching though a sense of urgency may materialize and a deal could well give oil another kick higher gold the us jobs report on friday took the wind out of the sails of gold bulls just as they were growing in confidence the yellow metal has struggled at 1 480 both when trading above this level and below and this time it was no different a few days of pressure was obliterated by a stellar us jobs report after which markets went into risk on mode and gold headed south gold remains in consolidation a little longer with 1 440 1 450 below now key two central bank meetings next week including the fed should be the key events for gold but recent easing by both mean policy makers are already in holiday mode the trade war remains the final thing that could really shake things up for gold bitcoin bitcoin has entered consolidation mode again between 7 000 and 8 000 this comes after a tough period for the cryptocurrency after chinese authorities appeared to once again turn their back on them while they re fond of the technology it s likely they re not too thrilled with the idea of ceding control that s hardly surprising cryptocurrencies and volatility go hand in hand we may be in a period of consolidation but that s unlikely to last the worst of the decline may be over for now but when it comes to bitcoin no one can really say so with any real confidence
spotlights brexit outcome and mpc official bank rate votes unexpectedly the british pound managed to gain momentum currently the gbp has been appreciating against the us dollar and the euro however all eyes are on the parliamentary elections that will become the crucial barometer of the future pound s strength general elections will take place on december 12 if johnson s party takes the majority it will be the most market positive outcome why mr johnson will get a chance to pass the brexit deal through the parliament to get the next month s deadline if the conservative party succeeds the british pound will continue its rally advertisement will the boe meeting affect the gbp the members of the monetary policy committee will present their interest rate s votes on december 19 the market hasn t seen any changes since september 2018 nevertheless this time analysts predict the increase of votes for the rate cut if the elections outcome is positive for the domestic currency the rise of votes for the cut will not affect the gbp in the case of the negative elections result the currency will lose its momentum and the vote may add additional pressure technical picture on the weekly chart of eur gbp the pair has been trading on lows of april 2017 it s not a surprise that indicators signal a soon reversal as the pair is oversold we may see a short term correction soon in that case the pair should stick above 0 8495 rising towards 0 8655 if the parliamentary elections are market positive the pair will keep suffering supports are placed at 0 8346 0 8094 if the pound loses momentum look at resistance levels at 0 8655 0 8958 0 9050 the gbp managed to strengthen against the usd as well up to now the gbp usd pair has reached the 6 month high again indicators warn about the reversal with rsi reaching the overbought area a correction may take place before the crucial elections in that case the pair may move to 1 2787 after touching the resistance range of 1 3170 1 3300 if the gbp is boosted by the elections the pair will target the range and the level of 1 3573 if moving down supports are located at 1 2787 1 2512 and 1 2143 story continues although the victory of the conservative party is highly anticipated traders are cautious about the further direction of the highly volatile british currency the gbp is anticipated to be a risky asset during the week ahead of the elections tariffs federal reserve and the weakening usd the american dollar started december with a significant fall trump s tariffs don t encourage the domestic currency after donald trump announced the us would impose new tariffs on steel and aluminium from argentina and brazil and proposed a 100 tariff on goods from france over the digital tax the american dollar plunged jobs data and federal funds rate non farm payrolls average hourly earnings and unemployment rate figures will be released on december 6 according to forecasts the jobs data are supposed to boost the american currency the unemployment rate has been sticking to 50 year lows nfp should show an increase of employed people while average hourly earnings will reflect the rise in the price businesses pay for labor however the effect of the data is expected to be limited what about the federal reserve analysts predict the fed to keep the rate on hold on december 11 however the mood of the authority will be the indicator of the market sentiment previously the central bank declared it considers letting inflation run above target such a measure will prevent it from additional rate cuts at the same time it may be a point of longer low rates if the federal reserve sounds pessimistic warning additional easing actions the usd will continue decreasing if there are any hints on the positive economic outlook the american currency will have a chance to recover technical picture let s consider the direction of the usd jpy pair one of the most sensitive pair to the market sentiment the japanese yen is considered as a safe haven currency while the american dollar lost this title that means traders can rely on the risk sentiment of the market to forecast market moves on the weekly chart of usd jpy the pair rebounded from the resistance at 109 55 if the usd keeps declining the pair will meet supports at 108 11 106 70 and 104 75 the appreciating usd will push the pair to highs at 109 55 110 89 and 112 no positive sign for the euro christine lagarde replaced mario draghi but she is expected to stick to the existing position the ecb will announce the main refinancing rate on december 12 there is no possibility to change the current monetary approach as the outlook for the eurozone remains tilted firmly to the downside with the inflation level staying under the 2 target the ecb is more likely to present a bearish outlook fiscal stimulus is anticipated to stay a core point of the monetary policy summary the only risk is a more dovish tone of the european central bank technical picture on the weekly chart of eur usd the pair has been trading in the downward channel if the dollar is boosted by the economic data or a relief in the trade tensions the pair will slide further down support is located at 1 0925 a break below will provoke a plunge to 1 0577 the weakness of the usd will give a chance to the euro resistances are at 1 1170 and 1 1384 1 1470 making a conclusion we can highlight that the market sentiment will be the main barometer of the market moves in december traders should take into consideration such events as brexit and trade issues paying additional

major economic policy proposals what do the candidates support in part i of our series on the 2020 election and the u s economy we examined some of the key facts about the election as it currently stands in this report we tackle where the candidates stand on some of the major economic policy issues we divide this into four sections health care taxes international trade and infrastructure obviously this is not an exhaustive list of policy issues but we believe they are the most relevant for financial markets and the economic outlook on the republican side we restrict our analysis to what a second term under president trump would look like on the democratic side we restrict our analysis to the top four polling candidates at the national level joe biden elizabeth warren bernie sanders and pete buttigieg together these four candidates account for a bit less than three quarters of support in the real clear politics national polling average we would like to discuss the proposals of all of the candidates but given that there are still 15 democrats running according to the ny times tracker we need to draw the line somewhere for brevity s sake if you would like to investigate the views of a candidate policy issue not listed below we encourage you to check out this useful issue tracker put together by politico or visit the candidates campaign websites additionally if you would like to take a deeper dive into a candidate s policies discussed below we encourage you to click the hyperlinks spread throughout the text which often lead to the candidates more detailed explanations of their plans before discussing the policy proposals of these candidates we believe there are two more important points to keep in mind first the priority a candidate places on a policy position can matter as much if not more than the policy position itself candidates naturally try to offer policy proposals on every topic imaginable but in recent years presidents have often been able to pass only a few major pieces of legislation over their time in office president obama was able to push through the affordable care act aca and dodd frank for example but fell short on carbon pollution cap and trade legislation president trump managed to overhaul the u s tax code but he has not been able to successfully push through a large scale infrastructure plan and neither president obama nor president trump at least thus far for the latter enacted comprehensive immigration reform thus which policy issue is first in line for attention is critical and something we will be monitoring closely as the field narrows further second what is proposed and what is enacted are often two very different things donald trump s initial 2015 campaign proposal called for a tax cut that analysts at the tax policy center projected would reduce federal revenues by 9 5 trillion over ten years 1 a revised tax plan released by the trump campaign closer to the election was projected by the same analysts to cut federal revenues by a smaller 6 2 trillion over ten years 2 in the end the joint committee on taxation projected that the tax cuts and jobs act tcja would reduce federal revenues by about 1 5 trillion over ten years 3 we encourage our readers to bear in mind that just because something is proposed by a candidate does not mean the end result will be identical or even close to the size and scope of the original plan health care policy medicare for all aca booster or something else donald trump it is a bit unclear what president trump s second term would look like in terms of health care priorities after republicans failed to fully repeal and replace the aca in 2017 health care has largely taken a backseat to other legislative priorities perhaps repeal and replace could make a comeback if republicans swept congress and the white house more likely in our view is that the trump administration would continue to tinker with the aca via executive action as it has done over the course of the past few years some health care areas that have seen some hints of bipartisan support in the current congress include reducing prescription drug prices and pushing back on surprise billing 4 these could be areas of focus for the trump administration in a second term joe biden on health care the core tenet of biden s position is the protection and expansion of the aca perhaps the biggest change to current law promoted by the biden campaign has been the idea of introducing a public health insurance option under the aca qualifying individuals receive subsidies to purchase private health insurance plans that meet aca qualifications under biden s proposal a public option would be offered by the federal government to compete with private insurance plans a less expansive public option was considered back when the aca was being written but ultimately did not make it into the final legislation biden has also proposed making the aca subsidies more generous stopping surprise billing and offering premium free access to the public option for individuals who would be eligible for medicaid but live in states that have not expanded medicaid as part of the aca pete buttigieg buttigieg pitches his health care plan as medicare for all who want it in some ways his positions bear a resemblance to the biden proposals outlined above buttigieg supports the introduction of a public health insurance option and says of it this affordable public plan will incentivize private insurers to compete on price and bring down costs if private insurers are not able to offer something dramatically better this public plan will create a natural glide path to medicare for all like biden s plan individuals with lower incomes in states that have not expanded medicaid would automatically be enrolled in the public option buttigieg also supports ending surprise billing boosting subsidies to those who purchase health insurance on their own capping out of pocket costs for seniors on medicare and limiting what health care providers can charge for out of network care to twice what medicare pays for the same service elizabeth warren and bernie sanders both sanders and warren are co sponsors of the medicare for all act of 2019 in short this bill would transition the united states health care system to one where all americans receive health insurance from the federal government all private insurance either bought individually or provided through an employer would be eliminated furthermore with the exception of prescription drugs and a few other small things all premiums deductibles and other forms of cost sharing would be eliminated estimates for the cost of such a plan are varied but one widely cited estimate by the urban institute pegs the total cost at roughly 34 trillion over 10 years medicare for all plans like the one proposed by warren and sanders are among the most expensive proposed changes to the federal budget to put the 34 trillion number into context consider that the cost of forgiving all student loan debt would be roughly 1 5 trillion which is about the same as the estimated 10 year cost of the tcja some of this additional federal spending on health care can be paid for by simply re routing money already spent by households and businesses to the government figure 1 for example the centers for medicare medicaid services project american businesses will spend roughly 9 trillion over the next decade on health care for their employees in theory if this money were instead sent to the federal government it would not be any additional cost to the company all else equal that said even after accounting for moves like these taxes on households would need to go up substantially to pay for medicare for all in order to keep the federal deficit from ballooning tax policy tax cuts 2 0 or a bevy of new taxes donald trump a second term for president trump would most likely be centered on some form of tax cuts 2 0 an idea that has come up periodically since the tcja was passed at the end of 2017 in our view the major policy aim of tax cuts 2 0 would be to make the temporary parts of the tcja permanent rather than to enact another large round of tax cuts although most of the tcja changes to the corporate tax code were permanent many of the changes to the individual and passthrough sections such as the individual tax rate reductions and the doubling of the standard deduction expire at the end of 2025 republican policymakers have expressed a strong desire to make these tax changes permanent president trump s second term would finish in 2024 and making these tax cuts a permanent fixture of the law would likely be a key priority before leaving office other proposals that could be on the table as part of tax cuts 2 o legislation include eliminating some aca taxes indexing capital gains to inflation and expanding saving vehicles like 529 education accounts in our view much broader across the board tax cuts are unlikely unless enacted as part of a stimulus plan to deal with a recession joe biden joe biden has thus far proposed a much less ambitious expansion of federal spending compared to some other leading democratic candidates and as such his tax proposals have not been nearly as aggressive in addition to his health care program outlined earlier biden has put out an infrastructure plan more on that later as well as an education job training plan that proposes policies such as doubling the maximum size of pell grants increasing the generosity of incomebased student loan repayments making two years of community college tuition free and investing 50 billion in workforce training programs to pay for these programs biden has proposed reversing elements of the tcja that benefited high earners and corporations for example biden has proposed restoring the top marginal income tax rate to 39 6 and raising the corporate tax rate up to 28 up from the current 21 but below the 35 rate that prevailed before the tcja this 28 number is in line with what was proposed in several of the budgets released by the obama white house biden has also suggested taxing longterm capital gains at that 39 6 rate for taxpayers earning more than 1 million annually at present long term capital gains are taxed at a maximum preferential rate of 20 even though the top marginal income tax rate is currently 37 for single filers earning 510 300 or above biden also supports expanding social security benefits paid for by lifting the cap on the social security payroll tax at present only earnings up to 132 900 for 2019 are subject to the 12 4 payroll tax that is split between employers and employees pete buttigieg to fund his health care plan buttigieg has proposed raising the corporate tax rate back to 35 in addition to his health care plan buttigieg has also proposed a variety of other spending plans such as spending 430 billion on affordable housing investing 700 billion in early childhood and k 12 education and spending 500 billion to make tuition at public college free for families with income below 100 000 and reducing tuition for families earning between 100 000 and 150 000 to pay for these proposals buttigieg would target the top 1 of earners by raising their capital gains tax rates as well as implementing mark to market taxes on capital gains buttigieg has at times entertained the idea of a wealth tax but at this point in time we are not aware of any concrete proposal his campaign has on the matter buttigieg supports subjecting earnings above 250 000 to social security payroll taxes in order to expand spending on the program buttigieg has also floated increasing the earned income tax credit a refundable tax credit aimed at low to moderate income households elizabeth warren warren has proposed some of the most detailed and far reaching changes to the tax code in line with the aggressive expansion of federal government spending she supports such as medicare for all cancelling up to 50 000 in student loan debt per borrower with a sliding scale depending on household income making public college free and investing 500 billion into affordable housing most of these proposed taxes are aimed at high earners and corporations warren has promised to repeal the tcja while also enacting a real corporate profits tax that would enact a surtax on u s corporations equal to 7 of the worldwide profits reported on a corporation s financial statement to finance medicare for all warren has proposed a slew of changes the full details of which can be found here one point worth noting from it is that american companies with 50 or more employees would instead of making premium payments to private insurers be required to redirect that money to the federal government this is the implementation of the re routing business spending on health care discussed in the last section for additional financing warren has signaled support for a wealth tax the wealth tax would be an annual tax on net worth above certain levels warren s proposed wealth tax would start at 2 on net worth above 50 million and climb to 6 on net worth above 1 billion warren has also proposed taxing capital gains as ordinary income for households in the top 1 of earners implementing a mark to market tax system on capital gains for the top 1 and enacting a 0 1 financial transactions tax on most stock bond and derivative transactions to fund an expansion of social security benefits warren would impose a 14 8 social security payroll tax split evenly between employers and employees on individual wages above 250 000 finally warren also has proposed establishing a 35 country by country minimum tax on foreign earnings thus shifting the united states back to a worldwide corporate tax regime as opposed to the territorial system that was adopted in 2017 and exempts most profits earned abroad from u s corporate income taxes bernie sanders sanders tax proposals are somewhat similar to warren s and would also be used to pay for a significant expansion of social programs such as adopting medicare for all cancelling all student loan debt and making public college free sanders does not have quite as explicit of a plan to pay for medicare for all as warren though his office did lay out some options earlier this year these included a 7 5 payroll tax paid by employers a 4 income based premium paid by employees a more progressive federal income tax system and a fee on large financial institutions among others sanders supports restoring the corporate tax rate to 35 and ending full expensing of capital investment among other aspects of the tcja he would like to reverse sanders has proposed a financial transaction tax though with more brackets than warren s sanders wealth tax also has more brackets it starts at a 1 rate for net worth of 32 50 million and eventually climbs to an 8 annual tax on net worth above 10 billion sanders supports taxing capital gains as ordinary income for those with income above 250 000 as well as applying the social security payroll tax on income over 250 000 to expand benefits for the program trade policy would a democratic president continue the trade war with china donald trump the specifics of what trade policy would look like under president trump s second term will of course depend on how trade developments unfold over the next 12 months in particular whether a trade deal is reached with china and whether congress finally passes the usmca the heir apparent to nafta even if a trade deal is reached with china something our forecast does not assume and usmca becomes law sometime before the 2020 election something our forecast does assume trade policy would be unlikely to fully disappear from the scene in president trump s second term in our view compliance will likely be a big ongoing issue in any u s china trade deal and some bumps along the road there would not surprise us the united states and europe continue to go back and forth on various trade issues such as automobiles and this could easily stretch past 2020 furthermore the president has shown a willingness to utilize tariffs as a tool to achieve other policy goals such as his threat in may 2019 to implement tariffs on mexico if border security was not improved in short we believe trade policy will likely remain a major policy issue so long as president trump remains in office even if the particulars shift over time joe biden generally speaking the democratic candidates have adopted a support the goal change the approach strategy to with china while generally opposing some of the trade actions taken threatened against traditional u s allies such as canada and europe among the four democratic candidates we have examined biden s comments on the campaign trail have generally been the most supportive of free trade biden has highlighted the potential damage done to american farmers manufacturers by recent tariffs and appears to be modeling his campaign more in line with the general free trade views of president obama biden for instance was a strong advocate for the trans pacific partnership tpp a free trade deal negotiated under president obama from which president trump withdrew upon taking office biden also voted yes to the original nafta back in 1993 that said even a biden presidency is no guarantee that trade policy would return to the quiet background of past presidencies for example biden has more recently expressed a desire to renegotiate parts of the tpp and the politico issue tracker lists all four of these democratic candidates as demanding further changes to the usmca agreement before they can support it even still when compared with the rest of the field we are examining biden is probably the candidate most likely to bring the trade war with china to a close in our view pete buttigieg buttigieg having never been a member of congress does not have an voting record on trade issues to which we can turn he has at times expressed criticism of the u s tariffs on china saying in a cnn interview in august that it s a fool s errand to think china will change the fundamentals of its economic model due to pressure from tariffs at the same time buttigieg has been critical of china on other fronts such as human rights and environmental issues and he has expressed skepticism about joining the cptpp the successor to tpp once the united states left the pact in our view buttigieg probably falls closer on the trade spectrum to biden than warren and sanders though all of them likely have more of a protectionist lean than the few u s presidents that preceded donald trump elizabeth warren warren probably falls more neatly into support the goal change the approach camp as she has generally been less supportive of traditional free trade policies than other candidates such as biden during her time in the senate for example she was an opponent of the tpp that biden supported as vice president warren laid out a trade policy plan in july the details of which can be found here and included the line while i think tariffs are an important tool they are not by themselves a long term solution to our failed trade agenda and must be part of a broader strategy that this administration clearly lacks in the plan warren advocates for laying out stringent labor environmental and human rights rules that a country must meet as a precondition to a trade agreement with the united states bernie sanders sanders also has a history of supporting more restrictionist trade policies sanders voted against nafta in 1993 for instance and opposed the tpp on more recent trade issues sanders has opposed the haphazard and reckless plan to impose tariffs on canada and the european union while also strongly support imposing stiff penalties on countries like china russia south korea and vietnam to prevent them from illegally dumping steel and aluminum into the u s and throughout the world like a warren presidency a sanders presidency would likely be marked by trade policy being a more important issue for the economy and financial markets than it was in the pre trump era infrastructure spending don t hold your breath in this section we discuss the outlook for infrastructure spending a bit more holistically rather than on a candidate by candidate basis infrastructure is an area where there often appears to be much bipartisan agreement on the surface investing in infrastructure can create jobs raise a country s potential growth and improve the quality of life of its citizens indeed after the 2016 election many analysts believed that infrastructure spending represented an area of potential common ground between president trump and the democrats in congress three years into president trump s first term however there have been several false starts and not much to show for them when it comes to infrastructure spending the main challenge is how to pay for such a program one obvious source of revenue would be to raise the federal gas tax which at 18 4 cents a gallon has not been increased since 1993 republicans are generally opposed to raising this tax however while democrats have concerns about its regressive nature policymakers could simply choose not to pay for a large investment in infrastructure spending but if they elect to go the deficit financed route there are often other policies that take precedence such as the tcja for republicans president trump and all of the democratic candidates we have discussed have at some point or another argued for increased infrastructure spending in areas such as water and transportation yet the proposed funding sources for these plans have been lighter on detail than in other areas such as medicare for all this highlights a point that we made earlier a candidate s priorities are as important as the policies a large infrastructure package could easily be paid for with higher taxes on the wealthy but where does this leave the funding for medicare for all or cancelling all student loan debt or universal child care perhaps a biden presidency would offer the highest likelihood of a large infrastructure deal given that his 1 3 trillion infrastructure plan is one of his more ambitious spending programs or if a democratic nominee were to make climate change their top priority a large investment in clean energy could lead to more spending on infrastructure but once again this hypothetical plan would be competing for time and resources with some of the other issues already mentioned such as health care higher education and affordable housing as the field continues to narrow we should have a better idea of what the ultimate nominee might prioritize in their first two years in office but at this point in time we are skeptical a large scale infrastructure package will be the first or second priority regardless of who the nominee is should a big increase in infrastructure spending take place we believe the most likely impetus would be an economic downturn if the economy were to slow sharply policymakers could turn to a mix of tax cuts and infrastructure spending to stimulate the economy as they did during the great recession outside of that scenario we suspect there will be too many other policy priorities soaking up the finite revenue sources 1 nunns j burman l rohaly j rosenberg j december 2015 an analysis of donald trump s tax plan urban brookings tax policy center 2

the domestic industry of the eaeu is defined by reference to producers in all eaeu member states international agreements 2 in general terms what is your country s attitude to international trade the primary external trade policy objectives of the eaeu members have been to liberalise regional trade and promote deeper economic integration among the commonwealth of independent states cis countries those goals were pursued with the customs union cu of russia kazakhstan and belarus which was formed in 2010 and more recently the cu was complemented and overtaken by the more comprehensive regime of economic integration within the eaeu as of 1 january 2015 the new eaeu has the legal status of an international organisation vested with legal personality which was not the case for the cu the eaeu is open to accessions by other countries armenia and kyrgyzstan became new member states of the eaeu on 2 january 2015 and 12 august 2015 respectively there are certain transitional arrangements in the areas of import tariffs and foreign trade regulation that apply to these newly acceded member states no other eaeu accession negotiations are currently ongoing on 22 august 2012 russia acceded to the world trade organization wto this is considered to be the beginning of a process of gradual liberalisation particularly with regard to import tariffs of the cu eaeu s trade with the rest of the world in accordance with wto rules in joining the wto as a member of the cu russia committed to ensure compliance of the cu and its successor the eaeu tdi regimes with russia s wto obligations and commitments a number of russian industries have regularly expressed concerns regarding the potential negative effects of russia s wto accession and have asked for increased protection of their trade interests since accession to the wto russia has been involved in a number of disputes including seven cases as complainant and nine cases as respondent in four disputes measures on the importation of live pigs pork and other pig products from the european union ds475 tariff treatment of certain agricultural and manufacturing products ds485 anti dumping duties on light commercial vehicles from germany and italy ds479 and russia measures affecting the importation of railway equipment and parts thereof ds499 russian policies and measures were found partially inconsistent with the wto agreements while the disputed measures in ds479 and ds485 had already been brought into conformity in accordance with the panel s findings the disputed measure in ds499 is under appeal and the disputed measure in ds475 is still at the implementation stage with a risk of retaliatory actions against russia in another dispute measures concerning traffic in transit ds512 the panel dismissed the

trade related policies and pose their questions and express views russia received over 700 questions and comments from over 50 wto members many welcomed the tremendous liberalisation efforts and remarkable improvements in russia s trade policy while others noted that there is still much for russia to do to improve many wto members demonstrated great interest in russia s investment regime and eaeu developments and raised new concerns in the areas of sanitary and phytosanitary and technical barriers to trade tbt local content requirements customs control and import restrictions as well as the transparency of certain policies kazakhstan a member of the eaeu also became a member of the wto on 30 november 2015 according to kazakhstan s wto tariff concessions one third of its import tariff lines for goods are bound at rates lower than those provided under russia s bound tariff rates in the wto or in the eaeu s common customs tariff in response to this issue as a transitional solution kazakhstan undertook not to allow the re export of goods imported into kazakhstan at lower tariffs to other eaeu member states accordingly to qualify for free circulation status within the eaeu goods imported into kazakhstan at lower rates should become subject to the higher eaeu import tariff for this purpose a special control system was introduced to monitor the movement of such goods based on electronic customs declarations invoicing and instant information exchange between the competent authorities of the eaeu member states kazakhstan is a respondent in one wto dispute brought by ukraine in september 2017 anti dumping measures on steel pipes ds530 at the time of writing the dispute is at the consultation stage armenia and kyrgyzstan have been wto members since 2003 and 1998 respectively their accession to the eaeu has triggered similar issues concerning tariff differences of their wto tariff bindings with the eaeu common customs tariff as a result these countries also agreed temporary derogations ie lower tariffs from the eaeu common customs tariff for certain goods imported for internal consumption such tariff derogations from the eaeu are only temporary both new eaeu member states have announced their intention to enter into their respective tariff renegotiations in the wto with the affected wto members while the actual renegotiations have not yet started wto accession negotiations for belarus formally started in 1993 but were suspended for decades until the accession process was resumed on 24 january 2017 belarus has been invited to submit written replies to members questions an updated legislative action plan copies of relevant draft and adopted legislation and additional documentation such as updated information on domestic support to agriculture

remedies in your jurisdiction since 1 july 2012 the authority for trade defence investigations in the eaeu is the eec and the administrative service directly in charge of conducting trade defence investigations is the eec s department for internal market defence the webpage of the department for internal market defence is available in the english language at www eurasiancommission org en act trade podm pages default aspx final decisions to impose measures following investigations are made by the board of the eec consisting of the eec ministers representing all the eaeu member states www eurasiancommission org en pages structure aspx complaint filing procedure 4 what is the procedure for domestic industry to start a trade remedies case in your jurisdiction can the regulator start an investigation ex officio according to paragraph 186 of the tdi protocol an investigation can be initiated by the eec on its own initiative or on the basis of a complaint lodged by the domestic industry manufacturing like products relevant for ad and cv investigations or like or directly competitive products in the case of sg in practice so far all investigations have been initiated following domestic industry complaints a complaint can be lodged either by individual domestic producers or by a group or association of domestic producers manufacturing a major share of like products for ad and cv or like or directly competitive for sg products the eaeu applies thresholds for domestic industry that are similar to those in other jurisdictions in particular the complainant must demonstrate that its complaint is expressly supported by at least 25 per cent of the total eaeu production and moreover it must be supported by over 50 per cent of the volume of the like or directly competitive products manufactured by those producers which have expressed an opinion on the complaint the eec will decide whether to open an investigation within 30 calendar days from the date when the complaint is deemed to have been submitted this deadline may be extended where the eec decides to request additional information or evidence however any such extension will not exceed 60 calendar days from the date of submission of the complaint the requirements for the preparation of a complaint are also similar to those in other jurisdictions namely the complainants must provide a detailed description of the product concerned and the like or directly competitive products detailed data on domestic capacity and production an estimate of domestic consumption trade data data on the indicators relevant for injury analysis available data on dumping by the imports from or specific subsidies in the targeted third country and evidence on trends in imports and factors that may interfere with the analysis of a causal link with material or serious injury or threat thereof the complaint must also contain a proposal on the form amount and duration of the measures and adjustment plans if relevant usually in the case of sg normally all the data should cover a period of three calendar years preceding the year of submission of the complaint as well as data on further periods where representative statistics are available all written submissions must be accompanied by non confidential and relatively detailed summaries contesting trade remedies 5 what is the procedure for foreign exporters to defend a trade remedies case in your jurisdiction the notice of initiation of a specific tdi investigation is published on the website of the eec www eurasiancommission org the date of publication on the website is the first day of the new investigation notifications are also sent to interested parties identified in the complaint and reasonably known to the investigating authorities notifications are also usually sent through diplomatic channels to the respective foreign governments of the affected countries in recent practice written notifications have occasionally reached their addressees with delays causing difficulties for interested parties to comply with further procedural deadlines interested parties exporting producers importers consumer associations and authorities of exporting countries can participate in the investigation in person or can appoint legal representatives there are currently no restrictions on foreign attorneys acting as representatives of interested parties before the eec all investigations are however conducted in russian and all documents must be submitted in russian or accompanied by a russian translation within 25 days from the publication on the eec s website interested parties must submit a letter to the eec to be registered as participants in the investigation only registered interested parties namely participants may obtain access to the non confidential files including a copy of the complaint participants must also request public hearings within 45 days and then subsequently submit their memorandum with defensive arguments and data relevant to the investigation within 60 calendar days from the date of initiation the same deadlines apply to all types of tdi investigations in the eaeu questionnaires must be answered within 30 days from their receipt extensions are possible the same deadline applies to all information requests in the course of the investigation public hearings are normally scheduled within six to seven months after initiation within 15 days after the hearings interested parties are entitled to submit information in writing as provided orally in the course of the public hearings safeguard investigations are normally concluded within nine months with a possible extension of no more than three months the respective periods for ad and anti subsidy investigations are 12 months for conclusion and six months for extension upon completion of the investigation and before the final decision the eec will send to the participants for comments a draft report on the main findings and conclusions of the investigation the eec board will decide on the imposition of measures usually within 30 to 45 days from receipt of the report on the investigation and of a draft decision from the investigating authority wto rules 6 are the wto rules on trade remedies applied in national law the eaeu is not in itself a wto member russia has been a wto member since 2012 kazakhstan since 2015 armenia since 2003 and kyrgyzstan since 1998 belarus is still negotiating its terms of accession according to the terms of accession of armenia and kyrgyzstan to the eaeu their individual wto accession commitments do not extend to other eaeu member states or to the eaeu as a whole all definitions of terms procedural requirements and time limits that apply pursuant to the tdi protocol and that are actually applied by the eec in tdi investigations aim to follow the respective wto rules on tdis according to the generally accepted understanding specific provisions in the wto agreements and the respective wto accession commitments of the eaeu member states that have been implemented by the eaeu as part of the international agreements among its member states become an integral part of the eaeu s legal order and should prevail over other laws that conflict with it this position follows from the treaty on the functioning of the customs union in the context of the multilateral trading system of 19 may 2011 which remains in force upon creation of the eaeu annex 31 of the eaeu treaty however the wto agreements on tdis do not have direct effect with respect to legal entities and individuals in the eaeu and the latter cannot directly invoke the provisions of these wto agreements before the court of the eurasian economic union eaeu court arguably such legal claims can be done by reference to the provisions of the eaeu treaty and other international agreements within the eaeu that implement the respective wto provisions under the tdi protocol all third countries are treated as market economy countries appeal 7 what is the appeal procedure for an unfavourable trade remedies decision is appeal available for all decisions how likely is an appeal to succeed as of 1 january 2015 the eaeu court is the sole competent institution for judicial review of tdi measures adopted by the eec board all acts and actions inactions that allegedly violate provisions of the eaeu agreements and individual rights provided under those agreements can be challenged before the eaeu court since its establishment the eaeu court has issued only one judgment dismissing claims submitted by an exporting producer from ukraine in relation to ad measures on steel rebar notably this was the first proceeding under the enhanced rules of procedure which required a report from a specially appointed expert group in 2012 2014 the eurasec court the predecessor of the eaeu court but limited to cu matters only had considered three tdi cases all three concerned ad measures in its practice the eurasec court demonstrated a reasoned approach and willingness to interpret the rules of the cu in light of specific wto provisions and particularly with due regard to the judicial practice of the court of justice of the european union including to a certain extent the applicability of the relevant wto rules in the domestic legal order however the eurasec court did not uphold any of the above three legal actions lodged against tdi measures review of duties quotas 8 how and when can an affected party seek a review of the duty or quota what is the procedure and time frame for obtaining a refund of overcharged duties can interest be claimed the eaeu respects all relevant wto disciplines on reviews and refunds and there is a legal possibility to request minimum price undertakings and interim administrative newcomer and expiry sunset reviews as well as refunds of ad or cv duties paid in accordance with the tdi protocol in 2016 2019 the eec initiated a number of review proceedings including interim reviews expiry reviews and an anti circumvention inquiry in 2015 the eec accepted the very first minimum price undertaking from several cooperating exporting producers in the ad investigation on oil country tubular goods from china in the following years one chinese producer failed to comply with the conditions of the price undertaking which was consequently withdrawn with respect to this company in 2018 the eec also accepted price undertakings from two cooperating exporting producers in the ad investigation on herbicides from the european union eu under the tdi protocol reviews may be initiated upon the request of an interested party an exporting producer complainants the eec may also initiate an ex officio interim review for example as a result of an amicable out of court settlement or implementation of the eaeu court s rulings in particular a similar development took place in the course of one judicial proceeding within the eaeu court where as a result of an agreement with the complainant the judicial proceeding was suspended and the eec agreed to initiate an interim review limited to the determination of dumping the review resulted in a minor revision of the ad duties imposed after reopening of the judicial case on the complainant s initiative the eaeu court found the revised duties to be consistent with the cu legal order and dismissed the action therefore interested parties are encouraged to request reviews and refunds where this is warranted by evidence compliance strategies 9 what are the practical strategies for complying with an anti dumping countervailing safeguard duty or quota the eaeu and the eec s practice in this respect remains rather limited parties have the right to request minimum price undertakings reviews and refunds as discussed under question 8 while it has already happened in practice in general the eec is often reluctant to accept price undertakings where a measure or decision of the eec in this respect is deemed unlawful it may be challenged before the eaeu court it is noted that the tdi protocol provides for anti circumvention investigations and measures in 2017 the eec completed an anti circumvention proceeding regarding original measures on seamless tubes and pipes of stainless steel originating from china which were extended to products originating from malaysia

imported goods if the exempt goods are to be released for free circulation within the eaeu they become subject to the common ett rates on 1 january 2018 the customs code of the eurasian economic union cc eaeu replaced the previously applied customs code of the customs union the eaeu member states have concluded a separate accord concerning export duties according to this accord each member state of the eaeu establishes its own list of certain goods in respect of which export duties may apply which is communicated to the eec on that basis the eec maintains a consolidated list of products subject to export duties for all member states of the eaeu member states retain the power to adopt and amend the export duty rates applied on export of goods contained in the consolidated list and originating in their territories similar rules are reflected in the cc eaeu export duty rates are subject to periodic amendments by decisions of governments of the member states there is no single official public database at the eaeu level where up to date export duty rates can be consulted customs authorities of eaeu member states have a system of issuing preliminary customs classification decisions that may affect the customs duty rate applicable to a product for which such a decision has been requested similar to the systems of issuing binding tariff information practised in other jurisdictions

procedure however only part of the information which relates to risk assessment and choice of customs control form is mandatory for prior submission while other information remains optional aimed at facilitating customs clearance prior notification may be done electronically at the websites of national customs authorities of the eaeu member states eaeu member states maintain a duty exemption regime for low value shipments including for e commerce in accordance with decision of the eec council n107 of 20 december 2017 the authorities decided to proceed with the gradual reduction of the maximum value and weight thresholds applied to duty exemptions therefore from 1 january 2019 the threshold for international postal deliveries is set at 500 or 31 kg during one calendar month while from 1 january 2020 it will be 200 or 31 kg per package no further reductions are envisaged by the current eaeu legislation note that while eaeu legislation defines the maximum threshold for duty exemptions the cc eaeu allows each eaeu member state to introduce even lower limits as provided above special rates and preferential treatment 11 where are special tariff rates such as under free trade agreements or preferential tariffs and countries that are given preference listed there is no single database at the eaeu level that lists duty rates applicable under preferential arrangements or preferential trade agreements the eaeu applies a unified system of tariff preferences ustp analogous to the eu generalised scheme of preferences to promote economic growth and welfare in developing and least developed countries articles 36 and 37 of the eaeu treaty specify tariff preferences granted to developing countries 75 per cent and 0 per cent of the mfn rate for developing and least developed countries respectively and refers to preferential rules of origin applied to such imports the ustp preferences apply to goods included in a special list of goods and a list of countries eligible for such preferences these lists are established by the eec the respective lists as well as the relevant legislation are available on the eec s website www eurasiancommission org ru act trade dotp commonsytem pages normatbaza aspx there is no official list or unified database for the existing preferential trade agreements of the eaeu member states with third countries the agreements are numerous however the most noteworthy is the multilateral agreement on a free trade area of the cis countries fta cis which has been in force among the majority of the cis countries since 2012 the fta cis has been suspended between russia and ukraine since 1 january 2016 due to exceptional national security reasons traditionally most cis countries continue to maintain a network of bilateral free trade agreements ftas between themselves in addition to the above multilateral fta cis russia currently maintains bilateral preferential trade agreements with azerbaijan georgia serbia tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan kazakhstan has bilateral preferential trade agreements with azerbaijan georgia serbia and tajikistan belarus maintains preferential trade agreements with azerbaijan serbia tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan and armenia with georgia tajikistan and turkmenistan kyrgyzstan has a bilateral preferential trade agreement with uzbekistan many of these agreements have specific product exclusions the eec is currently taking steps to encourage the eaeu member states to renegotiate existing bilateral trade agreements and conclude new ones so that the eaeu may become a party to them notably in its capacity of an international organisation vested with legal personality the eaeu signed an fta with the socialist republic of vietnam including a protocol on investment facilitation this is the first ever fta established between the eaeu and a third country and it entered into force on 5 october 2016 recently the eaeu concluded fta negotiations with serbia and the signature of the respective agreement is expected in october 2019 in 2018 2019 the eaeu signed an agreement on trade and economic cooperation with china and a temporary agreement aiming at the establishment of a free trade zone with iran as well as a memorandum of cooperation with the largest regional associations asean and mercosur 12 how can gsp treatment for a product be obtained or removed according to articles 36 and 45 of the eaeu treaty the eec administers the ustp and is responsible for maintaining and updating the following lists a list of eligible developing countries entitled to the general tariff preference currently 102 countries a list of eligible least developed countries entitled to the special tariff preference currently 49 countries and a list of eligible goods originating from developing countries and least developed countries that fall within the scope of the ustp the eligibility criteria for the inclusion of countries in the above lists are set out in the regulation on conditions and procedure for the application of eaeu unified system of tariff preferences adopted on 6 april 2016 this regulation specifies the country related criteria which are complex and include not only relative volume of import and level of country income criteria but also a number of other requirements some of which can be regarded as policy or discretionary criteria the eec adopts a list of eligible goods at its own discretion unless the products are considered to be sensitive for domestic industry or subject to the tariff quotas 13 is there a duty suspension regime in place how can duty suspension be obtained the eec is empowered to adopt decisions on tariff suspensions upon requests from the eaeu member states given the recent delegation of respective powers from the eaeu member states to the eec there is not yet an established formal procedure for requesting tariff suspensions therefore economic operators may be advised to address substantiated requests for tariff suspensions to their national competent ministries which in turn can refer the request to the eec the possibility for eaeu member states to provide unilaterally customs privileges in the form of partial or complete reduction of normal customs duty rates for specific tariff lines or end uses is provided for in article 43 and annex 6 of the eaeu treaty ie protocol on common customs tariff regulation these customs privileges may not benefit individual companies and shall not depend on the origin of the goods challenge 14 where can customs decisions be challenged in your jurisdiction what are the procedures acts or omissions of the eec that affect the individual rights and interests of economic operators provided under the eaeu agreements including customs tariff policy matters may be challenged directly by affected economic operators before the eaeu court decisions of the customs authorities of the eaeu member states can be challenged according to procedures provided in each national jurisdiction customs decisions of the russian authorities can be challenged via an administrative appeal before the higher customs authority and via a judicial challenge before the russian civil and arbitration courts in accordance with chapter 51 of the federal law on customs regulation in the russian federation and on amendments into certain legal acts of the russian federation no 289 fz of 3 august 2018 customs decisions in kazakhstan are challenged in accordance with several procedures depending on the type of customs decision being challenged the

2017 and other legal acts customs decisions in belarus are challenged by a complaint to the customs authorities or to the court law on customs regulation in the republic of belarus no 129 z of 10 january 2014 similar possibilities for challenging customs decisions through higher level customs authorities or national courts are also available in armenia and kyrgyzstan government authorities 15 what government office handles complaints from domestic exporters against foreign trade barriers at the wto or under other agreements the eec has not yet received a mandate from the eaeu member states for handling complaints against trade barriers in third countries and the fundamental reason is that not all member states are wto members yet the member states of the eaeu that are wto members armenia kazakhstan kyrgyzstan and russia can use wto mechanisms to tackle trade barriers affecting their exported goods however under article 39 of the eaeu treaty the eec shall monitor trade barriers in third countries and undertake respective consultations with the latter countries together with the eaeu member states complaints against trade barriers are handled by the competent ministries responsible for the economy and trade of each member state russia represents a particular interest in light of its leading experience as a wto member and the volume of its export trade in russia the competent authority for handling trade barrier complaints is the ministry of economic development med which has an experienced team of foreign trade experts who regularly deal with complaints about trade barriers in third countries the comprehensive and up to date list of trade barriers on foreign markets identified by the russian authorities is published on the med s information portal for foreign trade at www ved gov ru rus_export torg_exp in russian complaint filing procedure 16 what is the procedure for filing a complaint against a foreign trade barrier the national laws of the eaeu member states do not provide for a specific procedure for the filing of complaints against trade barriers in third countries however the competent authorities are generally open to hearing the concerns of domestic businesses there are no specific time limits in russia complaints are submitted in free written form and are considered by the med economic operators in armenia kazakhstan kyrgyzstan and russia may submit a complaint based on arguments in line with wto rules and challenging effective trade barriers against exports of armenian kazakh kyrgyz and russian originating goods and services such complaints are handled by the ministry of economy in armenia the ministry of national economy of kazakhstan the ministry of economy in kyrgyzstan and the ministry of economic development in russia and may be used as a basis for possible consultations or dispute settlement proceedings under wto rules grounds for investigation 17 what will the authority consider when deciding whether to begin an investigation the authorities as a rule recommend that interested parties collect available relevant data such as legislative or administrative acts of the third country s authorities that are believed to be the reason for the trade barrier statistical information on trade flows that have decreased or are expected to decrease as a result of the imposition of the trade barrier and data on the negative impact of the trade barrier on the business of the complaining company or effect on the economy of the eaeu member states as of 2013 the eec undertakes monitoring and reporting of foreign trade barriers for goods exported by the eaeu members the respective reports and lists of foreign trade barriers are published on the eec s website www eurasiancommission org ru act trade dotp pages dostup aspx measures against foreign trade barriers 18 what measures outside the wto may the authority unilaterally take against a foreign trade barrier are any such measures currently in force following the accession of eaeu members to the wto their actions must comply with wto rules only belarus is still a non wto member however the obligations of belarus under the eaeu treaty which seek to ensure where possible compliance with wto rules may have a restrictive effect on the ability of belarus to take unilateral actions against foreign trade barriers under the eaeu treaty the eaeu as an international organisation with legal personality may undertake retaliatory measures in accordance with the bilateral or multilateral agreements of the eaeu in this regard the eaeu member states have working procedures in place to take parallel coordinated action in case a third country imposes a trade barrier or other trade restrictive measures on one of them the relevant member state will report the case to the eec in consultation with the eec member states may then agree upon taking parallel unilateral or multilateral retaliatory measures such parallel actions on behalf of the eaeu might become particularly relevant if armenia kazakhstan kyrgyzstan or russia were to be authorised by the wto to impose retaliatory measures as a result of successful wto dispute settlement proceedings following non compliance article 40 of the eaeu treaty explicitly authorises unilateral retaliatory measures under multilateral wto or bilateral fta international agreements where individual eaeu members are parties in august 2018 russia unilaterally increased tariffs up to 30 per cent on a number of us goods eg optical fibres and road machinery as retaliation for the us section 232 measures on steel and aluminium products other eaeu members have not taken recourse to similar retaliatory measures against the us although hypothetically similar measures are available to eaeu members in response to the definitive safeguard measures of the eu on certain steel products adopted in february 2019 they have not taken recourse to this retaliatory instrument however there are notable exceptions to the above eaeu rules according to article 47 and section x of annex no 7 protocol on measures of non tariff regulation applicable to third countries of the eaeu treaty in exceptional circumstances the eaeu members may unilaterally impose bans and quantitative limitations on imports as well as licensing exclusive rights and authorisation requirements in regard to imports from third countries normally the duration of such restrictive measures should not exceed six months in cases where a specific foreign trade barrier might be qualified as relating to exceptional circumstances such unilateral retaliatory measures would be justified under eaeu law see also question 29 private sector support 19 what support does the government expect from the private sector to bring a wto case as yet there are no specific rules in the eaeu member states concerning the establishment of procedures and requirements for the preparation of wto dispute settlement complaints the practical support for the preparation of a wto case such as the initiative for relevant research evidence translations and expert advice is largely a task for the business community the competent authorities such as russia s ministry of economic development can step in when the business has prepared the groundwork including reliable wto legal argumentation and can then ensure effective support notable non tariff barriers 20 what notable trade barriers other than retaliatory measures does your country impose on imports the eaeu treaty provides for a harmonised system of non tariff trade regulation on the basis of annex no 7 of the eaeu treaty protocol on measures of non tariff regulation applicable to third countries as well as on the basis of other eaeu treaty provisions and annexes relating to specific types of non tariff measures eg technical regulations sanitary and hygienic measures veterinary and phytosanitary surveillance and export control measures the above protocol stipulates general rules and principles for the adoption imposition and use of specific types of non tariff measures while the adoption of each non tariff measure and management of the respective unified lists of the measures are done by the eec administration and enforcement of the measures remain within the competence of the eaeu member states and are governed by their national laws according to the protocol the eaeu may introduce the following non tariff measures on imports and exports bans and quantitative restrictions exclusive rights automatic licensing and authorisations non automatic licensing see also rules on issuance of licences and authorisations on exports and imports of goods in the addendum to annex no 7 of the eaeu treaty the unified and regularly updated lists of goods and respective non tariff measures of the eaeu are available on the eec website at www eurasiancommission org ru act trade catr nontariff pages ed perechen_title aspx other non tariff measures such as for export controls technical regulations and sps measures including plant quarantine measures are routinely applied by the eaeu and its member states they are subject to chapter xi and annexes 9 12 of the eaeu treaty as well as national implementing legislation the most notable trade restrictions in russia and the eaeu are traditionally of an sps nature including bans on the import of poultry and meat from the us owing to a bird flu epidemic or because of a zero tolerance policy on residues of antibiotics and steroids such as ractopamine which is banned in russia and also in other jurisdictions such as the eu and china other goods subject to extensive safety controls and requirements in russia and the eaeu include pork and other meat products from the eu due to the alleged african swine fever outbreaks the latter restrictions were found to be inconsistent with russia s obligations and subject to possible retaliatory measures from the eu unless russia were to effectively lift the ban cheese certain detergents and confectionery from ukraine and other items parallel to this all eaeu members make extensive use of stringent import licensing regimes for alcohol and pharmaceuticals general controls 21 what general controls are imposed on exports the majority of goods exported from the customs territory of the eaeu are free from export controls and export taxes and duties there are however exceptions which often affect certain natural resources hydrocarbons and energy goods raw materials including a number of metals certain agricultural and forestry products dual use goods etc the matter of customs duties on export in the context of the eaeu has been addressed in question 10 therefore this section deals with other export controls exceptions for similar primary goods may also apply in internal trade among the eaeu member states the rules on export controls in the external trade of member states are provided in the agreement on unified rules of export control of member states of the eurasian economic community the agreement of 28 october 2003 the agreement has been in force for the eaeu members since 1 january 2010 and is relevant also for internal trade among them however on 16 may 2014 kazakhstan denounced the agreement and currently applies its own national rules further kazakhstan has requested the exclusion of the provisions on export control from the scope of the eaeu treaty the agreement contains a set of common harmonised rules and procedures with regard to trade in specific raw materials dual use goods and equipment technology and services that might be used in weapons of mass destruction and missile delivery systems and military goods and equipment the agreement establishes a common list of goods and technology subject to export control under the agreement the participants are called on to communicate and cooperate among themselves and coordinate in the enforcement of export controls on goods included in the common list however the member states retain certain powers and remain responsible for the establishment and management of national competent authorities in charge of administering export controls and issuing export licences for the listed goods procedures involving customs declarations controls and where relevant payments of export taxes and duties apply to exports of goods and technologies on the common list outside the territory of the eaeu government authorities 22 which authorities handle the controls the following authorities handle export controls

imposition of economic sanctions with respect to specific countries persons and entities for information on economic sanctions see question 28 named persons and institutions 26 does your jurisdiction have a scheme restricting or banning exports to named persons and institutions abroad give details as stated above export controls with regard to the destination of the goods and technologies including with respect to persons and institutions in third countries are relevant in the context of economic sanctions see question 30 penalties 27 what are the possible penalties for violation of export controls penalties for violation of export controls are imposed according to the national legislation of the member states of the eaeu all countries provide for administrative and criminal liability for individuals found to have violated export control rules their actions can also be subject to civil damage claims legal entities may be subject to financial penalties or may be prohibited from running foreign economic activities for up to three years or both the gravity of the penalties is similar in all eaeu member states in russia criminal offences related to export controls are subject to financial penalties up of to 500 000 roubles imprisonment for up to three years and a prohibition on engaging in certain activities for up to five years or forced labour for up to three years however for violations committed by an organised group of persons or in connection with weapons of mass destruction the imprisonment period is up to seven years and the financial penalty is up to 1 million roubles administrative liability is limited to penalties of up to 20 000 roubles for legal entities and 2 000 roubles for individuals with or without confiscation of the goods or property subject to the offence government authorities 28 what government offices impose sanctions and embargoes the eec may introduce measures on foreign trade to implement economic sanctions against specific third countries due to the international obligations of eaeu member states such as sanctions approved by the united nations security council the measures should be adopted unanimously by all member states the legal basis for imposition of economic sanctions is contained in the protocol on measures of non tariff regulation applicable to third countries annex no 7 of the eaeu treaty under the above protocol the eaeu member states may also adopt sanctions and embargoes at the national level for the protection of national security interests in cases of balance of payments difficulties and for other reasons similar to general exceptions of the wto agreements as well as in exceptional situations which are not clarified further in the eaeu treaty such measures can be introduced pursuant to the respective domestic legislation eg article 13 of the federal law of the russian federation on fundamentals of the state regulation of foreign trade no 164 fz of 8 december 2003 normally the duration of such unilateral measures should not exceed six months other countries within the eaeu are called upon to respect and tolerate the unilateral measures adopted by an eaeu member state and affecting foreign trade with third states on 4 june 2018 the federal law on measures to mitigate counteract unfriendly actions of the united states of america and other foreign states entered into force the law aims to facilitate the adoption and introduction by the president and government of potential retaliatory measures against the us s sanctions imposed on certain russian companies and individuals in april and may 2018 as well as against further unfriendly acts sanctions of the us and other countries including those which decided to pursue the us s measures potential retaliatory measures could be of a political eg seizure of international cooperation or economic nature trade embargoes limitations on trade in services participation in the governmental contracts and privatisation etc as well as other measures the language of the new law grants wide discretion to the authorities in terms of qualifications of unfriendly acts and specific individuals as well as legal or public entities targeted by potential retaliatory measures and regarding the choice and extent of the countermeasures at the same time trade restrictions must not apply to imports into russia of vital goods that are not produced domestically and to goods imported for personal use the new law also obliges all individuals and organisations within the russian jurisdiction to implement the above countermeasures strictly applicable countries 29 what countries are currently the subject of sanctions or embargoes by your country the member states of the eaeu introduce and maintain sanctions and trade embargoes on the basis of the respective united nations security council resolutions however the exact scope and conditions may vary from one member state to another for that reason there is no single source of information on trade embargoes or economic sanctions maintained in the eaeu by its member states individual measures are provided for in various governmental decrees or resolutions of the member states in 2019 the eaeu member states maintained trade embargoes and sanctions adopted by the un security council including such countries as afghanistan central african republic democratic republic of the congo democratic people s republic of korea guinea bissau iran libya mali somalia south sudan sudan yemen and various individuals and organisations eg isil and al qaida suspected of participation in terrorist networks or activities and residing in various third countries including but not limited to the above see question 30 on 6 august 2014 russia banned imports of certain agricultural products raw materials and foodstuffs from the us the eu canada australia norway ukraine effective from 1 january 2016 albania montenegro iceland and liechtenstein in response to the economic sanctions in connection with events in ukraine in 2014 the list of banned imports covers all kinds of meat and meat products including sausages and similar products and offal fish and other seafood milk and dairy products cheeses cottage cheese etc vegetables fruits and nuts but excluding atlantic salmon and trout juveniles lactose free milk seed potatoes and onion hybrid sweetcorn and seed peas food supplements vitamin mineral complexes food flavourings or additives and protein concentrates baby food was explicitly excluded from the above prohibitions initially the measures were imposed for a one year period subject to prolongation or amendments in scope on 27 may 2016 the russian government relaxed import restrictions on beef poultry meat and vegetables intended for the production of baby food in russia by june 2019 russia had not introduced new countersanctions or trade embargoes against the eu or changed the existing ones in addition in response to the incident with a russian military aircraft on 24 november 2015 russia introduced a package of economic sanctions against turkey taking full effect as of 1 january 2016 most of the restrictive measures were lifted in 2017 and 2018 other eaeu member states did not join the restrictive measures imposed by russia although eaeu members formally respect and comply with the above russian restrictions there are numerous media reports on circumvention cases specific individuals and companies 30 are individuals or specific companies subject to financial sanctions individuals specific organisations and companies are already subject to financial sanctions by the member states of the eaeu the measures applied to individuals and entities include freezing financial and economic assets sanctions against persons and entities take place at the national level the authorities of each member state maintain and publish lists of organisations and persons in particular those suspected of terrorist activities eg russia s fstec website and decision of the council of ministers of the republic of belarus no 336 of 11 march 2006 the national authorities of eaeu member states regularly exchange information relating to sanctioned persons and entities the names of newly affected legal entities and individuals subject to financial sanctions are as a rule annexed to the national legal act of the member state implementing new sanctions according to the russian federal law 272 fz of 28 december 2012 on measures impacting individuals involved in violations of fundamental human rights and freedoms and of rights and freedoms of citizens of the russian federation the russian authorities can prohibit entry and seize the property and assets of listed foreign individuals considered to have been involved in violations of fundamental rights and freedoms and in offences against russian citizens this federal law is widely seen as a retaliatory measure by russia against legislation in the us known as the sergei magnitsky rule of law accountability act of 2012 which imposes individual sanctions on persons involved in violations of human rights and the rule of law in russia some individuals subject to sanctions under federal law 272 fz of 28 december 2012 are listed at www mid ru ru maps us asset_publisher unvxbbj4z6e8 content id 2047929 in march 2014 nine officials from the us and 13 canadian officials became subject to a ban on entering russia in response to the sanctions against russia related to the crisis in ukraine these lists are subject to continuous amendments for the purpose of expansion or annulment at any time without prior notice other trade remedies and controls 31 describe any trade remedy measures import or export controls not covered above that are particular to your jurisdiction traditionally the eaeu member states have relied on export taxes or export duties mostly on raw materials and hydrocarbons the rationale for export taxes has been to secure significant income for national budgets as well as to redistribute income from large businesses to the state and eventually to contribute to more equal distribution of the nations wealth from natural endowments export taxes may also potentially affect precious metals and minerals and rare earths however this area is now regulated by wto rules and commitments at least as far as the largest member state russia is concerned member states also have recourse to non tariff measures on imports and exports of goods see question 20 in addition the eec maintains a list of strategic goods that can be subject to temporary export restrictions in case of shortages and other critical situations see decision of the commission of the customs union of 27 january 2010 no 168 and notably its annex 1 as amended unilateral measures by the member states of the eaeu restricting imports or exports of goods from their national territories remain exceptional but are still possible in particular russia s import ban of 6 august 2014 see question 29 on certain food products from the us the eu and other countries can be regarded as a unilateral measure if the latter jurisdictions continue to prolong and intensify economic sanctions affecting russia in the future new russian unilateral measures should not be excluded additional tariffs imposed on imports of a wide range of steel and aluminium products by the us allegedly on national security grounds in january 2018 could ignite and escalate many trade conflicts around the globe the consequences of the above and further potential unilateral protectionist actions on the world trade are difficult to predict however it is certain that they may significantly change the trade regimes of many countries and territories in the near future update and trends key developments 32 are there any emerging trends or hot topics in trade and customs law and policy in your jurisdiction in recent years russia and other eaeu member states have followed a moderate external trade policy while trying to focus on import substitution and internal market protection in the meantime russia has effectively defended its rights in the notable wto dispute with ukraine on measures concerning traffic in transit invoking the national security provisions under the gatt 1994 on the other hand russia continues to face criticism from the us and eu on many restrictive market access measures and industrial subsidisation policies in future we expect further involvement of other eaeu member states in wto affairs
week ahead more central banks in wait and see mode uk election fomc ecb us china tariff deadline we have quite a week ahead of us so let s not spend too much time reviewing the past week because it s by and large it s the usual themes in the market em brexit and trade the british pound was the best performing currency of the week as the conservative party solidifies its lead in the polls see below it looks like we re going to get a conservative majority and brexit on schedule on 31 january the party is billing that as delivering brexit on time but of course that s not brexit it s just the start of brexit they ll then have a year or so to work out the entirety of the future relationship with the eu as liberal democratic party leader jo swinson said the idea that brexit is going to be done we re like in episode 1 of a 10 season box set good luck there were two central banks meetings during the week the reserve bank of australia rba and the bank of canada both joined the wait and see crowd causing currencies to appreciate over week overall easing expectations diminished during the week led by canada and new zealand with britain and the eu following oddly enough expectations of rba cutting rates actually increased slightly despite the rba s more optimistic tone that was due to the weaker than expected gdp figure on wednesday the coming week uk election fomc ecb us china tariff deadline you thought maybe that as the year winds down you d get a chance to relax well that s after this coming week for now the year is going out with a bang with a week filled with market moving events the main point of interest the event we ve all been waiting for is the uk general election at the time of writing it looks like the conservative party is going to get a majority in its own right which it alleges will allow it to leave the eu on schedule on 31 january the following graph from the economist shows the average of polls up to 5 december this kind of lead would usually be enough to allow the tories to win a parliamentary majority outright although we must bear in mind that a polls in britain have been notoriously unreliable for the last several years and b this election is subject to unprecedented uncertainty because people are no longer voting by party they re voting brexit past performance is no guarantee at all of future performance added to this the first winter election since the 1920s and you have no idea who will bother voting and how they will vote if there s a hung parliament then gbp will probably plunge but assuming the polls are right and the conservatives do win a majority the question then is how far can gbp bounce my guess is that even though it has risen ahead of the election there is so much doubt about the polls that speculators will have to build in some risk premium that s why i don t think there will be a buy the rumor sell the fact response on the contrary i expect buy the rumor and buy the fact even more speculators are still short gbp as are active currency managers they ve still got some ways to go before they re even flat much less long the real trouble of course will come further down the road when the politics cool down and the diabolical economics take over but that s for the first weekly in february brexit will of course be the major topic of discussion at the eu summit meeting in brussels thursday evening and friday the leaders should know by friday morning whether pm johnson has a majority the draft communique apparently urges the timely ratification of the withdrawal agreement in other words let s get this over with asap will brexit hurt eur so far it hasn t as far as we can tell but once the withdrawal agreement is signed and chaos at the borders begins eur could be hit too aside from that the other burning topic under discussion at the summit will be climate change leaders will reportedly aim to endorse the objective of achieving a climate neutral eu by 2050 according to reuters that could affect some energy stocks maybe they should hold the next summit in venice to help focus their minds on the problem there are two big central bank meetings during the coming week the federal open market committee fomc on wednesday and the european central bank ecb on thursday neither of these is a live meeting as it were the market is pricing in zero repeat zero chance of any change in rates at either meeting what then will we be looking for for the fed fomc members are sticking to their view that the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate and it would take a material reassessment of the economic outlook to get them to change both fed chair powell and gov brainard reiterated that view just last week what might such a material change look like slower growth in payrolls like we re expected to see this afternoon certainly wouldn t cut it we d need to see unemployment currently 3 6 rise to well above their estimate of the normal unemployment rate of 4 2 before they even start to get worried and with this week s consumer price index cpi expected to come in right around their target for inflation see below there s no need on that front to cut rates either that s why i don t expect any significant changes in the statement following the meeting and i believe it s likely to have relatively little impact on markets aside from the immediate direction of policy one point of interest will be any further discussions that they have on the review of their monetary policy strategy tools and communications as gov brainard phrased it but details of that discussion probably wouldn t appear until the minutes are released on 3 january the ecb meeting is likely to be similarly pro forma insofar as policy is concerned but it will attract a lot more scrutiny as it s the first one under the leadership of ecb president lagarde this will be her first time to give the post meeting press conference and so to hear her views in detail lagarde hasn t made many comments about monetary policy up to now the most she said was in her hearing before the european parliament s committee on economic and monetary affairs on monday her comments then could ve been taken from the statement following the ecb s last meeting suggesting that we can expect continuity from her rather than a new change of strategy this is only natural as lagarde isn t an economist by training she s therefore likely to start her tenure by reflecting the views of the governing council more than by trying to shape them in a new direction i expect more of the same this week as she starts to find her way in this new role perhaps her most important job at first will be to try to heal the divisions on the governing council between the doves and the hawks this meeting will also produce new staff forecasts for gdp growth and inflation they re likely to be unchanged from the previous set three months ago and so won t require any policy response as a result i expect the important parts of her statement to be pretty much the same as in october she s likely to acknowledge some improvement in the global outlook as other central banks have done but continue with the assessment that the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain on the downside one possible change we can glean from her comments to the eu parliament may be that she tempers the ecb s willingness to change policy the governing council continues to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate to be conditional on an assessment of the possible side effects of policy that would be a fairly small change however without much market significance the swiss national bank also meets a few hours before the ecb does on thursday but their meetings are usually uneventful for the markets interest rates in switzerland are currently the lowest they ve ever been anywhere in human history it ll take a lot for them to go lower meanwhile the snb isn t going to raise rates until well after the ecb starts to do so and the way things are going that might not happen in my lifetime see japan advertisement indicators japan tankan us cpi us retail sales uk short term indicator day as if these dramatic events weren t enough there are several important economic indicators coming out japan s economic indicators have little effect on the markets nowadays that s probably because the market is well aware of the bank of japan s reaction function which can be summed up as asleep at the wheel the boj just isn t going to change policy in reaction to anything or maybe it should be pedal to the floor because the boj can t change policy they ve basically done all they can do the main exception to this indicator rule is the bank of japan s quarterly short term economic survey of enterprises in japan known universally by its japanese acronym tankan the tankan is a huge survey of some 11 500 companies in japan designed to be representative of the japanese economy this is the most important indicator out of japan every quarter like the ifo or other such surveys it s presented as a diffusion index di of the percentage of firms saying things are improving minus the percentage saying things are worsening it s troubling that this quarter the dis for both large manufacturers and non manufacturers are expected to decline notably although the expectations index for large manufacturers what they expect the index to be when the survey is taken in q1 next year is forecast to rise a bit one problem with the tankan is that its effect on usd jpy is not consistent you might think that a rise in the dis would foreshadow a better economy and therefore cause the yen to strengthen while a fall should have the opposite effect however the tankan s most direct link is to the stock market since it reflects the views of companies a weak tankan can send japanese stocks lower and as we all know the yen often strengthens on a risk off mood when japanese stocks fall so even if you can forecast the results of the survey correctly it s hard to predict how the currency will move as a result nonetheless just straight economics would suggest that a further decline in sentiment among companies could eventually elicit a response from the somnolent bank of japan if we listen to what gov kuroda has to say the tankan may therefore be negative for the yen the us cpi will be released a few hours before the fomc makes its decision on wednesday this index isn t what the fed uses as its main inflation guide that s the personal consumption expenditure pce deflator or more specifically the core pce deflator be that as it may the market pays attention to it as if it is it s expected to show headline inflation bang on the fed s 2 target while core inflation is forecast to continue to run a bit above that rate if the fed takes this into account and i m not sure whether they do it certainly won t indicate any need for any change in policy any time soon usd positive other key us indicators coming out during the week include producer prices on thursday and retail sales on friday retail sales are important because everyone is pinning their hopes on the broad shoulders and deep pockets of the us consumer to sustain growth as gov brainard said last week there are good reasons to expect the economy to grow at a pace modestly above potential over the next year or so supported by strong consumers and a healthy job market this week s figure is expected to confirm that narrative as retail sales are forecast to grow exactly in line with the trend that s encouraging everyone so much usd positive other important indicators out during the week include uk short term indicator day on tuesday that s when the monthly gdp figure the trade data and industrial manufacturing production are all announced of course two days before the election these key data may not affect the market as much as it usually would in any event the gdp data the most important are expected to be miserable gdp is forecast to rise 0 1 mom which is pathetic after three consecutive months of decline the 3m 3m change is forecast to fall to zero stalling gbp negative if indeed anyone is paying attention which they may not be watch out for tariff sunday weekly update written by special guest analyst marshall gittler chief strategist head of education at acls global sign up for further analysis and forex signals at website acls global limited was created on the principle of bringing together a team of experts from the retail institutional forex world headed by the world renowned forex analyst marshall gittler and other analysts from around the globe this combination alone boasts 6 decades of successful analysis and trading in currencies while we count down the days left in the year there s one big date left for the financial markets sunday 15 december that s the day when the us is scheduled to raise tariffs on chinese goods it s a key day for the long running us china trade war here s the background back in august trump raised tariffs on 250bn worth of goods from china to 30 from 25 effective 15 october and to 15 from 10 on the remaining 300bn worth of goods effective 15 december but a few days before the october deadline trump announced that he was suspending the increase as the us and china had tentatively agreed on the first phase of a trade deal with china agreeing to buy up to 50bn in american farm products and to accept more us financial services in return this phase one agreement was supposed to be a limited agreement that would allow both sides to claim victory while soothing financial markets but china started making additional demands such as for the rollback of some existing tariffs and that tentative phase one agreement was never signed now the question is what will happen on 15 december will trump go ahead with that tariff increase last week the talk from the administration was that he was likely to postpone the december round of tariff increases even if the two sides hadn t reached a phase one agreement but the scuttlebutt this week is that he will indeed go ahead trump said that a trade deal is dependent on whether i want to make it in some ways it is better to wait until after the election and we ll see whether the deal is going to be right he said the election of course being the presidential election next november if trump does postpone the tariff increase it would cool the temperature around the trade talks the gesture may help to offset the impact of the hong kong human rights and democracy act of 2019 a bill that congress enacted which china feels is an interference in its domestic affairs and a thumb in its eye while the two sides are trying to work out this trade issue with both sides calmer an agreement would be easier to reach on the other hand if he goes ahead and ups the tariffs it will signal a new level of tensions in the trade war and probably elicit reciprocal actions by china that would probably cause a massive risk off move in the markets while sunday is the deadline for this and so strictly speaking i should write about it next week i expect the decision to be made sometime during the coming week that will be another major hurdle for the markets up to now i ve thought that with trump facing so many fights at the same time he d want an easy and quick victory somewhere but recently he s been booed at several sporting events in the us and mocked by his peers at the nato conference he can t stand being ridiculed i now think he s likely to dig in his heels just to prove he s tough i expect him to go ahead and allow the tariffs to be increased causing a risk off move that will send gold jpy and chf higher and aud and probably usd lower but of course his behavior is unpredictable much depends on who the last person to talk to him is and it s not going to be me as humphrey bogart said in the african queen you pay your money you take your choice
you can now subscribe to our you can now subscribe to our economic times whatsapp channel new delhi the indian economic juggernaut is on the roll and conditions are right for it to be a global super power of the 21st century noted indian ambassador to usa harsh vardhan shringla as he spoke about strong fundamentals of indian economy india is on the march it became a 3 0 trillion economy this year imf world economic outlook oct 2019 it took us nearly 60 years after independence to reach the 1 trillion mark only 12 years since then to take it to 3 0 trillion and only 5 years from 2014 2019 to take it from 2 0 trillion to 3 0 trillion prime minister of india has set a goal of achieving the 5 0 trillion mark by 2025 and we are all working diligently to achieve that goal shringla said while delivering address next phase of india s growth and development at harvard kennedy school cambridge massachusetts on friday india s growth story is based on its fundamentals while accelerating growth we have also achieved macro stability inclusive and sustainable growth we have achieved high growth maintaining social cohesion democracy and rule of law inflation used to be a problem in the early stages of our development it used to erode incomes cause hardship to our citizens and even bring down the political governments all that has changed from near double digits inflation has been brought down to the 4 0 percent level over the last five years india s fiscal and current account deficits which used to be 6 00 and 3 00 percent respectively a few years ago have been brought down to half with this internal and external macro stability india s national currency the rupee has become relatively stable and india has become a favourite destination for investment among the emerging markets the envoy pointed out inclusion can be the biggest failing of rapid growth across the world but india has managed it remarkably well income inequality has been a problem in many advanced economies but india has managed to pull millions out of poverty ever since growth accelerated following the liberalization of the 1990 s according to the oxford undp report on multi dimensional poverty india has lifted 271 million people out of poverty between 2006 and 2016 social inequality in india has been addressed through affirmative action and improved opportunities for the disadvantaged groups who were systematically left behind by the travails of history pointed out shringla spatial inequality has been dealt with by redistribution of financial resources through the finance commission set up once every five years and through the mechanism of centrally sponsored schemes and investment incentive for the backward areas he noted india s constitutional democracy is exemplary we have survived and prospered while several other nation states post the world war have fallen our constitution guarantees fundamental rights to all our citizens with an independent judiciary to enforce them together with growth and development india s socio political and institutional framework has promoted social cohesion and helped build a fair and equitable state that is run for by and of the people india enjoys a demographic dividend its working age population is larger than its non working age population and this dividend is expected to last till the middle of the 21st century said shringla it is likely to propel growth for at least three decades to come serious attempts are being made through the skill india mission to skill nearly 400 million people and ensure the benefits of demographic dividend translate into growth and development for our economy by 2030 india is projected to have a skilled labour surplus of over 200 million workers and would be a net supplier of skilled workforce for the entire world they would also be english speaking globally mobile and driver of growth for economies around the world india will soon have the largest market base population and with rising per capita incomes will go on to be the largest market in the world by 2030 one in two households is expected to be middle class by then india would also be an upper middle income country as per the world bank classification this essentially means by the middle of the 21st century india would be the largest market on earth a country which no power would be able to ignore and whose economy would be closely linked to product markets around the world through global value chains and to the factor markets through investment capital and skilled workforce india has undertaken unprecedented structural reforms since the liberalization of the 1990 s several industries have been de regulated many state owned enterprises privatised and government has opened its doors to foreign direct investment india today has one of the most liberal fdi regimes with more than 90 percent of foreign investment flowing in through the automatic route over the last five years government has undertaken deeper fdi reforms liberalizing defence construction single brand retail contract manufacturing aviation financial services mining etc as a result of these initiatives india achieved record fdi flows of us 286 billion between 2014 15 to 2018 19 making it the one of most attractive fdi destination across the world india has undertaken monumental tax reforms goods and services tax has done away with cascading differential tax systems and brought a complex federal polity under one nation one tax regime the envoy informed it is now being simplified further to internalize efficiencies and to evolve a moderate and efficient tax system that creates an integrated market for the whole economy corporate tax reforms announced recently are equally historic corporate tax rates have been brought down from 30 to 22 percent and for new investments to only 15 percent making india one of the most competitive industrial locations across the world logistics had been a long standing bottleneck for businesses which traditionally made the indian economy less competitive we have taken up the challenge in full earnest and would be undertaking a massive 1 4 trillion investment in infrastructure over the next five years five years ago we used to build 12 km roads per day today we build 30 km per day we are modernizing our railways and have undertaken major upgradation of our ports and airports through the public private partnership route you will see modern logistics improve efficiency of our economy and make india globally competitive as we arrive closer to the 5 0 trillion target i will now turn to the entrepreneurial ecosystem india has made the fastest progress in improving the ease of doing business india s ranking in the world bank s ease of doing business report has improved from 142 in 2014 to 63 in 2019 a jump of 79 places in a short span of five years india is the fastest growing digital economy and has the third largest start up ecosystem in the world this combined with a large pool of skilled professionals will make india the technology incubator of the future world the ambassador pointed out referring to india us bilateral trade he said it has been growing 10 percent year on year basis and is expected to reach 160 billion in 2019 trade has also become more balanced with us exports to india growing faster than indian exports to united states our investment relationship is also bi directional with 2000 us companies investing around 40 billion in india covering almost every sector of the modern economy 200 indian companies have also invested 18 billion dollars in us creating more than 1 00 000 jobs directly
investment thesis investment management companies perform well when the global economy is growing as investors tend to flock to equity securities generally such investments bear higher costs than fixed income or passive investment solutions enabling asset management companies to earn higher fees that result in profit margin expansion considering the global economy grew steadily in the decade following the financial crisis of 2008 it doesn t come as a surprise that many of the leading companies in this industry have provided stellar returns to investors the share price performance of major investment management companies in the last 10 years the industry however is going through dynamic changes the secular growth of passive investment products which have lower fees is proving to be an obstacle for many companies but not for blackrock inc blk financial the company certainly is the leader of this space and enjoys significant competitive advantages even though shares have appreciated 123 over the past decade there is still upside potential the stock was trading with a dividend yield of 2 7 at the market price of around 497 on friday company profile and business strategy blackrock is an asset management company providing a suite of investment products and solutions to institutional corporate and retail clients at the end of the first quarter the company was ranked number one in regard to assets under management top 10 asset managers by aum as of march 31 2019 source adv ratings one of the primary reasons blackrock has been so successful is because of the extensive products and solutions offered which represent various asset classes styles regions and markets product categories source company website the global footprint of the company has been another factor in its success the rising income levels of emerging markets such as the asia pacific and latin america regions created a demand for wealth management products in the last several years which was addressed by blackrock because of its reach in these regions over the last five years the company has focused on diversifying its business operations as a result the company now provides investment management risk management solutions and portfolio construction software tools to integrate all these operations into a single ecosystem the one blackrock model was introduced these changes indicate that offering all in one solutions to clients is one of the company s primary business strategies global offices source company website keeping up with technological advancements and providing a streamlined experience to clients is also a business objective of blackrock as confirmed by the management in the third quarter earnings conference call distributing wealth to shareholders through buybacks and dividends has always been a priority as well which the management expects to continue indefinitely industry analysis the asset management industry is at a crossroads historically companies focused on providing active investment products in a bid to help clients generate alpha returns however in the last decade passive investment products have garnered unfathomable attention and investors have poured trillions of dollars into such solutions a paper drafted by four federal reserve system governors in september confirmed that this shift will change the financial systems for many years the shift from active to passive investment strategies has profoundly affected the asset management industry in the past couple of decades and the ongoing nature of the shift suggests that its effects will continue to ripple through the financial system for years to come benjamin phillips a consultant with casey quirk told bloomberg news he believes that overall industry wide passive investment assets under management will soon overtake those of active investments source bloomberg companies that have failed to address this new development are falling behind the early adopters of such strategies blackrock was one of the first to address this shift and as a result has a market share of 20 currently source bloomberg companies that continue to provide innovative and thematic passive solutions will likely generate economic profits in the next 10 years pricewaterhousecoopers projects a huge increase in assets under management in 2020 and a shift in the investor base the volume of investable assets is expected to grow faster in south america asia africa and the middle east in comparison to developed regions such as north america and europe therefore investment management companies with a solid presence in these regions will be in a better position to exploit the available growth opportunities technological developments will also be at the heart of the industry in the next five years the growth of robo advisory solutions is one such aspect that needs to be addressed by industry participants according to data from backend benchmarking 440 billion in assets is currently being managed by automated investment solutions providers companies with a strong balance sheet and a healthy cash position would be able to either acquire small companies providing these types of services or develop a platform to roll out automated products in the future addressing this growing shift early would be key to staying relevant in the changing industry finally the industry is seeing an increased level of regulation from governing authorities so failing to comply with these standards might result in significant losses however morningstar analysts predict that smaller scale companies might find it difficult to absorb this pressure from regulators in the short term which could be beneficial for industry leaders financial performance the performance of equity markets has been stellar in the last 12 months however there has been some significant volatility at times as a result of trade tensions between the u s and china geopolitical uncertainty and unstable oil prices over this same period however blackrock has generated approximately 350 billion 5 of total organic growth this is an indication of the effectiveness of its business structure in the third quarter the company reported net inflows of 84 billion supported by 51 billion of inflows to the company s passive investment solutions source company filings the company s operating profit margin has declined at a steady rate from 40 83 in 2014 to 38 51 in the trailing 12 month period this doesn t come as a surprise considering the growth of low fee generating passive products at the end of the third quarter active products represented only 27 of total assets under management but generated 47 of base fees this is a clear indication that these products have better margins based on these factors it s fair to conclude that margins will compress further in the future management is optimistic however that this compression will partly be offset by the growth of assets source third quarter earnings presentation blackrock s debt maturities are well staged which is an indication of the high quality capital management practices being deployed in the next 11 years there are four years in which no maturities occur leaving ample time for the company to prepare its finances to honor upcoming repayments this reduces the company s refinancing risk source company filings according to data from gurufocus blackrock s debt to equity ratio is 0 19 which is indicative of a strong balance sheet position blackrock is generating organic growth even under volatile market conditions and analysts predict mid single digit revenue growth for the next five years as well the company continues to repurchase stock on the open market reducing the number of shares outstanding this will help per share earnings figures in the future dividends on the other hand have grown steadily since the third quarter of 2017 amid slow growth the company will deliver attractive returns to its shareholders in the coming years based on its ability to pounce on market opportunities according to gregory warren the morningstar analyst covering blackrock the company has a wide economic moat resulting from the significant switching costs of changing wealth from one investment manager to another this moat will help generate alpha returns as well outlook blackrock is investing to enhance its product offering to capture long term returns from developing trends in the industry for instance the iconic ishares exchange traded fund offering has been refreshed with new funds addressing higher growth segments such as factor investing sustainable investing and megatrend funds as these themes gain traction just like high tech investing did over the last couple of decades blackrock will be the go to investment solutions provider for clients capital expenditures have increased in the last three years as the company has started developing the necessary infrastructure to roll out new fund categories and will likely remain elevated over the next several years as well despite several reports by the international monetary fund and the world bank the federal reserve believes the american economy will continue to grow over the next several years in the third quarter the americas contributed to 66 of base fees and continued economic growth in the u s will positively impact blackrock s earnings trade tensions on the other hand are expected to subside as the two nations will eventually come to an agreement a couple of weeks ago chinese officials confirmed to the south china morning post that a trade deal is likely within the next several months this will be a tailwind for blackrock since a continuation of the current bull market would lead to higher net inflows blackrock is addressing the threat posed by robo advisory services as well the acquisition of futureadvisor in 2015 is finally set to pay dividends as investors embrace automated investing solutions the outlook for the company is positive and blackrock will likely benefit from the industry wide developments while some of its peers might struggle this is a result of the company s careful planning to invest in technologically advanced solutions and

negative as investors park investable assets in their cash accounts as opposed to higher fee generating investment products this will compress profit margins leading to earnings erosion a further appreciation of the u s dollar against emerging market currencies is another risk for investors as this would negatively impact the company s total revenue conclusion blackrock is one of the leading asset management companies in the world it is benefiting from the secular trend of investors embracing passive investment solutions even though fees of these products are lower than that of actively

investment thesis investment management companies perform well when the global economy is growing as investors tend to flock to equity securities generally such investments bear higher costs than fixed income or passive investment solutions enabling asset management companies to earn higher fees that result in profit margin expansion considering the global economy grew steadily in the decade following the financial crisis of 2008 it doesn t come as a surprise that many of the leading companies in this industry have provided stellar returns to investors the share price performance of major investment management companies in the last 10 years the industry however is going through dynamic changes the secular growth of passive investment products which have lower fees is proving to be an obstacle for many companies but not for blackrock inc nyse blk the company certainly is the leader of this space and enjoys significant competitive advantages even though shares have appreciated 123 over the past decade there is still upside potential the stock was trading with a dividend yield of 2 7 at the market price of around 497 on friday company profile and business strategy blackrock is an asset management company providing a suite of investment products and solutions to institutional corporate and retail clients at the end of the first quarter the company was ranked number one in regard to assets under management top 10 asset managers by aum as of march 31 2019 source adv ratings one of the primary reasons blackrock has been so successful is because of the extensive products and solutions offered which represent various asset classes styles regions and markets product categories source company website the global footprint of the company has been another factor in its success the rising income levels of emerging markets such as the asia pacific and latin america regions created a demand for wealth management products in the last several years which was addressed by blackrock because of its reach in these regions story continues over the last five years the company has focused on diversifying its business operations as a result the company now provides investment management risk management solutions and portfolio construction software tools to integrate all these operations into a single ecosystem the one blackrock model was introduced these changes indicate that offering all in one solutions to clients is one of the company s primary business strategies global offices source company website keeping up with technological advancements and providing a streamlined experience to clients is also a business objective of blackrock as confirmed by the management in the third quarter earnings conference call distributing wealth to shareholders through buybacks and dividends has always been a priority as well which the management expects to continue indefinitely industry analysis the asset management industry is at a crossroads historically companies focused on providing active investment products in a bid to help clients generate alpha returns however in the last decade passive investment products have garnered unfathomable attention and investors have poured trillions of dollars into such solutions a paper drafted by four federal reserve system governors in september confirmed that this shift will change the financial systems for many years the shift from active to passive investment strategies has profoundly affected the asset management industry in the past couple of decades and the ongoing nature of the shift suggests that its effects will continue to ripple through the financial system for years to come benjamin phillips a consultant with casey quirk believes passive investment assets under management will soon overtake that of active investments source bloomberg companies that have failed to address this new development are falling behind the early adopters of such strategies blackrock was one of the first to address this shift and as a result has a market share of 20 currently source bloomberg companies that continue to provide innovative and thematic passive solutions will likely generate economic profits in the next 10 years pricewaterhousecoopers projects a huge increase in assets under management in 2020 and a shift in the investor base the volume of investable assets is expected to grow faster in south america asia africa and the middle east in comparison to developed regions such as north america and europe therefore investment management companies with a solid presence in these regions will be in a better position to exploit the available growth opportunities technological developments will also be at the heart of the industry in the next five years the growth of robo advisory solutions is one such aspect that needs to be addressed by industry participants according to data from backend benchmarking 440 billion in assets is currently being managed by automated investment solutions providers companies with a strong balance sheet and a healthy cash position would be able to either acquire small companies providing these types of services or develop a platform

an employee counts yuan banknotes file china s foreign exchange reserves fell 9 billion in november to 3 096 trillion central bank data showed on saturday as washington and beijing remained locked in negotiations over an interim trade agreement analysts polled by reuters had expected china s reserves the world s largest would fall 4 billion to 3 101 trillion in november despite the slowing chinese economy and escalating us china trade war its reserves have been gradually rising since late 2018 helped by tight capital controls and rising inflows from foreign investors who are snapping up the country s stocks and bonds modest changes in reserve levels in recent months have been largely ascribed to fluctuations in global exchange rates and the value of assets that china holds such as foreign bonds the yuan has been driven largely by twists and turns in the 17 month long trade war between china and the united states after sliding sharply this summer as the dispute suddenly escalated the yuan rose for three straight months through november on hopes of a trade truce only to slide again in early december as tensions between washington and beijing flared fresh us tariffs on chinese goods are set to take effect on dec 15 it gained 0 12 against the dollar in november but remains about 2 3 weaker for the year to date the dollar meanwhile rose about 1 per cent against a basket of other major currencies in november the value of the country s gold reserves fell to 91 47 billion at the end of november from 94 65 billion at the end of october china held 62 64 million fine troy ounces of gold at the end of november unchanged from october china s economic growth cooled to 6 0 in the third quarter the slowest pace in nearly 30 years and many economists believe it will decelerate further into the upper 5 range in 2020 still analysts note capital outflows have been modest compared with the last economic downturn in 2015 16 when policymakers burned through roughly 1 trillion in reserves supporting the yuan china s central bank has started to slowly trim interest rates in recent months and more reductions are expected in coming quarters to avert a sharper slowdown but analysts believe those cuts will likely be more gradual and smaller than those in 2015 if so moves in the yuan are likely to be influenced more by trade developments than policy easing separately us president donald trump lashed out at the world bank on friday blaming the international financial institution for lending money to china why is the world bank loaning money to china can this be possible china has plenty of money and if they don t they create it stop trump wrote on twitter the president was reiterating a position long held by his administration including david malpass when he was a treasury department official prior to his election as the current head of the world bank trump s message on the world bank was also echoed by his treasury secretary steven mnuchin who told a house of representatives committee on thursday that the united states has objected to the institution s multi year programme of loans and projects in china that programme was nonetheless adopted on thursday it plans to reduce its lending to china the programme reflects the evolution of our relationship with china martin raiser world bank country director for china said on thursday our engagement will be increasingly selective but the reduction is not enough for washington which argues that the world s second largest economy is rich enough to finance itself and not depend on loans from the world bank which is supposed to bring financial resources to poor countries trump s very public stance comes amid negotiations between washington and beijing seeking to end the us president s 18 month long trade war which is aimed at forcing china to make concessions on protecting american businesses and reducing its trade surplus there is a great deal of uncertainty about the date of a possible partial agreement which trump said was imminent in october top white house economic adviser larry kudlow said on friday that a dec 15 deadline is still in place to impose a new round of us tariffs on chinese consumer goods but president donald trump likes where trade talks with china are going agencies
democratic socialists of america dsa and its two predecessor organizations the democratic socialist organizing committee dsoc and the new american movement nam emerged in the early 1970s during a long term rightist movement in the united states the dsa s contribution to the american left was its new founded identity as a radical organization born out of a merger between the dsoc and nam dsa also sought to become a democratic socialist party which fostered the inclusion members similar to that of the bernie sander s presidential campaigns 2016 2020 nevertheless it was under the leadership of dsa michael harrington s penetrating critique of american culture in the other america 1963 that catalyzed the nascent civil rights movement its leaders and the kennedy administrations to prioritize combatting racism poverty and inequality this in turn set the stage for martin luther king s poor people s campaign and eventually king s denunciation of american global hegemony these events thus presaged the johnson administration s great society war on poverty the foundations of democratic socialism and in root the dsa have its origins in the eighteenth century during the breakdown of feudal europe specifically england where the medieval guilds and the protection of workers rights was subsequently replaced as a commodity or as marx describes as commodity fetishism the emergence of capitalism during this period further reinforced the domination of capital over labor and the horror this unleashed on labor in the industrial revolution confronting this crisis were religious leaders bishop joseph butler and reverend john wesley philosophers and economic reformers john locke and adam smith arguing that labor creates profit and value not capital moreover they argued that workers possess a property right to the profits and value they create this implied that labor rightfully must direct the control of capital since this determines how and to whom surplus value will be distributed in a democratic manner robert owen and the industrial revolution the origins of this position can be traced to such reformers as robert owen i argue that owen s model represents the initial development of what today has become known as democratic socialism the injustices and oppression of the industrial revolution provided the context for a democratic socialist economy movement led by robert owen 1771 1858 and the utopian socialists private property understood as the exclusive right of industrialists was identified as the source of existing exploitation and inequality while the industrial revolution brought about unprecedented wealth it is without question that only capitalists received the lion s share though labor created massive profits surplus value for the capitalist class labor received a subsistence wage barely enough to survive owen and the utopian socialists sought to counter this injustice by opting for labor s democratic ownership of capital and the surplus value labor produced put in other terms labor had a property right to the profits they created the industrial revolution that gathered momentum in eighteenth century europe and the united states created the historical context for democratic socialism utopians argued that private property capital was the source of existing inequalities but the framework of their thought based on conceptions of a pre industrial society is today remote the extensive development of factory production and the social conditions that ensued and the laissez faire interpretation of these events favored by conventional economists created the conditions in which modern socialism was born nonetheless the industrial revolution brought about unprecedented increases in productivity based on the development of factories and the widespread use of machinery the major cost of these innovations was borne by society s least powerful the working class or for all intents and purposes the vast majority of poor in 1750 the working class in europe specifically england and the united states lived near subsistence levels and the purchasing power of wages deteriorated considerably during the second half of the eighteenth century national income grew over this period so that workers relative living standards fell and the potential consumption they involuntarily sacrificed financed the investment required for industrialization had working class incomes kept in step with national income the average worker would have been approximately 50 percent richer in 1840 than thirty years earlier the industrial revolution replaced traditional occupations typically rural farming or guild status as an artisan in various crafts this change resulted from the breakdown of the old feudal societies of europe and the industrialization of those same economies due to mechanistic innovations in the means of production mechanization facilitated the division of labor creating tasks that women and children could perform entire families often worked to achieve subsistence the conditions under which labor was performed were unregulated and dangerous and involved long hours in dehumanizing conditions moreover the growth of factory production stimulated urbanization in europe and the united states as a result roads water sewage waste management public health and provisions for open spaces failed to keep pace with urban migration while housing was concentrated in crowded slums the inevitable result manifested itself in air and water pollution epidemics of typhoid and cholera and widespread respiratory and intestinal disease with a consequent low expectation of life successive administrations in england specifically during the nineteenth century industrial revolution were slow to intervene and remedy social problems and maintain the price of bread and impeded or subverted the development of trade unions within this context it can be asserted that the period of napoleonic war and the subsequent economic crisis constituted the bleakest chapter in british labor history precisely because the foundations of modern industry were erected on the suffering of workers denied access to the fruits of an expanding economy by contrast capitalists enjoyed absolute power over their labor force thus the industrial revolution created the modern working class nominally free but able to live only by selling their labor power suffice it to say britain witnessed a considerable development of radical economic doctrines in the first half of the nineteenth century the radical response owen s prestige was based on his reputation as a businessman an economic theorist and a social reformer from the age of ten he served as a draper s apprentice but at twenty he was the manager of a large cotton factory at new lanark which became renowned throughout britain for its conditions of work owen was a benevolent autocrat who insisted on strict industrial discipline but in combination with living wages a decent work environment abolition of child labor and compulsory education for workers children the profitability of new lanark demonstrated the shortsightedness of other capitalists notion that profit maximization is best achieved through the alienation and exploitation of labor new lanark provided a viable moral counterstrategy to neoliberal market rationality late eighteenth and early nineteenth century industrialization rested on three sets of institutional principles 1 the absolute nature of private property 2 a self regulating laissez faire market economy and 3 the transformation of labor into a commodity while owen accepted industrial innovations he did not agree with the unrestrained rule of private capital self regulating markets and the exploitation of human labor he argued these three economic truths were the ultimate causes of contemporary inequalities and social injustice and thus urged their elimination owen believed that an industrial economy if it is to be moral must be created based on the principles that every person must be treated with dignity and the proceeds of production were divided equitably the operation of any economy was then to be criticized and evaluated according to such principles owen believed that a more just and efficient economy should be focused on his experimental model at new lanark thus owen s political economy was based on three important radical tenants the first tenant is based on what owen described as an economy of high wages owen held the view that a wage increase or higher labor costs leads to 1 an improvement in the living standards of workers 2 which then leads to greater efficiency and production by workers in other words increased wages generate additional revenue for both company and workers yet owen s theory conflicted with the prevailing orthodoxy which argued that any wage increase occurred at the expense of profits and hence led to a diminution in employment and economic activity nevertheless by extending the economy of high wages from an individual firm to the nation owen embraced an embryonic under consumption theory of depressions he advocated a high wage policy that maintained purchasing power as a cure for unemployment and promotion of economic growth the second tenant on which owen based his political economy was a belief that an individualistic economy is inequitable irrational and antisocial moreover private ownership is an institution whereby one class gains power over the rest in order to maximize profits in contrast owen did not attack industry or new technology as it manifested itself in the burgeoning industrial revolution rather he denounced private ownership of the means of production the spread of unfettered and unregulated economic competition and elements of narcissistic individualism propagated through enlightenment liberalism owen argued to the contrary that private ownership and unrestrained competition destroys social cohesion furthermore he argued that individuals by themselves cannot simply improve their own lot in life rather it was within the context of a community and its many support networks that the betterment of individuals was realized the third tenant is based on owen s labor theory of value premised upon the priority of labor he viewed human labor as the natural standard of value and that this concept required capital and machinery to become the servant of labor owen believed that capital and profit are designed to serve the human person and community as its first moral priority public policy and not the market should determine the amount of labor expended on commodities and workers ought to be compensated based on both human needs and effort owen argued for economic cooperation rather than competition through a network of self governing communes where private ownership of the means of production was transformed into a democratic alliance eliminating any labor ownership conflict owen argued that capital and profit should never come at the expense of labor owen as social reformer owen s career as a national reformer can be understood in different stages between the publication of towards a new view of society in 1813 and a report to the county of lanark in 1821 he concentrated on ameliorating existing social problems such as poverty child labor inhumane work hours and unemployment he thought that these social injustices could be avoided if other manufacturers replicated new lanark on grounds of enlightened self interest indeed his arguments applied to capitalists more concerned with long term profitability than with immediate gains but he found that his appeals met with little response he then attempted to persuade government to alleviate poverty and inequality and was popular in official circles after 1815 only by virtue of the fact that he focused on the importance of environmental improvements more than his personal brand of socialism as he advanced beyond the role of wealthy philanthropist to structural reforms that threatened the establishment power centers he became decreasingly influential in elite circles between 1824 1835 owen established what he described as communist communities the cities of orbiston near glasgow tytherley in hampshire and new harmony in indiana were three of the most prominent the aim was to settle unemployed laborers on the land in self governed villages of unity and cooperation such schemes reflected his conviction that society as then constituted would permit cooperatives to supplant existing institutional structures owen did this by attempting to persuade the rich and influential about his ideas for social and economic transformation nevertheless the owenite settlements were challenged partly because of the hostile external environment of the business community and the agricultural depression which generated an influx of unemployed workers which exceeded capacity consequently an excess supply of labor to the villages of cooperation proved counterproductive to the communist communities yet not insurmountable owen persisted in his collectivist experimentations in 1824 the london co operative society was formed as a store for cooperative trading designed to supersede competitive distribution and allow craftsmen to exchange goods without capitalist intermediaries it aimed to sell at trade prices and use the savings accumulated through elimination of retailers profits to financially bolster socialist communities the next envisaged stage of development involved members cooperation to produce directly for each other rather than choosing between capitalist goods sold in their stores for example the london society opened an exchange bazaar for societies and individuals to engage in mutual exchange owen returned from the united states in 1829 after establishing more than three hundred cooperative societies in the united states and england this figure rose to almost five hundred by 1832 although many pursued solely educational objectives cooperative stores bought wholesale and sold retail the commodities demanded by their members but cooperative producers faced the difficult problem of obtaining a market for all their products this problem stimulated development of labor exchanges where workmen and producers cooperatives could exchange products directly and thus dispense with both employers and merchants the most important such institution the national equitable labor exchange was established by owen in 1832 and stimulated the formation of similar exchanges in provincial cities they sought to secure a wider market for cooperative groups and to enable them to exchange their products at an equitable valuation resting on labor time owen appointed trade union valuers to price goods on the basis of the cost of raw materials plus the amount of labor time expended on them a new currency of labor notes was issued for the conduct of transactions crucial weaknesses emerged however labor and commercial prices coexisted goods the exchanges offered more cheaply were soon disposed of while the more expensive remained unsold exchanges would not control their stocks to demand levels and movements in the manner of capitalist retailers since they had to take what members brought them consequently they became overstocked where there were many cooperative producers and understocked in trades where there were few in particular their supplies were concentrated on goods that could be produced by craftsmen possessing little capital despite this major weakness they enjoyed considerable success for a time but collapsed in the general crash of the movement in 1834 even then some exchanges balanced their books while the national equitable labor exchange incurred a heavy debt which then fell to owen when owen returned to england in 1829 he found that a trade union movement had emerged after the repeal of the combination acts in 1824 and in 1829 he witnessed the formation of the first modern national union the operative spinners while this was happening the next two years saw much social unrest in the form of agricultural riots and a wave of strike activity in the northern textile towns as a means of achieving the eight hour workday then by 1832 several distinct but related bodies such as the owenite societies cooperative stores cooperative producers labor exchange and trade unions looked to owen for leadership most were growing rapidly as workers disillusioned by the terms of the 1832 reform act swung away from political mobilization toward organized labor action owen sought the fusion of these groups into one national organization centrally directed and under worker control which would challenge and transform economic relations through its practice of cooperative production by 1833 the operative builders union obu was the largest in the country with a membership of sixty thousand the obu adopted an owenite agenda to take over the construction industry and reorganize it as a national guild to implement this program none of its members would work for capitalist builders who refused to join the guild the owners attempted to destroy the obu by a lockout by forcing those reemployed to sign a document i e a written pledge not to join a union which gives the employer the right to fire them if they violate the pledge the workers lost as the obu simultaneously fought the lockout and attempted to launch the guild with inadequate financial resources its members were then forced back to work by various regions during 1834 and by the end of that year the obu ceased to exist it split into craft sections with a greatly reduced membership owen nevertheless sought to unite all the associations intended for the improvement of the working class to this end he inspired the formation of the grand national consolidated trades union gnctu which was intended to be a single inclusive union aiming to supersede capitalism by a cooperative system based on workers control of production it sought to implement on an economy wide basis a plan similar to the obu guild for construction ultimately the gnctu would control through its constituent members all industry thereby taking over the functions of capitalists parliament and local government it would become the locus of economic and ultimately political power the gnctu s formation was followed by feverish organization by discounting cooperative retail and producer societies unions alone attracted over one million members as with the obu owners reacted to the gnctu by presenting the document to workers with the threat of a lockout if not signed this response originated in derby it was imitated in other towns but derby remained the test struggle the workers lost being forced back to work after a lockout lasting four months given the repeal of the combination acts the case was pursued under the 1797 naval mutinies act which was never intended to apply to trade unions nonetheless this opportunity for the government to deter union organization arose because many unions adopted secret initiation ceremonies under the threat of employer retaliation as a result the gnctu encountered severe administrative problems the recruits it made and the disputes it faced were so abundant that urgent problems of management were inevitably ignored internal dissention developed and owen became disillusioned he hoped to initiate bloodless revolution by providing examples of the benefits derived from cooperation accordingly he dissolved the gnctu in august 1834 arguing for a return to education and the need for an ethical appeal in preference to coercion the gnctu faded away but some of its constituent groups and elements of its cooperative ideology remained owen returned to establishing villages of cooperation e g queenswood in 1839 and in 1844 the rochdale pioneers cooperative society developed from a local owenite body however after 1834 the thrust of working class agitation moved from industrial to political arenas focusing on the demands of the chartists the grand national consolidated trades union was undoubtedly a failure in its implementation yet it was attempting an impossible task that no leadership could have achieved this is because trade unions were still learning the art of organizing into a cohesive effective unit at the time workers were only able to accomplish sporadic results from organizing into unions and cooperatives however they were unable to achieve any sustained action by contrast having just won a significant political victory in the 1832 reform act factory owners and burgeoning industrialists were determined in their resolve to counter any form of organized labor movement or cooperative based industry they also possessed the support of a whig government determined to show that the reform act would not destroy property rights against such power workers were poorly paid uneducated and only beginning to understand the importance to organized efforts to seek improved working conditions and living wage salaries although owen s innovations beyond the sphere of new lanark failed during his lifetime he left an enduring legacy to the future of radical theory the influence of owen s would be 1 he established a personal example of one who cast aside his personal wealth in an endeavor to secure a more just future for others 2 the economic measures at new lanark illustrated that a policy of high wages and improved conditions need not destroy profitability 3 many of owen s theoretical innovations e g labor value to replace money as an equitable labor exchange are not inherently impractical 4 his theories of and attempts to establish workers cooperatives made owen the instigator of a significant movement of later times as developments from the rochdale pioneers of 1844 demonstrate and 5 owen s appreciation of the role of trade unions in replacing individual worker motivations by collective policy provided a clue to improving quantitative and qualitative living standards and also pointed to a force that could potentially be harnessed for achieving a future transformation of just and productive economic relations owen s approach to resolving economic injustice epitomized the utopian approach to resolving exploitation he hoped for individual conversion then government action yet this was an unrealistic ambition given the existing power structure at the time what owen lacked was a theory of class struggle believing instead that the transition to socialism or a more democratic economy would occur through the influence of reason and persuasion nevertheless the idea of reconciling capital and labor and owen s worker co operatives represents what is arguably the initial stages of democratic socialism in the tradition of michael harrington s democratic socialists of america and the radical legacy of bernie sanders cornel west and alexandria ocasio cortez author s note marx in capital discusses the expropriation of agricultural land from the poor who are dependent on that very land for their basic needs the historical context of the enclosure movement was based on a policy measure initiated by the aristocracy and wealthy land owners in eighteenth and nineteenth century england the movement was aimed at confiscating land that was owned in common by a village or at least available to the village for grazing animals and growing food the enclosure movement was designed to expropriate village land and redistribute it to the aristocracy and wealthy for their ownership in 1845 british parliament passed the enclosure act of 1845 in which the british government started enclosing land walls fences or hedges and awarding this land to the aristocracy and wealthy land owners who arguably knew how to make more efficient use of it the consequence for the people who were using this land was often eviction sending many of them to slums in the cities in hopes of finding work in low paying jobs such as factory work spawned by the industrial revolution the most well known enclosure movements were in the british isles but the practice had its roots in the netherlands and caught on to some degree throughout northern europe and elsewhere as industrialization spread

dr kaiser bengali white star karachi pakistan is facing a major economic crisis for which we need to take urgent steps but first we need to take our economic sovereignty back said economist dr kaiser bengali while proposing to ban all non essential consumer imports in order to promote local industry he was speaking at an interactive session on contemporary economic and security issues in pakistan at the library of the pakistan institute of inter national affairs on thursday pakistan has a lot of internal pressures that are resisting adopting the demands that fatf is making over the past 40 years we have created vested interests in this country that think that they are above the law this is across the board today s news is very interesting malik riaz s assets of 190 million pounds have been seized before that the supreme court of pakistan had said that he would be paying rs460 billion to the state whether he would have paid this or not is another matter what s significant is that his assets were seized by the uk s national crime agency and here we have to ask why is it that pakistani criminals are always convicted abroad why aren t they ever convicted here many decades ago there was this pakistani actor who spent five years in a london jail for drugs smuggling we never caught him here similarly there were some two or three pakistani cricketers who also did time in uk jails for spot fixing we didn t catch them in 2005 s earthquake there was this building which collapsed in islamabad and its owner is comfortably sitting abroad not convicted the owners of the baldia factory in which 289 workers burnt to death are also sitting in dubai we have created a criminalised state we don t catch our criminals said dr bengali we have also seen how the stock market here was manipulated and the corrupt people who earn from insider trading are the ones who also have access to the corridors of power had they been abroad they would have been in jail but here they dine with vips he pointed out in 2004 the fatf and international monetary fund were linked that was like giving teeth to bite to fatf in 1993 there was a caretaker government where moin qureshi was brought in from washington dc and made the prime minister of pakistan with him came his staff including shahid javed burki and dr mohammad yaqoob who became the governor of the state bank of pakistan he was the first person brought here from the imf to be given the position of sbp s governor i think it was testing of the waters with the objective being taking advantage of pakistan s weak economy he said then in 1998 pakistan went nuclear in 1999 the military coup takes place musharraf comes to power shaukat aziz comes in to become finance minister and then the prime minister he brought with him a team of contractors such as ishrat hussain from the world bank who became governor of sbp hafeez shaikh first became finance minister of sindh and then privatisation minister more such folks took over key positions which controlled the economy sbp s policy played a major role in shaukat aziz s policy he said they totally opened the pakistani economy consumer financing was introduced at low interest rates people who couldn t afford cars started buying cars which were all imported since those assembled here also had their parts imported from abroad similarly the demand for electronics also went up everyone was buying televisions air conditioners etc imports increased to the point that you can t even find local items in your supermarkets china came to invest in manufacturing he said the other thing that shaukat aziz and company did was to start privatising very large entities and all these entities most of which belonged to the service sector were sold to foreigners here banks and telecommunication were all privatised and restaurants chocolate shops boutiques were all opened by foreigners in big malls all these foreign companies earn revenue in rupees and convert it to dollars to send them home there is no inflow of foreign exchange he explained now this created a huge balance of payments vulnerability trade deficit increased in 2003 for every 100 of export our imports were about 125 so the deficit was 25 per cent today for every 100 dollars of export our imports are 225 the 25pc deficit has now turned to 125pc deficit last year our exports were of 24 billion dollars and our imports were of 60bn dollars this large gap cannot be filled by remittances and we are certainly in crisis we had to go somewhere or to someone to give us large sums of money i can say with conviction now that it was the objective of shaukat aziz to actually create this vulnerability as he came here with an agenda he said they want to bring pakistan to a point where we would be so caught up economically that we will have no choice but to accept what they say he pointed out and added that they could even ask us to give up our key national interests pakistan needs to take its economic sovereignty back he said ban all non essential consumer imports in order to promote industry reduce gst from 17pc to five per cent to improve the industry he added saying that both these efforts will reduce revenues on the other hand he also suggested cutting down on non development expenditures and non combat expenditures if we look at education we are sending millions of pounds to universities in the uk as we recognise their examination boards rather than our matric board he regretted earlier dr nausheen wasi assistant professor department of international relations univer sity of karachi gave a presentation about fatf in collaboration with international stakeholders the fatf works to identify national level vulnerabilities based on its assessment methodologies she said published in dawn december 7th 2019

since winning sri lanka s november 16 presidential election gotabhaya rajapakse has moved with great haste to concentrate governmental power in his hands he bullied the right wing united national party unp prime minister to resign then appointed his brother the former president mahinda rajapakse as the head of a minority sri lanka podujana peramuna slpp government he has kept the armed forces on alert and earlier this week prorogued parliament for a month unless he can cobble together a majority through horse trading and outright bribery rajapakse intends to keep parliament shut down at least most of the time until he gains the constitutional power to dissolve it and call a snap election for march his aim as he has frankly stated is to secure the two thirds parliamentary majority necessary to repeal a key constitutional amendment and give the president sweeping authoritarian powers these anti democratic moves are aimed not just at rajapakse s rivals within sri lanka s bitterly divided crisis ridden elite their principal target is the working class rajapakse is keenly aware that the sri lankan bourgeoisie sits atop a social powder keg one moreover that has begun to explode the past 18 months have witnessed the most important strike wave since 1980 when the j r jayewardene led unp government smashed the general strike that had erupted against its turn to free market pro investor policies during the election campaign the trade unions succeeded in shutting down the strikes but before gotabhaya rajapakse s presidency was even 10 days old strikes involving thousands of plantation workers erupted against poverty wages and increased workloads these initial struggles point to the seething anger that has developed over many years within the working class over rising prices mass unemployment and underemployment privatisation and dilapidated public services rajapakase s demagogic electoral promises of increased social spending notwithstanding he and his slpp government will be driven by falling economic growth and exports and mounting corporate and government debt to dramatically intensify the assault on the working class and rural toilers working people are already rebelling against international monetary fund dictated austerity yet colombo has pledged to the imf that it will halve this year s fiscal deficit of 7 percent of gdp to 3 5 percent by 2020 the growing resistance of the working class is the most important element in a broader crisis of bourgeois rule that has led all factions of the bourgeoisie not least the previous sirisena wickremesinghe national unity government to increasingly attack democratic rights the colombo political establishment is also torn by rapidly sharpening geo political tensions because sri lanka abuts the most important indian ocean shipping lanes us imperialism is determined to transform it into a frontline state in its military strategic offensive against china an offensive whose logic leads to nuclear war toward that end washington has repeatedly intervened in the faction fighting within sri lanka s ruling elite most notably helping orchestrate mahinda rajapakse s ouster in the january 2015 presidential election us secretary of state mike pompeo has already served gotabhaya rajapakse notice that washington expects sri lanka to join it in fostering a free and open indo pacific region a euphemism for us imperialist domination of the region this no doubt includes the timely signing and activation of the pending us sri lanka status of forces agreement sofa which reportedly opens the door to the establishment of us military bases and will provide all us personnel on the island with legal immunity moreover none of the issues that gave rise to the 30 year anti tamil civil war have been resolved serving as defence secretary under his brother president gotabhaya rajapakse presided over the massacre of tens of thousands of tamil civilians with which the civil war ended in april may 2009 during the presidential election campaign he shamelessly promoted buddhist supremacism while touting himself as the foremost defender of the army heroes implicated in war atrocities in his maiden presidential address rajapakse offered the tamil and muslim minorities a veiled fist he claimed he is for reconciliation while pointedly noting that he hadn t needed minority votes to win the election meanwhile the tamil national alliance tna and the other tamil bourgeois parties that emerged from the ashes of the separatist liberation tigers of tamil eelam ltte have sought to corral the tamil masses behind rajapakse s rivals within the dominant sinhalese establishment they have emerged as among the most vociferous advocates of close ties with us imperialism in the hope that washington will back their calls for greater power sharing i e enhanced access to power and privilege the corporate media are claiming that gotabhaya rajapakse s 6 9 million votes 52 percent constitute a massive mandate this is a lie a lie that is being propagated to intimidate the working class and oppressed masses and legitimise the government s resort to state repression when it confronts popular opposition the vote for gotabhaya rajapakse was largely a protest vote on the part of workers and poor people especially in the rural south against the right wing administration of president maithripala sirisena and prime minister ranil wickremesinghe its rule was widely despised for its imposition of imf austerity and attacks on democratic rights that said the election results starkly lay bare an acute crisis of working class leadership and perspective amid mounting and increasingly explosive social struggles struggles that have united sinhalese tamil and muslim workers and youth and provide an inkling of the social power of the working class most working people electorally rallied behind one or the other of the two main reactionary camps of the political establishment the unp is a party steeped in communalism it launched the anti tamil civil war and as sri lanka s governing party waged it for more than a decade yet most minority voters cast their votes for the unp s sajith premadasa himself the son of a notorious former sinhala chauvinist sri lankan president on the grounds that he was the lesser evil the working class and oppressed masses will soon come into headlong conflict with the rajapakse led slpp government if they are to prevail they must break free from the rightward lurching communally laced capitalist political framework and the politics of protest votes and lesser evils none of the burning problems facing working people can be seriously addressed let alone resolved within the framework of capitalism an outmoded socio economic order that subordinates all social needs to the enrichment of a tiny capitalist oligarchy and threatens humanity with world war as the rival imperialist and great powers jostle for markets resources and strategic advantage the sri lankan bourgeoisie is mired in crisis and clearly has been shaken by the growth of social opposition but it retains control of the economy and a large repressive state apparatus and can rely on the support of new delhi and washington in defending its rule unless and until the working class constitutes itself as an independent political force and rallies the toilers and rural poor behind it in the fight for workers power the venal sri lankan bourgeoisie will be able to press ahead with its class war offensive this will involve political manoeuvres state repression the incitement of communalism and no less crucially its use of the pro capitalist trade unions and various left parties from the sinhala chauvinist janatha vimukthi peramuna jvp to the nava sama samaja party nssp and frontline socialist party fsp to defuse social opposition and divert it back into the sterile framework of capitalist electoral and protest politics the socialist equality party intervened in the presidential election standing pani wijesiriwardena as its candidate precisely to provide the incipient mass movement of the working class with the socialist internationalist program and revolutionary political leadership it requires to become transformed into a political offensive for a workers and peasants government and the socialist transformation of society from mahinda to gotabhaya rajapakse the lessons of the rise and fall of the sirisena wickremesinghe government a crucial part of the political preparation by the working class for the coming clash with the gotabhaya rajapakse government is to critically examine the experience of the past five years what forces brought the sirisena wickremesinghe national unity government to power its record in office and why rajapakse and his slpp were able to politically exploit the mass anger at its austerity measures as well its harnessing of sri lanka to us imperialism s anti china war drive just weeks before the january 2015 presidential election washington working in league with its close ally india and former sri lankan freedom party slfp president chandrika bandaranaike coaxed sirisena a longtime henchman of mahinda rajapakse into defecting from the government and standing as the common opposition candidate against his longtime boss the us was determined to be rid of rajapakse because he was deemed too close to china and thus an obstacle to washington s plans to use sri lanka as an aircraft carrier in the indian ocean unp leader and presumptive presidential candidate ranil wickremesinghe was eager to do washington s bidding but he was deemed unelectable because of his close ties to big business and his right wing record this led to the approach to sirisena and the setting in motion of events that would ultimately blow up the slfp which since the 1950s had been one of the two main parties of bourgeois rule in sri lanka the hastily organised us orchestrated regime change operation succeeded for two reasons first mahinda rajapakse s government was widely discredited his promise of a peace dividend at the conclusion of the civil war had proven a cruel hoax working people had instead faced fresh attacks on living standards and democratic rights while the government maintained massive military expenditures second the tna numerous ngos many unions and the pseudo left political parties all rushed to garland sirisena for years a hand raiser for rajapakse and his new ally the us client wickremesinghe as the leaders of a democratic upsurge and even as in the case of nssp leader wickremabahu karunaratne a democratic revolution some pseudo left groups like the nssp openly supported sirisena s election others like the united socialist party usp and the frontline socialists gave implicit support by emphasising the need to defeat rajapakse s dictatorial rule and subsequently hailed the opening of democratic space as the socialist equality party sep had warned the sirisena wickremesinghe national unity government s promises of democracy reconciliation with the tamils and good governance proved no less fraudulent than rajapakse s peace dividend it radically realigned the island s foreign policy in favor of washington and new delhi and closely tied the sri lankan military particularly the navy to the us indo pacific command the pentagon s frontline force against china in return for an imf bailout loan it implemented savage austerity measures hiking taxes on essentials and further slashing welfare programs health and education it maintained the army s occupation of the predominantly tamil north and east and with the help of the us and its allies suppressed war crimes investigations that washington had previously used as a mechanism to pressure the rajapkase government to diminish its ties with beijing growing popular opposition to the government found distorted expression in the gains the rajapakses newly created political vehicle the slpp made in the february 2018 local council elections soon after a strike wave began that has continued and grown in the current year to involve ever wider sections of the working class over the past 18 months strikes have been mounted by railway workers health workers teachers non academic university workers electricity petroleum postal and plantation workers and by workers at some free trade zone enterprises subservient to the capitalist state and the profit system and often led by supporters of the government the unions have invariably sought to smother the strike struggles isolating them and then shutting them down the tamil nationalists the jvp and the pseudo left organisations all worked to keep the working class under the political thrall of the bourgeoisie opposing any working class political challenge to the sirisena wickremesinghe government and thereby enabling the rajapakses and their slpp to cynically project themselves as the only opposition the frontline socialist party the united socialist party and the nssp responded to sirisena s anti constitutional october 2018 political coup in which he removed wickremesinghe as prime minister and replaced him with mahinda rajapakse by rallying around the unp s bogus campaign for democracy only the sep fought for the working class to intervene independently in the political crisis in opposition to the two rival bourgeois factions warning that both were turning toward dictatorial measures and exposing washington s blatant intervention in support of wickremesinghe see fight for a socialist solution to the political crisis in sri lanka six months later all the ostensible opposition parties fell into line when the government and intelligence agencies despite being forewarned allowed an isis backed group to stage bombing attacks on easter sunday 2019 killing hundreds of people sirisena exploited the attack to impose draconian emergency regulations deploy the military throughout the country and unleash a vicious anti muslim campaign the opposition and this includes the jvp the tna and the pseudo left fsp usp and nssp all supported the emergency regulations declared the fight against extremism a national priority and supported the unions immediate shutdown of all strikes in so doing they helped provide a platform for gotabhaya rajapakse to use the easter bombings to step up his militarist and communalist rhetoric and denounce the government for weakening the military intelligence apparatus as they had done in 2015 so during the 2019 presidential campaign the tamil nationalist and ostensibly left parties sought to corral working people behind the unp some did so explicitly others like the fsp and usp did so implicitly by railing against rajapakse fascism while remaining silent on the unp s communalism long record of attacks on democratic rights and role as satrap for us imperialism by politically suppressing the working class and tying it to the right wing unp the tamil nationalist and ostensibly left parties opened the door for rajapakse to make a demagogic appeal to mass anger over imf austerity through his sinhala chauvinist and buddhist allies he even tried to exploit popular opposition over washington s demands that sri lanka serve as a pawn in its intrigues against china and while doing so he simultaneously appealed for support from the bourgeoisie and the military apparatus by casting himself as strongman who has shown he can and will take ruthless measures against the working class laying bare his intentions gotabhaya rajapakse declared this week that he is determined to amend the constitution forthwith to give the president authoritarian powers so as to provide the stability demanded by foreign capital without stability investors won t come he declared the way forward for the working class whatever illusions exist among working people in the rajapakse slpp government will be quickly dispelled the critical question however is what strategy and program will guide the coming mass struggles in order to assert its class interests the working class must adopt a socialist internationalist strategy and build new organisations of struggle that incarnate it the growing strike wave in sri lanka is part of a global working class upsurge that has seen mass strikes in india and the united states the yellow vest movement against social inequality in france and mass anti government protests around the world from chile and ecuador to algeria and lebanon in capitalism the working class faces a global enemy transnational corporations scour the globe seeking the highest investor returns while the major capitalist powers mount trade wars and regime change wars and frantically rearm just as they did in the 1930s to defeat globally organised capital the working class must adopt a global strategy to unite and coordinate its struggles across national boundaries and continents in response to an insurgent working class the bourgeoisie in every country is turning toward authoritarian methods of rule and cultivating ultra right nationalist and communalist forces this is as true of the us where a fascistic billionaire sits in the white house germany where the neo fascist alternative for germany is the official opposition india where the bourgeoisie has embraced narendra modi and his hindu supremacist bharatiya janatha party and sri lanka the defence of democratic rights requires the independent political mobilisation of the working class and a ruthless struggle against all those who in the name of defending democracy tie the working class to one or another faction of the bourgeoisie such as the unp central to the sep s intervention in the presidential elections was the fight to make the objective unity of sinhalese tamil and muslim workers expressed in the current strike wave a conscious political strategy workers must reject the poison of communalism and nationalism for decades sinhala populism has been the chief ideological weapon of the ruling class used to bind working people to their class enemies and split the working class the tamil nationalist perspective of the tamil bourgeoisie led the oppressed tamil masses into a blind alley hostile to the working class the ltte based its strategy on seeking the support of india and subsequently us imperialism in this the tna only follows in its footsteps the democratic rights of the tamil and muslim mases will be secured only through the overthrow of bourgeois rule and the establishment of the socialist republic of sri lanka and eelam as part of a union of socialist republics of south asia and the world struggle for socialism the sep bases its struggle on the strategy of permanent revolution which animated the victorious 1917 russian revolution and elaborates a global revolutionary strategy for the working class a key tenet of permanent revolution is that the basic democratic tasks in countries of belated capitalist development can be realised only through a working class led socialist revolution an independent political movement of the working class will provide a program to free the rural toilers from the domination of big business and thereby undercut the phony appeals of the sinhala populists and tamil nationalists the struggle against war is the cutting edge of the struggle for socialism workers and youth in sri lanka must vigorously oppose the us drive to harness the island to its war plans a working class led movement against war must be built across south asia as part of a global anti war movement workers and youth should follow the lead of the abbotsleigh plantation workers and build workplace and neighbourhood action committees independent of the unions to mobilise opposition to the attacks of big business and the state and unite the manifold struggles of working people into a working class political offensive above all the working class needs a revolutionary

cambridge with interest rates on government debt at multi decade lows a number of leading economists have argued that almost every advanced economy can allow debt to drift up toward japanese levels over 150 per cent of gdp even by the most conservative measure without any great concern about long term consequences advocates of much higher debt might be right but they tend to downplay or ignore everything that can go wrong first and foremost the new view of debt understates the risks to other claimants on public tax revenues such as pensioners who might be thought of as junior debt holders in the twenty first century welfare state after all most social security systems are debt like in the sense that the government takes money from you now and promises to pay it back with interest when you are old and for governments this junior debt is massive relative to the senior market debt that sits atop it indeed governments in oecd countries are currently paying out an average of 8 per cent of gdp in old age pensions and a staggering 16 per cent in the case of italy and greece actuarially future taxes earmarked for paying pensions swamp future taxes earmarked for paying debt by a significant multiple although many governments have been trying to adjust pensions downward gradually as europe did during the financial crisis and mexico and brazil have done under duress more recently unfortunately slow growth and aging populations mean much remains to be done thus even if it seems that governments can take on much more debt without having to pay significantly higher market interest the real risks and costs may be hidden economists alan auerbach and laurence kotlikoff made a similar point in an influential series of papers back in the 1990s second and perhaps even more critically the current complacency regarding much higher debt implicitly assumes that the next crisis will look just like the last one in 2008 when interest rates on government debt collapsed but history suggests that this is a dangerous assumption for example the next wave of crises could easily stem from a sudden realisation that climate change is accelerating much faster than previously thought requiring governments simultaneously to stall the capitalist engine and spend vast sums on preventive measures and remediation not to mention dealing with climate refugees and the next global conflagration could be a cyber war with unknown ramifications for growth and interest rates moreover aggressive experimentation with much higher debt might cause a corresponding shift in market sentiment an example of the nobel laureate economist robert lucas critique that big shifts in policy can backfire owing to big shifts in expectations and frankly any realistic assessment of current global economic risks must acknowledge that the world s most important economy is in state of political paralysis with impulsive decision making leaving it ill equipped to deal with an outside the box crisis should one arise the bottom line is that there is no guarantee that interest rates will fall in the next global crisis none of the preceding arguments undermine the strong case for investing now in high return infrastructure projects including in education that more than pay for themselves in the long run as long as governments adhere to sound debt management criteria balancing risk and cost when choosing maturities today s ultra low interest rates offer great opportunities but the broader claim that issuing government debt has become a veritable free lunch similar to government profits from currency issuance has been dangerously overblown if the aim of government policy is to reduce inequality the only sustainable long term solution involves raising taxes on high earners debt is not a magic shortcut for giving to the poor without taking from the rich true in many advanced economies current real inflation adjusted interest rates on government debt are below the real rate of economic growth presumably therefore governments can take on much more debt without ever having to raise taxes after all as long as income is growing faster than the stock of public debt simple arithmetic shows that the ratio of debt to gdp income will fall over time yet things are not quite so simple interest rates are ultra low in part because global investors are starved of safe assets that will still pay out in the event of a sharp downturn or economic catastrophe but can governments in fact provide that insurance for free if there is a risk that interest rates will rise in the next major systemic crisis a recent international monetary fund study of 55 countries over the last 200 years showed that although economic growth exceeded interest rates on government debt almost half the time this was not a good predictor of whether the surveyed countries were safe from interest rate spikes in a crisis last but not least how sure can investors be that they will come first in line in the next crisis as they did in 2008 will the united states government again put wall street before main street and honour debts to china ahead of obligations to pensioners modern economies have many important uses for debt but it is never a risk free option for governments which is why it should be taken on and managed wisely even when rock bottom borrowing costs prevail kenneth rogoff

by lucia mutikani washington reuters u s job growth increased by the most in 10 months in november as former striking workers returned to general motors gm n payrolls and the healthcare industry boosted hiring the strongest sign yet the economy was not in danger of stalling the labor department s closely watched monthly employment report on friday also showed steady wage gains and the unemployment rate falling back to 3 5 suggesting consumers will continue to drive the longest economic expansion in history now in its 11th year the report added to other fairly upbeat reports on the trade deficit housing and orders for big ticket goods together the improving data validate the federal reserve s decision in october to cut interest rates for the third time this year but signal a pause in the easing cycle that started in july when it reduced borrowing costs for the first time since 2008 full story u s central bank policymakers are expected to highlight the economy s resilience when they meet on dec 10 11 though trade tensions continue to reverberate in the background this was a strong report with a solid rise in payrolls another drop in the unemployment rate and decent growth in hourly earnings said chris low chief economist at fhn financial in new york the fed will see this as clear vindication of their decision to stop cutting rates nonfarm payrolls increased by 266 000 jobs last month with manufacturing recouping all the 43 000 positions lost in october the government s survey of establishments showed employment growth was also boosted by a gain of 60 200 healthcare workers the most since march the largest increase in payrolls since january lifted job growth well above its monthly average of 180 000 this year economists polled by reuters had forecast payrolls rising by 180 000 jobs in november the economy created 41 000 more jobs in september and october than previously estimated the 40 day strike by about 46 000 workers at gm plants in michigan and kentucky had restricted employment gains to 156 000 jobs in october even discounting the gm related boost employment growth exceeded 200 000 jobs last month the strong payroll gains suggest the trump administration s 17 month trade war with china which has plunged manufacturing into recession has not yet spilled over to the broader economy the u s china trade tensions have bruised business confidence and undercut capital expenditure though washington and beijing are working on a phase one trade deal the united states has ratcheted up tensions with other trade partners including brazil argentina and france president donald trump said on thursday the united states was having meetings and discussions with china that are going well full story economic growth estimates for the fourth quarter are converging around a 1 8 annualized rate the economy grew at a 2 1 pace in the third quarter economists estimate the speed at which the economy can grow over a long period without igniting inflation at between 1 7 and 2 0 u s stocks were trading higher while the dollar dxy gained against a basket of currencies prices of u s treasuries were lower steady wage gains the surge in november payrolls defied an institute for supply management survey showing a measure of manufacturing employment contracted in november for the fourth straight month it also confounded the adp national employment report showing a sharp deceleration in private payrolls growth last month and consumers perceptions of the labor market were less upbeat but cooler than normal temperatures in november curbed hiring at construction sites and mines though the labor market remains resilient despite the business investment downturn hiring has slowed from last year s average monthly gain of 223 000 because of ebbing demand and a shortage of workers the government has said it could cut job growth for the 12 months through march 2019 by at least 500 000 jobs when it publishes its annual revision next february still job creation is well over the roughly 100 000 jobs per month needed to keep up with growth in the working age population the unemployment rate fell one tenth of a percentage point last month from 3 6 percent in october as people left the labor force the smaller household survey from which the unemployment rate is derived also showed a modest job gain last month a broader measure of unemployment which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part time because they cannot find full time employment fell to 6 9 last month from 7 0 in october the labor force participation rate or the proportion of working age americans who have a job or are looking for one dipped to 63 2 in november from more than a six year high of 63 3 in october the tight labor market is generating steady wage gains average hourly earnings rose seven cents or 0 2 after increasing 0 4 in october in the 12 months through november wages rose 3 1 after advancing 3 2 in october wage gains were moderate because the bulk of the jobs created last month were in healthcare and leisure industries that tend to pay low wages average hourly earnings for production and non supervisory workers increased 0 3 and were up 3 7 on a year on year basis in november conditions remain firmly in place for the consumer and the service sector to cushion the economy from external risks and related weakness in u s manufacturing said brian coulton chief economist at fitch ratings in new york manufacturing employment rebounded by 54 000 jobs last month as gm strike returnees boosted payrolls in the auto sector snow storms in the midwest and cold weather restricted construction hiring to only 1 000 jobs last month mining shed 7 000 jobs the leisure and hospitality industry hired 45 000 workers it has added 219 000 jobs over the last four months with about two thirds of the gains at restaurants and bars there were increases in professional and business services financial

investing com here are three things that flew under the radar this week 1 views of the economy swing with partisanship while overshadowed by the strong u s jobs report friday the university of michigan s posted its highest level since may the preliminary measure of sentiment for december came in at 99 2 up from 97 and topping expectations for a dip to 96 8 one thing definitely not worrying consumers is all the headlines about the impeachment hearings with virtually no consumer spontaneously mentioning impeachment in response to any question in early december richard curtin surveys of consumers chief economist said but politics does come into play in the survey so much so that party affiliated respondents act as outliers the average gap between democrats and republicans was 18 7 points in the obama administration and 41 6 points since trump took office curtin said while the implications of the economic expectations of democrats and republicans are clearly exaggerated the independents who represent the largest group and are less susceptible to maintaining partisan views hold very favorable expectations indicating the continuation of the expansion based on consumer spending he added weak wages stymie experts the labor department s employment report was applauded enthusiastically by investors who took the opportunity to add risk but while the monster rise of 266 000 in was pretty straightforward one part of the report left economists with something of a mystery why is wage growth so muted given the strong job market and overall economy rose 0 2 in november according to the report down from a 0 4 rise in october the rise was lower than the 0 3 economists predicted according to forecasts compiled by investing com wage inflation ticked up to 3 1 wage growth continues to remain puzzlingly weak justin wolfers economics professor at the university of michigan tweeted over the past year hourly earnings are up only 3 1 that s the sort of number that s unlikely to worry the fed much even as it continues to be puzzled by such low wage and price growth at such a low inflation rate from the federal reserve s point of view and for many in the market the absence of wage pressures is a boon and keeps the fomc from hiking rates to combat inflation which could stall growth and hit asset prices but at the same time workers aren t enjoying a commensurate rise in pay as the economy keeps chugging along this is where the labor market diverges from 1990s boom and helps explain why confidence in economy is high but not as good as was during peak of 1990s boom grant thornton chief economist diane swonk tweeted both consumer sentiment and consumer confidence measures are strong but well off the euphoric highs of the late 1990s swonk added the good news is that what the expansion has lacked in momentum it has made up for in stamina she added we need that to fully regain the mojo lost in the 2000s 3 gold to lose some luster before resuming climb has made the list of fashionable investments over the past year outperforming the broader u s market at a time when stocks have recently notched record highs but the yellow metal s next move is likely to be to the downside before resuming a climb higher abn amro said in a note earlier this week fixed on a diet of global central bank easing and low interest rates the price of gold has jumped about 16 over the last 12 months beating returns of about 15 admittedly the s p 500 was in the midst of its big fourth quarter 2018 swoon and wouldn t bottom until dec 26 2018 with expectations running high that global banks will continue to ease denting the value of their respective currencies demand for gold will remain intact and push gold prices even higher but not before correcting even though the longer term outlook looks solid we expect substantial price weakness in the coming weeks and months said georgette boele senior fx and precious metals strategist at abn amro the abn amro strategist highlighted the metal s 200 day moving average 1 400 an ounce as key level of support to watch much of the rise in gold prices has been supported by central banks ramping up purchases of the yellow metal as they seek to hedge their euro and dollar holdings in 2018 central banks bought the most gold in 49 years and in the first half of this year their gold purchases have topped that of last year the need to hedge against currency debasement amid falling interest rates will likely continue to drive central bank demand cpm group projects central banks will buy 20 million ounces on a net basis this year and anticipates a comparable increase in 2020 the decline in global government bond yields which lowers the opportunity cost of owning gold will also support gold prices abn amro s boele suggested the outstanding amount of negative yielding government bonds will probably grow while gold has no yield it is at least not paying negative rates

stocks have been buoyed in recent weeks by the prospect of a light at the end of the trade war tunnel with investors anticipating an imminent phase one deal with china that upward trajectory abruptly reversed on tuesday after president donald trump said there might be no resolution until after the 2020 election in some ways i like the idea of waiting until after the election for the china deal trump told reporters from the nato summit that begins today in london adding i have no deadline the benchmark dow jones index fell 400 points shortly after opening its biggest drop in two months in response to the news economists top concern is a tranche of tariffs on 156 billion in chinese imports primarily consumer goods that is set to take effect on dec 15 a trade deal was widely expected to suspend the implementation of those tariffs now all bets are off i think it has to go into effect otherwise trump loses his credibility said mitchell goldberg president of clientfirst strategy i think investors are factoring in that it s going to go into effect he said predicting that the market could fall by up to 10 percent goldberg remained optimistic though that a broader market rout was unlikely this is not going to be in my opinion a repeat of year end 2018 he said pointing out that concerns about inflation and higher interest rates that triggered a december selloff turned out to be unfounded i still think the market has a lot of wind at its back he said listing corporate buybacks low interest rates and solid consumer spending some experts are less sanguine saying investors have been viewing the trade war through rose colored glasses markets have been far too complacent in the whole treatment of this trade war said jacob kirkegaard senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics i think they re also greatly underestimating the longer run effects of this trade war he said slapping a new round of tariffs on everything from coats to computers would send shock waves through the consumer economy and threaten to derail consumer spending kirkegaard said i certainly don t think markets are pricing that in i think the reaction to that will be significantly more negative than what we ve seen in markets to date nothing good will come out of it said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics referring to the trump s statements on tuesday zandi said if what he means is if he allows the tariff increases he s threatening on dec 15 to go into effect then i think we get a recession next year on those grounds some economists argue that the tariffs almost certainly will be suspended or delayed the economic fallout would be too great to risk i suspect even the china hawks in the white house don t really want to impose the december tariffs they were supposed to be a threat to win concessions from china actually implementing them would just put up prices for american families said mark williams chief asia economist at capital economics in addition to pinching household budgets and reducing consumer spending power more tariffs could hurt american job growth as well zandi estimated that the trade war thus far has probably cost the labor market around 40 000 jobs each month it s obvious in manufacturing he said adding that more tariffs could accelerate job losses on monday the president blamed the federal reserve for the contraction in manufacturing writing in a pair of tweets manufacturers are being held back by the strong dollar which is being propped up by the ridiculous policies of the federal reserve the fed should lower rates there is almost no inflation and loosen making us competitive with other nations and manufacturing will soar but economists say trade policy not monetary policy is the hurdle facing american manufacturing which dropped for the fourth month in a row according to figures released monday from the institute for supply management global trade remains the most significant cross industry issue timothy fiore chair of the ism s manufacturing business survey committee said in a statement and unlike last year there are fewer mitigating actions the federal reserve could take if the market plummets this time i think it s very unlikely that the fed is going to somehow surprise the markets by easing more kirkegaard said the fed has pretty clearly signaled that they re on hold now that means there is no parachute if there is a significant contraction

consol energy nyse ceix is a pure play coal mining company its mining assets consist of three operating mines in pennsylvania pennsylvania mining complex pamc with combined proven and probable reserves of close to 700ml tons of thermal coal that given its characteristics 12 970 btu lb and 2 4 sulfur content is sold at prices of 45 to 60 per ton depending on the year with a premium to average thermal coal besides the company owns 1 281ml tons of recoverable reserves 82 of a total of 1 562ml tons in three properties in the northern and central appalachian and illinois basin regions in total the controlled owned and leased proven probable recoverable reserves are 2 260 7ml tons out of which 96 2 are thermal most of them in the northern appalachian region napp and 3 8 are crossover metallurgical quality coal estimated annual production capacity is as of today 28 5ml tons the company produced and sold 27 6ml tons in 2018 and 25 4ml tons on average in the last five years the mines rank 10th 14th and 37th in the us jointly considered the pamc ranks 3rd behind north antelope peabody and black thunder thunder basin coal consol owns directly the equivalent to 79 of the reserves and therefore pays no royalties on those the rest is leased by consol that controls 100 of all the reserves the three mines are underground and extraction is made in longwalls which provides for better extraction efficiency and lowest cost within that kind of mines they are operated as a single complex and all extracted material treated in the bailey plant here you can see where it is which is supposed to be the largest preparation plant in the us the plant is directly served by railroad and connected with a marine terminal in baltimore port 280 miles away owned and operated by consol all that sounds as an extremely efficient operational set quality is good within the thermal coal product extraction method is efficient and processed coal movement is also very efficient and with a direct link to seaborne transportation according to the company the complex of the three mines is in the first quartile of cash cost within the region northern appalachian region and in the first quartile on a global basis the fact is that at current deeply depressed coal market the company makes a 20 margin on selling price last three quarters of 2019 and an average of 25 from 2014 to 2018 seems to prove it on a cash cost only basis those same references would be 33 and 38 the company also receives income from royalties and leases on part of its properties for an amount of 35ml in 2018 a little bit of history the consolidation coal company was formed in maryland in 1860 and incorporated in delaware in 1935 in 1945 the company merged with pittsburgh coal company to form pittsburgh consolidation coal company you can find annual reports from 1940 and even a book on its history here its initial goal was to buy many small coal mining operators which was a very normal practice in the end of the 19th century hence the consolidation consol part in its name in 1966 it was bought by continental oil conoco cop which was later bought by its rival dupont dd in 1981 in 1991 a jv is formed by dupont and rwe assets with the name of consol energy dupont wanted to concentrate in agricultural biotechnology and pharmaceutical and used consol s cash to get paid leaving rwe with most of the jv the company made a public offering in 1999 to rebalance its balance sheet but the result was not encouraging with the stock market still caught up in the enthusiasm over dotcom issues in 2001 the company expanded its business into gas production in 2003 rwe sold its 74 stake in several private placements together with some paper from the company in those days it produced 60 70ml tons of coal from 20 mines and 40 46bl cubic feet of gas its revenues were in the 2bl range from 2003 to 2016 consol continued to grow its natural gas business with the formation of a separate company cnx gas and the acquisition of dominion resources appalachian basin exploration and production assets while at the same time started a restructuring of its coal activities concentrating in the best quality more efficient assets in the current chapter of this long story the company split into two publicly traded companies a natural gas company cnx resources cnx and a coal company which retained the name of consol the split from cnx and legacy financing facilities the most obvious purpose of the split was to get rid of the coal business and allow cnx resources corporation to become a pure play gas company on nov 17 cnx stockholders received a distribution of one share of common stock of the newly named consol energy for every eight shares of cnx s common stock held in addition the former parent transferred all of its ownership interest in cnx coal resources lp ccr to consol energy inc as part of the separation the resulting corporate structure as of today with minor changes since the spin off is shown in the chart ccr is a master limited partnership formed by cnx in 2015 to manage and further develop the pamc in other words to start at that time the reduction in exposure to the coal business in favor of gas on july 15 the group made an ipo for 44 6 of ccr raising approximately 158ml plus 200ml from a revolving facility at that time it was greenlight capital which took a significant stake in ccr ccr was also granted a right of first offer to acquire the rest of the pamc complex since then the initial 44 6 of ccr in hand of third parties has been slowly reducing and currently stands at 38 5 therefore consol owns all of the assets except for 9 625 of the pamc equivalent to the 38 5 of ccr times the 25 of pamc consol owns 100 of the marine terminal and of the 1 3bl tons of undeveloped reserves the company mentions 1 6bl tons but that includes the part of the reserves that is leased as dupont or rwe had made previously cnx wanted the ugly dirty stuff away but liked its cash flow so it implemented substantial upstream payments in the form of capital payback dividends and financing lines before and at the time of the split i estimate that all those measures provided cnx with 1 7bl of cash showing the cash cow characteristics of consol s business obviously the financial situation of consol just after the ipo was relatively leveraged consol had several facilities that had been signed to provide cash for cnx before or at the spin off senior secured credit facilities sscf up to 900ml those facilities consist in a revolving facility rcf of up to 400ml a term loan tla of up to 100ml and a second term loan tlb facility of up to 400ml sscfs bear interest at a floating rate and is amortized quarterly at stepped up amounts as quarters advance the revolving facility and tla due 2023 6 8 cost in 2018 include financial covenants to be measured quarterly all of them are reasonable and were met as of 3q 2019 second lien notes sln 300ml at 11 due 2025 yes you have read correctly an 11 coupon to be paid semi annually for the benefit of cnx consol shareholders were left with an utterly expensive debt and additionally which is where you start to think this was not an arm s length operation that can only be amortized with a premium of 11 if redeemed before nov 21 with a max of 35 of the principal 5 5 if redeemed after 2021 2 75 after 2022 and none after 2023 not very nice looking in my opinion the notes are trading at 85 but i do not know how liquid they are and if an investor or the company can really buy some volume at those prices which would be an excellent opportunity in my opinion i tried in interactive brokers but i couldn t maryland economic development port facilities medco 5 75 revenue bonds medco due sept 25 the outstanding amount at the time of the spin off and as of now was 102 9ml those are bonds backed by the revenues provided by the marine terminal and provide the cheapest financing from all of the legacy facilities a quick look to the coal market demand and supply i will try to not extend myself too much here because it is not that relevant to get to a correct estimate of consol s value it is widely known that the consumption for coal for electric generation purposes is decreasing significantly in most mature economies while at the same time has increased significantly in economies like china and is still increasing in economies like india according to iea in 2017 8 3bl tons of coal were produced out of which 6 3bl tons were thermal coal consumption of steam coal is estimated at 6 4bl tons in 2017 major consumer countries are the following in 2018 and according to the iea coal was the largest single source of electricity contributing over 38 to the world s electricity needs and was responsible for 40 of the additional power generation worldwide most of consol s production 60 to 80 is sold to eastern us utilities and the rest is exported so it makes more sense to concentrate in the us rather than in the global picture normally 80 of the coal that is produced in the us is bituminous and sub bituminous quality and most of it 90 95 is used in electric transformation plants demand for thermal coal reached a peak in 2007 with 1 127ml tons and since then it has been constantly decreasing to the 637ml tons of 2018 equivalent to a 5 1 decrease rate per year eia estimates that 2019 will be another year of declining demand with us generators demanding less than 564ml tons 11 decrease vs 2018 a consumption level last seen in 1982 equivalent to a coal share in electric generation of 25 the factors that explain this trend are essentially the following the fracking expansion which has turned natural gas from a premium fuel into a low cost base load generation resource combined with the continued build out of efficient natural gas combined cycle generation persistent cost declines in the renewable energy industry that put pressure on utilization rates of coal electric plants growing utilities interest in coal generation phase outs the only piece of good news for the coal industry in 2018 was the significant growth in coal exports that totaled 115 6ml tons a sharp increase from 2017 what traditionally has been a swing market for the us might become more important and stable alternative in the future coal and natural gas coal is also compared by utilities with other energy sources with the end of the previous century the perception of natural gas started to change from a premium fuel to a viable base load alternative in 2000 natural gas was 21 of global primary energy supply and the evolution of supply needed of higher prices to tap reserves of this fuel which is what happened from 2001 to 2009 high natural gas prices had two effects one was to increase its effective cost premium over coal allowing for a recovery of coal prices and second was to create the incentive for supply expansion in the us production increased significantly from 500bl cubic meters in the us in the 90s to more than 600bl in 2010 20 and globally production increased almost 60 in the same period nevertheless as of 2017 the share of natural gas as primary global energy supply has barely increased and is estimated at 22 obviously this differs between mature and growing economies in the us after that natural gas production expansion since 2010 the cost relationship of natural gas thermal units to coal went down to a normal range of 1 to 2 5x in the last years it has stood at 1 2 1 3x which is at the lower part of the range putting pressure on coal price competitive position compared to natural gas in the short term both prices are independent and are fixed mainly by supply variations but in the medium term this relatively low premium is an incentive for natural gas demand continuing to erode coal s share as primary energy supply nevertheless the current premium is not uncharted territory coal price using data from eia information on prices and production and adjusting for cpi factors i came up with real price production charts for both bituminous and sub bituminous coal markets in the us since 1969 as you can see there are similarities but also some relevant differences sub bituminous coal between lignite and bituminous coal a less efficient cheaper material saw its production multiply by 5x after the opep crisis in the 70s from 100ml tons p a to more than 500ml tons of production as production increased prices kept driving lower until a minimum of 9 7 per ton in real terms was reached in 2001 since then there was a slight recovery in price up to 15 as production kept on increasing until 2008 less demand for cheaper product and the rise of natural gas as a base load energy alternative started to drive production lower since then the reduction in sub bituminous coal production in the last 10 years has been relevant from c 540ml tons in 2008 down to 340ml tons in 2018 a 37 reduction or 4 5 annually regarding bituminous coal given its higher thermal content it can be sold at a higher price 3x higher on average than sub bituminous coal the maximum bituminous coal production level was reached in 1990 with 693ml tons at that time price was already coming down since the 70s opep crude crisis from 80 per ton to 40 per ton in real terms prices continued their fall until a minimum of 34 per ton was reached in 2000 as production kept on reducing demand and natural gas re pricing forced a significant recovery in price from 2000 to 2011 of more than 2x in real terms up to 75 per ton to fall again until 2016 down to 49 per ton together with a big cut in production down to 325ml tons in that year 53 since 1990 or 2 9 p a since 2016 there has been a slight recovery both in price up to 58 per ton 18 and production volume up to 357ml tons 10 for me it is very difficult to extract some forecasting information about future price except for the fact that prices can increase regardless of the evolution of demand if supply reduces more than demand prices for bituminous coal are today 70 above the 2000 minimum despite the fall in coal consumption simply because supply has reduced by 217ml tons since that year equivalent to a 38 contraction performance regarding the p l of the company there is not a lot of history since the split was in 2017 and the perimeter of mines before that was different but there are at least four years of homogeneous information the company essentially sells the coal it produces serving different long and medium term contracts that it signs with utilities the coal revenues cash and non cash costs and margin are summarized in the following table in the last four years within the depressing coal market that we just peeked consol has averaged 25 4ml tons of coal sales at a price of 51 3 per ton for an annual income of 1 3bl and a cash margin of 495ml or 37 7 of coal revenues as we can see in the table selling price has reduced progressively along the years except for 2018 but the company has been able to keep its margins relatively unchanged thanks to a reduction in extraction cash costs the company also operates the baltimore marine terminal and makes some margin on it despite most c 60 of its activity belongs to consol itself besides consol receives income from part of its mines in the form of royalties also from leasing some of its properties selling rights of way etc after adjusting for the part of pamc not controlled by consol 9 625 the total gross margin of the company and the ebitda corresponding to like for like activities of the company are summarized in the table the annual ebitda has moved in a wide range of 250 490ml the company has been able to recover its coal margin in 2018 and together with diminished sga expenses it obtained an ebitda in 2018 that is not far from the one in 2014 when coal cash margin was 80ml higher other significant changes are the increase in the margin from the baltimore terminal operation due to increased export activity and the reduction in income from property rentals probably due to some reorganization activity or even make up before the split regarding sga i have adjusted the reported figures which seemed quite low with expenses that were included as other costs in the p l that i think belong to sga expenses like employee benefits they call them legacy but they don t seem anymore leases and coal reserve holding costs as you can see in the table the company has made a great effort to reduce expenses in every line showing a clear efficiency effort now the missing element for valuation would be capital expenditures the company did some heavy investments in 2014 349ml partially financed with 221ml of asset sales since then investment capex which i consider to be mostly maintenance capex has ranged between 50ml and 130ml per year or 5 11 of coal revenues with an average of 8 4 that is probably representative for the coming years the free cash flow generated by the company s business along these years is summarized in the following table as we can see it has increased every year from the 128ml in 2014 a year that was penalized by heavy capex investment up to 292ml in 2018 i have used a 15 normalized tax rate for past years so we can see a picture unaffected by different tax rates on average the company has made c 200ml of free cash flow in the last four years with an average coal price of 51 per ton above the level that the company is achieving in 2019 that same figure would be c 250ml if we put 2014 capex outside of the average with that i think we have all the essential elements to get to make a guess on the probable valuation range of consol valuation the company s value is relatively unaffected by the coal depressing scenario since consol produces 7 of us supply without adjusting for exports the company produces high btu bituminous coal for a very competitive cost in the first quartile of the cost curve at the current demand reduction rate 5 it would take 60 years for the demand in the us for thermal coal to be lower than the current production of the company at double that rate it would take 28 years that is more than the 25 years of proven and probable reserves of the company coal prices the real determinant of consol s value can in fact increase from current levels despite the negative scenario for coal volumes there is no way out of the fact that with time whoever that produces a commodity at a cash cost that is higher than the market price will disappear low prices destroy producers the less efficient first and reduce supply making prices to increase whoever produces at a total cost above market price might not disappear but will certainly get in trouble unless are fully equity financed additionally given the product that the company makes it is feasible to consider that the production is suitable for the export market obviously as a worst case scenario so yes prospects for demand are depressing but what consol is worth depends now and for the foreseeable future on coal price and not coal demand we can leave price as the open variable for valuation but we need to make some assumptions which after having reviewed the company s past performance we are in a good position to make regarding production sales volumes the company provided a 26 8 27 8 guidance in the 3q 2019 presentation which seems reasonable given the volume made in 2018 27 6ml i will take the lower part of the range or 26 8ml tons as the reference just to start on the safe side i will take 2018 as representative of cash extraction cost 29 3 ton and non cash costs 6 2 ton of coal extraction despite i will do some sensitivity analysis on it afterwards i have assumed that maintenance capex will be equal to the average of 2015 18 period which is excluding 2014 that implies an 8 4 capex to revenue ratio the minimum has been 5 and the maximum without 2014 has been 11 regarding other income i will take 2018 figures for property income 9 4ml vs 33 6ml on average i will take the average income for royalties 21 5ml vs 24 7ml in 2018 and for marine terminal 23 9ml average vs 40 9ml in 2018 just to be sure that i m not assuming multiple on un sustainable figures jointly considered other income and marine terminal provide a margin of 54 8ml vs an historic average of 79ml taking into account all of the above the calculation of consol s free cash flow for different coal selling prices is summarized in the following table the normalized fcf that the company will make is c 170ml to 490ml with a coal selling price of 42 5 to 60 per ton in those fcf figures i have already eliminated the 9 625 stake of pamc that consol does not control i typically use a 10x multiple on normalized fcf if the business of the company is not great as certainly everybody would agree it is the case for coal despite consol s performance in the past i am making an extra adjustment in the debt value of 63 9ml vs book value since i consider that the sln and the tlb were given in conditions that are above what the company could be paying if i take 6 as the ideal cost of debt for the company the present value of all the extra cost for the years of remaining maturity would be 63 9ml or c 2 5 per share as it is shown in the table at 10x and discounting for financial debt employee benefits provision etc the estimated value per share is in the range of 3 to 120 per share taking into account the 2019 3q number of shares net of treasury stock at that date 25 9ml shares the current share stock price implies a coal selling price of roughly 45 per ton all else equal as per 3q 2019 guidance selling price is 1 6 above at 46 6 per ton a significant part of the producers cannot keep up their businesses running while consol s estimate value would be 25 8 per share or 2x current share price of 12 7 so yes there is a downside but we are already very close to the bottom if not past it so we are on the safe side regarding the range of possible future scenarios in 2011 not so far away us bituminous coal price hit 68 5 per ton which would yield a 640ml free cash flow and a c 179 per share value with previous assumptions and multiples it does seem very far now but it is a scenario that does not look impossible at all by the way the price of 2011 is equivalent in real terms to 75 per ton in today s money i have made the following sensitivity table of value per share depending on coal selling price and extraction cost the colored values belong to the real situations for each year in terms of selling price and extraction cost as we can see in 2014 the company sold at prices close to the top of the range but its extraction cost was also significantly higher than today in latest years a lower selling price has been compensated by lower extraction cost 2016 was the year with the lowest price 43 3 to extraction cash cost margin 28 1 of all all things being equal the company needs at least a price to complete extraction cost cash and non cash of 7 4 per ton for its equity value to be above the water or 9 2 to justify its current market cap vs the 13 2 that the company has made on average since 2014 that apparently small difference of 4 per ton in coal price makes equity implied value pass from current market cap to more than 3x higher as you can see sensitivity is very high in this price of coal range since we re very close to the extraction cost of the company or most coal mining companies in the us the difference with consol is that at this price borderline it is still competitive additional upsides capital cost management the company is actively managing its capital and funding cost and using part of its free cash flow to buy back either shares or debt after several plan amendments the company can buy back up to 200ml in debt or shares since the beginning of the program the company has bought back second lien notes the ones at 11 for an amount of 60 8ml or 20 of the initial issuance with an average premium of 10 this premium is my own estimate based on some assumptions but the company does not like to disclose it probably because it doesn t like to show it is buying at par plus applicable amortization premium vs buying at the market at 15 discount maybe i m wrong but this is what i was able to figure out common stock equivalent to 8 7 of the total shares outstanding at an average price of 24 per share that is double the current share price the company thought it was already undervalued in 2018 when it bought shares at an average price of 36 logically in 2019 with even lower prices the company has intensified its acquisitions more than doubling then at an average price of 19 ccr common units for a total amount of 3 4ml the amount is low probably because of lack of market volume since the price looks interesting as of the 5th of november 2019 the last webcast the company had invested another 14ml in undisclosed buybacks but probably in conditions similar or better than until the end of the third quarter debt buyback improves average cost of debt that i estimate that it is below 8 as of 3q 2019 vs 8 84 only nine months ago full elimination of term loan and second lien notes would have a positive effect in my opinion of 63 9ml or 2 5 per share almost 20 return with current share price in addition share buybacks increase future value of remaining shareholders in the company the effect in per share is bigger as share value estimate increases at a coal price of 60 per ton and an estimated share value of 120 the value creation capital gains for the 2 4ml shares that have been bought back would be 232ml or 9 per share less conservative assumptions as explained before i tried to be on the safe side regarding the figure to which a multiple is applied to make sure i don t escalate inflated base figures terminal margin could keep up with the figures of 2018 or rental income and royalties could increase that could easily add 20 30ml p a which is equivalent to 170 250ml in additional value or 6 9 per share growth projects the company is using some of its fcf for growth of the itmann project that started in 2019 and is projected to become operational in 1q 2020 this is supposed to add 0 6ml tons of crossover metallurgical coal to the production mix of consol for a capex that is estimated in 65ml the lower part of the initial range i have not considered the effect that this high irr project could bring to the value of consol but it will certainly be positive conclusion i came to look into consol because i follow azvalor funds and one of its big bets is consol i gave a quick look at it back in march 19 when it was trading at 35 and it looked very cheap in ev ebitda multiple so i bought just a few to secure some exposure before putting hours on its analysis as it frequently happens to me just after buying it began to fall and went 10 lower in just a few months i still did not find the time but the fall went on at the beginning of november with the share already at 13 i decided it was time to handle the problem and see which big mistake i had made and why so i started putting real hours in the company i heard all webcasts of the last two years and nothing seemed to have happened to justify the crash in valuation except for the negative mood against coal peers of the company in financial strain should not be a surprise by now if you ve read so far and depressing demand perspectives luckily for me it happened this way otherwise i would have invested much more back in march the logic of numbers and supply rationale kept on knocking my door with the conclusion that consol is a great opportunity it was at 35 and certainly is at 12 7 from a static point of view at current coal market prices the company can easily be worth 25 per share or double of what it is today in the market when i say easily is because i ve tried to be cautious on production level in other income or in debt and minorities in pamc also because this value does not consider any additional debt reduction or improvement nor any income from new growth projects so in a reasonably worst case scenario i would be expecting a 100 return at 12 7 per share you can say coal price can still decrease and demand will shrink much more than the market is expecting and you have to be very pessimistic for that but if bituminous coal price reduces more supply will cease and then price no matter how small is demand will increase because there will be no supply demand can shrink 93 before consol s output is taken into account it is the cheapest to extract high btu low sulfur bituminous coal around so it can be the last to remain solvent but that is only a reasonably worst case scenario any marginal improvement brings tremendous upside to the value of the company for every 1 increase in coal price all else being equal 182ml 7 per share is added to its estimated value a 27 increase for the first dollar or 55 if compared to current market cap that is what happens when market value is so close to zero or in other words when the market assumes that business value is so close to debt and other liabilities a more optimistic scenario but still not out of this world like price of coal returning to the 2011 price of 68 5 per ton would bring its fcf from 240ml to 640ml and its estimated equity value to 4 6bl or close to 180 per share that would imply a ev ebitda of 7x and a ev fcf of 10x which are not high multiples by the way this seems like a bit crazy right now but it is just what comes out from simple math it is an example and i don t mean it will happen but it is a plausible scenario where price goes back to what it was a few years ago how can price go up if demand goes down well because supply goes down the same way or even further as it has been happening since 1990 i do not know what coal prices will do but i do know that they cannot decrease much further for a long time since low prices will erode supply and will end up at some undefined moment with higher prices until that moment it is just patience but when it comes consol will be an extremely cheap call option on the cheapest quality bituminous coal in the us

founder chief executive officer thank you john hello everyone and welcome to our third quarter earnings call revenue grew 30 over the third quarter of last year unearned revenue for the third quarter grew 32 year over year and the number of structured facts it s an indication of engagement usage reached 259 million which grew more than 65 from the year ago quarter and during the quarter we signed the largest new enterprise client deal in the history of the company with subway to provide to power brand verified answers from more than 30 000 of its restaurants in the united states and canada and europe this is a massively important milestone and during q3 we also signed contracts with leading brands like liberty tax pilot travel centers lucky brands and the church of jesus christ of latter day saints we expanded and renewed contracts with the toronto dominion bank autozone h e b wells fargo qdoba and h r block we ve never been more excited about the demand for yext but in q3 the launch of our new answers product disrupted our sales execution it elongated purchasing cycles as customers who are down a path with yext got excited about answers and wanted to learn more before buying yext and it slowed some deal cycles all that said we have never seen a stronger pipeline and stronger market demand for the yext search experience cloud and while we have the most experienced reps we ve ever had still 45 are new since the beginning of the year so introducing a new product to a group of reps who are just getting comfortable with our existing products was a lot for them to digest that said we have never been more excited about our future we have an amazing new product in answers which we believe has doubled our tam we now have 250 quota carrying reps the highest number and most experienced we ve ever had we believe we have the strongest pipeline and demand generation we ve ever seen we now have a complete search experience solution that every brand on the planet can benefit from and we have never been in a stronger position going forward let s talk a minute about yext answers our revolutionary new product with the yext answers anyone with a website can answer questions in their own domain and a google like experience see believe it or not most companies today can t answer basic questions about themselves in their own website and when a user can t get an answer from a company s own website they bounce back to google and run the same search and then the brand s lost control of the customer journey as the user s lost in a sea of results and competitive ads and third party sources which are rife with misinformation yext answers based on natural language processing that accesses facts and the knowledge graph keeps brands in greater control of the customer journey and increases conversion on a brand s website you see unlike traditional site search which is built on technology that uses keywords to turn links to documents answers gives a direct answer to the question just like google does except it s on a company s own domain brands across multiple industries have already transformed their websites with answers during its early adopter period including bbva usa three mobile and iha these customers and many more we ve already signed and are already live are already seeing results and let s talk about one for a minute three mobile they ve been able to use yext answers to achieve significant customer insights previously they were using yext to power their store locations and listings but now with answers they know so much about what their customers are looking for graham johnson that s their kilt styling executive who you may recall from the investor breakout at onward he emailed our team to say and i quote it was great to see the insights and suggested content from the first day some of the search terms alone have opened up our eyes to some massive missed opportunities both commercially and experientially we aren t just at the beginning of customer success with answers we just launched this product but we re already on a run rate to handle over 5 7 million searches and deliver a stunning 2 8 million clicks per year the data first proves that people use site search and second that yext answers that the yext answers search engine is delivering search quality so superior that users are engaging with the results by clicking in fact one of the large one of our large financial clients informed us that they ve already seen a 25 increase in conversion on their website when their customers use answers versus their old site search and this is a huge lift with answers yext can offer brands a comprehensive solution to power their search experiences everywhere from one single platform every customer journey starts with search today s modern search experiences don t just link to documents they understand questions and provide answers which come from a knowledge graph and with the yext knowledge graph brands can create entities to represent every fact they want the world to know about them that s the foundation of our platform and our strategy is to build applications on top of the knowledge graph that let our customers power search experiences to meet their customers everywhere so for example listings leverages all the locations the customer has in their knowledge graph to be published in google maps and voice search applications like siri and alexa and next our pages product lets companies build a website a web page for every fact that s stored in their knowledge graph optimized to appear in search and now with answers a company can answer a question on their own domain about any fact stored in their knowledge graph in a google like experience and if a fact changes say a health system adds a new insurance accepted or a financial services company launches a new credit card they simply update their knowledge graph and boom their customers find the latest facts anywhere they re looking whether it s on google facebook alexa now in a company s own website and now in their own site search too and so we re positioning this comprehensive solution as the yext search experience cloud delivering brand verified answers everywhere consumers search every customer journey starts with a search the yext search experience cloud provides the answer with answers we believe the total addressable market for the yext search experience cloud has effectively doubled answers is opening up new industry segments like cpg and technology and new types of entities for existing customers and want us to answer questions about their business we re already seeing success selling into new segments with wins like campbell s and expanding entities into existing customers like three mobile who now want to be able to answer anytime with any type of question about their business not just about their locations since every customer journey starts with a search we believe the yext search experience cloud will become a critical component within our customers dxp or digital experience platform stack this means we re well positioned to capture share within the 14 billion dxp market which gartner estimates is growing at approximately 14 per year and so in total we now believe our addressable market opportunity has expanded from the 10 billion number at the time of our ipo to more than 20 billion with the addition of answers and we are well positioned to capture share driven by our comprehensive search experience cloud platform we ve never been more optimistic about our future we have a complete search solution we have an exciting new product that effectively doubles our tam we have the most tenured set of sales reps we ve ever had and above all we stand at an important time when the world needs yext this information is running rampant online our mission to power the truth and drive our customers more transactions from their search experiences has never been more precious now i ll turn the call over to our president and chief revenue officer jim steele james steele president and chief revenue officer thanks howard as howard noted the launch of answers is significant but did delay our deal cycles despite this issue we continue to win new business this quarter closing 88 deals with at least 100 000 in total contract value versus 71 deals in the same period last year including three deals that resulted in at least 1 million of total contract value including new logos and renewals of existing customers total number of mid market and enterprise customers increased 46 year over year to 1 766 customers this is notable since howard just walked you through the answers upsell opportunity in path this means we have an expanding mid market and enterprise customer base available to upsell with compelling products like answers i think it s worth repeating that the sales cycles for a typical enterprise seller can take multiple quarters especially on deals exceeding 1 million the sales cycle for a typical mid market seller is about half the time of an enterprise seller though the sales cycles are longer total contract values are meaningfully larger in the mid market and enterprise than in small business subway which howard announced as yext s largest new enterprise client deal in the history of the company was a multi quarter due diligence and sales process in addition to subway in canada and europe internationally we had some very nice wins in europe we added logos such as motability operations the abbeyfield society asda stores in the uk riva out of germany and a significant expansion at marston s charlotte tilbury and the body shop international japan s most impactful deal this quarter was xebio group one of the largest sporting goods company companies in japan i m happy to say we have built an exceptional sales team worldwide nearly 20 of our total employee base are quota carrying sales reps this is a significant increase from the start of the year growing 45 to 250 we ve now exceeded our sales hiring targets for the year and i believe we re laying a strong foundation to capture this enormous business opportunity howard talked about we will continue to hire the best but now in fourth quarter we re shifting our focus to driving execution and efficiency in particular across enterprise and mid market we now have the comprehensive solutions we have the marketing the sales enablement the go to market team and the opportunity all aligned to realize their full potential so now i ll turn the call over to steve to walk you through the quarter in more detail steve steven cakebread chief financial officer jim thank you while the launch of answers and the momentum generated at onward19 are not reflected in our current financials they do position us nicely for a long term sustainable growth from our expanded market opportunity our third quarter revenue grew 30 to 76 4 million revenue excluding small business customers grew 34 highlighting the increasing role of our enterprise and mid market investments in addition international revenue grew 67 year over year to 13 6 million unearned revenue increased 32 from the year ago period to 107 5 million and as of october 31 we had 252 million in remaining performance obligation or rpo and our backlog includes another 32 million in revenue that s under contract but subject to accounting exclusions on that basis we have 284 million in estimated future revenue under contract net retention was 107 for the overall company and comparable with q3 last year and our enterprise and mid market net retention was 110 again consistent with q3 last year as well gross margins were 73 3 this quarter compared to 74 6 last year that s driven in part by hiring in our services organization and additional lease expenses keep in mind year to date gross margins are still 74 2 and we feel comfortable that over time our gross margins will continue to be in the range of 73 to 77 total opex increased from 66 7 million last year to 98 8 million this quarter primary drivers of this increase was overall growth in headcount including the increase in our quota carrying sales reps along with the new leases in new york district of columbia and london it will be incurring double lease expense in new york until our one madison avenue lease expires in december of 2020 specifically the annual run rate for our lease at one madison avenue is 4 8 million per year while the annual run rate at 61 ninth avenue is 10 3 million a year once our lease at one madison expires at the end of december 2020 our run rate for our lease expense in new york will be approximately 10 3 million annually keeping in mind in q4 of this year our lease expense at one madison will be 1 2 million and 2 6 million at 61 ninth third quarter net loss increased from 22 9 million a year ago to 42 7 million this quarter on the basis of our 113 5 million weighted average basic shares outstanding net loss per share of 0 38 this quarter compares to 0 23 loss a year ago on the basis of 99 6 million weighted average basic shares outstanding non gaap net loss excluding stock based compensation increased from 10 million a year ago to 21 6 million this quarter and our non gaap net loss of 0 19 per share this quarter compares to 0 10 in the year ago quarter so please refer to the press release we issued this afternoon for a reconciliation of gaap to non gaap results cash and cash equivalents were 245 million as of october 31 2019 net cash used in operations for the third quarter was 31 8 million as compared to net cash used in operations of 22 6 million in the year ago period the biggest drivers were the increase in headcount changes in unearned revenue and our new leases onward19 expenses are also impacted this quarter as to guidance in the fourth quarter we expect revenue to be between 79 million and 81 million and in the same period we anticipate non gaap loss per share of between 0 15 and 0 13 which reflects the impact of 0 03 on our new lease agreements in new york and dc this also assumes a weighted average basic share count of approximately 115 2 million shares we do expect to be operating cash flow breakeven in the fourth quarter consistent with past seasonal trends turning to the full year we now expect 296 5 million to 298 5 million in revenue our non gaap net loss per share range is now expected to be in the range of 0 51 to 0 49 and this includes a 0 09 per share from the impact of our new lease agreements in new york and dc this also is based on an assumed basic weighted average share count of approximately 111 8 million shares we re focused on growing the business driving to non gaap breakeven and getting to operation operating cash flow breakeven as we head into the fourth quarter i m thrilled about the new initiatives we put in place that howard and jim discussed specifically we ve exceeded our hiring plan during the quarter resulting in 45 year to date increase in the size of our sales team we grew our mid market and enterprise customer base by 46 year over year we ve launched a game changing product in answers and the customer feedback has been very positive and initial market response has been encouraging and we ve seen a 65 growth in a number of facts the yext knowledge graph as we mentioned we have a strong solution our search experience cloud platform and a consistent message to explain our business i m feeling confident about our ability to utilize our opportunity and drive toward our long term plan so with that we ll turn it back to the operator and open for questions thank you questions and answers operator thank you our first question comes from koji ikeda with oppenheimer please go ahead koji ikeda oppenheimer co inc analyst oh hey great guys thanks for taking my question so i had a question kind of thinking about the future growth profile of the business here specifically next year so with the it sounds like you had a great launch of answers but that really pushed out some of the sales cycles resulting in that fourth quarter guide looking kind of at the mid 20s so considering that you guys are a subscription business and you have talked about 30 sustained growth in the past do you still feel confident that you can grow 30 next year thank you howard lerman founder chief executive officer thanks koji this is howard i ll take that question first look we launched an amazing new product in answers in q3 and anytime you launch a new product it s going to be a little bit disruptive this is the first major product that we ve launched in five or six years and it slowed the deal cycles down a little bit for upsells for new customers think about for example if you were launching if you broke your iphone and then in 30 days apple was releasing the iphone 11 and you had an iphone 10 you d think a little bit about am i going to buy the 10 now or am i going to wait 30 days and buy the 11 so we had some deals that slowed and as a consequence of launching this product second we started the quarter off by kicking off a planned enablement roadshow in preparation it took about 200 reps off the field for a couple weeks we knew we d give them a little bit less time to sell but we didn t expect it quite to elongate the deal cycle in the quarter and then the final thing i ll just say about the sales execution issue that we experienced with the launch of answers is that look 45 of our reps are new this year they all are getting comfortable with our existing products and starting to be able to sell them but then throwing a brand new product at them with some new buyers and some new different types of dynamics involved was a little bit of a curveball and it took a little bit longer for them to digest that so that s kind of our view on the sales execution in q3 but that said we ve never seen a stronger pipeline we ve never felt stronger market demand for the yext search experience cloud and we see the early feedback from all of the new initiatives we re launching and i want to say just one other thing which is that we re an innovative company we believe every company in the world that has a knowledge graph i m sorry we believe every company in the world that has a website is going to need a knowledge graph in order to sort out all the different facts about their company and put them everywhere people are searching every customer journey starts with a search and whether that s on google whether that s on a company s own website we want to be we have the opportunity to be the company that provides the answer to that search it s a very compelling and strategic place to be and so we re really excited about this opportunity we doubled our tam with the launch of this new product we have the most complete set of sales reps we ve ever had the most tenured we ve ever had we have a complete solution with the yext search experience cloud and we believe very much that our future is our best days are ahead of us and i ll turn it over to jim for a sec james steele president and chief revenue officer yes thanks koji this is jim steele just to kind of add some color at the beginning of the third quarter we re getting ready to launch answers so we brought our sales team as howard said that created obviously a lot of time out of selling mode and we brought them in to train them on answers which is a very different sales cycle we have a different buyer in many cases in fact all the cases we ve been selling at a much higher level it turns out that every company is views their website as sacrosanct they want to make sure that they re very protective of it and up until now we ve been powering their external kind of digital ecosystem with the googles and facebooks and yahoo yahoos and bings and yelp and everyone else but when you re dealing with their website it s a different level of being protective as a customer so the cmo the cio in particular and the chief digital officers all got involved and we re dealing with different budgets so created some complexity in terms of understanding the data architecture that goes into selling answers is really taking the knowledge graph that we ve been already selling for a while it drives our listings and pages products but now we re also powering their internal website so there was a lot of interest and just to give you an idea we almost had too much interest because when we train the reps at the same time we asked their sales teams for nominations for their customers for early adopters knowing that we weren t actually going general availability with answers until the last few days of october the last few days of our quarter and we had 10 slots that we had available capacity wise to deal with early adopter customers well we had this overwhelming response we had 130 nominations and the customers all got excited they said yes we need this we re interested in learning more and i ll give you one example we had a healthcare company a very large healthcare company that we re already working on a knowledge graph and listings opportunity and when we introduced answers to them they got very excited but it brought a whole new sales path because we got involved with different executives and they we went down a different path and they had different budgets they wanted to bundle the two deals together so that deal did not close in the third quarter which we had expected we do expect i hope knock on wood we do want to win this deal hopefully in 90 days we ll be talking about it but this is the kind of thing that happened it definitely created a pause as customers wanted to understand how answers fits in and they wanted to leverage an answers purchase along with their other solutions that they re buying but to howard s point our demand has never been stronger we have never been better prepared going into a quarter than we are today from a capacity point of view with 250 sales reps all trained and enabled on our solution we ve got this platform now with the knowledge graph and the new product with answers that it has just unbelievable demand and from a leadership point of view the leadership team and revenue has never been in a stronger place we ve got a world class team we have patrick blair running our commercial business unit sales we ve got dave runitsky running our enterprise business we ve got wendi sturgis in europe our ceo of europe who has been with yext over eight years and we recently brought on mary fratto rowe from salesforce a couple months ago to build our customer success organization and make sure our customers getting the most value they can out of our products so the combination of all that and then we have uda san as our ceo of japan he built salesforce japan for 10 years and with that team and the pipeline that s never been stronger i am really excited about the growth opportunities for next year and starting going into the fourth quarter we re in a very strong position steven cakebread chief financial officer right and i ll just remind everybody i mean we did grow q3 revenue 30 unearned revenue grew 32 backlog at 283 7 million at the end of this quarter leaves us in good position for the fourth quarter and going forward with our product offering and all those stuff that jim described i mean our long term growth strategy is still intact our focus clearly is on q4 because that drives our fiscal year 21 guidance so we ll give you all that stuff next quarter as we both finish q4 and finish our budgeting but i feel really good with where we re at we ve never been better positioned as a company for the products the sales team capacity the solutions we have and growing the tam just gives us a huge amount of opportunity so yes we think the long term growth plans are still very much intact here koji ikeda oppenheimer co inc analyst great thanks for taking my questions operator our next question comes from naved khan with suntrust please go ahead naved khan suntrust robinson humphrey inc analyst thanks a lot couple of question so maybe i think you guys talked about a few things in terms of that might have affected the quarter and also going forward including maybe a couple of lost week s training the sales reps as well as longer decision making if we have to think about q4 how much of the impact was kind of one time related to training the sales reps versus sales cycle getting elongated and i think you also mentioned about pipeline being at a record is there at some point a catch up when you see more conversions happening in the pipeline and people just kind of basically willing to comment more dollars or how should we be thinking about it i thought answers in some ways could actually help accelerate sales just because it s so compelling and can you just help us walk through the thinking on your end howard lerman founder chief executive officer thanks naved it s howard i ll take the question we don t see this as a multi quarter problem we expect to have a seasonally strong q4 it s not a catch up quarter our deal flow is strong but these are big deals and it s a new product so there s a little bit longer closing cycles as large deals take time we got to educate customers on the new product get embedded into our customer s account they ve got a fine budget for answers so we ll make up in q4 what we ve missed in q3 but we are building the pipeline strong and we ve got great demand momentum naved khan suntrust robinson humphrey inc analyst the other thing i wanted to ask was so this is sort of a new metric it releases around like new customer total customer count including the mid size can you give us a sense of what the contribution is from mid size currently and how that might grow steven cakebread chief financial officer yeah i think we just started in our mid market so a lot of our business still comes from the larger enterprise accounts and quite frankly that s where a lot of the hiring came in the last couple of months and q3 was in our mid market so you ll see mid market start to become a contributor over the next year but as you know there are smaller deals quicker deal cycle which is why we want to invest there and some great accounts but for this quarter and i think for the next couple of quarters you will see us still be dominated by enterprise deals predominantly howard lerman founder chief executive officer and we encourage you to stop at subway on your way home to support our newest largest customer naved khan suntrust robinson humphrey inc analyst thanks with respect to headcount can you maybe just brief us on what your thinking is do you think the hiring might slow down a bit because at an appropriate level or what kind of is that howard lerman founder chief executive officer sure i think so there s a couple of things here on the overall company headcount of course we ve been on plan and we will continue to be there what we ve done is accelerated the sales rep hiring and that s still going to be a point of focus here we and you ve heard me say this we re not in the 32 nfl markets in north america we have a great opportunity clearly in international growing at 67 so we re going to continue to hire both sellers and developers predominantly in this company that said you don t bring on the quantity of sales reps in the period short period of time that we did without taking a little bit of a breather assimilating them and getting them productive and so you ll see us kind of push ahead as business pushes ahead but right now we ve kind of got to integrate all these people we just brought on and make them successful but we ve not stopped hiring we ve not really slowed hiring in the areas of development and sales reps naved khan suntrust robinson humphrey inc analyst thank you operator our next question comes from mike murphy with j p morgan please go ahead adam bergere j p morgan analyst hey guys adam bergere on for mark murphy first question on yext conversion tracking so some partners during onward said that that s the feature they are most excited about doing it and independent of the sales cycle elongation do you guys have any feedback on how this might be helping or like changing the sales process since it makes it easier for customers to track roi howard lerman founder chief executive officer so yext conversion tracking just to give everyone a sense of what that is if you haven t seen it before it allows customers to track not just the clicks they re getting out of their search experiences but also track conversions as they define it this is a new feature we launched at onward it s part of our existing packages and it lets customers see not just clicks but also conversions as well across their listings on their pages and with answers it doesn t change the amount that they re getting from the product it s just a new way for them to analyze the features so i don t think that has any impact whatsoever on the sales or sales execution one of the coolest things about yext answers is that you can see what people are typing in what they re searching for what they re asking questions about and quickly react and then you can for the first time add a transaction to a site search so traditional side search today when you run a site search if you go to like citibank com and you search for something what they do is they give you 10 blue links back you try like searching for like student checking account and you ll see like oh there s like 10 links to maybe they re relevant results but with the yext answers for some of our customers that are using this product like we have several banks that are already live on it now if you type in say branches near me you get a google like experience back with maps and the maps have transactions on them and those transactions include phone calls and driving direction requests it can actually be whatever the customer wants so for the first time we ve made it possible for a company to transact right off sorry for a user to transact right off the search engine results page of a site search kind of like you can in google and this is a breakthrough and customers are already seeing the results from this i think i mentioned that one of our customers a bank and they are a pretty big bank has seen a 25 increase in conversions these are real people that are converting right off the page to a user that went through yext answers versus went through their old site search that s a huge lift and it s going to have a real impact on their bottom line adam bergere j p morgan analyst okay thank you and second question as you guys continue to build out your indirect sales channel do you guys have any feedback on the uptake of the certification program that you guys released i believe it was called the hitchhiker program and how is it being adopted among major sis thanks howard lerman founder chief executive officer hitchhikers is our new program that lets customers get certified and become super experts in our product we had extraordinary demand for people to become hitchhikers at yext think of every saas company like salesforce you have a salesforce certified administrator at your company or maybe you purchase access to a salesforce administrator that works at salesforce that s the program that we re implementing now and these are experts in the product that help companies get setup and hitchhikers play a key role in helping a company get setup maintaining their knowledge graph creating the original architecture and schema for that graph keeping all the entities live getting all the connections into the knowledge graph so the data can flow in from all the different systems across the company making sure that data can make it out to any partner that might be using yext via app directory and then also setting up the pages setting up the websites getting all the styling correct there have to do some basic css and some other type of some coding to kind of make that happen it s not like hardcore engineering but you need to have some technical expertise to do it and then finally watching the queries come in watching the questions come in as people ask stuff we ve got be able to answer and so hitchhikers are experts at being able to quickly react and keep a customer current in all their search experiences everywhere that s the goal of this program and it s going to be more formally rolled out we took initial interest we had overwhelming response and these hitchhikers are going to be a key part of helping customers get going like certified administrators are for salesforce operator our next question comes from tom white with d a davidson please go ahead thomas white d a davidson analyst great thanks for taking my questions in the prepared remarks you guys talked about kind of the strong pipeline and demand exiting onward for answers and the fact that customers wanted to i guess learn a bit more about the product given that steve is there any kind of color you can give us on sort of the trajectory for kind of unearned revenues growth in the fourth quarter and then just a follow up to another question about the outlook for next year i just wanted to clarify steve it sounded as though you guys are still comfortable with sort of that 30 ish revenue growth target that you guys have talked about in the past i just wanted to get clarity there given sort of this slower exit to the year and some of the comments about the elongated sales cycle thanks steven cakebread chief financial officer sure i think on the long term strategy and where we see ourselves is that 30 plus growth is still intact and quite frankly it s stronger just because market size sales quality new products et cetera so that s not changed i mean you have to be a little careful if you look at our quarters keep in mind we re still big deal enterprise driven so we re going to get some volatility in the quarterly numbers but year to date we re still in our model in terms of q4 yes there s obviously onward generates a huge amount of demand with particularly when you bring out new products we have a lot of work to do and yes i think everybody feels really comfortable about where the opportunities are for us but as we ve said a couple of times on this call there s big deals it takes a while there s more budget there s more people and so it s our job to go out and execute in q4 and we ll talk about that when we get to the end of the quarter thomas white d a davidson analyst great thanks so much for the color operator our next question comes from mark mahaney with rbc capital markets please go ahead michael chen rbc capital markets analyst hi guys this is mike chen for mark i was just wondering if you could provide a little more color on the international i know you mentioned germany and japan being pretty strong market but any more color on some of the other top performing markets and are there any specific international markets where you may need to expand headcount a little more than others and then i have a follow up as well james steele president and chief revenue officer yeah hey mike so it s been exactly three years since we opened up our office in northern europe based out of london for the uk and then about 2 5 years ago we opened up germany and france and as part of the southern europe we also have an office in italy and those have been great markets for us i mean as steve said the growth rate internationally has been tremendous we 67 growth that which is really driven by the luxury retailers in europe you think about any of the names from france and from italy a lot of those customers are our customers we have tremendous growth there financial services is very strong so our international market we love it we moved wendi sturgis over there in february of this year at the beginning of the year as our ceo for europe and we have three strong mds that are running the three regions there so we are very optimistic and then in japan japan has been about a year and a half two years since we hired uda san and that has been just a great success story as well so we have customers in a 150 different countries and of course we have our operation in china as well because a lot of our global brands have operations throughout china and we have very good relationships with all the publishers all the third party search engines there so we see international is a great growth opportunity but we re being very careful about not to expand too fast like we have those three markets four markets including japan and five i guess if you include italy but all over europe and japan we see so much opportunity that we re not jumping the gun here on others we have others in mind at some point but we re not we don t want to move too fast michael chen rbc capital markets analyst got you and then just in terms of gross margins could you explain again why that came down quarter over quarter and year over year and i know you talked about it being relatively in the range of 73 to 77 but is that just going to be kind of lumpy quarter to quarter or is that going to like trend or have like a particular cadence to it steven cakebread chief financial officer yeah that s a good observation i mean all our numbers are lumpy simply because we re doing enterprise business and revenue is lumpy because of that as well but we did just like in sales made some conscious investments in customer service and support as howard talked about hitchhikers wasn t a big part of it but customer support does start to get we need to get those folks ramped up for answers and our other expansion so i would look at it lumpy and if you go back and look at our financial trends it does run between 73 and 77 that s why i gave you the year to date because it s been kind of settling in the mid 74 range so quarter the quarter numbers while i look at them year over year there are somewhat subject to what we do in a particular quarter but the year to dates are going to stay in the mid 70s range as we described michael chen rbc capital markets analyst got it thank you operator our next question comes from stan zlotsky with morgan stanley please go ahead stan zlotsky morgan stanley analyst hey guys thank you so much for taking our question wanted to go back to answers for a second so when you re talking to these customers and clearly there s a lot of stakeholders that are brought to the table in those discussions how much bigger are these answers deals when answers specifically is getting involved howard lerman founder chief executive officer stan i d say it s roughly double stan zlotsky morgan stanley analyst got it and the deals that you mentioned that slipped out of q3 did you close any of them in q4 yet steven cakebread chief financial officer yeah a few but there are still more deals to go and we ve got big deals that s the thing stan as you know i mean deals move in and out of quarter so one slip in one quarter doesn t necessarily mean it s a bigger quarter we still got 1 million deals to take down and those takes some time with budget but we feel good about where we re at and what we re doing stan zlotsky morgan stanley analyst got it got it and looking at i know you don t like to talk about billing steve but you have a big seasonal q4 coming up and although you don t like to talk about billings the stock does trade on billings a very tough comp coming up 49 from a year ago and you just printed 12 in q3 how should we think about billings going into the big seasonal q4 steven cakebread chief financial officer well a couple of things i won t go through my diatribe on why billings is somewhat irrelevant but that said you saw q4 revenues come down because clearly our business in q3 in terms of bookings wasn t where we expected it to be q4 is huge and as we said we have new products so i m not going to put any expectations out about billings the one thing is we ll put both of ourselves out of our misery because we will in q4 give you year over year growth in rpo we are looking at giving installed base and a few other metrics so billings will become very irrelevant to the conversation as we get our metrics sorted out for next year stan zlotsky morgan stanley analyst okay perfect thank you so much guys operator our next question comes from brett knoblauch with berenberg capital markets please go ahead brett knoblauch berenberg capital analyst hi guys thanks for taking my question maybe just on the recent investments you guys have been making over the past several quarters and maybe when do you plan on kind of seeing a return on that investment and maybe when should we start expecting to see some leverage in the business opex has just kind of consistently been outpacing revenue growth and maybe just how long you expect that trend to continue steven cakebread chief financial officer i think there s a couple of aspects of this one is as we said we will continue to invest in our sales and marketing and our developers just because we ve got some great new products and we re totally uncovered in a lot of markets although jim as you heard said it s going to continue to work on sales efficiency and productivity which we re quite well aware of guys so that s not a surprise that said part of the dialogue if you go back and listen to the script next year for us we re carrying a lot of excess real estate into next year and until that kind of sorts itself out there s going to be an overhead to that i think as we get into fiscal year 22 we start to see the efficiencies on the broader operation so there s kind of two things going on that you look out as you look at next year and again we ll describe a lot more of this for next year as we get through q4 and we balance revenue but we clearly the number of facilities with our headcount growth we ve added like i said london dc new york we just are sitting in san francisco today actually in new facilities we brought on in the last six months we ve got to outfit all of those so you re going to see some impacts there but i think that will go away in 22 fiscal year 22 and then the rest of it is operational efficiency which we are really driving toward and it s serious business to get to cash flow breakeven and operating breakeven so that is not lost on us and that s where we re driving to i think the product lineup the fact that we have strong pipelines et cetera starts to put in place the productivities that we re all looking for over the foreseeable future but next year is going to be a little bit challenge because of facilities cost brett knoblauch berenberg capital analyst and then how should we think about hiring next year obviously up 45 so far year to date is that steven cakebread chief financial officer let me go into that i mean some of our hiring driven by what we do in q4 too so i think those are more appropriate questions as we get through q4 and where we re going i guess we fundamentally will continue to hire developers and we fundamentally will continue to put sales reps in territories where we know we have great opportunity but we re uncovered but in terms of specifics and totals and all that i really need to look at q4 results and then we ll see how we scale the business next year brett knoblauch berenberg capital analyst all right thanks steve thanks guys steven cakebread chief financial officer yeah howard lerman founder chief executive officer great thank you brett ben we re going to go ahead and end today s conference call and we look forward to chatting with you in the coming weeks and in january and wish you all a happy holidays thank you ben operator duration 49 minutes call participants dominic paschel investor relations howard

general motors payrolls which would confirm that the economy remained on a moderate expansion path despite a prolonged manufacturing slump the labor department s closely watched monthly employment report on friday is also expected to show steady wage gains and the unemployment rate holding near a 50 year low the report would validate the federal reserve s decision last month to cut interest

workers and investors got an early christmas gift with a blowout november jobs report that showed the u s economy is still capable of creating jobs and sustaining wage gains above the rate of inflation but the fly in the ointment is persistent trade war worry it indicates that the labor market is defying gravity as we enter the end of the year said glassdoor com senior economist daniel zhao economists said the addition of 266 000 new jobs nearly all of which 254 000 came from the private sector reflected how the labor market is pulling the disengaged and underemployed off the sidelines the labor market continues to be more than robust enough to continue to absorb new workers the unemployment and underemployment rates are going down at the same time said sameer samana senior global market strategist at the wells fargo investment institute the two numbers often have an inverse relationship he said moving in tandem is an indication that there is a demand for more workers and that the labor force is meeting that demand at 63 2 percent the labor force participation rate has tracked at roughly the same level for the past four months it shows you there s a quite a bit of dynamism in the u s labor market samana said job seekers need to take advantage of it there s definitely pockets of growth and there s going to be pockets of decline said irina novoselsky ceo at careerbuilder com the supply and demand trends are very different in different zip codes she said those uneven rates of job growth could be holding back wage gains at an annualized 3 1 percent wage growth is still slightly below what many economists would consider a healthy range of 3 5 to 4 percent although market observers said the persistently low rate of inflation helps mitigate that it s faster than the rate of inflation greg mcbride chief financial analyst at bankrate com said of the wage growth rate we are seeing some growth in consumer buying power albeit modest he said if you look at the six month average you can see that there s been a continued deceleration in payrolls growth especially in manufacturing there s been a clear deceleration in wage growth samana said although he added that this trend does have a silver lining for companies when you start to meaningfully accelerate north of 3 percent that s when profit margins come under pressure he said market experts worried that a looming tranche of tariffs on 156 billion in chinese made consumer goods could drive up corporate expenses in unpredictable ways and more importantly hurt consumer buying power those tariffs are much more geared towards the u s consumer and if the u s consumer were to start to feel their costs rise meaningfully most people don t have a lot of excess savings samana said the consumer spends until they start to worry about their financial situation when combined with the cost pressures of tariffs a tight labor market could create inflation more quickly than demand for workers alone we re pretty concerned about the overall impact on inflation said john bredemus chief investment officer at allianz investment management higher inflation could drive up mortgage rates and contribute to a rising dollar a headwind for u s multinational firms for this reason some economists were less sanguine about the longer term outlook in spite of november s outsized job gains questioning whether the positive reading was too good to be true it seems like a candidate for a big downward revision said ian shepherdson chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics who characterized the report as an outlier in a client note a repeat of this performance in december would be a different story but we think downside correction is more likely he said economists said that while the effects of new tariffs wouldn t be immediate they would be hard to mitigate once set into play that does bear watching as we move into 2020 any tariffs that take effect and particularly those that hit the consumer pocketbook do pose a stiffer headwind mcbride said with consumer spending the key driver of today s economy in the face of anemic corporate investment anything that makes americans less willing or able to buy goods and services could spread the trade war s impact far beyond the manufacturing sector i think the concern is that as the dec 15 tariffs roll around if we don t have a trade agreement in place by then there is the potential that the trade war spills over into other sectors zhao said

cnn opec and its allies have reportedly agreed to deepen its production cuts by 500 000 barrels per day in an attempt to support crude oil prices in the face of booming us output but the cartel which is led by saudi arabia did not release details or hold a press conference following its meeting in vienna on thursday opec meets with allied producers including russia on friday the prospect of deeper cuts failed to wow investors with crude prices posting only small gains on news reports that an agreement had been reached that s mainly because saudi arabia is already pumping at below its quota while others flout the agreement opec countries and allied producers have limited their production since 2017 the current deal removes 1 2 million barrels per day from world markets and is due to expire at the end of march there is uncertainty over how much longer the coalition can stick together it remains unclear what would occur in potentially reflecting saudi s new stance that they could walk away from this deal if other countries did not comply fully wrote analysts at goldman sachs the current oil price is particularly important because saudi arabia is preparing to list shares in its

drop in industrial production from the previous month was much worse than economists had expected while the dax the country s benchmark stock index managed to stay in positive territory the report

zimbabwe s central bank has asked the international monetary fund to overlook the country s shortcomings in achieving fiscal targets and allow a program to help restore the economy to run its course eddie cross a member of the monetary policy committee who attended the meetings held with the washington based lender s delegation on thursday said policy makers expected a tough report from the imf team which is in the country until dec 11 to review progress under a staff monitored program we asked them to recognize the achievements we have made in such a short space of time cross said in an interview in the capital harare we urged them to recognize that our fundamentals are now sound cross said some of the achievements include a reduction in the budget deficit the establishment of an interbank market and reducing state employee costs an electronic interbank system will go live later this month as the central bank tries to bring transparency into the trading system so far 15 lenders have confirmed their participation however the gains have been overshadowed by the worst economic crisis in a decade monthly inflation surged to 38 in october and while the statistics agency has stopped publishing an annual price growth rate cross puts it at 400 according to bloomberg calculations based on the statistics office s consumer price index data the rate was 440 in october a drought has also left nearly half the population of 14 million people food insecure rising food costs forced the government to make an about turn on scrapping grain subsidies the government will shoulder this cost and it s likely to attract scrutiny from the imf after it called for tighter monetary measures and curbs on government spending in its last review the staff monitored program is seen as a precursor to getting debt relief that s needed to restore the economy and is due to end in march cross said he s sure the imf would grudgingly agree to let the program run its course
president donald trump during a small business roundtable meeting in the roosevelt room of the white house in washington on friday dec 6 2019 erin schaff the new york times written by annie karni and jeanna smialek president donald trump was greeted friday morning with news of a blockbuster jobs report showing that employers added 266 000 jobs in november and the unemployment rate fell to 3 5 its lowest level since 1969 the country s economic condition which has historically aligned with a president s reelection chances should be helping trump sail into a second term but what should be a top indicator of trump s performance as president came a day after speaker nancy pelosi called on the house to begin drafting articles of impeachment against him advertisement it didn t take long for trump to tie the two together without the horror show that is the radical left do nothing democrats the stock markets and economy would be even better if that is possible he wrote on twitter and the border would be closed to the evil of drugs gangs and all other problems 2020 such is the trump presidency a leader who is presiding over a record long economic expansion that has proved more durable than anyone predicted while defending his fitness to hold office with 11 months to go before the 2020 election a polarized electorate is dividing itself by which storyline it views as more pertinent the president s potential abuse of power or the comfort of a steady paycheck credited to his leadership the trump campaign is betting that trump s rote denials of pressuring the ukrainian president to investigate his political foes will eventually sway enough voters to put the entire impeachment issue to the side advertisement trump having a perfectly acceptable phone call with the president of ukraine doesn t affect anybody s daily life said brad parscale the president s campaign manager a good job with a bigger paycheck does but trump s presidency is also testing conventional wisdom that a good economy is all voters need to keep the status quo rather than seek out change were it not for the other factors of the trump presidency it should be by far the most popular presidency in history based on the economics said tony fratto founder of hamilton place strategies a public affairs firm and a former spokesman for the treasury department under president george w bush instead of enjoying anything close to overwhelming popularity because of the economy trump s national approval rating has remained low dropping about 2 percentage points to 41 since the ukraine story broke one problem with trump s campaign message is that the economic expansion started before the president assumed office causing many voters to take it for granted advertisement at this point voters may think this is just the normal economy fratto said that gives them the luxury to focus on other things like the behavior of the president another factor is also at play while trump routinely talks up the economy he is far more passionate when lashing out at democrats over the impeachment inquiry or simply riffing about the news of the day than when discussing the stock market and unemployment rate his off the cuff comments often overshadow his dutiful recitations of gains at the white house on friday trump noted in a monotone voice that the unemployment rate was at the lowest rate as i told you in many years and in many ways i think we probably very soon say historically he only seemed to come alive when discussing rolling back energy standards on light bulbs the new bulb is many times more expensive and i hate to say it it doesn t make you look as good of course because being a vain person that s very important to me he said noting that it gives you an orange look advertisement trump s penchant for steering the conversation away from the economy is frustrating for many republicans and business leaders given america is powering through a record 11 year expansion employers have hired 2 2 million people over the past 12 months a surprisingly robust performance at a time when unemployment is at its lowest in half a century those gains have often come despite trump s policies not because of them and it remains an open question how long the pace of growth can continue the president s globe spanning trade war has put businesses on edge and slowed their investment manufacturing has dipped into outright contraction as weak global growth and geopolitical tensions weigh on exports trump s economic advisers have been keenly aware of the need to keep the economy humming as the president heads into a reelection year america is working and not only is america working america is getting paid after taxes larry kudlow a top economic adviser said friday i don t see any end to it right now what i see is more strength advertisement administration officials have been exploring ways to ensure the expansion continues including tax cuts aimed directly at the middle class the white house has not indicated which income brackets would see a lower rate but trump is expected to back a plan that would make permanent the individual tax cuts included in the tax package he signed in 2017 those cuts are now slated to expire in 2025 trump has dangled the additional tax cuts as a reason voters should back him and republican house candidates warning that the economy and retirement accounts will tank if democrats win the white house if any of these people that i ve been watching on this stage got elected your 401 k s would be down the tubes trump said in october you d destroy the country at rallies and speeches he has told supporters you have no choice but to vote for me citing dire economic consequences of electing any of the democratic candidates whom he has tried to broadly portray as a band of extreme socialists advertisement so far the economy is complying with trump s reelection message average hourly earnings increased 3 1 in the year through november a moderate but sustainable pace bigger paychecks have given consumers more cash to spend on everything from restaurant meals to holiday shopping helping to power the economy such a strong economic track record should help insulate trump from attacks by democrats claiming that they can do a better job managing the economy so far his rivals have floated plans that they say would spread wealth more equitably by raising taxes on corporations and the rich to finance universal health care and free college tuition but democrats have found a ripe opening in impeachment to hone their attacks on trump advertisement the constitution makes clear no one is above the law sen elizabeth warren of massachusetts said in a recent interview with msnbc i hope we hold him accountable even without the impeachment drama it s not clear that the economy will continue complying with trump s campaign messaging trump said this week that trade talks with china may last past the 2020 election rattling stock markets around the world additional tariffs on chinese goods are slated to take hold dec 15 and it is unclear whether they will be delayed global growth remains fragile and while many economists expect it to accelerate in 2020 that forecast could be upended by an escalation in the trade war we re really in terra incognita here i think in terms of what s possible next year just given all of the geopolitical factors at play said ernie tedeschi policy economist at evercore isi advertisement trump has jawboned the federal reserve to cut interest rates more aggressively blaming the central bank for not doing enough to propel the economy the fed cut rates three times in 2019 as it tried to insulate the economy against trade tensions and slowing global growth but it is unlikely that it will cut borrowing costs again without good reason for now trump is hoping his economic message wins out over impeachment an issue campaign advisers predicted would be firmly in the rearview mirror by november stock markets up record numbers trump tweeted friday adding it s the economy stupid

berlin the european central bank s ecb decision in september to pursue more monetary policy easing was controversial with one board representative from germany resigning over the move but one of the most remarkable features of the ecb s position has not gotten enough attention the admission that inflation expectations have become de anchored and that without fiscal policy support the central bank will probably fail to fulfill its price stability mandate for the foreseeable future in fact many observers and even several members of the ecb s governing council now argue that the bank needs to adapt its mandate with a new definition of price stability in mind they are right but there is one crucial caveat since central bank independence was strengthened in the 1990s it has become clear that in normal times the specific mandate does not matter much the united states federal reserve managed to guide expectations and achieve price stability with its dual mandate price stability and maximum employment just as well as the bank of england or the ecb with their narrower price stability mandates after the global financial crisis however the traditional mandate proved inadequate to cope with large scale financial instability fickle market confidence and political paralysis developed country central banks had to devise policies on the fly without a guiding framework each in its own way pursued unprecedented monetary easing massively expanding its balance sheet in order to provide much needed support to the economy in many ways these measures succeeded monetary expansion played a major role in pulling the economy back from the brink but over time central banks capacity to affect the real economy declined today and for the foreseeable future domestic inflation is increasingly affected by global rather than local developments and financial in stability and fiscal policy are far more influential than monetary policy for the ecb this generates a particularly serious challenge after all unlike other central banks it must account for the preferences of 19 sovereign national governments with little to no structural or fiscal policy coordination the eurozone is also highly fragmented financially lacking a common capital market a unifying safe asset or macroeconomic stabilisation tools the ecb needs a more realistic and flexible mandate given the eurozone s fragmented nature that mandate should probably still be centered on price stability but it should also recognise that the current definition of price stability below but close to 2 per cent inflation over the medium term is too narrow a broader definition is needed according to which the ecb pursues a symmetric inflation target of 2 per cent within a 1 5 2 5 per cent band over a longer time horizon some advocate an even higher target for example olivier blanchard a former international monetary fund chief economist has proposed re anchoring expectations at 4 per cent a different proposal from new york federal reserve president john williams is to target a price level rather than an inflation rate a commitment to more broadly defined price stability in the long term would give the ecb more space during times of crisis thereby enabling it to account better for risks to financial stability and the real economy this would help it to stabilise prices more quickly bolstering its credibility by contrast when the ecb consistently fails to meet its price stability objective as it has for the last five years it loses credibility and indeed the ecb has faced harsh criticism sometimes warranted often not over its implementation of untested expansionary monetary policies since 2008 partly because the measures were often poorly understood by the public the loss of credibility has undermined the ecb s capacity to fulfill its objectives creating a vicious circle that threatens its de facto independence this is why the timing of any mandate change must be chosen very carefully if the ecb tries to move the goalpost while it is missing the shot the short term blow to its already diminished credibility could be serious given this the ecb must work to strengthen its standing before it adjusts its mandate including by attempting to reach the existing price stability objective after years of failure at the same time the ecb must communicate better what its capabilities are some have urged the ecb to try addressing the solvency problems of banks or governments during the crisis others would like the ecb to discipline governments to do the right thing and consolidate spending a central bank must do neither and would utterly fail if it tried but these attempts have hurt the ecb s standing particularly in germany and have diminished its credibility clarifying the contents of the ecb s policy toolbox including sovereign bond purchases and other non standard measures would go a long way toward protecting the ecb from such attacks in the future and when the time comes to shift its objectives the ecb must communicate the change which to be sure may not need to be as big as many believe clearly and thoroughly us president john f kennedy was right the time to repair the roof is when the sun is shining the ecb cannot revise its mandate until the current storm has passed but with water pouring in it cannot afford to wait very long the sooner the ecb does what is needed to restore its credibility the sooner it can do what is needed to protect itself from future storms marcel fratzscher a former senior manager at the european central bank is president

washington dc abhijit banerjee and esther duflo two of this year s recipients of the nobel memorial prize in economic sciences are the latest among leading economists to remind us that gross domestic product is an imperfect measure of human welfare the human development index published by the united nations development programme aggregates indicators of life expectancy education and per capita income and has long been available as an alternative to per capita income alone in 2008 joseph e stiglitz amartya sen and jean paul fitoussi outlined the many failures of gdp for the french government sponsored commission on the measurement of economic performance and social progress subsequent oecd sponsored work elaborated on their findings and related research by the brookings institution s carol graham on subjective wellbeing and duke university s matthew adler on the measurement of social welfare has received well deserved acclaim nonetheless gdp continues to reign supreme in the halls of power policymakers around the world are constantly awaiting the latest quarterly data on gdp growth and variations of one tenth of a percentage point are regarded as significant indicators of macroeconomic performance the international monetary fund s world economic outlook may include in depth analysis across a wide range of topics but it always starts with gdp to see why treating gdp growth as a proxy for progress even in terms of income alone is highly problematic consider the case of a country with 10 citizens and a gdp of 190 where nine citizens start with 10 each and the tenth citizen starts with 100 moreover assume that gdp is equal to national income so that net factor income from abroad is zero now imagine that the first nine citizens experience no income growth in a given year while the tenth enjoys a 10 per cent increase gdp will have increased from 190 to 200 implying an annual growth rate of approximately 5 26 per cent this is reflected in the usual way national income is computed individuals are weighed by their share of total income and that 5 26 per cent rate represents a weighted average in which the income growth of the 10th citizen counts nine times more than that of each of the other nine citizens contrast this example with one in which the same country uses a democratically measured growth rate weighing each individual equally as a share of the population rather than as a share of total income here the growth rate would reflect the weighted sum of nine zero per cent growth rates and one 10 per cent growth rate each weighed at one 10th with a resulting total growth rate of 1 per cent the weighing of individuals by their share of income is not generally perceived by the public but this implicit practice is important to point out because it enshrines the principle of one dollar one vote rather than one person one vote it is essential for assessing the total size of a market or the economic power of a country but it does not capture an economy s performance for its citizens this is hardly the only reason why gdp is an inadequate measure of human wellbeing it also ignores people s need for respect dignity liberty health rule of law community and a clean environment but even if all of these other democratic goods were satisfied gdp still would fail as a metric of progress purely in terms of income alone building on work by the economists thomas piketty emmanuel saez and gabriel zucman the center for equitable growth has proposed gdp 2 0 a metric that would complement existing aggregate gdp reports by disaggregating the income growth of different cross sections of the population such as income quintiles providing this kind of distributional picture regularly would require increased coordination among government departments as well as some conventions on for example how to use tax data to complement the usual national accounts but conventions are also needed for existing national income accounting provided that distributional data are routinely available one could compute a growth rate based on the weighted average across each decile of the income distribution with equal weighting for population as in the example above individuals would still be weighed by their incomes within each group which is why it would be preferable to use deciles rather than quintiles but the final product would be much closer than current methods to the democratic ideal one of the main advantages of gdp growth is that it is expressed with a single number whereas other performance indicators either are presented within dashboards comprising multiple metrics or aggregated in essentially arbitrary ways the implicit use of income shares as aggregation weights is perfectly appropriate for macroeconomic analysis and is not arbitrary the problem arises when gdp becomes a proxy for progress what we can measure easily and communicate elegantly inevitably determines what we will focus on as a matter of policy as the stiglitz sen fitoussi report put it what we measure affects what we do publishing a democratic metric like the growth rate of gdp 2 0 is no pipedream a gdp growth rate using equal weights for each decile of the population would also produce a single number to complement the usual growth rate true it still would not capture the substantial differences within the top decile in many countries where the top 1 per cent have been gaining disproportionately compared to everyone else and we still would need other metrics to measure performance in dimensions other than income but as a single figure published alongside gdp growth it could go a long way toward changing the dominant conversation about economic performance kemal dervi former minister of economic affairs of

zimbabwe begs imf for patience on staff monitored program spread the love zimbabwe s central bank has asked the international monetary fund to overlook the country s shortcomings in achieving fiscal targets and allow a programme to help restore the economy to run its course eddie cross a member of the monetary policy committee who attended the meetings held with the washington based lender s delegation yesterday said policy makers expected a tough report from the imf team which is in the country until 11 december to review progress under a staff monitored programme we asked them to recognize the achievements we have made in such a short space of time cross said in an interview in the capital harare we urged them to recognize that our fundamentals are now sound cross said some of the achievements include a reduction in the budget deficit the establishment of an interbank market and reducing state employee costs an electronic interbank system will go live later this month as the central bank tries to bring transparency into the trading system so far 15 lenders have confirmed their participation however the gains have been overshadowed by the worst economic crisis in a decade monthly inflation surged to 38 in october and while the statistics agency has stopped publishing an annual price growth rate cross puts it at 400 according to bloomberg calculations based on the statistics office s consumer price index data the rate was 440 in october a drought has also left nearly half the population of 14 million people food insecure rising food costs forced the government to make an about turn on scrapping grain subsidies the government will shoulder this cost and it s likely to attract scrutiny from the imf after it called for tighter monetary measures and curbs on government spending in its last review the staff monitored programme is seen as a precursor to getting debt relief that s needed to restore the economy and is due to end in march cross said he s sure the imf would grudgingly agree to let the program run its course bloomberg share this post like this like loading
we have got to fight against privilege george orwell exhorted in 1941 against the notion that a half witted public schoolboy is better for command than an intelligent mechanic england he wrote is governed by an unteachable ruling class that too frequently escapes into stupidity failing to see that an economic system in which land factories mines and transport are owned privately and operated solely for profit does not work only a socialist revolution he continued could unleash the native genius of the english people of course the bankers and the larger businessmen the landowners and dividend drawers the officials with their prehensile bottoms will obstruct for all they are worth but never mind if the rich squeal audibly so much the better one measure of how little has changed is that orwell s diagnosis of the country he called a rich man s paradise and even his specific prescriptions nationalisation of basic industries abolition of hereditary privilege educational reform and punitive taxation of offensively unequal incomes still resonates almost eight decades later as the united kingdom goes to the polls the long english past of entrenched privilege and extreme inequality is back if it ever went away the problems stemming from archaic political and social structures and an economy geared to further enriching the rich seem even more intractable at the same time the wartime english patriotism that orwell tried to alchemise into socialism as highly intelligent germans tried to kill him has degenerated into self destructive nihilism during the tory onslaught on a german dominated european union which countenances even the breakup of the uk fragmentation of the uk would of course leave the welsh and the scottish with a sharper sense of their political and cultural identity englishness on the other hand appears as foggy as ever as the hunters of an authentic english national identity lurch towards a political climax it seems worth asking what is it all about englishness was always a form of theatre first staged in overseas colonies discovering its traces in rudyard kipling and india vs naipaul remarked on how at the height of their power the british gave the impression of a people at play a people playing at being english playing at being english of a certain class today in a post imperial britain run by half witted public schoolboys the english character seems even more as naipaul wrote a creation of fantasy view image in fullscreen dock workers outside the house of commons in 1968 photograph evening standard getty images those such as orwell who saw through the fantasy were usually mortified he was born in bihar in india to an opium agent with a caribbean slave owner as an ancestor while working as a colonial policeman in burma he discovered imperialism to be an evil despotism and englishness to be a humiliating act a pose of masculine authority and racial superiority necessary to keep volatile natives in their place others such as enoch powell a lower middle class native of the west midlands were seduced by this posture of stiff upper lipped preeminence powell became a classicist at cambridge taught himself fox hunting and wrote highly wrought georgian verse he exulted as a brigadier in the hierarchies of empire in india then like curzon milner cromer and other purveyors of an englishness made in india and egypt he came to develop a certain rather fierce idea of england and its destiny orwell on the other hand was an archetype of the unpatriotic leftwinger on his return home until he found a lodestone of native english genius in the red wall of northern england the spirited english response to hitler s vicious assault deepened his conviction of having discovered a new emotional unity in england one that a socialist revolution could turn in favour of its downtrodden people he persuaded himself that england together with the rest of the world is changing and a new middle class blending in with the old working class would bring forth new blood new men new ideas war did indeed awaken a spirit of social egalitarianism leading to conservative defeat in 1945 some of orwell s proposals were partially implemented by the attlee government still there was always something too sanguine about the homecoming scenario of a deracinated intellectual for if england was a family as orwell claimed with rich relations who have to be kowtowed to and poor relations who are horribly sat upon then as a range of foreign and english observers noted at the time it was a family marked to an unusual degree by sadomasochistic relationships jg ballard another disaffected child of imperialism who arrived in england in 1946 after three years in a japanese internment camp in shanghai was not only appalled by his country s grotesque social division he also marvelled at the system of self delusions that enabled a people comparable in their poor education diet and grim housing to the menial toilers of shanghai to give their lives to an empire that had never been of the least benefit to them the english class system which everyone secretly accepted for reasons i have never understood ballard later wrote was an instrument of political control far from collaborating on revolution the straitened middle class feared and despised the working classes especially organised labour and was obsessed with enforcing codes of behaviour that were calculated to create a sense of overpowering deference as for the upper class the american critic edmund wilson noted in 1945 how its members manifested the appalling traits he had found in novels such as thackeray s vanity fair and butler s the way of all flesh passion for social privilege and dependence on inherited advantage the great new zealand memoirist janet frame discussing the seemingly unbreakable social hierarchy of england s natives with other indigent new zealanders and australians in london in the 1950s concluded they re in the middle ages though as exploited as indians the english people orwell wrote manifestly tolerated their selfish incompetent and often silly ruling class change i felt was what england desperately needed ballard reminiscing about the 1940s wrote two years before his death in 2009 and i still feel it yet england s political and social system had long been premised on regulating change when it favoured the middle class neutralising it when it was demanded by the working class all the while safeguarding the unteachably stupid upper class walter bagehot the economist editor with an acute phobia for england s poor and disenfranchised put it frankly in 1867 the unwritten english constitution in its palpable form is this the mass of the people yield obedience to the select few they defer to what we may call the theatrical show of society discussing the role of the monarchy in this show bagehot was equally blunt we must not let in daylight upon magic in other words the masses of england were to be ruled by almost the same combination of pomp bluff and repression that the natives of india were the fossilised politics enjoyed greater legitimacy at home because the english had lived through much of the modern era as its winners innovating industrially and expanding commercially before other countries the mystique of british power commanded deference while perpetuating such archaisms as a single parliament representing four nationalities though as exploited and defrauded as indians the english people orwell wrote manifestly tolerated their selfish incompetent and often silly ruling class the post war development of cheap luxuries in particular averted revolution the economist reassured itself in 1977 britain s very stability the beguiling flummery attending its institutions hold most of its citizens in a trance of acceptance but the trance had begun to break after 1945 when instead of enlarging the realm on which the sun never set the english began to retreat and simultaneous with the loss of colonial territories the colonised started to arrive in a war ravaged england powell among others had cherished a starry eyed notion of the empire as a large multiracial family with white males on top but the unstated proviso for the imperialist paterfamilias was always that the dark skinned family members stay in their respective countries and not seek to live work and marry white people in england the new arrivals prompted by the postwar need for nhs nurses bus drivers and other workers quickly exposed this separate but equal chicanery of the commonwealth writing in 1953 to his wife naipaul summed up the hostile environment the british empire s previously invisible citizens confronted in england considered only for jobs as porters in kitchens and with the road gangs the oxford educated trinidadian had been reduced he claimed to a poor wog literally starving and very cold with no fire in my room for two days and only tea toast in my stomach these people want to break my spirit naipaul wrote they want me to forget my dignity as a human being the fact that most people from the colonies inhabited even lower depths of poverty humiliation and despair had little effect on public opinion and policy racialised immigration acts were passed throughout the 60s the poor wogs were also repeatedly put in their place by the police the media and politicians a tory candidate in powell s own stomping ground the west midlands won his election in 1964 with the campaign slogan if you want a nigger for a neighbour vote labour still those accustomed to lording it over dark skinned natives in the outposts of empire could not be appeased if as naipaul wrote to be english in india was to be larger than life then to be english in multiracial england after 1945 was to know a devastating loss of manliness decolonisation had been outrageous enough for powell who had hoped as late as 1951 for churchill to reconquer his great love india the appearance on english streets of dangerous savages against whom englishness had been defined on the imperial frontier was just too much the racial hierarchy in which he had forged his self was in danger of recalling the outbreak of virulent prejudice against jewish immigrants of the period 1890 1905 as he put it in his 1968 rivers of blood speech quoting an unnamed quite ordinary person in this country in 15 or 20 years time the black man will have the whip hand over the white man there was also something intolerable about the fact that imperialism had become if not a source of shame and embarrassment then a subject for comedy and satire among a younger generation summed up by the album cover of the beatles sgt pepper s lonely hearts club band upstart darkies and cheekily androgynous liverpudlians turned the 1960s into a hellish time for powell view image in fullscreen enoch powell speaking at the 1968 conservative party conference in blackpool photograph dennis hart anl rex shutterstock what sort of people do we think we are he thundered in 1967 one self pitying answer was a nation of ditherers the following year powell mutated into a ventriloquist for the silent majority members of the white working class who worried about immigration and were denounced for their honesty as racist and ignored by academics journalists politicians and parties in a classic sleight of hand of intellectual demagoguery the former professor of ancient greek claimed to be only articulating plain truths and commonsense that decent ordinary people bullied by a politically correct establishment did not dare express the usual temptation to hold foreigners and immigrants responsible for decline and stagnation was strong in england as postwar economic growth tapered off in kamala markandaya s outstanding recently republished novel the nowhere man 1972 which is set in the weeks around powell s speech in april 1968 a white londoner reduced to living with his wife s mother is greatly relieved to discover that black people are to blame for his luckless existence a great light bursts upon him as he receives powell s newly respectable wisdom they came in hordes occupied all the houses filled the hospital beds and their offspring took all the places in schools writing in 1970 the journalist paul foot pointed out all that has changed is that new scapegoats must be found for the homelessness the bad hospital conditions and the overcrowded schools political theorist tom nairn cautioned however against the then common tendency to dismiss powell as a posh race baiter or a moustached blast from the imperial past nairn pointed out that powell turning his back on an irretrievably lost empire had set out to construct a post imperial english nationalism with a mass base the problem with english identity always was that it consisted of little more than a theatrical performance of brute power abroad by men of the imperial ruling class it had lacked any broad content at home notwithstanding orwell s infusions of socialism and his belated patriotism more ambitiously and successfully than orwell powell was now forging a native english genius at home by defining it initially at least against emasculating foreigners nairn predicted a long term future for powellism which he wrote in 1970 actively stirs up conflict instead of conspiring to stifle or ignore it and in an existential crisis can pull the whole of the official structure of british politics in his direction in retrospect powell himself charted the high english road to powellism as he invested his zeal for stark antagonism in ulster unionism neoliberalism and finally europhobia belonging to the common market he wrote in 1975 spells living death the abandonment of all prospect of national rebirth the end of any possibility of resurgence view image in fullscreen school children playing together in southall london in 1972 photograph tony henshaw alamy stock photo a very different destiny for england which did not involve quacks vending pills for imperial era virility was always likely the possibilities lay in its multi racial experience something genuinely new in england since orwell s time some of the early arrivals were deeply damaged by it such as naipaul who escaped from the humiliations of wog hood into the company of those gratified by his scorn for wogs but many others came to attest to the potential of much more fluid post imperial identities i am an englishman born and bred almost the protagonist karim amir declares in hanif kureishi s the buddha of suburbia 1990 yet it was significantly powellism that steadily built up to its present political apotheosis in brexit through the thatcher blair years of deregulation and privatisation a hardening political consensus against immigration a tabloidised culture of journalism and demented tory eu baiting all assisted by the propaganda empire of an australian media tycoon almost as committed to a politics of xenophobia as his

diana died and the millennium dome began construction now seems a timely meditation on the fate of english identity englishness had descended deeper into parody throughout the 80s and 90s as a sloane

intellectual entrepreneur emerged during these decades ranging from st george flag manufacturers to churchill fanboys hectically retailing englishness and elaborating powellism in highbrow as well as lowbrow modes roger scruton the philosopher and author of england an elegy took up powell s lament about the despoliation of england giving it a neo pastoralist orientation scruton who shared powell s ancestry in northern england s lower middle class reinvented himself as a fox hunting squire as prone to defend public schools from his own labour voting father s resentment as to sneer at the people

americans succumbed to this imperial chic as well and made it more lucrative emerging just in time to cash in on empire mania banana republic s range of khaki colonial wear offered an opportunity to vicariously quell in jodhpurs and pith helmets the mutinous natives of sind and punjab in this sense those british chancers who later crossed the atlantic to exhort americans to re establish empire

tether that powellism would become hegemonic tom nairn predicted in 1970 healing wounded english pride with reactionary balm and appealing to the perfectly justified national feeling of frustration and anger more importantly because this feeling is so inarticulate and so divorced from the genteel cliches of the establishment powellism could suggest convincingly that something is profoundly wrong

climb to the sunny uplands of empire 2 0 like powell he presents himself as the saviour of england s matchless destiny against the ditherers and election rhetoric notwithstanding he shares powell s and the brexiters conviction that a higher dose of deregulation and privatisation will make england great again more disingenuously than powell he ridicules the piccaninnies as well as the aliens in black letterboxes and reaches out to the home counties colonels with promises to lock up swarthy criminals and throw away the key there should be no mistaking the neo fascistic cults of unity and potency he promotes and the insidious forms they assume in england s tabloidised media in ballard s last novel kingdom come 2006 which drew inspiration from robert o paxton s classic book the anatomy of fascism english nationalism turns sadistically against those powell stigmatised as hostile aliens however violent racism which has exploded in recent years is not nearly as sinister as the steady hardening of powellite verities into bien pensant opinion centrist dads as much as unteachable brexiters are likely to invoke his much victimised silent majority of ordinary decent men dispossessed by immigrants and then gagged by politically correct academics and journalists thus as simon jenkins recently stated in the guardian brexit was about how far britons can define and protect the character of where they live with brexiters in the ascendant politically as well as culturally the triumph of powellism is complete but we may be looking at an instance to borrow a term from the bush administration of catastrophic success for powellism remains in its moment of hegemony a symptom of rather than a cure for the seemingly insoluble crisis that orwell diagnosed the dwindling material basis of an ex imperialist country that is unable to break in a globalised world with its antique assumptions of power and self sufficiency and whose fundamentally cynical bagehotian mode of politics in which the will of the few was passed off as the will of the many is broken unable to innovate and deal with change or defuse the anger of those victimised for so long by social and economic inequity the life of nations powell argued no less than that of men is lived largely in the imagination but nations that are too extravagantly imagined eventually pay a steep price for their system of self delusions postcolonial india turns on itself in fury and frustration as its dream of power and glory explodes england s post imperial self reckoning feels harsher largely because it has been postponed for so long and the memories of power and glory are so ineradicable in the meantime the most important elections of our lifetime approach and as orwell warned a generation of the unteachable is hanging upon us like a necklace of corpses
even as washington is mired in political infighting we have to admit that texas rep bill flores r bryan has a point when he said last week the best thing that the folks in this capitol building can do is to give the american people the usmca as a christmas present flores along with a bipartisan group of 16 other members of congress from texas held a news conference last week outside the u s capitol urging their fellow lawmakers to ratify the united states mexico canada agreement usmca the trade deal expected to replace the 25 year old north american free trade agreement nafta which president trump has famously called the worst deal ever advertisement there s no doubt that after a quarter century nafta was due for updates and the progress on labor environmental and security protections should be welcomed on both sides of the aisle but what s often overlooked is that nafta largely due to pushback from texas politicians manufacturers business owners farmers and ranchers remains in effect until the usmca is ratified advertisement that s crucial for economic growth in texas and across the u s opinion get smart opinions on the topics north texans care about sign up or with google facebook by signing up you agree to our terms of service and privacy policy as rep henry cuellar d laredo pointed out last week alongside his fellow members of the texas congressional delegation every day there s more than 1 7 billion in trade between the u s and mexico that s over 1 million every single minute on a state by state basis texas is by far the biggest exporter to mexico and is second only to michigan in exports to canada impressively and as a testament to the ingenuity and hard work of our men and women in the lone star state texas alone exported more than 137 billion to mexico and canada last year advertisement by contrast after taking office president trump immediately pulled the u s out of the trans pacific partnership tpp a move we saw as a mistake and still believe lessens u s leverage in trade negotiations with china that fact that trump was dissuaded from pulling out of nafta before the usmca was negotiated and soon we hope enacted has been crucial to continued economic growth in our state and others the president s trade war with china on the other hand has pummeled manufacturers farmers and ranchers across the country as bloomberg reported last month more than 30 states stretching from florida to alaska suffered double digit drops in merchandise exports to china through september of this year sales to the asian nation fell 39 in texas where oil and gas products make up the largest export to that country advertisement but as we ve written in the past no one is getting hit as hard by the ongoing trade war as those in the agriculture industry so we were pleased when the president recently signed bilateral trade agreements with japan that lower tariffs on farm and industrial goods as well as digital trade such as software announcing that japan would open its markets to 7 billion in u s farm products including beef pork wheat and cheese trump declared the pact a huge victory for america s farmers ranchers and growers advertisement that may be so but we would also point out as have japanese officials that this victory could have been won much earlier had the u s not pulled out of the multilateral tpp which has similar deals for its 11 members moreover unlike the tpp the u s japan bilateral trade pact does not contain deals on fish rice or forestry products neither does it affect trade in automobiles or parts between the two countries the u s it should be pointed out still does not have a comprehensive bilateral trade agreement with japan and despite the impressive jobs numbers last month exporters in manufacturing and farming continue to get hammered by the ongoing trade war with china advertisement nevertheless trump now says he has no deadline for striking a trade deal with china and he says it might make more sense to wait until after the election next november we agree with the president that after this much pain any deal with china has got to be right but we would also encourage the president to give america s farmers and manufacturers an early christmas present by striking a deal perhaps shortly after congress passes the usmca that will end china s crippling tariffs finally in the spirit of the season we would ask that the president not go forward with his administration s threatened 100 tariffs on french wine and cheese and would remind him of the wisdom of the 1976 nobel laureate milton friedman who said paraphrasing the 19th century economist henry george in time of war we blockade our enemies in order to prevent them from getting goods from us in time of peace we do to ourselves by tariffs what we do to our enemy in time of war
trump s trade war is losing not gaining support paul krugman wrote this week in his column why is trump a tariff man so why does the president avoid making the deals that might end this perpetual state of economic uncertainty in a word freedom tariffs let him exercise unconstrained power rewarding his friends and punishing his enemies krugman continued readers had questions other than tariffs how could the united states encourage other countries to adopt better trade practices what s the effect on foreign policy relations could electing a new administration reverse damage any silver lining is a long way off according to krugman to really get back on track we d need a defeat not just of trump but also of trumpism which would take multiple elections he wrote in response to one reader

so high fiscal policy could emerge as the best way to provide economic stability raising questions about how the bank of canada should interact with the finance department it seems certain that digital currencies will go mainstream soon central banks will have to decide whether they will lead that charge or if private companies such as facebook inc can be trusted to do it political considerations will arise the trudeau government surely would love to appoint a woman and none of the nine governors to date has been french canadian the bank of canada s all white mostly male governing council certainly would benefit from some diversity but the primary attribute should be an openness to dramatic change we may need a governor who is willing to challenge the status quo of

by just about any metric this is the best job market since the late 1990s the economy has been adding jobs for 110 straight months a record streak jobs are plentiful unemployment is at a half century low and the unemployment rate for african americans hispanics asians and americans with less than a high school education are all at the lowest levels since the labor department began keeping track there s a lot to cheer but one of the lingering black marks on this strong jobs picture is why wages aren t growing like they did in the late 1990s when yearly wage growth routinely topped 4 the latest monthly report card on jobs came out friday from the labor department and shows that the average worker s pay known as average hourly earnings is up 3 1 in the past year it s a pretty good number but it s nowhere near where it was before many hoped this would be the year wages really accelerated after all business leaders have been complaining for months they can t find enough workers both highly skilled and not to fill roles and the natural response to that is usually to bump up pay but wage growth peaked in february at 3 4 and has pulled back a bit since then puzzling economists from late 2017 through late 2018 it looked like wage growth was picking up that ended wage growth has been backsliding this year tweeted economist heidi shierholz senior economist at the left leaning economic policy institute the white house likes to point out that the wage picture looks even better for working class folks what they mean by that is workers in nonmanager roles are actually experiencing faster wage growth than supervisors a welcome trend to many advertising skeptics continue to claim that the u s economy has run out of steam time and time again they re proven wrong said tomas philipson acting head of president donald trump s council of economic advisers wages for nonsupervisors are growing at just shy of 3 7 according to the latest data through november that s better than for workers overall but even that figure lags the trend from the late 1990s it s about half a point less than much of 1997 98 as well as 2006 07 and there s concern that this metric is also starting to pull back a bit economists keep debating what the heck is going on some point to the decline of union membership and the lack of bargaining power for workers now versus in the past even beyond unions there s growing evidence in many cities and towns of a shrinking number of big employers able to control wages in the area and keep them lower it s a phenomenon in economics known as monopsony which is when there is only one buyer similar to a monopoly which is when there is only one seller others point out that workers today are interested in more than just hourly pay they want better benefits and more flexible work schedules and some surveys indicate workers are willing to accept lower pay or more modest pay increases in exchange for more time off or the ability to work remotely still others point to the cost of living inflation has been very low since the great recession staying below 2 a year while rent and health care costs continue to rise for many gas groceries and other goods have not risen much in price for most some say wages do not need to rise as much if inflation remains low the latest annual inflation rate was 1 8 but inflation was well below 2 in 1998 a year when wages were around 4 what s clear is that the stock market is at record highs and many companies are having another very profitable year yet the share of the economic pie going to workers remains at basically a 70 year low and it does not show any signs of rebounding even in a hot job market one thing that really troubles me is the pace of wage growth workers are getting a smaller cut of what we produce than they used to tweeted betsey stevenson associate professor of economics at the university of michigan everyone thought that a strong labor market would help change that but worker s share compared to profits of gdp remains stubbornly low

increase in november that fell well short of a forecast of 140k on the trade front the pendulum swung on wednesday however with talks of a deal ahead of the 15th december supporting riskier assets story continues through the 2nd half of the week the weekly jobless figures impressed ahead of the november labour market figures on friday also positive on thursday was a narrowing in the trade deficit and a rise in factory orders it wasn t enough for a greenback recovery however while the u s equity markets bought into the hope of a phase 1 agreement the fx world thought otherwise once more

upward revisions both were still down from october however advertisement advertisement through the 2nd half of the week economic data was limited to november house prices figures while house prices got a boost in november there was no material impact on the pound throughout the week the uk election opinion polls continued to be the key driver the tories found support back on the rise with less than one week to go the markets are now betting on a tory victory which led the pound to levels not seen since back in may the pound rallied by 1 66 to 1 3140 in the week for the ftse100 the stronger pound and negative sentiment towards trade weighed heavily on the index in the 1st half of the week a friday recovery was not enough to reverse the earlier losses the index ended the week down by 1 45 out of the eurozone it was a busy week on the economic data front advertisement advertisement economic data included private sector pmi numbers out of italy and spain and finalized numbers for france germany and the eurozone the stats were skewed to the positive with upward revisions to french german and eurozone manufacturing numbers a plus on wednesday service sector activity was also better than had been anticipated the eurozone s composite was revised up from 50 3 to 50 5 this was still down from october s 50 6 however as manufacturing sector activity continued to drag while the stats

french goods advertisement advertisement in the 2nd half of the week the stats were skewed to the negative germany factory orders and industrial production tumbled in october with eurozone retail sales also in decline the disappointing numbers paint a gloomy picture at the start of the 4th quarter and will be of concern for the ecb on the economic growth front the only good news was the fact

further pressure on the aussie dollar early in the day advertisement advertisement the economy grew by 0 4 quarter on quarter slowing from 0 5 in the 2nd quarter negatively skewed figures had a muted impact however as monetary policy and a slide in the greenback provided the upside the rba held back from any chatter of a rate cut in the last meeting of the year driving the aussie back to 0 68 levels against the greenback negative sentiment towards trade in the early part of the week had also pinned the u s dollar back supporting 3 consecutive days in the green for the aussie ahead of a

disappointed in october with sales staling trade data also come in softer with the trade surplus narrowing from a 7 18bn to a 4 52bn ultimately a more hawkish than expected rba in the 1st half and risk appetite in the 2nd half supported the weekly gain it certainly wasn t the data for the kiwi dollar it was a particularly quiet week on the economic colander there were no stats to provide direction for the kiwi which continued to find support market sentiment towards trade and rbnz monetary policy fueled the upside in the week a shift in the rbnz s stance on bank capital requirements

numbers on thursday and november employment figures on friday it was a mixed bag for the loonie while trade and ivey pmi numbers impressed employment figures were woeful leading to a heavy reversal on

while in the united states in between wedding festivities i also had a chance to catch up with us politics besides the impeachment inquiry being conducted by the house of representatives against president trump the other important matter on the political landscape is the primary campaign in the democratic party to choose the candidate to contest the 2020 presidential election the democratic party is essentially a moderate to a centre left coalition that includes centrist moderate candidates like former vice president joe biden and hard left candidates like senator elizabeth warren and senator bernie sanders the latter being a self avowed democratic socialist most candidates in the democratic race agree on most issues the issues that are common with some small variation include a guaranteed living minimal wage support for trade unions progressive taxation gun control abortion rights a humane immigration policy and affordable healthcare for all citizens it is on the issue of healthcare that the biggest divide between centrist and hard left candidates like senators sanders and warren occurs both sanders and warren support universal healthcare provided free for all citizens by the federal government they also call this initiative medicare for all medicare is the us federally funded programme that provides healthcare to all us citizens above the age of sixty five medicare costs much less than private health insurances but it is not free so medicare for all is unlikely to be really free either more importantly the cost of a universal healthcare programme run by the federal government in the us is estimated to cost between 25 and 35 trillion dollars over a ten year period to put this in perspective just one trillion dollars would pay off all of pakistan s external and internal debt as well as fund all of cpec and a few major dams too the us supporters of universal healthcare point out that all modern developed countries provide guaranteed and free or heavily subsidised healthcare to all citizens through different mechanisms and in these countries healthcare is considered a right and not a privilege the us is an exception in the developed world and it has almost one in ten citizens without any health insurance and if we include legal and illegal immigrants the number goes up however any person that turns up in a hospital emergency room will be treated in the state of new jersey where i practised cardiac and thoracic surgery for twenty years uninsured patients were treated and the state provided hospitals some reimbursement as charity care doctors taking care of charity patients of course did not get any money a universal healthcare programme run by the federal government in the us is estimated to cost between 25 and 35 trillion dollars over a ten year period to put this in perspective just one trillion dollars would pay off all of pakistan s external and internal debt as well as fund all of cpec and a few major dams too that brings me to the idea of free or almost free healthcare for all in pakistan at least in the punjab where i have worked in the public sector for a number of years i know that an infrastructure exists that is capable of providing heavily subsidised universal healthcare for all comers from basic health units bhus all the way up to our tertiary care teaching hospitals we have the capability to provide all levels of healthcare to all citizens the sad thing is that for all the years since this system was put in place it has never been developed to its full potential the recent attempts at privatising parts of this system cannot really work since people that work in these facilities are government employees and cannot work for the government as well as a private non government entity at the same time there has been much talk that the present government wants to privatise our major teaching hospitals i do not even need to read the law against which the doctors were striking recently but having worked in mayo hospital i can say one thing for sure no sane business entity is ever going to take over this hospital and try to run it as a for profit institution almost fifteen years ago king edward medical college kemc became a university kemu until that time the budgetary control of the affiliated hospitals including mayo hospital was under the principal of kemc however when ke became a university the vice chancellor vc lost that power over the affiliated hospitals the medical superintendents ms of the affiliated hospitals including that of the mayo hospital were appointed by the health department and were answerable only to their bureaucratic masters during my tenure as professor and chair of the department of cardiac surgery in kemu i also functioned as the head of cardiac surgery in mayo hospital once during a discussion with the ms of mayo hospital i was reminded only partly in jest that i was the chief consultant for cardiac surgery but still only a consultant i was also informed that the person actually in charge of my hospital department was the senior registrar who of course reported directly to the ms whatever happens as long as the doctors as well as all the other staff of our public hospitals are employed and paid by the government there can be no semi or partial privatisation of the public healthcare sector the point i am trying to make is that the government run health sector is capable of providing good quality subsidised medical care to most people if only it can be properly developed a few years ago i asked a senior medical bureaucrat about the medical facilities like the bhus and the rural health centres rhc he said that a third of them are fully functional a third are non functional and the rest are somewhere in between universal healthcare is relatively expensive though nothing even close to the trillions of dollars mentioned above however it is possible to provide a reasonably appropriate level of universal healthcare to people living in the punjab if the existing networks of public medical facilities are improved literally from the ground up these healthcare facilities from the bhu all the way up to major tertiary care teaching hospitals can only be improved if the people that form the backbone of these institutions are empowered and that means that the doctors the nurses and the paramedical staff must be paid a decent living wage and provided a proper autonomous service structure the sad truth is that the so called permanent bureaucracy that runs this country and has so far run it into the ground will never be willing to allow medical professionals to function beyond the bureaucrats control the proof of what i say lies in an interesting discussion i had with a former health secretary of the punjab who really had no idea what an open heart operation actually entailed and yet he tried to convince me that he actually knew more about open heart surgery than i did comically sad was the fact that he actually believed himself it is my opinion that until the person s running a major teaching hospital can tell the difference between a positron emission tomography scan computerised axial tomography scan magnetic resonance imaging scan and a mimosa vivacia scan they should not be let anywhere near a major medical facility except as a patient the writer has served as professor and chairman

preceding the announcement by the continuing shareholders of the initial proposal capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein have the meanings ascribed to them in the circular the signa transaction and the initial going private proposal in connection with the company s strategic objective to simplify its retail strategy and unlock the value of its real estate the company completed the merger of the retail operations of hbc europe and signa s karstadt warenhaus gmbh in the fourth quarter of 2018 after completing the transaction given the deteriorating state of the european retail business the need for significant incremental capital contributions to fund material operating losses in the european business and the continued need to focus on core operations and strengthen the company s balance sheet the company concluded it was important to pursue a complete exit from the european retail market and fully monetize its european real estate in and around late february 2019 representatives of hbc including mr baker and mr putnam commenced exploratory discussions with representatives of signa about a potential sale to signa of hbc s remaining 50 interest in its european real estate joint venture and 49 99 interest in its european retail joint venture the signa transactions shortly after the commencement of exploratory discussions with signa mr baker considered the viability of hbc using proceeds of the potential signa transactions to complete a buyback of hbc shares or fund other liquidity opportunities for shareholders mr baker also commenced exploratory discussions with the other continuing shareholders as to whether proceeds from the potential signa transactions could provide a portion of the financing for a potential privatization transaction involving hbc and thereby a liquidity opportunity for other hbc shareholders such exploratory discussions included among other things what levels of debt financing and leverage would be appropriate and what other sources of financing could be available on acceptable terms it was determined that without proceeds from the potential signa transactions it was highly unlikely that the debt capital markets would be independently available to support a privatization transaction on terms that would be sustainable for the company mr baker commenced such discussions with representatives of each of fabric luxembourg holdings s a r l fabric hanover investments luxembourg s a hanover and abrams capital management l p abrams on or about march 5 2019 mr baker together with certain

continuing challenges hbc faces the continuing shareholders engaged from time to time in discussions regarding the business on or about march 25 2019 prior to a regularly scheduled board meeting on march 27 2019 and with discussions of the potential signa transactions still fluid mr baker and mr putnam informed mr leith hbc s lead independent director about mr baker s desire to evaluate a potential privatization transaction together with the other continuing shareholders all of which was contingent on proceeding with the signa transactions which as of such date were still being negotiated without any certainty of outcome mr leith consented to mr baker exploring such a transaction and sharing certain limited financial information with the continuing shareholders on a confidential basis mr leith also provided consent to the use by mr baker of the company s historical transaction counsel in connection with that initial evaluation and was advised that rbc and bofa securities would be financial advisors to mr baker on march 27 2019 the board established the special committee at that time consisting of messrs leith chair pommen rotman and rubel each an independent director to supervise the review and evaluation of the company s strategies and options with respect to i the company s lord taylor business unit and ii its european real estate joint venture and european retail joint venture and real estate assets which were the subject of the potential signa transactions the special committee s mandate included oversight and supervision of the

came in ahead forecasts with 24 economic indicators coming up short of forecast 5 stats were in line with forecasts in the week looking at the numbers 35 of the stats reflected an upward trend from previous figures of the remaining 24 3 stats reflected a deterioration from previous sentiment towards trade and disappointing stats out of the u s pressured the greenback after the thanksgiving break that was before labor market figures that brought to an end a run of 5 days in the red for the dollar 4 consecutive days in the red in the week left the greenback down by 0 58 to 97 700 for the week out of the u s it was a busy week economic in the 1st half of the week data included private sector pmis and adp nonfarm employment figures for november it was a double whammy for the dollar with both the ism manufacturing and non manufacturing pmis coming in weaker that combined with negative chatter on trade in the 1st half of the week left the greenback in the deep red on wednesday the adp s nonfarm figures didn t help with the adp reporting just a 67k increase in november that fell well short of a forecast of 140k on the trade front the pendulum swung on wednesday however with talks of a deal ahead of the 15th december supporting riskier assets through the 2nd half of the week the weekly jobless figures impressed ahead of the november labour market figures on friday also positive on thursday was a narrowing in the trade deficit and a rise in factory orders it wasn t enough for a greenback recovery however while the u s equity markets bought into the hope of a phase 1 agreement the fx world thought otherwise once more on friday it was an altogether different story however as nonfarm payrolls and wage growth gave the dollar a much needed boost nonfarm payrolls surged by 266k well ahead of a forecast of 186k with wages growing by 3 1 for nonfarm payrolls that was the largest monthly rise in a 304k jump in january of this year it was also the first over 200k rise since june s 224k if the dollar was looking for additional support december s prelim michigan consumer sentiment and expectations indexes also wowed late in the day in the equity markets the dow fell by 0 13 with the nasdaq down 0 10 the s p bucked the trend rising by 0 16 a labor market fueled rally on friday reversed heavy losses from earlier in the week out of the uk it was also a relatively busy 1st half of the week on the economic calendar finalized private sector pmis for november provided support while retail sales figures delivered a dismal picture while both the manufacturing and services pmis saw upward revisions both were still down from october however through the 2nd half of the week economic data was limited to november house prices figures while house prices got a boost in november there was no material impact on the pound throughout the week the uk election opinion polls continued to be the key driver the tories found support back on the rise with less than one week to go the markets are now betting on a tory victory which led the pound to levels not seen since back in may the pound rallied by 1 66 to 1 3140 in the week for the ftse100 the stronger pound and negative sentiment towards trade weighed heavily on the index in the 1st half of the week a friday recovery was not enough to reverse the earlier losses the index ended the week down by 1 45 out of the eurozone it was a busy week on the economic data front economic data included private sector pmi numbers out of italy and spain and finalized numbers for france germany and the eurozone the stats were skewed to the positive with upward revisions to french german and eurozone manufacturing numbers a plus on wednesday service sector activity was also better than had been anticipated the eurozone s composite was revised up from 50 3 to 50 5 this was still down from october s 50 6 however as manufacturing sector activity continued to drag while the stats were skewed to the positive side it was the negative sentiment towards trade on monday and tuesday that provided the eur upside this came in spite of the u s administration threatening tariffs on all french goods in the 2nd half of the week the stats were skewed to the negative germany factory orders and industrial production tumbled in october with eurozone retail sales also in decline the disappointing numbers paint a gloomy picture at the start of the 4th quarter and will be of concern for the ecb on the economic growth front the only good news was the fact that the eurozone s gdp numbers were in line with 2nd estimates for the week the eur rose by 0 38 to 1 1060 for the european major indexes the cac40 led the way down falling by 0 56 the eurostoxx600 and dax30 fell by 0 02 and 0 53 respectively the losses coming in spite of a bounce back on friday elsewhere it was a bullish week for the aussie dollar and the kiwi dollar the aussie dollar rallied by 1 15 to 0 6841 with the kiwi dollar up by 2 24 to 0 6566 for the aussie dollar it was a busy week for the aussie dollar in the 1st half of the week economic data included gross company profit figures for the 3rd quarter november manufacturing and 3rd quarter gdp numbers joining the eu the uk and the u s the manufacturing sector contracted in november with the index falling from 51 6 to 48 1 gross company operating profits were also dire with profits falling by 0 8 in the 3rd quarter in the 2nd quarter profits had risen by 4 5 on wednesday gdp figures added further pressure on the aussie dollar early in the day the economy grew by 0 4 quarter on quarter slowing from 0 5 in the 2nd quarter negatively skewed figures had a muted impact however as monetary policy and a slide in the greenback provided the upside the rba held back from any chatter of a rate cut in the last meeting of the year driving the aussie back to 0 68 levels against the greenback negative sentiment towards trade in the early part of the week had also pinned the u s dollar back supporting 3 consecutive days in the green for the aussie ahead of a thursday pullback in the 2nd half of the week economic data included october retail sales and trade data while the rba refrained from talking about rate cuts retail sales disappointed in october with sales staling trade data also come in softer with the trade surplus narrowing from a 7 18bn to a 4 52bn ultimately a more hawkish than expected rba in the 1st half and risk appetite in the 2nd half supported the weekly gain it certainly wasn t the data for the kiwi dollar it was a particularly quiet week on the economic colander there were no stats to provide direction for the kiwi which continued to find support market sentiment towards trade and rbnz monetary policy fueled the upside in the week a shift in the rbnz s stance on bank capital requirements also fueled the rally which led to 7 consecutive days in the green for the loonie it was a relatively busy but important week for the loonie economic data included october trade and november ivey pmi numbers on thursday and november employment figures on friday it was a mixed bag for the loonie while trade and ivey pmi numbers impressed employment figures were woeful leading to a heavy reversal on friday in spite of the mixed stats it was ultimately the boc that delivered the boost in the week in the previous meeting members had been cautious over the economic outlook which was in contrast to the latest meeting this time around the boc saw the economy stabilizing the loonie rose by 0 20 to c 1 3255 against the greenback a 0 61 slide on friday limiting the upside for the japanese yen it was a relatively quiet week on the data front with stats limited to finalized november private sector pmis 3rd quarter capital spending and october household spending figures in the 1st half of the week private sector pmi figures did little to impress while capital spending jumped by 7 1 in the 3rd quarter in the 2nd quarter capital spending had risen by 1 9 the stats had a muted impact however a slump in household spending did influence at the end of the week however household spending slid by 11 5 month on month in october with sales sliding by 5 1 year on year with trade terms continuing to adversely affect the japanese economy the latest household spending data could be the stat that forces the boj into action sentiment towards trade and demand for the safe havens ultimately drove the yen to 108 levels in the week the japanese yen rose by 0 83 to 108 58 against the u s dollar out of china it was a relatively quiet week on the economic data front with private sector pmis for november in focus a pickup in service sector activity provided support for riskier assets early in the week this was in spite of negative sentiment towards a u s china trade agreement from the weekend the nbs numbers set the mood going into the week the nbs manufacturing pmi rose from 49 3 to 50 2 with the services pmi rising from 52 8 to 54 4 aligned with the nbs

maybe we need more conspiracies not fewer i mean if a conspiracy is either good or bad depending on the context why not i think a little more long term calculated thinking might do us all well maybe instead of wishing for some indeterminate career move to fall in your lap you should be laying the groundwork and planning it yourself you probably aren t going to be where you want tomorrow but you might be surprised where you can get to in five years or what if you finally decided to get in shape no telling everyone about it you just went to the gym and changed your life perhaps we have too few conspiracies not too many too little scheming rather than too much what would happen if more people took up plotting coordinating how to eliminate what they believe are negative forces and obstacles and tried to wield power in an attempt to change the world we could almost always use more boldness and less complacency we could use less telegraphing of our intentions or ambitions and see what secrecy patience and planning might accomplish we could use a little more craziness and disruption even from the people we disagree with ryan holiday conspiracy

everything to know about the april 8 eclipse in atlantic canada saltwire eclipse saltwire by lucia mutikani washington reuters u s job growth increased by the most in 10 months in november as the healthcare industry boosted hiring and production workers at general motors returned to work after a strike the strongest sign yet the economy is in no danger of stalling the unemployment rate ticked back down to its lowest level in nearly half a century and wage gains remained near their strongest in a decade the labor department s closely watched monthly employment report showed on friday related stories the numbers suggest consumers will keep the longest economic expansion in history now in its 11th year chugging along into next year when americans will decide whether to re elect president donald trump the report added to other fairly upbeat data on the trade deficit housing and orders for big ticket goods together the improving data appear to validate the federal reserve s decision in october to signal no further interest rate cuts are needed for now the u s central bank cut rates three times this year starting in july when it reduced borrowing costs for the first time since 2008 u s central bank policymakers are expected to highlight the economy s resilience when they meet on dec 10 11 though trade tensions continue to reverberate in the background this was a strong report with a solid rise in payrolls another drop in the unemployment rate and decent growth in hourly earnings said chris low chief economist at fhn financial in new york the fed will see this as clear vindication of their decision to stop cutting rates nonfarm payrolls increased by 266 000 jobs last month lifted by the gain of 60 200 healthcare workers the most since march and increased hiring at restaurants and bars the government s survey of establishments showed manufacturing recouped all the 43 000 positions lost in october but colder than normal temperatures in november curbed hiring at construction sites and helped to sink mining payrolls the largest increase in payrolls since january pushed job growth well above its monthly average of 180 000 this year economists polled by reuters had forecast payrolls rising by 180 000 jobs in november the economy created 41 000 more jobs in september and october than previously estimated even discounting the roughly 46 000 gm returnees employment growth exceeded 200 000 jobs last month the robust payroll gains suggest the trump administration s 17 month trade war with china which has plunged manufacturing into recession has not yet spilled over to the broader economy some economists said this could buy the trump administration more time as it negotiates a phase one trade deal with china top white house economic adviser larry kudlow said on friday the dec 15 deadline remained in place for a new round of u s tariffs on chinese goods set to kick in adding there s no arbitrary deadline on trade talks the report alleviates pressure on the trump administration to make a trade deal with china giving negotiators more leverage to push for a harder line said daniel zhao a senior economist at glassdoor in san francisco the dollar strengthened against a basket of currencies snapping a five day losing streak u s treasury prices fell stocks on wall street rallied after a roller coaster week steady wage gains the u s china trade spat has bruised business confidence and undercut capital expenditure tipping manufacturing into recession the magnitude of last month s increase in payrolls is at odds with other labor market data job openings are near a 1 1 2 year low small business hiring intentions have softened relative to 2018 and the institute for supply management survey s measure of factory employment has contracted for four straight months while this morning s reading is a definite improvement it does little to explain waning momentum over the past ten months said lindsey piegza chief economist at stifel in chicago it remains to be seen if such strength signals a turning point to more robust hiring patterns though the labor market remains resilient despite the business investment downturn hiring has slowed from last year s average monthly gain of 223 000 because of ebbing demand and a shortage of workers the government has said it could cut job growth for the 12 months through march 2019 by at least 500 000 jobs when it publishes its annual revision next february still job creation is well over the roughly 100 000 jobs per month needed to keep up with growth in the working age population the unemployment rate fell one tenth of a percentage point to 3 5 percent matching september s reading which was the lowest level since december 1969 a broader measure of unemployment which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part time because they cannot find full time employment fell to 6 9 from 7 0 in october the labor force participation rate or the proportion of working age americans who have a job or are looking for one dipped to 63 2 in november from more than a six year high of 63 3 in october average hourly earnings rose seven cents or 0 2 after increasing 0 4 in october in the 12 months through november wages rose 3 1 after advancing 3 2 in october wages were held back by the concentration of hiring in low paying industries average hourly earnings for production and non supervisory workers considered a more reliable wage measure increased 0 3 and were up 3 7 on a year on year basis in november that should keep consumer spending in good shape in the coming months said sarah house a senior economist at wells fargo securities in charlotte north carolina manufacturing employment rebounded by 54 000 jobs in november construction hiring rose by only 1 000 jobs while mining shed 7 000 jobs the leisure and hospitality industry hired 45 000 workers it has added 219 000 jobs over the last four months with about two thirds of the gains at restaurants and bars there were also increases in professional and business services financial activities and transportation and warehousing jobs last month government employment increased by 12 000 jobs editing by alistair bell and paul simao
we need to move away from neoliberalism we have told ourselves a nice story about the economy as we adopted the manchester school and made it into the 20th century model the market became central we renamed it into the neoliberal model we forgot that the economy is far more than just the work sphere or the business cycle i have written about this in the past because part of this is ideology we ignored the centrality of home life to economic life why we have stopped investing in those things that keep home life going we see it with education which we continue to shortchange it was not always this way the launch of sputnik led to a generalized panic the united states lost its technological edge we had to do something part of that something was a massive investment in public education we needed to get our children and young adults ready for what these days is called science technology engineering and mathematics stem for short the russians launched yury gagarin soon after sputnik we knew we were falling behind not only was the national aeronautics and space administration told even ordered to catch up we started to do something else basic and secondary education was prioritized and budgets grew but it was in the area of education that the impact of the sputnik crisis was to be most felt in 1958 the u s congress passed the national defense education act in an effort to ensure that the highly trained individuals would be available to help america compete with the soviet union in scientific and technical fields in order to achieve this goal the act made provisions for loans and grants to institutions of higher learning who wanted to improve their mathematics science and foreign language programs of course this made perfect sense there was no point setting up research and development bodies if there would be no trained personnel to run them consequently the national science foundation nsf was revamped and its budget drastically increased in 1959 congress appropriated 134 million dollars for the foundation almost a hundred million dollars more than the previous year by 1968 the foundation was receiving about half a billion dollars a year in federal funds in fiscal 2012 the nsf had a budget of some 7 billion dollars and provides the funds for approximately 20 percent of all federally supported basic research conducted in colleges and universities throughout america in some fields such as mathematics and computer science the nsf is the major provider of federal support at all events in the decade between 1955 and 1965 federal expenditure on research and development rose from 2 7 billion dollars to more than 15 billion dollars as old bodies such as the nsf and new ones such as nasa competed to fund research of one kind or another but it was not just the government that was putting in new resources into education the system itself was enthusiastic in its determination to take a giant leap forward for practitioners of education in america were by no means sanguine at the thought of being left behind by their soviet counterparts james b conant a former president of harvard university carried out a detailed two year study of american high schools with the support of the carnegie foundation in order to ensure that all gifted children were being properly motivated to pursue higher education and in 1960 harvard embarked on its biggest fund raising up till then for the purpose of reforming its whole approach to education the campaign raised 82 5 million dollars less than a decade later subsidies went to public colleges and universities this is the origin of well funded systems like the university of california and the california state system these subsidies allowed students to attend colleges and not go into massive debts in fact most students who graduated from college did so without debt or very little debt compare this to the present we are in the midst of a planetary emergency we need people trained in the stem fields this is not because the russians launched a satellite into space or beat us into manned no the planet is in the midst of a crisis and we may face extinction however we are cutting educational budgets at all levels from pre k to graduate schools states and the federal government have a problem finding the money teachers are facing pay cuts and benefit cuts across the board the crisis is worse in some states than others but it s a crisis as a society we decided that the market should take care of this why many charter schools who can choose their student body are financed with public funds but are run as private organizations these schools also lack in the area of certified teachers it gets worst the current administration is taking this effort to epic levels why science could impinge on the market and its instincts the environmental protection agency is preparing a new measure that will exclude science from its rulemaking according to the new york times the measure would make it more difficult to enact new clean air and water rules because many studies detailing the links between pollution and disease rely on personal health information gathered under confidentiality agreements and unlike a version of the proposal that surfaced in early 2018 this one could apply retroactively to public health regulations already in place in the final analysis it is coming from our faith in the market no matter what it is also a retreat from the role of government which is also part of the economy ultimately it is a product of corporate capture it is a rejection of the science that allowed us to clean this country s waterways it is part of a pattern which also doubts the existence of the climate emergency it is a complete surrender to the market so what happens when we ignore the core economy for starters we see increased insecurity and the costs of certain core services have gone up the transformation of the american economy into a market centric system where education was commoditized happened in the last forty years it creates not just distrust but also insecurity it is one of the reasons behind the precariat then we have other issues that are part of this the efforts to reduce the already paltry safety net is not just an attack on good government it is also a direct affront to the core economy if the elderly for example have no means to take care of themselves it will have a direct effect on the rest of society just as we have some of the most expensive pre k in the world we have a safety net that is dissolving in the name of the market this takes away from the efficiency of workers in the private sector the inequality in pre k also keeps poor parents at home or children are placed with relatives while children of well to do parents go to schools that could cost as much as college this deepens inequality and handicaps most this is problematic because those children show up to school not ready to learn they already are attending substandard schools this is a cost we all pay it is also an early indicator of the school to prison pipeline we also see this with health care we have the most expensive least efficient system in the world people stay at a job to keep their insurance as good or bad as it may be people fear to go to the hospital because there will be a bill to pay and perhaps lose all they have worked for in their lives this makes society sicker and less able to function some in the market charging as much as they can get away with and lobbying politicians to prevent them from imposing measures that would slow down or reverse trends they include things like a maximum price for drugs or being able to negotiate for lower costs on all services we have monetized and put in the hands of the market higher education healthcare basic research we forgot that our success in the 1950s and 60s came from a heavy investment in these areas by the government no the private sector did not build the internet which you are using right now to read this piece that was the department of defense granted arpanet came from a need to survive a first even second nuclear strike but it is the origin of the internet and the information economy nor did the gps system we all use came from the private sector in fact it is still a military system that we civilians use it was the government that invested in the basic science and technology needed to develop this many of the medicines we use today started with basic research at the national institutes of health it was not the private sector that did that so when we are told by the industry that it costs a lot of money to bring new medicines and procedures to market they are correct but a lot of it came from the taxpayer over the last few decades our investment in basic research has gone down these are the trends for the first time in the post world war ii era the federal government no longer funds a majority of the basic research carried out in the united states data from ongoing surveys by the national science foundation nsf show that federal agencies provided only 44 of the 86 billion spent on basic research in 2015 the federal share which topped 70 throughout the 1960s and 70s stood at 61 as recently as 2004 before falling below 50 in 2013 the sharp drop in recent years is the result of two contrasting trends a flattening of federal spending on basic research over the past decade and a significant rise in corporate funding of fundamental science since 2012 the first is a familiar story to most academic scientists who face stiffening competition for federal grants this rise is coming from the pharmaceutical industry it is not just because they can get great profits from new drugs but they can impose intellectual property rights on these avoiding the need to share this makes medicines that much more expensive for much longer when combined with a lack of price controls in the united states this makes it a very good business and we are seeing it with old drugs such as insulin small changes in the drug allow them to patent the drug anew this is one reason insulin continues to rise in cost also things like the epipen originally developed by dod scientists to treat troops during a chemical attack have gone into the stratosphere when it comes to price when americans say that this is capitalism gone astray they have a point this is a system where the regulatory bodies were captured it is also a system where profit is put ahead of human life affecting all spheres in particular the core or household economy basic services are not there labor rights are under attack ultimately because of this the planet is under attack however some people are getting insanely rich this will have negative effects on the overall economy as well as political stability yes when senator elizabeth warren or bernie sanders raised the issue of a wealth tax this is partially what they are addressing we need to rebalance our economy in ways that will redistribute wealth but that will also strengthen the role of government and re regulate industries towards the common good and away from pure profit making we also need deep investment in green economies meaning that subsidies to mature industries the fossil fuel industry will need to go to the green industries we need to survive as a species this is precisely why those who benefited greatly from the centrality of the market above all else are not happy if you made a few billion under the current system higher taxation may cut your wealth growth curve it will not stop under either model but will slow it down think about this how many cars planes and homes can you own how much material stuff can you acquire psychologists have found that people who are extremely wealthy have distorted views several studies have shown that wealth may be at odds with empathy and compassion research published in the journal psychological science found that people of lower economic status were better at reading others facial expressions an important marker of empathy than wealthier people a lot of what we see is a baseline orientation for the lower class to be more empathetic and the upper class to be less study co author michael kraus told time lower class environments are much different from upper class environments lower class individuals have to respond chronically to a number of vulnerabilities and social threats you really need to depend on others so they will tell you if a social threat or opportunity is coming and that makes you more perceptive of emotions they may also develop an addiction to accumulating more money which is a problem one reason why they may feel threatened by a wealth tax it will reduce the speed at which they get that money why they will fight against this maybe even run for office themselves we need to recalibrate and re regulate the economy to make it work better and by regulation i mean change how it works not just who is regulated but we also need to expand government investment in public services including education and healthcare chiefly we must move away from the market as the only way to run the economy

we need industry for the economy of the state amarinder singh said during his interview in an exclusive interview to ndtv punjab chief minister amarinder singh pointed out his government s measures concerning women safety speaking to ndtv s prannoy roy mr singh also said that he s worried about drugs in punjab and that his government has set up a special task force to deal with the drugs menace in the state drugs won t disappear but the situation will become manageable he said here s the full transcript of the interview ndtv i do want to start by admitting to something that i m half bengali half irish born but adopted sardar all my life yes adopted by me i don t know if punjab is happy about that or regretting it i can say as i mentioned the one thing that i used to do best in when i was in school was the bhangra we used to travel around the country with tehmat pug handkerchiefs singing bale bale not bad for a bengali i do also congratulate you on a very important aspect post the pulwama episode i think it s generally agreed that your speeches were by far the best than any politician has ever given on that issue right amount of mystery right amount of aggression it wasn t like overdone in either direction many congratulations on that now one thing there are it s wonderful to see so many potential investors here punjab has been known to be an agricultural state and how are you going to change it how will do for punjab in industry what punjab has done for agriculture and i must say that one of my worries i can see that they spoke to a lot of potential investors and they have some worries so i ll slowly raise those worries like gangsterism border state women s safety going too much with one program all those we ll go into because you need to address their worries as well but first big picture can you do for industry what you did for agriculture amarinder singh let me put it this way when in 1966 the green revolution started punjab was not a glycemic state we never ate rice maybe a little bit of ghee here and there but when the country wanted it within a few years within three to four years we started to change we suddenly produced the rice that the country wanted so when the punjabi gets down to something and if he sees money there and he saw money in and he did it of course there were some negative factors more production more money support by the government led to grain after grain after grain after grain which ended up ruining our soils so i m just trying to tell you the change if there s money in it it ll work and people who never knew how to grow suddenly became great rice farmers so i think the same here with industry industry it s got a different reason i think you know the world has opened up we need it for the economy of the state and we have children who are growing up and on this television every day they see what s happening in the world and they re all looking for going to california or going to some other country in the world in their future we want them to make their future here now general shergill is sitting here he was telling me that the other day he met a jco now in the iit at ropar so you know that s how education is coming up and i think that with the kind of skill development that we are proposing the way the people our youngsters want this job and if we have the right environment and the right avenues for them to find jobs you will find that they will do a great job see we have some issues here which i think people must look at punjab has never had a labour problem three decades we ve never had a strike and in every way the government is doing what it can to you know lay the foundation for a good industrial base we are bringing in we have brought in a new industrial policy and wherever we found weaknesses we plug those and today i think when you look at our new policies and water acts and labour act and whatever else we have done you will see that punjab is a very fine destination from your point of view and for us we will find you will find ready labour in the form of educated youngsters ndtv you say there s no major strikes except one of the worries which we did find that people talk about goondaism and gangsterism in punjab and you know if you re going to invest here you have to worry do you need extra security what about that how are you handling that amarinder singh that is something that is on top of our agenda we don t allow anything like this to happen for instance nearly 1200 goondas are in the jail the truck unions which were full of goondas that we ve abolished ndtv they used to blackmail industrialists right the truck unions amarinder singh absolutely i mean coming from let s say dera bassi to chandigarh they would charge you rs 1000 and from chandigarh to dera bassi rs 5000 i mean these sort of things they were doing because they had the muscle and then we removed that muscle so from these points of view we are doing from our side we are not allowing anything at all the police are very active everyone gets a clear cut instruction if any goonda comes with a weapon he lays it down if he doesn t lay it down he faces the consequences ndtv so what s the phrase in punjabi amarinder singh bande bano nahi ta phir seedhe kar denga de ndtv perfect everything sounds better in punjabi actually no but apart from that one of the repercussions of gangsterism has been security for women women s safety and everybody here is worried about that because people are employing women more and more they are better than men by and large right amarinder singh i think so in fact i was talking to my friend yesterday and i was mentioning i think that the women s performance i was asking him how are they doing and they are all doing very well ndtv what about women safety then amarinder singh see we have allowed women to come work night shifts and whatever else and we have also now put in this new factor that the police we have given police numbers and anybody any women who feels insecure or wants a lift home or something they call that number and a police officer will come pick them her up and drop her home ndtv after 9 at night amarinder singh anytime 24 hours ndtv any women in punjab after 9 and till 6 in morning amarinder singh anytime 24 hours till whatever time she wants suppose at 2 o clock in the morning after night shift and she is not well or something and she wants to go she calls the number and somebody comes and picks her up prannoy if she is surrounded by eve teasers and goondas she can phone and the police will come and take her home ndtv that s fantastic i hope all the other states are listening to that because we did see one minister in another state saying women should not work at night they should stay at home at night and women s reply to that was if men stay at home at night it d a safe country amarinder singh i saw that ndtv so you re saying you re solving two of those problems gangsterism and women s safety the other worry that investors have and i don t want to make this too much of a worry is that you re a border state how are you handling that amarinder singh you know i sometimes wonder what pakistan s policy is because they are engaging everybody around the clock in the south they ve got balochistan and in the west they ve got iran and afghanistan in the north they re engaged with the tribal in the east in the north east they are engaged with us and kashmir so really what is their policy and i don t know what they actually think they are doing they have tried to do a little bit here in punjab but we sorted the problem out so there s no question that ndtv so how d you sort it out amarinder singh well the same things we ve neutralised these groups that we re trying to eliminate we ve taken their weapons we ve arrested the people and we ve got 125 in the lockup ndtv 125 amarinder singh yes in the last two years and since then let me tell you they ve cooled off they know that punjab means business and we re not going to allow anything like this to happen here they have their own problems but that s their problem they don t try to make their problem my problem because i won t allow that and we are very tough on that and we have our first line of defence which is our border security force followed by us which is the second line then behind us is the army and they are very strong in punjab so they won t meddle around with us that i will assure you and when they did try they ve had to face it we told the terror modules lay down your arms or get shot ndtv what s your message to pakistan in punjabi amarinder singh bande bano nahi to phir assi baithe haan ndtv what do you think about imran coming there amarinder singh i think he means well i mean of course the press thought that i was into some major engagement with him when we were driving from the integrated check post to kartarpur sahib ndtv the press media never trust the media amarinder singh i know i know i don t trust the media but they thought i don t know what they were discussing but all we discussed in those six minutes seven minutes was cricket because his grand uncle played for patiala at one time patiala had seven all india camps so we were talking about that sort of thing they thought we were into some sort of big indo pak talk or something like that ndtv you could have taken that opportunity or will you take that opportunity of indo pak trade amarinder singh i would like that i want peace punjab wants peace we don t want any of this messing around with us but you know they should understand this and their army should also understand this that s one side of the story we want peace because you know for another reason i don t think they ll mess around with us in any big way because they ve brought their industry right up to the border if they can bring it up to the border why can t we take it up to the border i mean they are not afraid of us so why should we be afraid of them that s one and as far as their functioning is concerned i think imran would like peace but you know the shots have always been called by the army in pakistan and now of course the army is having a little mess around of its own with this new this chief s appointment but it depends really what the army wants after all even if the army tries to dominate how do they feed their country they are going around the world with a begging bowl and they ve only got the friends and day by day they are lessening so i think the army will have to play cold for their own country s sake if their country starts starving then it affects the army too ndtv that s a good point how do you react to the observation i ve faced it myself you go to pakistan the average person in the street is so warm towards you taxi drivers don t take fares if they know you re from india they don t charge you but the politicians it s all politicians fault amarinder singh of course it s the politicians fault ndtv and the army amarinder singh army it s a very simple thing for them it s a way of life i mean when i was the captain or let s say a lieutenant you just lived in your bunker or lived in a little room in your mess but they are given flats then they become captains and they are given little bigger flats by major they give a bigger house and by the time you become a general you get a big house and a farmhouse and a farm and all that sort of thing so by having peace and by their relevance going all these stop so they want to remain relevant and they are the ones who call the shots and i think unless they themselves understand that their country is heading for doom they are not going to sort of cut back but my guess is that the way their economy is floundering the army will have to think twice ndtv one of the few things i noted about pakistan you go there and all the previous presidents pictures have been taken down only his photograph is there and he has filed a case against the previous presidents who filed the case against previous presidents this guy has stepped down and they did a case against him and they kept telling me what we admire about india is you have so many heroes and you respect your leaders of the past they have no heroes no body respects jinnah and one or two earlier but india has that you also kind of solved that problem in punjab threat is no more a great animosity with the opposition now that s a major step amarinder singh there was never animosity you must remember people have been through a difficult time talking about my state the government had behaved in a shocking manner in fact people who they did not get one with will just pick them up and put them behind bars and charge them with all sorts of things so when the government changes that anger is there gradually we are handling it we put our commissions to look into all these false cases and i think largely now that time has passed and things have stabilized it is because the commission is working quite effectively a lot of cases they have said are false and have been removed and that and the atmosphere which is required if you are going to fight with each other and this is going to carry on you see continuity is what the industry wants if today you put up a plant here you don t want that the next government comes and starts messing around you want that sort of stability and i think realization ndtv and that is coming here amarinder singh certainly and our people believe it ndtv otherwise tendency is that whichever government comes in any state or centre all cases are only against the opposition again in their party everybody is clean so that seems to be when one thinks of the second greatest leader globally in the last 200 years after mahatma gandhi i still believe mahatma gandhi was the greatest global leader in 200 years and is recognized across the world second greatest probably mandela 27 years in jail and he comes out and forgives and he says truth and reconciliation we need that amarinder singh absolutely i think we are doing that in punjab we are not messing around when something very major happens we let the law runs its course but you know as i said it is very difficult because they have been through this i am happy to say by and large everyone has accepted and i hope this will be an indication to the next government whichever comes next ndtv should be it s a sign of a mature democracy one another thing which worries the investors is drugs and then cancer but first let s talk about drugs everybody says actually i hate to say it i say don t trust the media we did a series called smashed at sunset that was not really drugs that was booze but then we found out its not only punjab it s all over india india is smashed at sunset booze is very addictive of course in punjab they do it more colourfully amarinder singh well i don t know the other day you know that the gst has come in we are only left with excise duty and the other day we were talking about this excise duty and how to get the revenue up in excise duty is if you drink more i am not asking people and encouraging people to do this but you know the fact is that i am saying it in a light hearted manner but the fact is that yes i am not worried about that ndtv so patiala peg must get you a lot of excise duty amarinder singh this much ndtv you look at that and say excise duty when you see a peg that size amarinder singh i am worried more about the drugs and drugs is something we have set up a special task force we have got them working hard and you will be surprised we have arrested around 32000 people of course they are not all in the jug we have been through investigations people have been let off we have got about 3800 which have been convicted and the rest are under trials almost 4000 ndtv that s quite a big clean up then amarinder singh it is because what would you do now i have a problem that drugs used to come across the border then people used to bring them in now it s coming from kashmir look at the amount of security forces there and we caught a 300 kilo consignment coming from uri then it comes from nepal comes from delhi delhi is much worse than us and then it comes from land nearly one ton of this thing came to kandla and then from that a couple of hundred kilos were shipped to punjab so we seem to have become the destination because people feel we have money so people sell drugs here we have been very tough on this now we have just extradited a man from armenia from one of our guys who went there from here we are working upwards and hopefully we will get to the top there is so much money in drugs and that is something that will keep us on our toes all the time it s not going to disappear but it certainly will become manageable it was completely out of control before i have seen videos posted on social media of little girls maybe 10 or 15 three of them sitting on a manji in a village and sniffing the stuff now this is the sort of stuff that is happening this is before our government came and this is what we had made a commitment to that when we came we will calm this down and we have done it our force is working very well and by god s grace we will have it under ndtv total determination amarinder singh we have broken the back bone of it now the question is to push it down as much as we can ndtv and not to lose focus because other countries have faced this and eliminated it amarinder singh look at america columbia has it for long and it s still the same way now they are shipping it by submarines these smugglers have bought a submarine and the us coast guard just caught one submarine which was carrying cocaine from columbia ndtv but you are focused on stopping amarinder singh yes that is a must yes sometimes excess take place but very few we are careful ndtv so by the next elections you say we are a relatively drug free punjab amarinder singh no i don t think the world can ever be drug free but i think it will certainly be better and under control ndtv that s a big thing to say the other worry that people have i am sorry i am just bringing the worries it is because i think everyone needs to bring them out is cancer there used to be a world known cancer train to jaipur i think everybody said the pesticides and fertilizers are causing cancer in punjab what are you doing about that amarinder singh you know we have that train going to bikaner because we did not have cancer treatment but now cancer treatment has come up we have got the tata s coming up near sangrur we have one coming up here in chandigarh and elsewhere also we are trying to bring in these treatment areas for cancer but statistics wise we did have two teams in fact in my last the first ter we did ask dr talwar to have a look around and find out what is the reason of the cause of this he found nothing then i think in the last government s time they sent the tata people around to find out they couldn t find anything ndtv they are trying to find out what is the direct linkage and they couldn t amarinder singh they thought perhaps it is the excess use of fertilizers over a period of time and some sort of some chemical reaction has taken place or something but no they couldn t so in fact now that they have got statistics coming in punjab is lower than other states we are not above other states we are lower than other states in cancer so it seems to be a national problem ndtv so the focus was punjab but actually the incidents is lower than other states amarinder singh because of this daily train to bikaner it became a focus ndtv again it was the media never trust the media guess this is also a little bit of worry for the investors but air pollution and burning of stubble when i did my phd in agriculture economics and i travelled around punjab a lot because you were the first to use combine harvesters and i used to sit on the combine harvesters and they used to run well i want to say something you certainly have democracy in punjab and the way you handled that was great right talking about air pollution and burning of crops and i said i was going with the combine harvesters and you know in those days combine harvesters were john deere imported no one knew how to fix them and sardars would not switch it off they would go inside while it s working and try and fix it because if you switch it off you would never know if it would start again it was fantastic so these combine harvesters are leaving stubble and they are burning it what s happening and pollution is everywhere including punjab amarinder singh now as far as stubble burning it has always been there but unfortunately the area has gone up now and is contributing then of course vehicular traffic and industry has contributed power generation has contributed so it s becoming what it is has increased over the last couple of years now we have time to get on with that i know there are parts in punjab that are using it for power generation ndtv using stubble amarinder singh yes they are already using stubble and i hope more will come up and apart from that ethanol is there which can be broken out from this there have been trials by iit ropar but they have not been successful on that score so i hope they will break through eventually but certainly for power generation yes ndtv sir can we have a commitment that by next year we won t have stubble being burnt that you will buy it off the farmers they will only stop if they make money amarinder singh exactly and this is what i have told the prime minister i wrote him a letter i said unless we give them a rs 100 a quintal rate see you must remember what are my farmers 70 of my farmers are under 5 acres of land and out of that half of them are under 2 acres land now every operation they do under the government is about rs 1200 now how can a framer who can barely feed his family i will pay 24600 700 crore in debt services this year trying to help them out from all of the debts ndtv they have to burn it it cost too much to amarinder singh when they can t feed their families how are they going to do two extras ndtv so can we pay the farmers and stubble off the amarinder singh no let s see then it went to the supreme court and supreme court says punjab should pay them we have to pay them in any case now we are also ordered by the supreme court to pay them when we don t have any money and we are asking the government of india you pay rs 100 a quintal more in the msp so that this can be looked after ndtv we really i think all of us would love to see this problem solved and as you say if this is a method maybe you can share it with the centre amarinder singh no i don t know what the centre has ndtv the farmers need to be paid amarinder singh i think the case is still on so let s see what happens in that we have already taken it up when i see the pm next time will also mention this again ndtv you can t imagine how important it is children are coughing dying and we just need to pay the farmers and they will benefit and everyone will benefit amarinder singh the other day i was coming from firozpur to here and we re flying at over 500 feet and i couldn t see the ground even punjab it s not only delhi ndtv and the amount in hospital costs it all adds upon the end but you are getting a huge amount of money in gst that was a trick question amarinder singh i wish i was getting it my finance minister is smiling a lot ndtv he is crying amarinder singh yesterday he and six other fms met the national fm and they were promised we haven t had this gst nope we have handed over everything which produces revenue for the state to the government of india under the gst act now their commitment to us was that every first week of the month this money would come to us and we have not had it since august ndtv you have not been paid since august your gst so that s over 4000 crores you haven t been paid audience member 6000 now ndtv my god you have not got 6000 crores and it s due to you since 1st of august you have not got the cash how will you function i mean it s a lot of money he is looking a bit depressed amarinder singh it s not fair and it s not only us i think all states ndtv yes it s all states you are paying it to the centre but they are not returning your share amarinder singh we are not getting our share what is supposed to be ours we handed over all our lives to them so now what do i have i have liquor excise duty i have sand mining i have stamp duty and a couple of little things which give us a little here and there and we are borrowing to exist how much can we borrow but we are borrowing to exist ndtv that s a very very serious issue and finally i will just talk about one more thing and that is we have millions and millions tonnes of rice and wheat stored away some are being eaten away by mice but we are growing more and more of that shouldn t we change the cropping pattern amarinder singh that is precisely why we want to change the outlook on our economy and that is why we are having this invest punjab today it is you know at a time i will just elaborate a bit other states have now developed their water systems you have got the kaveri basin the ganga jamuna basin and they are all growing paddy i have as of today last year s rice last year s wheat and this year s wheat my stocks and godowns are full and the fci is not lifting them and this year s crop which has come in which is about 13 million tonnes we are storing where ever we find space ndtv you have last year s wheat there is so much excess wheat and rice amarinder singh and wheat doesn t last rice lasts for a while but that wheat if it gets spoiled after a year or two than we have to waste that is why i have got 31000 crores owed to me by the government of india 31000 crores over a period of last so many years where all of this wheat spoilage has taken place where they have charged us for lifting their bags into godowns for them and we are transferring it and in these sorts of thing ndtv and if they don t lift it and there is a deterioration of it they don t pay for that it s their fault amarinder singh they are paying to maintain the msp they are buying all the wheat and all we are buying on their behalf and we store it for them any spoilage in storage is to our cost and that has added to 31000 crores which we are talking to them about ndtv 31000 crores so one way to look at it for investors is 31000 crores to come and then another 6000 crores for gst so bonanza coming but when it will come we don t know just last thing on this cropping pattern you need to pay more for other crops so people switch to pulses or vegetables amarinder singh this is economics if they would give us an msp for maze they are giving an msp for maze but they don t maintain it there is a cotton msp they don t maintain it cotton corporation is supposed to come in and starts biting when the crops fall below whatever the msp is they don t do it and maze doesn t have an msp which they maintain if they give it to me for rice now we have millions of tons of pulses that are being imported or oil seeds are imported then we can get the farmer to change when he sees money in return everything changes if you could change from nothing to rice why can t you change to dals and cereals and moong dal or whichever dal you want to grow providing we have an msp and he knows he is getting money for it ndtv well sir i think we all must congratulate on you being so hands on you really know what s happening in your state you are really hands on you are still old 37 you regret being the finance minister sometimes okay if you had to say to the center you owe me nearly 40000 crore in punjabi and give it back what would you say to them amarinder singh i won t say what i said earlier ndtv okay a very mild version would be amarinder singh no i will tell you that they don t listen they have the same problem with us ndtv because you must be saying it in punjabi amarinder singh they are borrowing from the national reserve where are they going to so they have to gear up their own systems first ndtv so one statement to them in punjabi please give us our money or else amarinder singh we don t fold our hands in front of anyone in punjabi we just ask for what is rightfully ours ndtv thank you very much

recommended from editorial stephen poloz to step down how canada s top banker went from folksy obscurity to steady hand bank of canada likely to resist global push to ease keep interest rates where they are who will be the next bank of canada governor here are six candidates poloz s distinguishing feature as a policymaker was his ability to get inside the heads of executives he was a standout at university of western ontario and was tapped to help lay the groundwork for the bank of canada s switch to inflation targeting in the early 1990s but he went walkabout in the real economy soon after that eventually ending up as chief executive of export development canada in 2011 when he was named boc governor two years later poloz said he had spoken with more than 70 chief executives in the past year he kept that up as governor making a point of assembling actual economic actors to build up his store of anecdotal evidence of what was happening on the ground top stories get the latest

cut in january 2015 before it had become obvious that the oil price collapse would cause serious damage when the economy nearly stalled last winter he led the governing council to the sidelines but he didn t panic by reversing recent rate increases as he sensed that unusually severe weather was skewing the trade numbers he was right his time at edc gives him a very unique perspective to understand the issues exporters are facing leduc said we may need a governor who is willing to challenge the status quo of central banking charles st arnaud chief economist at credit union central of alberta formerly of bank of canada and the finance department if we can be lucky enough to hire a bespoke governor for the next seven years what might he or she look like claire kennedy a tax lawyer from toronto will spend the next several months pondering that question as the lead independent director on the bank of canada s board it s her job to organize the search for poloz s replacement she will post the job description early in the new year and will submit a recommendation to finance minister bill morneau by the spring the bank of canada said morneau and the federal cabinet can accept the board s recommendation or make their own choice advertisement 4 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content from up here in the cheap seats it seems candidates will need at least four attributes decent technical ability excellent communication skills a certain wiliness around politicians and an open mind to the possibility that the economy that exists now might be different than the one they learned about in grad school the next governor will begin her or his term under a cloud few forecasters predict a u s recession in the short term but almost all of them acknowledge the possibility so kennedy s hiring committee should select someone with an understanding of all the tricks that central banks have developed since the financial crisis to provide stimulus when interest rates are at zero the canadian benchmark rate was 4 5 per cent in december 2007 when the central bank started cutting interest rates to counter what would become the great recession the policy rate is only 1 75 per cent today technical prowess should be easy enough to find the pool of world class technicians with communications skills to match will be smaller not so long ago it was taken for granted that the primary requirement for running a central bank was phd in economics but central banking has changed the fed and the european central bank are run by lawyers not economists evidence that the increasingly public role of central banks demands leaders who are comfortable in the spotlight advertisement 5 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content communication can no longer be vague charles st arnaud former bank of canada economist the role has evolved in a way that we are asking governors to be much better communicators said charles st arnaud chief economist at credit union central of alberta who worked at the bank of canada and the finance department earlier in his career communication can no longer be vague canada s next central bank governor must also be ready to overhaul the way monetary policy is done at a minimum he or she will be in charge of a multi year rethink that could result in a decision to scrap the bank of canada s inflation target in favour of something else with interest rates so low and household debt so high fiscal policy could emerge as the best way to provide economic stability raising questions about how the bank of canada should interact with the finance department it seems certain that digital currencies will go mainstream soon central banks will have to decide whether they will lead that charge or if private companies such as facebook inc can be trusted to do it political considerations will arise the trudeau government surely would love to appoint a woman and none of the nine governors to date has been french canadian the bank of canada s all white mostly male governing council certainly would benefit from some diversity but the primary attribute should be an openness to dramatic change we may need a governor who is willing to challenge the status quo of central banking st arnaud said email

latin america is experiencing an abrupt change generated by enormous confrontations between the dispossessed and the privileged this confrontation includes both revolts by the people and reactions by the oppressors the october revolts the uprising in chile is the most important event in the latin american tsunami it is the biggest rebellion in the country s history every day thousands of young people leave schools universities and neighborhoods to face down the security forces their banners are simple chile got tired we woke up a people exhausted by humiliations has risen against the neo liberal model seventy percent of households entire income is eaten up by debts to pay for private education health care and pension savings chile shares the podium with eight of the most unequal nations in the world the mass of the population is confronting an isolated government one which took office in elections marked by abstention conservative president sebastián piñera deploys savage levels of repression which has already led to more than twenty deaths thousands detained and countless wounded there are indisputable reports of sexual abuse against detained women the army conducts this vandalism to preserve its privileges bequeathed by pinochet but some soldiers have refused to take part in the repression piñera is overwhelmed he imposed a curfew then had to lift it he asked for dialogue and then dialed up the bloodletting every day he announces some social concession but these bring no results the populace continues to mobilize so as not to repeat the frustrated experience of mass protests in 2006 and 2011 which led to only cosmetic changes meanwhile the politicians of the center left concertación agreement or common ground pact which includes both christian democrats and the socialist party seek to dilute the uprising s demands these forces supported the regime for 30 years and even initially justified last month s militarization now they are promoting a call to hold a plebiscite that will ensure continuity for piñera s administration while blocking the decision making sovereignty of any future constituent assembly elected to rewrite the constitution ecuador is the second epicenter of revolt indigenous communities resisted an increase in fuel prices at the local level and were then joined by other popular sectors in a monumental march on quito lenin moreno escaped to guayaquil a conservative enclave and opted for bloody repressive resulting in seven dead and thousands injured but after several days of intense battle he gave up he canceled the gas hike and acquiesced to the victory achieved by conaie s intransigence the confederation of indigenous nationalities of ecuador when the indigenous peoples marched into parliament the fugitive president remembered how three of his predecessors were taken down by these same forces 1997 2000 and 2005 the protesters also occupied the imf offices warning the bankers what to expect from this new round of resistance after winning on barricades the social movements organized a parliament of the peoples a sign of how the revolt is beginning to articulate alternative projects the fascist threat the coup in bolivia introduced a dramatic counterpoint to the uprisings in chile and ecuador the right took the initiative and seized the government it was a decisive action under the direct leadership of the army president evo morales resigned at gunpoint when the generals refused to obey him he did not resign simply owing to the pressure of the general crisis as argentine president de la rúa did in 2001 he was removed from the presidency by the military high command however the main peculiarity of this operation was its fascist tint the security forces established their own liberated zones occupied by thugs who launched a reign of terror they kidnapped social leaders invaded public institutions and humiliated opponents coup leader and christian fundamentalist luis fernando camacho put far right brazilian president jair bolsonaro s proclamations into practice with bibles in hand and evangelical prayers his supporters burned houses abducted women and chained up journalists camacho shouted racist slogans against the cholos while his henchmen mocked the coyas terms for indigenous people that are racial slurs in the mouths of the racist elite they burned the indigenous whipala flag and beat indigenous people in the street like germany during the 1930s camacho has created legions out of the resentful middle classes to humiliate the indigenous the ruling class is gleefully taking its revenge this class never accepted the fact that an indian evo won the presidency and they look favorably upon camacho s hoards bolivia s economic and military elite are hoping to stabilize the coup and after a period with camacho s gangs in the lead then place their trusted men in positions to manage the state but their immediate priority is to consolidate evo s overthrow the prominence of the united states in the plot was confirmed by trump s praise for the army s intervention international business offered the coup leaders generous support and succeeded in securing the european union s blessing self declared interim president jeanine áñez will try to hold the presidency long enough to rig new elections the coup regime is oscillating between public relations efforts necessary to maintain its farce and the direct exercise of a dictatorship in response to the coup bolivia has returned to its traditions of ungovernability heroic popular resistance is growing under harsh conditions in the first five days of the coup 24 were killed despite the crackdown mobilizations extended from the bastion of el alto an indigenous majority city of one million people neighboring the capital city la paz to cities across the country hundreds of popular neighborhood associations are at the heart of the struggle organizations that know how to organize street battles in the course of these actions the attitude adopted by evo must be evaluated the main problem with his strategy was not that he hoped to remain in office continuously but his total lack of foresight that the coup was coming the militants organizing the resistance are fully aware of this shortcoming a resounding victory and a positive example lula s release sparked immense joy among those organizing against his arrest it also landed an important blow against the lava jato operation car wash anti corruption farce mounted by prosecuting judge moro currently bolsonaro s minister of justice and his accomplices at o globo brazil s largest daily newspaper and their campaign to prevent the tenaciously popular lula from once again running for president now the right must deal with the mass caravan protests demanding the full restoration of lula s political rights in advance of a potential 2022 presidential bid that protests against bolsonaro will resonate across the continent and they will have all the more impact as he clearly lacks the minimal self control required to exercise his executive role at the head of the brazilian state instead he will continue on with his carnival like antics bolsonaro s crude behavior in office is aggravating his government s internal crises it has already come to light that several of his relatives committed money laundering crimes and testimony has recently emerged directly linking him to the murder of the party for socialism and freedom city councilor from rio de janeiro marielle franco despite all the damage he has done bolsonaro has not been able to translate his reactionary rhetoric into a concrete fascist program or state workers launched a huge strike against his neoliberal pension reforms and three million people marched against homophobia a central component of bolsonaro s political and personal profile meanwhile student protests against budget cuts reached an unprecedented mass level mobilized under the banner of books yes weapons no the unhinged bolsonaro is planning a counteroffensive including mobilizing his right wing social base to demand lula be sent back to prison what happens next in brazil will arise from this confrontation the democratic victory in brazil complements an even more significant victory in venezuela since trump could not copy reagan or bush s invasions of granada 1983 or panama 1989 he had to content himself with the appropriation of the venezuelan national oil company pdevesa subsidiary in the united states his venezuelan lackeys tried every imaginable plot but they were undermined by the failed self proclamation of juan guaidó as president of venezuela facing a very difficult social scenario aggravated by gigantic mistakes in economic policy committed by president nicolás maduro s government david managed to stop goliath to this day the bolivarian camp as the movement sparked by hugo chávez is called maintains an intense level of street mobilizations and fights for control over public space every time the opposition appears furthermore military cohesion and loyalty to the government has been preserved gaido failed to win over the high command for instance by means of constant political intervention in the army under pressure from the popular militias these actions illustrate how to confront threats from the right to beat the fascists you must act without hesitation relentless struggles and electoral confrontations protests in puerto rico forced the governor to resign after he mocked victims of the hurricane and spouted homophobic comments in neighboring haiti demonstrations over the last few months have been monumental barricades are built every day in the cities to protest a government that aggravated the indescribable impoverishment of the population honduras continues to be convulsed by persistent resistance against the bloody regime that took power by means of an electoral fraud 2017 and 2013 the criminals who run the state not only assassinated environmental activist berta cáceres they have murdered some 200 popular militants who dare defy the security forces mafia the struggle in latin america extends to the electoral field as well last year andrés manuel lópez obrador won an overwhelming victory in mexico ending a suffocating cycle of pri and pan governments hopes are focused on ending violence endemic to the so called war on drugs which has turned the country into graveyard 300 000 dead and 26 000 more unidentified bodies countless social leaders have been massacred in a war that goes beyond settling scores between organized crime syndicates voters expect lópez obrador to end the forced displacement of populations and to investigate and prosecute the perpetrators of massacres like the one in ayozinatpa the achievement of these objectives will clash with the recent enactment of new internal security norms which authorize anti drug actions by the armed forces lópez obrador s submission to trump s blackmail and his demand to block central american migrants on mexica s southern border by deploying of the national guard will only exacerbate this danger president elect alberto fernández s victory in argentina marks another important electoral reversal for the right in latin america with the return to power of the peronist bloc including cristina fernández de kirchner elected as vice president argentina s movement will have to settle the score in the responses to the economic social catastrophe left behind by conservative president mauricio macri this dramatic scenario may lead to the resumption of political mobilization in the country with the highest level of union and social organization in the entire region in colombia we are witnessing the slow emergence of center left forces which for the first time is standing in elections in municipalities and for governorships against the oligarchy and the paramilitaries on the other hand the center left frente amplio broad front in uruguay saw its vote decline in 2019 elections after 15 years in power and a few months ago in el salvador an improvised right wing coalition captured the presidency ending a decade of shaky management by the frente farabundo martí para la liberación nacional fmln these last examples prove why popular mobilization must be maintained and why the left cannot restrict its actions to the ballot box instead maintaining open communication channels with organisms that emerge from social struggles is vital we can already glimpse exactly these sorts of modalities at play in the neighborhood associations cabildos of chile in the parliament of peoples of ecuador in the meetings of movements in bolivia and in the coordinated organizations of haiti pretexts and wrecking operations it is evident that the coup d etat has resurfaced as an instrument in the hands of the ruling classes bolivia crowns a sequence initiated in honduras 2009 practiced in paraguay 2012 and extended to brazil 2016 in each case the army has returned to the forefront of politics as guarantor of new authoritarian forms maintained under a state of emergency the media manipulates information presenting corruption as a disease unique to center left governments and promoting fake news stories provided by the intelligence services at the request of rightist groups meanwhile the right buttresses its lies with various devices to confuse popular consciousness including fostering religious fanaticism based on evangelical churches that contribute millions of dollars to stoke fear and destroy solidarity washington s main priority is to recover the largest oil field in the hemisphere in venezuela it has also reinforced its embargo against cuba and conspired to open access to the enormous reserves of lithium in bolivia s altiplano evo pursued extensive talks to expand the exploitation of this strategic resource with chinese firms a fact not lost on the trump administration the recent brics brazil russia india china and south africa summit in brasilia brazil included clear statements of intent by china in favor of free trade in the region bolsonaro himself has begun to evaluate a free trade agreement with china to counteract this growing rivalry for influence in latin america trump has increased the regional presence of the u s military forming close relationships with latin american militaries as a means to assert u s corporate economic interests u s intervention also serves to strengthen neoliberalism which has been challenged by the chilean uprising that revolt demolished the neoliberal myths most praised by the region s capitalists the trans andean rebellion has reverberated internationally because has exposed the chicago boys cherished orthodoxies as scams the protests have also pointed out how neoliberalism drives social disintegration in latin america producing massive migrations when local economies are opened to international competition and when small farmers are destroyed dispossession swells caravans leaving for the north which no wall or security force can contain neoliberalism expanded crime and led to terrifying violence of the 50 most dangerous cities on planet 43 are located in latin america this model is also responsible for the destruction of the environment and the recent fires in the amazon the intentional burning of large forests is perpetrated to plant soybeans or open pastures for livestock under the law of maximizing profit interpretations and lessons learned so far the right not only ignores the disasters caused by its management it claims its model forged a thriving middle class which now seeks greater participation in public life but the middle class is just a label used by the right to improvise justifications they mix apples and oranges to force interpretations of social development to fit their prejudices at the same time controversies about the current scenario are not limited to the right they also include certain confused thinkers who situate themselves on the left these analysts fail to account for the differences between popular revolt and reactionary clamor we must make this distinction categorically an anti government barricade in venezuela stands on the opposite side of the indigenous protests in ecuador the followers of camacho in bolivia are our enemies and those who defend evo are our allies it is important to remember these self evident facts in the face of neutralist positions which are intended to elide the huge gulf separating the opposing camps these neutralist views have criticized maduro and guaidó in venezuela with equal virulence and now they extend the same equivalency to bolivia proper characterization of the confrontation in bolivia is not an academic exercise it is a precondition for organizing against the coup plotters and intensifying solidarity marches and actions it is impossible to organize solidarity if one does not know who to fight and who to defend to defeat the coup imperialism and neoliberalism mobilization must be redoubled and political action intensified but we must also learn from mistakes committed on our side that have allowed the right to recover it is very difficult to defeat enemies within our own movement their regeneration has been a permanent problem for our side over the past decade the ultra reactionary lenín moreno is only the most extreme case moreno not only reversed previous governments reforms he is implementing the ruling class agenda nor should we forget that one of the main architects of the parliamentary coup against brazilian workers party president dilma rousseff was none other than michel temer her own vice president the policy of broadening the front to include pro capitalist elements has even led lópez obrador to form a governing alliance with evangelicals conservatives and capitalists to the detriment of his radical core the right has tended to regain ground when progressive governments naively identify their electoral successes with permanent political support they forget that the elections constitute a moment in the fight for power but when effective control of the economy the judiciary the army and the media all remain in the hands of the dominant groups the return of the right is only a matter of time that return has usually coincided with an exhaustion of progressive efforts including improvements in working class standards of living this paradox has been verified in argentina brazil and el salvador and could be repeated in uruguay in all cases center left governments provided relief and reform for the population which then resulted in more conservative electorates that contradiction also underlies the crisis in bolivia in recent years the mas suffered significant electoral setbacks despite its unprecedented successes in managing the economy it achieved high growth rates a significant reduction in poverty and strong investment flowing from the productive use of natural gas income the depoliticization of the popular movement is the most frequent explanation for this disconnect between socio economic improvements and electoral decline some argue that voters become more individualistic as consumption expands yet in reality that depoliticization is a consequence of the continuity of a system that reproduces privileges for the capitalists ideology in a society does not float in a vacuum if the ruling classes retain power then their preeminence tends to extend to electoral expressions the powerful regain control of the government because they never lost power the return of the right is not inevitable nor is it merely a natural function of the supposed pendulum of political life it springs from progressivism s lack of radicalism instead of encouraging substantial transformations at the appropriate times the progressive political current adapts to the status quo and as it discounts the possibility of wresting power from the great capitalists it ends up strengthening capitalist domination the experience of the center left governments confirms that limiting radicalization opens the floodgates of revenge by the right the importance of the left the current context includes certain similarities with the prevailing picture at the beginning of the century when a succession of rebellions in venezuela ecuador bolivia and argentina generated the conditions for the birth of the progressive cycle the so called pink tide that period concluded with a conservative restoration which now in turn faces challenges by a new generation of movements and leaders the similarity between today and what happened in 1989 2005 can be seen in the resemblance of the ecuadorian uprising this fall with the 2001 argentine caracazo pot banging protests both revolts originated in reactions against an increase in fuel prices imposed by the imf there are also parallels between 2001 and chile s uprising popular anger against the political regime que se vayan todos or throw them all out is now concentrated on the figure of piñera and the form of government bequeathed by pinochet but what is striking about the current cycle is the sheer scale of popular participation the number of protesters in the streets is breaking all records set over the last two decades in ecuador marches several times higher than previous peaks are being recorded in haiti an estimated five million people have marched in the protests in chile two million took part with another one million mobilizing in puerto rico chances for achieving real gains and changes in power relations are huge the reopening of the progressive cycle is not the only thing at stake today s ongoing battles could lead to new and unexpected scenarios the most important thing is to understand is the content of the confrontations and to be clear that the interests of a minority of capitalists must clash with the wishes of the popular majority a right wing alignment of the powerful will clash with emancipatory proposals from the left our peoples triumph requires we build strengthen and renovate that left originally

brandon smith alt market com friday 06 december 2019 if we are to measure the concept of economic recovery in real terms then we would have to look at the fundamentals not stock markets and whether or not they re improving unfortunately not all economic data is presented to the public honestly very often it is mired and obscured in a fog of disinformation and false standards i would point out though that there is relatively accurate information out there in certain areas of the global economy and it tells us our economic structure is destabilizing beyond that even the rigged numbers are moving into negative territory but what does all this mean for the holiday retail season one of the mainstream s favorite gauges of us financial health and if 2019 s holiday profits sink what does this tell us is going to happen in 2020 first let s start with what we know since we live in a globalized economy where everything is supposedly interdependent it helps to examine international export numbers the us doesn t manufacture and export much of anything anymore beyond agricultural products but global markets do expect us to consume the goods of other nations a decline in exports indicates a failing global economy but in particular a failing us consumer economy the obvious example would be china which has seen plunging export data at least the past three months though many will argue that this is merely due to tariffs and the trade war however it s not just china that is showing signs of collapse south korea another major manufacturing and export hub in asia 5th largest in the world has seen declining exports for 11 consecutive months south korean shipping is crumbling in november and the media is blaming the trade war as some sk companies would be hit indirectly because they sell intermediate goods to china are are linked to us companies in china but this makes little sense tariffs are highly targeted to specific companies and specific goods and so far the us has not directed major tariff attention at south korea beyond the auto market also the new korus deal between trump and sk is different only cosmetically to original trade agreements yet south korean exports continue to fall the same situation can be seen in japan with japanese exports witnessing a 9 2 year over year drop in october the largest decline in 3 years japan has seen three consecutive months of declines in exports and what about europe while germany the manufacturing powerhouse of the eu finally saw a jump in exports to the us this past month overall the european union has seen consistently poor export performance for the past year and germany itself is hovering on the edge of recession with 0 1 official gdp growth many economist already consider germany to be in recession as official gdp numbers are constantly manipulated by governments to the upside but let s not forget about the us remember how trump promised that the trade war would result in a renaissance for us manufacturing and that millions of industrial jobs would be returning to our shores well as i ve warned consistently for the past couple years there is no way corporations will be bringing manufacturing jobs and factories back to the us without ample incentives trump already gave companies tax cuts without demanding anything in return and the cost benefit ratio of building new factories and paying american workers top dollar versus keeping existing factories in asia and dealing with 10 25 tariffs just doesn t add up to a new us rust belt renaissance while manufacturing jobs have increased us manufacturing activity has declined meaning there simply isn t enough demand for the goods being produced us manufacturing ism index just sank this month and has been sinking for the past four month into negative territory while us pmi manufacturing data jumped this month it is still well below the 10 year average and is also very low compared to past holiday seasons which almost always see a spike in manufacturing us manufacturing remains at a historic low of 11 of us gdp and production output has decline steadily since january of this year the question is will the vast decline in global manufacturing translate to a crash in consumer demand we know that us credit dependency has skyrocketed in the past few years but will more debt result in more profits for retailers this is highly unlikely as us retail sales growth for example has been in decline at the same time that consumer debt has been rising why credit delinquencies have been relatively stable so far this year so my theory is that people in the us are paying off previous debts by taking on new debt they are kicking the can on their insolvency the rest here

strategy and unlock the value of its real estate the company completed the merger of the retail operations of hbc europe and signa s karstadt warenhaus gmbh in the fourth quarter of 2018 after

discussions with the other continuing shareholders as to whether proceeds from the potential signa transactions could provide a portion of the financing for a potential privatization transaction

u s highlights trade tensions reemerged this week president trump suggested that the u s china deal could wait until after the election announced steel and aluminum tariffs on brazil and argentina and threatened to impose tariffs on france international trade numbers were also unambiguously weak in october even as trade deficit had narrowed despite uncertainty on the trade front it was another banner month for america s job market payrolls rose by a healthy 266k in november with service sector hiring accelerating for the fourth consecutive month contraction in the manufacturing sector deepened slightly in november with the ism manufacturing index edging lower to 48 1 from 48 3 service industries continued to expand alas at a slightly slower pace than in a month prior canadian highlights the bank of canada elected to leave its policy rate unchanged this week in an accompanying speech deputy governor tim lane set a high bar for easing citing the resilient canadian labour market data today suggests cracks may be appearing in that narrative as the labour market saw losses across the board the bank also remains concerned about the high levels of household debt october s credit data showed an increase in household debt driven almost entirely by mortgages without persistent weakness in the labour market or a further escalation in trade conflicts the bank may still find it comfortable to remain on the sidelines for the time being u s hiring remains solid despite trade tensions trade related developments and employment data stole the limelight this week with the deadline of the next wave of proposed tariffs on imports from china a little more than a week away investors kept a close eye on the state of the u s china trade negotiations and trade policy more broadly on that front comments by president trump earlier this week suggesting that the u s china deal could wait until after the elections were not encouraging sending equity markets sharply lower sentiment was further dampened by news that the u s will restore steel and aluminum tariffs on brazil and argentina for alleged currency manipulation and the threat to impose tariffs on 2 4bn of imports from france equity markets rebounded toward the end of the week amid news of beijing reaffirming that the talks remain on track and the excellent job numbers oil prices rallied on the news that opec countries agreed to deepen existing production cuts and saudi arabia promising to maintain its voluntary 400k bpd cut bringing total cuts to 2 1 million bpd trade data was not encouraging this week as trade volumes continued to slow in october export and import volumes declined for the second straight month since imports fell more than exports the u s trade deficit narrowed for the second month in a row hardly a sign of health the return of trade tensions this week suggests that trade policy will likely remain volatile and exports sluggish in the year ahead this is not good news for u s businesses particularly manufacturers who continue to contend with retaliatory tariffs weak global demand and a strong dollar manufacturing sentiment ebbed further in november with the ism manufacturing index edging lower to 48 1 from 48 3 in october while the production subcomponent edged higher on the month it remained in contractionary territory and new orders and employment sub indexes continued to deteriorate signaling that manufacturing output could further worsen before it gets better the services sector hasn t been immune to trade related headwinds with the ism non manufacturing index edging 0 8 points lower to 53 9 in october however it remains well in expansionary territory supported by resilient domestic demand two thirds of non manufacturing industries surveyed in october reported growth compared to less than a third in the manufacturing survey chart 1 this divergence of fortunes between the manufacturing and services sector continues to manifest in employment data payrolls expanded by an impressive 266k in november with service industries contributing 206k to the headline businesses in the services sector have been ramping up hiring since july chart 2 while gains remain muted in the goods producing sector with the pop in november reflecting the end of the gm strike all in all despite uncertainty on the trade front and softer global growth the labor market has remained remarkably resilient with reports like this the fomc can sit comfortably on the sidelines after cutting rates three times this year as long as international risks do not intensify and hurt confidence domestically the american economy will remain in expansion supported by a healthy consumer canada jobs data versus resilience the bank of canada rate decision took center stage this week but the outcome was not all that surprising citing waning recession concerns improvement in financial market sentiment and an economic outlook that s evolving in line with their expectations the bank opted to hold the policy rate at 1 75 however it was keen to note that it will continue to closely monitor the resilience of canada s economy deputy governor tim lane provided more insight on the decision and the bank thought process in a speech on thursday dg lane compared and contrasted bank of canada policy decisions with those of the federal reserve to underline the point that despite the interconnectedness of the two economies the bank does not have to move in lock step with the fed and that policy paths have diverged before chart 1 according to dg lane the bank of canada did not follow the fed in cutting rates in 2019 because inflation and its economic outlook are on target and the policy rate was already lower than that of the fed s he highlighted the recent strength in the labor market as the key reason why canada s economy has been resilient to external shocks unfortunately today s labour market data pokes some holes in that narrative the canadian economy shed 71 2k net jobs in november and the unemployment rate climbed to 5 9 from 5 5 weakness was seen across all forms of employment private public and self although its just one month of data it will certainly send worrying signals to the bank s governing council trade uncertainty also continues to gray the skies even with the volume of exports increasing in october due to a dramatic surge in artwork exports the level has barely shifted since the beginning of the year looking ahead growth in exports will likely remain subdued reflecting the decline in u s manufacturing and continuation of global trade conflicts amid the headwinds the bank of canada will still think twice about providing further support to the economy the bank remains concerned about the high levels of debt held by canadian households this worry was backed up in october s credit data which showed a 4 rise in household credit relative to a year ago extending an upward trend that started in february chart 2 the increase in household credit was driven by mortgages whereas growth in consumer credit continues to moderate while lowering rates could provide more support to the housing market it could also raise the level of household debt heightening already existing vulnerabilities in the canadian economy this week s statements made it abundantly clear that the bank has a high bar for cutting rates today s labour market data may have taken us closer to reaching that bar but we re not there yet without continued labour market weakness feeding into consumer spending and housing activity or a further escalation in trade conflicts the bank may still find it comfortable to remain on the sidelines for the time being u s upcoming key economic releases u s fomc rates decision

washington hiring in the united states jumped last month to its highest level since january as u s employers shrugged off trade conflicts and a global slowdown and added 266 000 jobs washington hiring in the united states jumped last month to its highest level since january as u s employers shrugged off trade conflicts and a global slowdown and added 266 000 jobs the unemployment rate dipped to 3 5 from 3 6 in october matching a half century low the labor department reported friday and wages rose a solid 3 1 in november compared with a year earlier advertising investors cheered the report sending the dow jones industrial average up 325 points in mid day trading november s healthy job gain runs against a widespread view that many employers are either delaying hiring until a breakthrough in the u s china trade war is reached or are struggling to find workers with unemployment so low the pace of hiring points to the resilience of the job market and economy more than a decade into the u s economic expansion the longest on record steady job growth has helped reassure consumers that the economy is expanding and that their jobs and incomes remain secure consumer spending has become an even more important driver of growth as the trump administration s trade conflicts have reduced exports and led many businesses to cut spending today s jobs report more than any other report in recent months squashed any lingering concerns about an imminent recession in the u s economy said gad levanon an economist at the conference board a business research group consumers are entering the holiday season with both the ability and the willingness to spend the healthy data suggested that the federal reserve which meets next week is unlikely to cut its benchmark short term interest rate anytime soon the fed has cut rates three times this year to help nurture the economy at the same time chairman jerome powell has said the fed is not inclined to raise rates in response to ultra low unemployment until inflation has risen consistently which has yet to happen the perception that any rate hikes are a long way off has helped underpin the stock market s gains monthly job growth has picked up since summer it has averaged 205 000 over the past three months up from just 135 000 in july fears that the u s economy might slip into recession peaked during the fall as the u s china trade war intensified and financial market trends pointed to a downturn in the coming year or two that raised the possibility that trump would have to face a democratic opponent next year against the backdrop of a struggling economy but friday s figures paint a somewhat rosier picture of the economy and some risks to global growth such as a disorderly brexit for the u k have faded in the past month most economists are predicting modest growth for next year renewed concerns that trade will continue to hamper the u s economy drove stock prices lower earlier this week after president donald trump had said he was willing to wait until after the 2020 elections to strike a preliminary trade agreement with china with the two sides still haggling the administration is set to impose 15 tariffs on an additional 160 billion of chinese imports beginning dec 15 both sides have since suggested that the negotiations are making progress but there is still no sign of a resolution the return of striking general motors autoworkers added roughly 40 000 jobs in november a one time bounce back that followed a similar decline in october when the gm strikers weren t counted as employed excluding the strikers manufacturing jobs showed a small gain friday s data included other positive news the government revised up its estimate of job growth for september and october by a combined 41 000 outsize hiring for the holiday shopping season did not appear to be a major driver of last month s job growth retailers added just 2 000 jobs on a seasonally adjusted basis and transportation and warehousing firms gained fewer than 16 000 both figures are below last year s november totals the shopping season is shorter this year because thanksgiving occurred later than in recent years which might be delaying some temporary hiring most analysts say they remain hopeful about the economy and the job market the economy grew at a 2 1 annual rate in the july september quarter and the annual pace is thought to be slowing to roughly 1 5 to 2 in the final three months of the year sluggish but not recessionary consumer confidence has slipped in recent months but remains at a decent level helping boost sales of expensive purchases such as autos and appliances the fed s three interest rate cuts have helped lowered mortgage rates and supported the housing market sales of existing homes have risen nearly 5 in the past year sales of new homes have soared by one third

restated below to include additional information regarding the period preceding the announcement by the continuing shareholders of the initial proposal capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein have the meanings ascribed to them in the circular the signa transaction and the initial going private proposal in connection with the company s strategic objective to simplify its retail strategy and unlock the value of its real estate the company completed the merger of the retail operations of hbc europe and signa s karstadt warenhaus gmbh in the fourth quarter of 2018 after completing the transaction given the deteriorating state of the european retail business the need for significant incremental capital contributions to fund material operating losses in the european business and the continued need to focus on core operations and strengthen the company s balance sheet the company concluded it was important to pursue a complete exit from the european retail market and fully monetize its european real estate in and around late february 2019 representatives of hbc including mr baker and mr putnam commenced exploratory discussions with representatives of signa about a potential sale to signa of hbc s remaining 50 interest in its european real estate joint venture and 49 99 interest in its european retail joint venture the signa transactions shortly after the commencement of exploratory discussions with signa mr baker considered the viability of hbc using proceeds of the potential signa transactions to complete a buyback of hbc shares or fund other liquidity opportunities for shareholders mr baker also commenced exploratory discussions with the other continuing shareholders as to whether proceeds from the potential signa transactions could provide a portion of the financing for a potential privatization transaction involving hbc and thereby a liquidity opportunity for other hbc shareholders such exploratory discussions included among other things what levels of debt financing and leverage would be appropriate and what other sources of financing could be available on acceptable terms it was determined that without proceeds from the potential signa transactions it was highly unlikely that the debt capital markets would be independently available to support a privatization transaction on terms that would be sustainable for the company mr baker commenced such discussions with representatives of each of fabric luxembourg holdings s a r l fabric hanover investments luxembourg s a hanover and abrams capital management l p

prior to a regularly scheduled board meeting on march 27 2019 and with discussions of the potential signa transactions still fluid mr baker and mr putnam informed mr leith hbc s lead independent director about mr baker s desire to evaluate a potential privatization transaction together with the other continuing shareholders all of which was contingent on proceeding with the signa transactions which as of such date were still being negotiated without any certainty of outcome mr leith consented to mr baker exploring such a transaction and sharing certain limited financial information with the continuing shareholders on a confidential basis mr leith also provided consent to the use by mr baker of the company s historical transaction counsel in connection with that initial evaluation and

rotman and rubel each an independent director to supervise the review and evaluation of the company s strategies and options with respect to i the company s lord taylor business unit and ii its

this is not investment advice the author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned wccftech com has a disclosure and ethics policy much of what we cover in the wccftech finance section details the longstanding and somewhat ill defined battleground between corporations and governments offshore tax havens tax avoidance schemes with strange sounding names like the double irish or dutch sandwich luxembourg discount corporate tax rates and others often fuel multinational corporations ability to make ridiculous levels of money last week a little known tax transparency company called fair tax mark published an assessment of many of these multinational tech firms including amazon nasdaq amzn facebook nasdaq fb google nasdaq googl netflix nasdaq nflx apple nasdaq aapl and microsoft nasdaq msft and came to the conclusion that between them the firms had avoided approximately 100 billion of global tax over the last decade france s digital services tax is an attempt to redress the balance on huge multinational technology firms that have a multitude of tools at their disposal to avoid global taxes and at a high level proposes to tax revenues rather than profits of course this has its own problems since the us now views proposals like this as being unfairly targeting of its companies given that many of the new economy digital companies which are so huge are american but fundamentally the main image of the battleground between corporations and governments is one of taxation amazon abandoned hq2 but takes new space in new york amazon ran a major event marketing it as a beauty pageant but basically asking a number of cities across the us to submit bids to have the honour of being selected as the location for its second headquarters ultimately it decided to go with two locations arlington va and new york for a number of reasons including its deep pool of talented workers but also the tax breaks it got which were reputed to be approximately 3 billion over a 10 year period fast forward to february and amazon decided to throw the towel in on its planned new york location after a fair amount of negative publicity and strong public criticism of the tax breaks it received in order to grace new york with hq2 status well yesterday it announced that it has signed a lease for 335 000 square feet of office space to accommodate over 1 500 new employees scheduled to open in 2021 still a far cry from the huge space it planned to originally open but perhaps a sharp awakening that the rise of corporations is still checked by public opinion and governments the problem however remains the extent to which corporations can flex their power to transfer wealth from people and governments to their own coffers many feel that at present too much power resides in the hands of big business and the world has begun pushing back against this in the form of weaker commitments to globalisation vs nationalism looking pointedly at the trump presidency and brexit as well as other initiatives like digital taxes to try to curb the ability of corporations like amazon to run riot foxconn wisconsin a case study in excessive corporate power a lot of this blowback comes hot on the heels of the famed deal that wisconsin offered to foxconn brokered in part by a white house keen to bring jobs from the asia pacific region back to us shores wisconsin offered what was reportedly anywhere from 3 billion to 4 5 billion in subsidies to foxconn to bring 13 000 jobs to the states amazingly this equated to over 300k in incentives per employee while the state itself would bankroll infrastructure work as an added bonus to make the new sites accessible the problem now however is that the deal is widely derided and regarded as a complete dud foxconn has a bunch of empty buildings in wisconsin has delayed its plans to build manufacturing plants and hire workers has thrown in the towel on the innovation centers it was to build to have highly paid professionals employed as well as blue collar manufacturing workers and has massively scaled back its plans from 13 000 workers to just 1 500 sure subsidies haven t been paid out to the firm yet but this deal has absolutely cost wisconsin residents money in the form of infrastructure building and homes in the form of people who had their properties bought up to make way for the factory that never was now as the 2020 election in the us draws nearer president trump has told foxconn founder terry gou to bring more jobs to wisconsin important for him no doubt given how important the state was in the 2016 election wrapping up capitalism is amazing it is the single best vehicle for wealth creation that exists that we know of however it does have a tendency to concentrate power and wealth in the hands of the successful few whether they are individuals or companies these few have an immense ability to shrug off the rules that apply to most others whether it is people who take advantage of tax loopholes or corporations we ve written about how companies are also eroding retail investor value by waiting later and later to go public how they avoid taxes and how they get governments to give them tax breaks like with the trump tax breaks to deem all their foreign offshore cash repatriated and give them a tax break on bringing it back into the country this latest news that amazon is expanding its ny presence even after its disastrous attempt to court government sanctioned tax breaks is yet another little push back in the face of corporations much of the world s regulatory mechanisms are naturally a reaction to what has occurred and been perceived as bad practice as such it s only natural that corporations will push the boundaries before then being brought back into line france s digital services tax is the first logical step to take aim at the fact that corporations should either have profitable operations or not run if a company can fake a lack of profitability and get away with it that shouldn t be allowed and as such the assumption is that if you re doing business it must be profitable to you as such france will just tax your revenue rather than worry about how you can show you re not making a profit and therefore don t deserve to be taxed when everyone knows you actually are other measures which seem more and more outdated is the us sec regulation requiring only firms which have over 10 million in assets and more than 500 external investors to have to file accounts this bar was set by the securities and exchange act of 1934 when 10 million was a hell of a lot more money than it is today the rationale was that if you re so big you have that much and a bunch of shareholders you should basically be a public company so we ll make you open up to scrutiny in the same way a public company is and make you file accounts the trouble is that the venture capital investment industry has come a long way since 1934 and now many multi billion dollar companies are still private with a number of shares just circulating amongst limited external parties thereby allowing them to keep all the early stage growth and profits for themselves pension funds and others who have requirements that their investments be in publicly traded companies are left out in the cold as obviously are retail investors the war between corporations and governments regulators is a long one and being constantly waged this week we saw amazon take a slice of humble pie
well there were 266 000 jobs added to the us job market in november and the unemployment rate hit another fifty year low at 3 5 percent this was better than expected wages were up by 3 1 percent from one year ago while consumer prices are up by less than 2 0 percent year over year the economy has been expanding for ten and one half years without a setback and the s p 500 stock index is standing right at the edge of another historic high yet some people are still not happy the economy during all this time of economic recovery has only increased at a 2 2 percent compound rate of growth over this whole period this is quite low by historical standards furthermore labor productivity actually declined in the third quarter and income wealth inequality remains very very high what is going on here this period too by most standards has been a period when the federal reserve has pumped more reserves into the banking system than ever before through three rounds of quantitative easing and a desire to err on the side of monetary ease so as not to unintentionally cause a liquidity problem or something worse that would set back the economy into another recession the federal government during this time has also run continuous deficits and issued historic amounts of government debt to the credit markets many times i have written about possible changes that have taken place in the economy in this â modernâ era changes that have resulted in the economy working differently than it has before and this difference must be worked out so that we can understand what is really going on let me address two changes that may be contributing to this â newâ modern era the foundation of this â newâ modern era has been what i have referred to as credit inflation over fifty years ago the federal government set out with a new philosophy based upon keynesian economic reasoning supplemented by an empirical relationship called â the phillips curveâ which purported to show the trade off in the economy between the unemployment rate and inflation the creation of a government policy based on these two factors produced the environment i refer to as an environment of credit inflation in such a program the fiscal and monetary policies of the government are aimed at reducing unemployment to as low as possible while accepting some constant degree of price inflation policymakers justified this approach by citing the data that represented the phillips curve you could buy less unemployment at the cost of a â mildâ degree of inflation on a constant basis the problem is that peopleâ especially financially sophisticated people or wealthy people that could hire financially sophisticatedâ could take advantage of this inflation and produce higher and higher returns that were almost guaranteed in fact this credit inflation became so consistent and produced such substantial returns that more and more of the â creditâ the government created through monetary and fiscal policies went into not only consumer price increases but also flowed into asset price increasesâ and even asset price bubbles this behavior was recognized by the early 1970s but became more and more prominent as the century moved along and the federal government was perfectly complacent in this result because it kept people at workâ which helped politicians get re elected but credit inflation especially with asset price inflation and or bubbles and especially when they are constant due to continuing government policy efforts helps to produce substantial movements in income wealth inequality in fact i would argue that the huge increase in income wealth inequality over the past fifty years has been underwritten by government policy efforts to sustain inflation as pictured in the phillips curve by the end of the century and moving on beyond the great recession economic growth as it is currently measured slowed down and has been sustained at the modest rate of growth over the past ten years as mentioned above and as i have argued in many of my posts the supply side of the economy has dominated economic growth as it is now measured because a lot of the â credit inflationâ created has gone into the financial loop and does not contribute to â measured â physical economic growth this gets us to the second change alluded to above employment is high and unemployment is low because the â financialâ sector and much of the newly evolving â technologicalâ sector are not measured sufficiently in the current way gdp is measured the financial sector and much of the newly evolving technological sector prosper through the creation of intellectual capital and not physical capital thus employment has grown in these sectors and although these sectors do not add much to the gdp numbers the employment is real and the transformation of the economy is real and because this transformation is based upon the development of intellectual capital and not physical capital the measured growth of labor productivity has fallen and will continue to fall or remain modest physical productivity growth as measured by the current statistical techniques is just not that important any more so the us economy is adding lots of people to the labor market on a regular basis and the unemployment rate has dropped back to levels that existed while credit inflation was just in its infancy fifty years ago but the economy has transitioned to something different intellectual capital is more important now relative to physical capital labor productivity is different now than it was fifty years ago within this environment what should we be focusing upon i believe that we should be focusing upon the unemployment rate in terms of people seeking employment having an unemployment rate of only 3 5 percent is excellent however we should not forget in this picture the labor force participation rate the labor force participation rate is about where it was in the summer of 1978 but a full four points below what it was 18 years ago this is something we need to be worried about because this result represents the fact that there are many americans whose skills donâ t fit the jobs of the â new modern corporation as a consequence a lot of these americans are the ones who â are left behind â these are the americans we need to do something for otherwise what more can you want

capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein have the meanings ascribed to them in the circular the signa transaction and the initial going private proposal in connection with the company s strategic objective to simplify its retail strategy and unlock the value of its real estate the company completed the merger of the retail operations of hbc europe and signa s karstadt warenhaus gmbh in the fourth quarter of 2018 after completing the transaction given the deteriorating state of the european retail business the need for significant incremental capital contributions to fund material operating losses in the european business and the continued need to focus on core operations and strengthen the company s balance sheet the company concluded it was important to pursue a complete exit from the european retail market and fully monetize its european real estate in and around late february 2019 representatives of hbc including mr baker and mr putnam commenced exploratory discussions with representatives of signa about a potential sale to signa of hbc s remaining 50 interest in its european real estate joint venture and 49 99 interest in its european retail joint venture the signa transactions shortly after the commencement of exploratory discussions with signa mr baker considered the viability of hbc using proceeds of the potential signa transactions to complete a buyback of hbc shares or fund other liquidity opportunities for shareholders mr baker also commenced exploratory discussions with the other continuing shareholders as to whether proceeds from the potential signa transactions could provide a portion of the financing for a potential privatization transaction involving hbc and thereby a liquidity opportunity for other hbc shareholders such exploratory discussions included among other things what levels of debt financing and leverage would be appropriate and what other sources of financing could be available on acceptable terms it was determined that without proceeds from the potential signa transactions it was highly unlikely that the debt capital markets would be independently available to support a privatization transaction on terms that would be sustainable for the company mr baker commenced such discussions with representatives of each of fabric luxembourg holdings s a r l fabric hanover investments luxembourg s a hanover and abrams

leith hbc s lead independent director about mr baker s desire to evaluate a potential privatization transaction together with the other continuing shareholders all of which was contingent on proceeding with the signa transactions which as of such date were still being negotiated without any certainty of outcome mr leith consented to mr baker exploring such a transaction and sharing

chris talgo insidesources com for decades the left has advocated for nationalizing the country s health care system under a medicare for all type plan despite their rhetoric however this scheme would do much more harm than good dozens of democrats in the house of representatives and senate have co sponsored or voiced their support for one of the many iterations of medicare for all while m4a activists promise it would reduce health care costs and increase access the exact opposite is likely to occur in fact there are several reasons the united states should avoid implementing medicare for all first m4a is completely unaffordable and would push the united states even further into the debt abyss according to a study by the mercatus center medicare for all would add approximately 32 6 trillion to federal budget commitments during the first 10 years of its implementation 2022 2031 the united states is already more than 23 trillion in debt adding an extra 30 trillion in federal spending over the next decade would cause economic armageddon to put this in perspective the atlantic notes the urban institute a center left think tank highly respected among democrats is projecting that a plan similar to what senator elizabeth warren and senator bernie sanders are pushing would require 34 trillion in additional federal spending over its first decade in operation that s more than the federal government s total cost over the coming decade for social security medicare and medicaid combined according to the most recent congressional budget office projections put another way medicare for all would blow up the federal budget which would cause all sorts of negative consequences huge deficits massive tax hikes high inflation and major cuts to domestic and foreign programs are all but inevitable if medicare for all becomes law second m4a would reduce access to health care services and medications why because the above cost estimate from the mercatus center is on the low end of the spectrum and assume s the legislation achieves its sponsors goals of dramatically reducing payments to health providers in addition to substantially reducing drug prices and administrative costs in other words m4a would wreak havoc on supply and demand within the health care industry which encompasses about one seventh of u s gross domestic product arbitrarily slashing reimbursement rates for medical professionals will dramatically reduce health care services the same principle applies to the availability of existing drugs and those in the developmental stages third m4a with its inherent price controls would almost assuredly lead to health care rationing basic economics and common sense suggest that if the government provides 330 million americans with free health care without increasing health care supply shortages and rationing would be inevitable don t believe this can happen in america well just take a peek at what has happened to our neighbor to the north which implemented a single payer health care system in 1984 thirty five years after it enacted universal health care canada s health care system is rife with excruciatingly long wait times along with several other problems in fact medical wait times in canada are so appalling that 1 040 791 patients who waited for medically necessary treatment last year each lost 1 822 on average due to work time lost according to the canada based fraser institute in far too many cases canadians are forced to wait months on end to receive care the fraser institute notes the average wait time for patients who require medically necessary elective orthopedic surgery is an astounding 41 7 weeks similar horror stories are common in countries with m4a esque programs for example great britain s national health service created in 1948 is in shambles as forbes recently reported nearly a quarter of a million british patients have been waiting more than six months to receive planned medical treatment from the national health service according to a recent report from the royal college of surgeons more than 36 000 have been in treatment queues for nine months or more fourth m4a means major tax increases for all americans according to a recent report from the committee for a responsible federal budget m4a needs to be financed through higher taxes lower spending more borrowing or some combination of the three the report s authors estimate the cost could be covered with a 32 payroll tax a 25 income surtax a 42 value added tax or a public premium averaging 7 500 per capita while m4a advocates tout it will reduce costs for lower and middle income americans the exact opposite appears to be true most americans agree that the u s health care system needs major reforms increasing the government s role in health care via medicaid for all is not the answer however just think if the u s government can t competently run the postal service va hospital system dmvs or amtrak why would we task it with overseeing the extremely complicated and deeply personal health care system chris talgo is an editor at the heartland institute he wrote this for insidesources com

the international monetary fund recently asked a slate of experts for their views on the future of corporate taxation and tax competition most of the fund s interlocutors answered that tax competition was likely to intensify in the foreseeable future since each nation has a sovereign right to set its own taxation who could possibly force tax havens to stop some countries the experts agreed will always offer lower tax rates than their neighbours if it s in their interest to do so mobile profits will seek the lowest tax burden there may be ways to fix egregious forms of abuse but taxing multinational companies at high rates in an ever more tightly integrated global economy hopeless as we move forward into the 2020s we need the confidence to say this view is wrong there is nothing in globalisation that requires corporate tax to disappear the race to the bottom that rages today is a decision we ve collectively made perhaps not fully consciously or explicitly certainly not a choice that was openly debated or voted on but a choice nonetheless we can make other choices and we have to make other choices because the current trend looks unsustainable if globalisation means ever lower taxes for its main winners the big multinationals and ever higher taxes for those it leaves out working class families then it probably has no future tax injustice and inequality will keep increasing and to what end voters falsely convinced that globalisation and fairness are incompatible will be in danger of falling prey to protectionist and xenophobic politicians eventually destroying globalisation itself fortunately there are other equally feasible paths an effective action plan has three pillars exemplarity coordination and sanctions against free riders exemplarity means that each country should police its own multinationals for instance the united kingdom should make sure that uk companies if they don t pay enough abroad at least pay their fair share at home to understand how this could work imagine that by manipulating intra group transactions a british oil and gas company had managed to book 1bn in profits in ireland taxed at say 5 per cent and 1bn in jersey taxed at say 0 per cent there s a problem here the company pays much less tax than it should overall if for illustration london would otherwise have levied it at 25 per cent we call this a tax deficit the good news is that nothing prevents the uk from curbing this deficit itself by collecting the taxes that the tax havens choose not to levy concretely the uk could tax the company s irish income at 20 per cent and its jersey bounty at 25 per cent more generally it could easily impose remedial taxes such that its effective tax rate in each of the countries where it operates equals 25 per cent such a reduction of the company s tax deficit would not violate any international treaty it does not require the cooperation of tax havens it doesn t even require new data the necessary information already exists but if britain did that wouldn t companies move their headquarters to tax havens this threat too can be addressed the first way to do so is to strengthen the regulations that determine where a company is headquartered for instance a firm with most of its activities in britain could be automatically considered british another solution is international cooperation the world s largest economies could all agree that they will apply say a 25 per cent minimum tax rate to their multinationals wherever they operate from there it would be easy to pressure tax havens to join such an agreement with the threat of sanctions if need be each country is of course entitled to its laws but when these laws spill over negatively on to others the victims are entitled to retaliate refusing to take part in a minimal global standard such as an effective corporate tax rate of an unexceptional 25 per cent should be seen for what it is an extreme form of dumping that fills the coffers of some small states and more importantly of global shareholders at the expense of everyone else such practices must be discouraged contrary to what the experts polled by the imf might believe globalisation does not prevent countries from taxing corporations at high rates those who profess that the race to the bottom in corporate tax rates is natural that taking on tax havens is a crime against free trade are not the defenders of globalisation what will make globalisation sustainable is not the disappearance of capital taxation but its reinvention not tax competition but tax coordination not free trade agreements that ignore fiscal issues but international deals that advance tax harmonisation when people embrace these ideas it will become apparent that progressive taxation is not doomed to disappear but that it can be reinvented and expanded in a globalised economy
