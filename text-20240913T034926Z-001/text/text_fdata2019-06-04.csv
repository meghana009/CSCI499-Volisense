claudio katz the takeaway idea is that the imf is the sole authority behind the crisis the fund has always had a privileged role in managing international crises but the debtor relation has never been directly with the imf what typically occurs is a country finds itself indebted to many banks and eventually reaches a point where it can t pay the imf shows up at that point and assumes the role of guarantor of future payment however argentina s current debt with the fund is on par with what is owed to the banks argentina has received a historic 57 billion bailout package from the imf which is actually a problem for the imf in that sense the crisis is not only a concern for argentina but for the imf itself the way this unfolded was unusual the united states demanded the fund loan money to argentina for purely geopolitical reasons with an eye on venezuela the united states is trying to shore up an important ally in the southern cone this was against the fund s own wishes because they knew they were lending to a client that will never pay them back when argentina does reach insolvency for the first time in history it won t be with the banks but directly with the fund hence international financial analysts are concerned about the effects argentina could produce within the imf what all this means is that the fund will assume a hardline stance towards argentina in practice that won t mean further repayment demands but instead a series of deferrals on payments in exchange for deepened austerity the international monetary fund currently has its own representative set up in argentina s central bank the minister of economy is essentially imf director christine lagarde however what is especially troubling nowadays is the level of naivety one finds locally with regard to the imf people seem to think that the government is the sole culprit and that the imf is here to lend a helping hand even the kirchnerist opposition has embraced an image of the imf as if it were a benevolent institution like an old friend the opposition is eager to meet with fund representatives and send a message that we are willing to negotiate it s alarming to see the opposition rushing off to washington rather than raising awareness and encouraging social mobilization in contrast with other periods the bulk of the opposition isn t rallying against the imf there were some gestures in that direction in may june 2018 but those efforts were swept under the rug this is worrying because sooner or later the fund will come back and say very well now it s time for a labor reform bill and a pension reform bill which is the priority of the imf the imf wants to impose a labor reform bill like in brazil and a pension reform bill like greece s now more than ever we need to remember two examples greece and ecuador in ecuador len√≠n moreno campaigned with rafael correa on the slogan i am the anti right candidate he beat the right wing as a progressive candidate and then applied the same austerity measures as macri it s disheartening to find right wing economic policy embraced by so called progressives a more conservative sector of kirchnerism is starting to fall in line with this tendency
jeremiah sokan is a renowned liberian economist and currently represents 47 countries on the board of directors of the green climate fund which manages about 20 billion dollars of climate action monies under the united nations framework convention on climate monrovia economist jeremiah sokan has laid out several recommendations for the weah led government aimed at resuscitating liberia s rapidly dwindling economy according to mr sokan to revitalize the economy president weah should consider setting up three taskforces including the taskforce on economic revitalization taskforce on foreign engagements and international corporation and a taskforce on peace security and reform the primary role of the team on economic revitalization he said is to engage imf and world bank on support to revive the economy through a possible bail out the taskforce on foreign engagements and international corporation s key responsibilities will aim at strengthening the president s network with key regional counterparts and major economies through states visits and other bilateral engagements while the primary role of the peace security and reform taskforce is to engage matters relating to internal peace on the monetary policy front sokan welcomed the president s statements on the constitution of the board of directors and revamping of central bank s administration professionalizing the institution is a right step in the right direction to the credible image of this all important entity he said in addition he called on the president to beef up the capacity of the technical economic management team by adding professionals and experts in economics finance and accounting to diagnose the real triggers of the current inflation the team according to him should begin robust engagements with the imf and work bank on the scope of work at hand and establish within one week the volume or quantity of actual monies in circulation m2 cash checks savings accounts money markets mutual funds loans credit cards bonds in addition he called for the establishment of the volume of money that is really needed to stay in circulation to run the economy finding out the difference between the current money in circulation and the amount the economy needs to run normally and stating why citizens do not trust the banking system enough to save but use the black market mr sokan made the comments when he issued a paper covering wide range of economic issues as well as other national issues of concern he stated that the health of the national economy drives development however the liberian economy has over the years been plagued by unaddressed systematic and structural challenges he said he alleged that past governments simply left key problems un tackled and engaged in peripheral fixes to macroeconomic issues past administrations simply kicked the can down the road on monetary policy he stated according to him liberia faces a contractionary monetary issue leading to high inflation rate which is causing high merchandise prices on the market and rapid depreciation of the liberian dollars against the united states dollars further outlining the economic woes mr sokan stated local currency perceived value is in a free fall purchasing power of ordinary citizen is reduced dwindling economy with no new foreign direct investment and a shrinking tax base as a result of mass layoffs of employees rumors of protest with propensity of sending a message of unsafe unstable country which could exacerbate economic situation from bad to worse he further noted that liberia s economy faces complex systematic and structural challenges that will require time to address major problems according to him the weah led government is very young 15 months old and inherited bad economy from the 2014 ebola crisis in his analysis he the banking sector in liberia is vastly undeveloped and faces numerous challenges that need to be addressed and called on the central bank of liberia to put in place measures that will make it creditable and attractive to customers the key issues are most of the monies in circulation are not in the banking system two currencies liberian and us dollar floating in the hands of ordinary people on a daily basis creating unnecessary exchange rate debate daily june 7 protest touching on the june 7 planned protest mr sokan called on the organizers and all liberians to be tolerant non provocative assemble peacefully he noted that although he is not supporting the protest citizens are entitled to assemble peacefully to petition their leaders as enshrined in article 17 of the constitution
published tuesday 4 june 2019 print disqus richard rick mills the ongoing battle between the united states and china for economic supremacy isn t only being fought in the gilded ballrooms of washington as trade negotiators from either side parry over automobile parts content intellectual property rights government subsidies and the like casualties and victories are also borne out over the decks of hulking freighters that carry the commodities which make up the nuts and bolts of international trade indeed shipping statistics are often sought by economics and traders trying to predict the health of a country s economy or the world economy the baltic dry index bdi is one such leading indicator another is the purchasing managers index pmi pmis are a monthly survey of supply chain managers across 19 industries an economy with a pmi of over 50 is considered to be growing under 50 means an economy is treading water or possibly drowning this article is concerned with the baltic dry index and other shipping statistics such as cargo volumes through west coast ports that we can use to determine who at this stage china or the us is winning the trade war the overall conclusion we at ahead of the herd came up with is that the united states is winning in terms of raw economic data but at a cost to both economies of roughly 165 billion in two way trade the losers also include us consumers who are paying more for imported goods and companies in both countries that can t afford 25 tariffs for an extended period of time baltic dry index created by the london based baltic exchange the baltic dry index is a measure of supply and demand for bulk cargo such as iron ore lumber coal grain etc demand for such bulk shipped as opposed to containerized cargo raw materials is a predictor of future economic growth for example a country that is expanding its steel output will order more iron ore and coal which will increase the demand for shipping these commodities therefore an expanding or contracting bdi is considered to be a leading indicator of industrial production and economic activity the bdi is calculated by assessing multiple shipping rates across 20 routes for each vessel category capesize vessels weighing over 100 000 dead weight tonnes dwt these ships cannot go through the panama canal panamax ships 60 000 80 000 dwt that can go through the panama canal and supramaxes or handymaxes similar in size to a panamax but with specialized loading discharging equipment members of the baltic exchange contact dry bulk shippers worldwide in order to gather the prices of each raw material included in the index then calculate an average price for each the bdi is issued daily those that follow the baltic dry index diligently can glean precious information in which to make investment decisions that few investors are aware of for example the bdi is known to have predicted the 2008 recession when the prices of key commodities in the index suddenly dropped the bdi has also been shown to correlate with stock market indices the movement of the baltic dry index usually shows up around 25 trading days later in the machinations of the s p 500 which is pretty useful as it can help determine when to buy or sell equities a recent article in 321gold shows a graph whereby the bdi and the s p 500 are closely correlated except for january and february 2019 when the lines diverge ie a significant drop in the bdi didn t show up in the s p but the outlier event explained the author was likely the collapse of a tailings dam in brazil which suddenly meant a large decrease in the shipping of ore from vale s minas gerais mine right now the bdi is moving higher which could signal a leg up in the s p 500 if the correlation holds we can also use the bdi to analyze the trade war the index rose to a 2018 high last september but it dropped sharply over 50 in the first two months of the year to the lowest in two years due to declining demand for commodities particularly china the world s largest commodities consumer why would that be well there are two factors at play the first is slowed shipments between china and the us in 2019 as tariffs first introduced in july of 2018 started kicking in many shippers throughout 2018 tried shipping as much product as they could before an increase in tariff rates from 10 to 25 more about that below the second as mentioned is vale s iron ore tailings disaster the two factors account for the decline in the bdi for january and february an article in seeking alpha said february was likely the bottom for shipping rates with some capesize vessels being chartered for under the break even rate of 15 000 a day or more indeed the bdi has risen since then and is currently sitting at just over 1 000 note the five year bdi hit an all time low in the beginning of 2016 which correlates to the bottom of the 2012 16 mining bear market weak global growth now that we understand what the bdi is and how it can be used as an analytical tool we turn to the state of the global economy investors are not only worried about the effects of the trade war on global trade they are also concerned it is weighing on global economic growth what is the state of the world economy what can shipping statistics tell us about where the economy is heading nearly a year into the trade war between china and the us observers are starting to see it in more geopolitical terms no longer is this about tariffs on steel and soybeans it s morphed into a fight over technology ie the conflict with huawei and zte rare earths are being introduced as possible pawns and it can even be framed as the battle for global supremacy between the planet s leading economic and military contenders the united states and china witness the constant tensions in the south china sea china s unsuccessful role in containing north korea and its controversial belt and road initiative which seeks to create a china centric trading block in southern asia to counter us influence the trade war is spilling over into other areas too equity markets are in turmoil stocks of us multinationals have declined and the price of oil ended its worst week of the year last friday us and chinese consumers are having to pay more for imports which is likely to shrink consumption and weigh on each s gdp according to the federal reserve bank of new york the latest round of tariffs will cost the average american household 831 this year in short it s not looking good bank of america merrill lynch recently warned that increased tensions may impact markets severely in a note to clients stating rather ominously the most important point to grasp is whether the trade war is just about trade or instead we are just witnessing the early innings of the most important geopolitical conflict of our time as quoted in yahoo finance cnn paints an equally foreboding picture noting in an article on sunday that treasury yields are down and that global economic data has disappointed which could easily lead to another stock market downturn once the rot sets in escalating tensions between the united states and china clearly pose a problem businesses are saying that new rounds of tit for tat tariffs will hit their bottom lines while economists warn of global ripple effects the situation is made worse by the fact that there s no end to the fight in sight goldman sachs analysts said last week that if the united states moves forward with threatened tariffs on all remaining imports from china it would push the us stock market down an additional 4 markets have already been rattled by trade fears the dow just declined for the fifth straight week its longest weekly losing streak in nearly eight years but it s not just about whether markets wake up to the fact that they d priced in a trade deal that was far from certain apprehension over trade is now magnifying other signs of weakness resurfacing concerns about slowing global growth that dominated markets in december recent economic data has revealed key soft spots manufacturing in europe and china appears weak germany s economy appears to have slowed this quarter to little more than a crawl according to research firm capital economics which pointed to manufacturing and business climate figures the chances of britain crashing out of the european union without a deal have also increased meanwhile the yield on the benchmark 10 year us treasury fell to its lowest level last thursday since late 2017 bond yields tend to fall when investors are worried about sluggish growth then there s us oil which fell nearly 7 last week to 58 63 a barrel it was the worst week in five months but there s more orders for durable goods are down and the pmis of the countries that count are frankly sucking wind wolf street called the us pmi figure the cleanest of the dirty shirts the finance publication notes that orders for durable goods like cars and appliances have steadily ticked down since december and have shown no growth for three months in a row the pmis for us services and manufacturing in may were the lowest since recessionary 2009 after the data was released gdp forecasts for the second quarter were slashed from 2 2 to 2 in the best case scenario barclays plc to 2 25 to 1 in the worst case jpmorgan chase across the pond in europe germany s pmis have been awful according to a survey at least the us is above 50 the pmi of europe s strongest economy slumped to the mid 40s the lowest since july 2012 near the bottom of the euro debt crisis said wolf street placing trade war concerns at the heart of the problem the manufacturing sector has been weak since february but the pmi survey suggests that the sector s woes intensified in may to mean factories will therefore likely act as an increasing drag on the economy in the second quarter trade wars remained top of the list of concerns among manufacturers alongside signs of slower sales and weaker economic growth both at home and in key export markets the survey said meanwhile china s pmi the one everybody watches also slipped further under the 50 threshold from 49 5 in january to 49 2 in february cnbc however sounds a glimmer of hope noting that china s steel imports for the first two months were pretty close to last year s same period this suggests fairly steady demand and fits with a picture of a chinese economy that has lost some momentum but isn t yet at risk of a serious slowdown tabulating the trade war score of course what we all really want to know is who s winning the trade war on may 6 reuters asked that question and came up with some valuable insights we decided to compare their data to our shipment data to see if they match by and large they do for those having trouble keeping track of all these tariffs a recap the trade war kicked off last july with 34 billion of tariffs on chinese imports this was followed by 16 billion worth last august and another 200 billion in september china matched us duties with its own tariffs on american goods the trump administration threatened to up the tariffs on the september list of products from 10 to 25 but that was suspended pending trade talks the collapse of those talks earlier this month means the 25 rate kicks in june 1 the latest development is that a further 325 billion in chinese imports is being put into motion the result of which is that all chinese imports will become subject to tariffs as for the trade war s impact these are the key takeaways according to reuters in the first quarter of 2019 chinese imports tanked by a third compared to last year s q1 and exports fell by a tenth the sector of chinese exports that has been worst hit is machinery and electrical equipment the trade war has knocked between 0 1 and 0 2 off us gdp but for china it could mean a loss of 0 3 to 0 6 of gdp that doesn t seem like a big difference but in gdp terms it is in the first quarter the chinese economy grew by 6 4 compared to 6 7 in the second quarter of last year the last quarter before tariffs were imposed for the us the equivalent figures are 3 2 versus 2 9 the flow of us imports is being re routed in other words goods that would normally come from china are coming from elsewhere like vietnam south korea and mexico the centre for economic policy a think tank estimates 165 billion in trade has been lost or redirected to avoid tariffs oceangoing freight volumes down from record highs we can utilize shipping statistics to trace the pattern of imports and exports that we see imprinted by the trade war first it s interesting to note that 2018 was a record year for shipments of commodities hit by tariffs the reason is retailers stocking up on goods they knew would get hammered with a 15 increase 10 to 25 if trade talks failed this is called front loading and it shows up in port statistics california s three major ports los angeles long beach and oakland handle about half of the united states containerized cargo 2018 saw a notable trend of more imports coming from china due to front loading and a drop off in us exports to china chinese imports to all three ports increased from 5 4 million containers in 2017 to 5 7 million in 2018 exports to china on the other hand dropped from 881 128 containers to 701 493 containers year on year the ceo of maersk the world s largest containerized shipping company remarked that chinese exports to the us grew 5 10 in the third quarter of 2018 versus a 25 30 fall in us exports to china a record 539 5 billion in chinese goods were imported by the us in 2018 but only 120 3 billion worth of american products were shipped fast forward to the present situation which looks quite a bit different seaborne imports into all three california gateways from china have slipped considerably wall street journal reported container imports into los angeles and long beach declined a combined 10 2 compared to february 2017 the port of oakland saw a 5 drop in volumes trading data evidence shows the united states is substituting chinese made products from those manufactured elsewhere according to s p global market intelligence chinese furniture imports fell 13 5 in the first quarter versus a 37 2 increase in imports from vietnam and a 19 3 hike from taiwan refrigerator imports from china dropped 24 1 but south korea and mexico each exported 32 more fridges to the us tire imports from china were down 28 6 replaced by vietnam s which more than doubled to 141 7 us china trade deficit at 5 year low currently the united states is exporting more to china despite tariffs while importing less from china the result as president donald trump hoped is a lessening of the us trade deficit with china in fact the deficit is at a five year low in particular the chinese are importing more coking coal from the states five times as much in april compared to march even though there are 25 tariffs on us thermal coal and coking coal china has also resumed buying us soybeans not so fast i started this article by asking a simple question who is winning the trade war i wanted to take a bit of a different tack by answering the question with shipping data actual shipments are something tangible and therefore have more value in my opinion than gdp data a pmi or imports and exports shipping stats also give us as investors something to watch for they are important indicators of future economic activity and are therefore ignored at our peril remember those who paid attention to the baltic dry index could have avoided the great recession the us is in fact winning the trade war we see it in the slowed imports of chinese goods and increased exports of us goods with the resultant narrowing of the us china trade deficit shipments from china went bonkers last year as us retailers stocked up before getting whacked by 25 tariffs now those same companies are shunning china and cozying up to south korea vietnam and mexico chinese goods are being replaced that was the whole idea but is this not a pyrrhic victory consider that in order to gain the upper hand over the chinese the trump administration has forced a reduction of 165 billion in two way trade global growth is weak the us pmi is barely holding above 50 ie the us economy growing stock markets are nervous critical minerals are just waiting to be hit by china which has a monopoly on them the us has little to zero production of dozens of these economic and defense critical metals meanwhile us and chinese consumers have to pay a hidden tax on the higher cost of hundreds of imported goods granted the trade war winning formula is being reflected in us economic stats which at first blush look pretty good in the first quarter the us economy barreled along at 3 2 a year ago it was at 4 2 economic growth peaked in 2014 at close to 6 when obama was president then dropped under 1 as the us election cycle began in 2015 since trump has taken the helm the trend line is clearly up employment has fallen to 3 6 which is the lowest since the mid 1960s over 50 years ago african american unemployment is at a record low after hitting an all time high of 26 828 on october 3 2018 the dow jones industrial average traded sideways until april 5 2019 when the closing bell rang on a yearly top of 26 424 the s p 500 is up about 20 since its december low the economy has added over 5 4 million jobs since trump and his team entered the white house after a decade of stagnation real wages hourly pay accounting for inflation have grown 3 2 an economy that shows those kind of numbers usually has high inflation but even here the united states is well within a comfortable range at 1 6 it s actually below the fed s 2 target june will mark the 10th year of a growing us economy but this economy is built on a weak foundation based on tax cuts and high corporate earnings derived from stock buybacks in december 2017 the trump administration passed the tax cuts and jobs act the legislation slashed the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 and the top individual tax rate shrunk to 37 it also cut income tax rates doubled the standard deduction and eliminated personal exemptions but the most important change concerned the repatriation of profits that us corporations were holding overseas under the tax cuts and jobs act companies were incentivized to bring their overseas profits to the united states where they would be taxed at a one time rate of 15 5 which is lower than the regular corporate tax rate of 21 suddenly these companies found themselves flush with cash and they needed to find a way to spend it stock buybacks are a good option because they allow management to stuff cash back into the company indirectly by reducing the share float it makes them their earnings per share look good which drive fat compensation packages in 2018 us companies set a record 1 trillion in stock buybacks as an example of how companies have used buyback programs to improve their metrics consider apple since 2012 apple s buyback program cut its outstanding shares by one quarter doubled its earnings per share and ended up with a 150 increase in its share price there is clearly a strong connection between repatriation stock buybacks and higher than normal corporate earnings is it any coincidence that half a trillion dollars worth of overseas profits were brought home in 2018 during which time the united states saw the most share buybacks in history along with sky high corporate earnings data firm refinitiv estimates profit growth among s p 500 companies at 23 in 2018 s p stocks were up 13 in the first quarter of 2019 the best q1 performance since 1998 and a booming stock market i don t think so and even though repatriation has run its course buybacks are popular on wall street share repurchases have increased every quarter of the last four quarters and the buying frenzy is set to continue lower taxes and high corporate earnings are certainly helping the us economy to grow according to the congressional budget office cbo about 0 3 of the 2 9 gdp growth in 2018 can be attributed to the 1 5 trillion tax cut the repatriation of corporate profits appears to be a good thing the problem is in allowing companies to keep more of their profits the government is depriving itself of tax revenue the cbo forecasts the 1 5 trillion tax cut will add 1 5 trillion to the national debt over the next 11 years how will the government pay for such massive ticket items as the 2 trillion infrastructure plan just proposed print more money i guess and heave it onto the mountainous debt pile the trump administration like the reagan adminstration before it believes that robust corporate earnings will put more money into the hands of workers the trickle down effect to spend but that isn t happening cnn quotes the congressional joint committee on taxation in reporting that two thirds of taxpayers paid around 100 less in taxes in 2018 about the cost of a nice dinner for two in fact the tax cuts worked out much better for those making between 500 000 and a million who were an average 5 2 richer compared to households making under 50 000 in 2018 whose after tax income rose by just 0 6 the rich are indeed getting richer granted consumer spending is up 12 7 trillion in the first quarter of 2018 to 13 trillion in q1 2019 which is important because it represents two thirds of the us economy but as we discovered when researching what is behind the us economy s strength this just means more consumer debt us credit card debt skyrocketed to 870 billion in 2018 a new record so the us is winning the trade war for now but what happens after all the overseas profits have been blown on share buybacks and the tariffs really begin to bite the us white shirt of the dirty shirt western economies might become a tad bit soiled worse what if the trade war turns nasty and beijing decides to pull out the big guns china could stop buying us treasuries which would cause the us dollar to plunge or slap embargoes on critical metals like rare earths and lithium crucial to the new electric economy and the defense of the nation conclusion economist stephen roach has an interesting take on the trade war writing in project syndicate roach invokes history to expose a parallel between the us trade conflict with japan in the 1980s and the current battle with china he argues that the united states should really look in the mirror and address its own problems notably the low us savings rate before throwing stones at asia back in the 1980s japan was portrayed as america s greatest economic threat not only because of allegations of intellectual property theft but also because of concerns about currency manipulation state sponsored industrial policy a hollowing out of us manufacturing and an outsize bilateral trade deficit in its standoff with the us japan ultimately blinked but it paid a steep price for doing so nearly three lost decades of economic stagnation and deflation today the same plot features china notwithstanding both countries objectionable mercantilism japan and china had something else in common they became victims of america s unfortunate habit of making others the scapegoat for its own economic problems like japan bashing in the 1980s china bashing today is an outgrowth of america s increasingly insidious macroeconomic imbalances in both cases a dramatic shortfall in us domestic saving spawned large current account and trade deficits setting the stage for battles 30 years apart with asia s two economic giants i agree with roach as much as i am comforted in knowing that america is so far beating china i can t help thinking is this all going to come back and bite us in the end richard rick mills aheadoftheherd

overview the global capital markets are stabilizing today after taking a body blow of broadening the use of us tariffs in migration dispute with mexico threatening the ratification of nafta 2 0 and still escalating hostile rhetoric between the us and china and the threat of anti trust action against the largest digital platforms the decline in equities is moderating today most of the large asian markets were modestly lower but singapore indonesia and thailand gained today and are net gainers over the past week so is taiwan even though share prices eased today australian shares stabilized 0 2 vs 1 2 monday after the central bank delivered its first rate cut in three years european markets are also firmer today is the first six sessions that the dow jones stoxx 600 has risen above the previous day s high us shares are trading firmer the s p 500 gapped lower last friday and that gap found between roughly 2769 0 and 2776 7 may be of technical importance the us 10 year is threatening to end the five day nearly 25 bp plunge but the sharp drop yesterday kept global yields under pressure the dollar is narrowly mixed against the majors the european complex is slightly firmer but sterling and the swiss franc the yen and the aussie and kiwi are little changed to marginally softer amid consolidation asia pacific governor lowe delivered his first rate as head of the reserve bank of australia and brought the cash rate to a record low of 1 25 the markets had it fully discounted and there was not much of a reaction when it came lowe did little to sway the market away from expectations that there will likely be a follow up cut in q3 and in fact his statement that expectations for another cut are not unreasonable will unpin expectations going forward the rba continues to put an emphasis on the labor market and yesterday s news of an 8 4 drop in job postings and news before the meeting concluded today of an unexpected contraction in april retail sales 0 1 vs 0 2 median forecast in the reuters poll did not help matters tomorrow australia will report q1 gdp the quarterly pace may have quickened 0 5 vs 0 2 but the year over year is likely to have slowed for the third consecutive quarter 1 8 vs 2 3 the african swine flu has forced china to cull its swine herd though the incentive structure may distort the culling and the slaughter rush to market less feed is necessary and the decline in soy imports reflect this in part however late yesterday due to what the press described as atypical mad cow found in brazil has forced a halt of beef exports to china china s is the largest foreign buyer of brazilian beef in 2018 it imported about 1 5 bln of brazilian beef to put that in perspective the cost of us rare earth imports from china were for less than half of that the dollar slipped below jpy108 for the first time since mid january weakness in stocks and the rally in bonds was the main pressure we have highlighted that the jpy107 75 area which is a 61 8 retracement of the rally from the flash crash low and the measuring objective of a chart pattern double top is nearer jpy107 00 yesterday s high near jpy108 45 may offer nearby cap on thursday there are over 5 bln of in expiring options struck between jpy108 00 and jpy108 50 the australian dollar marginally extended its recent gains to approach 0 7000 but is consolidating at little changed levels in the european morning it is holding above 0 6950 where an a 705 mln option is set to expire today the dollar firmed slightly against the chinese yuan at cny6 9120 it is at a four day high europe a couple days ahead of the ecb s meeting the eurozone reported softer than expected may inflation figures the headline cpi fell to 1 2 from 1 7 in april economists had projected a 1 3 pace the decline is mostly due to core prices excluding food and energy the core rate fell to 0 8 from 1 3 this was also slightly larger move than had been expected as we noted before the core rate bottomed in 2015 at 0 6 the news reinforces expectations that the ecb staff will shave its forecasts and that the ecb will provide generous terms for the new two year loan facility in president trump s campaign to encourage the uk to leave the eu he promises a big trade deal unlike past american presidents who view an integrated europe to be in us interests trump articulates the concern of others that europe is free rider on us defense expenditures and takes advantage of the us on trade in this rubric emu is a small bretton woods for german that gives it an economic sphere of influence and dilutes the iron of the old deutschmark with weaker alloys giving it a hyper competitive currency which it exploits by exporting 47 of its gdp in 2017 one scenario that is being debated is that if the us were to go ahead with trump s threatened 25 tariff on autos and then exempts the uk as part of a larger trade deal emu car and parts producers and especially german producers would likely have to consider moving production to the uk the euro rose by nearly 2 3 of a percent yesterday it does not sound like much but it is the biggest single day advance since january 25 it kissed last month s high of 1 1265 it extended the gains in asia but early european action capped it in front of 1 1280 the 1 1285 area corresponds to a 38 2 retracement of this year s decline the 50 retracement is closer to 1 1340 just above the april high of around 1 1325 there are roughly 630 mln euros in an option struck at 1 13 that expires today and 1 4 bln euros at 1 14 that expires shortly after draghi s press

strain but economic momentum remains weak emerging and developing economy growth is constrained by sluggish investment and risks are tilted to the downside these risks include rising trade barriers renewed financial stress and sharper than expected slowdowns in several major economies the world bank says in its june 2019 global economic prospects heightened tensions subdued investment structural problems that misallocate or discourage investment also weigh on the outlook stronger economic growth is essential to reducing poverty and improving living standards said world bank group president david malpass current economic momentum remains weak while heightened debt levels and subdued investment growth in developing economies are holding countries back from achieving their potential it s urgent that countries make significant structural reforms that improve the business climate and attract investment they also need to make debt management and transparency a high priority so that new debt adds to growth and investment growth among advanced economies as a group is anticipated to slow in 2019 especially in the euro area due to weaker exports and investment u s growth is forecast to ease to 2 5 this year and decelerate to 1 7 in 2020 euro area growth is projected to hover around 1 4 in 2020 21 with softness in trade and domestic demand weighing on activity despite continued

faster growth trajectory the goal of lowering extreme poverty under 3 percent by 2030 will remain unreachable analytical sections address key current topics government debt has risen substantially in emerging and developing economies as hard won cuts in public debt ratios prior to the financial crisis have to a large extent been reversed emerging and developing economies need to strike a careful balance between borrowing to promote growth and avoiding risks associated with excessive borrowing growth rates in low income countries are expected to rise to 6 in 2020 from 5 4 in 2019 but that is still not enough to substantially reduce poverty while a number of low income countries progressed to middle income status between 2000 and 2018 the remaining low income countries face steeper challenges to achieving similar progress many are poorer than the countries that made the leap to higher income levels and are fragile disadvantaged by geography and heavily reliant on agriculture investment growth among emerging and developing economies is expected to remain subdued and below historical averages held back by sluggish global growth limited fiscal space and structural constraints a sustained pickup in investment growth is necessary to meet key development goals business climate reforms can help encourage private investment sharp currency depreciations are more common in emerging and developing economies than in advanced economies and central banks are often required to respond to these fluctuations to maintain price stability the exchange rate pass through to inflation is more limited when central banks pursue credible inflation targets operate within a flexible exchange rate regime and are independent of the central government in the current environment of low global interest rates and weak growth additional government borrowing might appear to be an attractive option for financing growth enhancing projects said world bank prospects group

conditions and the ability of authorities to calibrate supportive monetary and fiscal policies to address external challenges and other headwinds in the rest of the region growth is also expected to moderate to 5 1 percent in 2019 before rebounding modestly to 5 2 percent in 2020 and 2021 as global trade stabilizes europe and central asia regional growth is expected to firm to 2 7 in 2020 from a

introduction and summary over the past several decades as concentrations of income and wealth have approached historic levels taxes on the very wealthy have not kept up in fact taxes on the ultrarich have gone in the opposite direction tax changes enacted since the 1980s including the recent tax cuts and jobs act tcja passed in december 2017 have eroded taxes on the people who have benefited the most from the economy thereby aiding and abetting the widely acknowledged and troubling increase in wealth inequality these changes have worsened a structural defect in the u s tax code specifically its failure to tax massive accumulations of wealth this site is protected by recaptcha and the google privacy policy and terms of service apply the result is that america s tax code no longer adheres to the core principle of ability to pay the idea that taxes should be based on a person s capacity to pay taxes 1 instead today s tax code turns that principle on its head by letting the wealthiest of the wealthy pay virtually nothing on their gains not only are top tax rates on ordinary income low by historical standards the uber wealthy also stockpile increasing amounts of capital income while paying little or no tax on those accretions of wealth the resulting negative feedback loop whereby the rich use their wealth to influence the u s political system to skew policy in their favor including giving themselves even more tax cuts undermines democracy in many cases this allows economic elites to get what they want even if a majority of citizens disagree 2 the tcja is a prime example of this problem the bill passed into law despite overwhelming public opposition to tax cuts for the wealthy 3 and some lawmakers admitted that the motivation behind the bill was to satisfy political donors 4 reversing this troubling trend will require a higher top tax rate for those with extremely high incomes as well as a better way of incorporating wealth and the income it generates into the determination of how much tax a person owes accurately accounting for wealth is key to establishing a fair tax system policymakers have many options when it comes to taxing wealth or taking wealth into account including implementing innovative approaches to the tax system and revamping existing provisions of the tax code well designed adjustments to account for the current composition of income and wealth at the top could slow the ballooning imbalance in the structure of the u s tax system moreover making these adjustments could lead to a more inclusive economy in the long run especially if the revenues are invested in areas such as education infrastructure and scientific research finally as policymakers consider ways to better account for income and wealth inequality in the u s tax code they should beware of myths surrounding taxation of the wealthy that may be used to push back against new proposals this report challenges these misleading and commonly cited claims made by opponents of rebalancing the tax code and putting the economy on a better track failing to adequately tax extreme wealth contributes to economic inequality over the past several decades in the united states the very wealthy have experienced disproportionately large income growth compared to everyone else that income comes in part from wages and salaries but an increasingly large share of income among the wealthy derives from the assets they own those assets minus any debts owed represent the net worth or wealth of an individual and the ultrarich now hold an astounding share of all u s wealth disparities in wages and salaries are huge by one estimate the typical ceo in 2017 made 347 times the salary of the average american worker compared to 20 times as much 50 years ago 5 the wages of the average american worker used to keep pace with the growth of the u s economy but in recent decades workers wages have stagnated in real terms 6 when other sources of income are counted such as self employment and business income capital gains interest income and income from government programs nearly one quarter of u s income goes to the top 1 percent of income earners while a mere 14 percent goes to the bottom half of income earners see figure 1 disparities in income however are dwarfed by disparities in wealth the assets an individual owns minus the debts they owe wealth encompasses everything of significant value that a person owns including real estate corporate stock or ownership interests in a noncorporate business such as a partnership s corporation or limited liability corporation llc most of the assets the wealthy hold today are financial assets which are nonphysical assets that often can be easily converted to cash in 2016 80 4 percent of the wealth of the top 1 percent consisted of financial assets such as corporate stock financial securities mutual funds interests in personal trusts and ownership interests in unincorporated businesses 7 the value of financial assets has grown significantly over time wealth disparities are greater in the united states than in any other country in the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd 8 in the united states the top 1 percent holds more wealth than the bottom 90 percent of the population see figure 2 this inequity is even more stark among the uber wealthy or the top 0 1 percent and the top 0 01 percent the incomes and wealth of this ultra rich demographic have reached unprecedented levels 9 meanwhile middle class wealth is growing much more slowly than wealth at the top and still has not recovered the losses from the 2008 financial crisis and the great recession 10 close to half of all american households have less wealth today in real terms than the median household had in 1970 11 wealth inequality has also worsened along racial and ethnic lines since the great recession by 2014 the median net worth of a white household was 141 900 thirteen times the median net worth of a black household of only 11 000 12 structural changes in the tax code favoring the wealthy occurred over the same period of time that income and wealth inequality grew in the late 1980s the top marginal income tax rate dropped well below 50 percent and today stands at 37 percent 13 that means that a lawyer who makes 650 000 pays the same top tax marginal tax rate as a ceo who makes an annual salary of 10 million 14 this was not always the case since the enactment of the income tax in 1913 the u s top marginal income tax rate has typically been 50 percent or higher 15 in fact for more than four decades the top tax rate was 70 percent or higher in the past few decades payroll taxes on wages and salaries to fund social security and medicare also increased significantly with the combined rate rising from 11 7 percent in 1975 to 15 3 percent today the larger social security portion of payroll taxes applies only on earnings below a certain threshold currently 132 900 this failing of the tax code with respect to wages and salaries as well as income from certain assets that are also subject to ordinary tax rates such as interest on certain bonds or a bank account is straightforward and easy to understand the rates are simply too low for those who make the most however the failings of the tax system with respect to wealth and much of the income it generates are more complicated and extensive they are the primary reason why the tax system favors the wealthy like the reduction in top rates on salaries the weakening of taxes on wealth and wealth related income has also occurred over the past few decades most recently through the tcja how the structure of the tax system heavily favors those with great wealth the enormous amount of wealth held by the top 1 percent yields a variety of types of income most of which are given special treatment in the u s tax system the tax system favors both the income produced by wealth assets and the assets themselves which normally increase in value capital income includes dividends capital gains from the sale of assets interest on bonds and other financial assets and profits from businesses a person owns because the very wealthy hold most of the financial assets in the united states capital income represents a much greater share of their total income and much of that capital income is taxed at special low rates see figure 3 capital income also includes economic rents which are the payments an owner receives from an asset that exceed what is deemed economically or socially necessary in other words returns beyond what is considered normal in a competitive market 16 economic rents usually exist when one person or company is the sole owner of the asset or when there is no competition in the market for that asset 17 experts cite a number of factors contributing to the extraordinary growth in economic rents in recent decades these include increased concentration in industries18 such as technology and finance and the proliferation of patents and copyrights in industries such as pharmaceutical drugs and entertainment both of which confer monopoly like benefits 19 rents have enabled a small group of the wealthy to capture a very large share of profits on certain assets which helps to explain the skyrocketing wealth among the top 0 1 and 0 01 percent in addition to rents capital income may include labor income that is disguised as capital income one well known example is the practice of private equity fund managers taking a portion of their compensation out of their fund s profits this carried interest makes this portion of their fees appear to be capital income which is taxed at a much lower rate than wage and salary income large income disparities today are all the more concerning because they indicate that the wealth gap is likely to keep growing individuals with high capital incomes save increasing amounts and acquire more assets while those with less capital income fall further behind for the wealthy the tax system s treatment of capital assets and the income they generate is a gift that keeps on giving while some capital income is taxed as ordinary income most capital assets and capital income receive favorable treatment under the u s tax code compared to the treatment of wages and salaries the result is a tax code that is heavily tilted toward the wealthy who own the majority of high value capital assets 20 over the past few decades legislative changes most recently in tcja have weakened taxation of capital income even as the stockpile of capital assets held by the wealthy has grown dramatically in part because this wealth is compounded by lower taxed income from those assets together these changes mean that the tax code has played a significant role in helping the rich get richer by enabling them to avoid some or all taxes related to their ownership of capital assets and amass ever larger amounts of wealth more than they would have if the tax code were more equitable here are just some of the ways in which the u s tax code favors wealth and the income it generates lower tax rate on capital gains and dividend income in any given year the wealthy may receive income from their capital assets such as gains from the sale of a capital asset or dividends on stock this capital income is subject to a much lower tax rate of 20 percent 21 the wealthy are best positioned to take advantage of this favorable rate according to the tax policy center the top 1 percent of households with incomes greater than 750 000 in 2018 reported nearly 69 percent of all capital gain on tax returns and 46 percent of all qualified dividend income 22 some capital income such as interest on a bank account or bond annuity income and royalty income as well as short term capital gain or assets held for less than a year is treated as ordinary income and thus is subject to the same ordinary income tax rates as wages and salaries the top tax rate on ordinary income is currently 37 percent new lower tax rate on pass through business income over the past few decades there has been a sharp increase in income from so called pass through businesses 23 pass through businesses such as partnerships s corporations and llcs do not pay the corporate income tax instead all of their income is passed through to the individual owners shareholders or partners to be taxed at their individual tax rates changes in federal tax rates combined with laws passed at the state level in the 1980s and 1990s made it more favorable for many businesses to operate as pass throughs rather than as corporations these businesses could retain limited liability without having to pay the corporate tax and average effective tax rates for income from pass through businesses were significantly lower than the combined effective tax rate on corporate profits that were distributed to shareholders in the form of capital gains and dividends 24 in recent decades the number of pass through businesses has increased dramatically income from these businesses has grown as a share of total business income surpassing income from regular corporations that pay the corporate income tax incredibly while pass through business income on average was already taxed at a lower effective tax rate than corporate income before the tcja was passed the 2017 law established a new significant loophole for many pass throughs a 20 percent deduction for certain pass through business income 25 proponents of the deduction claimed that it would benefit small businesses but they obscured the much greater benefit to large businesses and the wealthiest individuals 26 subsequent regulations interpreting the new deduction made it even more regressive 27 a recent analysis by the u s congress joint committee on taxation confirmed the tilt toward larger businesses it found that in 2018 only 4 9 percent of individuals with eligible pass through business taxable incomes were high income taxpayers defined as individuals with business incomes of at least 315 000 for joint returns yet these higher income business owners claimed 66 percent of the total benefit from the deduction 28 in fact the new pass through deduction combined with the tcja s new business expensing provisions and corporate tax rate cut delivered much larger benefits to big businesses than to small businesses 29 no tax on unrealized gain or deferral perhaps the greatest tax advantage of owning capital assets is that the gain in value of those assets is generally not taxed at all so long as the assets are not sold this untaxed increase in value is called unrealized gain and the ability to avoid paying tax until the asset is sold or transferred to another person or entity is referred to as deferral the wealthy have so much income and wealth that many can afford to hold on to capital assets indefinitely thereby shielding them from taxation as their assets grow in value how much income they realize is largely in their control such as deciding when or whether to sell their assets until they do the gains are unrealized and therefore untaxed moreover the wealthy can strategically sell some assets at a loss in order to offset the gains that they do realize on other assets the gain on capital assets can be substantial over time for example corporate stock a type of capital asset soars in value when the stock market goes up and the market has hit record highs in recent years 30 corporate stock may also increase in value as a result of corporate tax cuts such as those enacted in the tcja 31 a huge tax cut for corporations represents a windfall for past investments made by those firms increasing the value of the company s stock while precise estimates are not currently available the evidence above suggests that unrealized and thus untaxed gain on capital assets represents a significant portion of wealth at the top gains on primary residences and retirement accounts are tax favored as policymakers consider these assets foundational to middle class wealth however as shown in figure 4 even if gains on these assets are excluded the majority of unrealized capital gains are held by the top one percent even though assets generally must be held in order to defer tax on the gain the wealthy can still derive substantial benefits from the assets they hold one way is to simply borrow against the assets because amounts borrowed are not considered income for tax purposes professor edward mccaffery refers to this borrowing against capital assets as the monetization of unrealized appreciation and cites as an example the 10 billion line of credit secured by oracle ceo larry ellison in 2014 32 merely owning valuable capital assets may enable a wealthy person to obtain loans at very low interest rates since creditors know that wealthy borrowers can liquidate assets if needed the wealthy can enjoy use of the loaned funds while keeping their assets under some circumstances they may even be able to deduct the interest on the loan thereby lowering their taxes on other income when a wealthy debtholder dies assets can be sold immediately by the heirs who will owe no income tax on the unrealized appreciation due to the stepped up basis rule described below they can use the proceeds to pay off the debt keeping what is left tax free 33 wealthy taxpayers also can avoid tax on the unrealized gain on their assets by donating the assets to charity this results in a double tax benefit the wealthy donor never pays tax on the gain and can claim a charitable deduction based on the full market value of the assets at the time of donation 34 stepped up basis normally gain in the value of an asset is taxed when the owner sells or transfers the asset however if a person transfers an asset through a gift or bequest no income tax is triggered if a person holds an asset until they die neither the individual nor their estate will ever pay income tax on the gain that accrued during the individual s lifetime though some estate tax may apply as discussed below in addition because of a provision in the tax code called stepped up basis individuals who inherit the assets do not have to pay income tax on that gain either only on gain that accrues after they inherit the asset 35 suppose for example a parent bought stock for 1 million the 1 million what the parent paid is called their basis in the stock now suppose they held it until they died at which point it was worth 3 million the parent s estate would not pay income tax on the 2 million gain yet had the parent sold the stock during their lifetime after its value increased to 3 million the parent would have had to pay income tax on the 2 million gain their heir or heirs would not pay income tax on that 2 million gain because heirs only pay income tax on gain occurring after the date of inheritance and then only if and when they sell the asset if the heir sells the asset immediately after inheriting it they would pay no tax because when the asset is bequeathed the basis is stepped up to its stock market value at the time of the parent s death in this case 3 million in other words the heir inherits the asset with a basis of 3 million under 2019 tax rates the income tax savings for the wealthy heir on the 2 million of unrealized gain could be as much as 430 970 36 decimated estate tax the modern estate tax which is essentially a one time tax imposed when wealth is transferred at death was intended in part to break up large concentrations of wealth 37 over time however the estate tax has been significantly weakened and there are many loopholes in the tax system that enable the wealthy to bypass the estate tax altogether the tcja further weakened the estate tax which now only applies to estates worth more than 22 8 million per couple or 11 4 million for singles meaning that the tax only applies to the portion of the estate value that exceeds the threshold 38 in 2018 the tax policy center estimated that of the 2 7 million americans who would die in 2018 only about 0 07 percent or 1 in 1 400 people would pay any estate tax 39 table 1 in the appendix summarizes the disparate tax treatment of different forms of income and wealth it shows how the tax code does a thorough job of taxing wages and salaries but weakens substantially as it moves from short term capital income to long term capital gains and dividends to unrealized gain on assets a person owns to overall wealth the tcja demonstrated that corruption is exacerbating the tax system s structural failings in 2017 the economy was growing and corporate profits and wealth at the top were soaring yet tax revenues were low congress had cut taxes numerous times over the preceding two decades and federal revenues were falling further behind federal spending even though discretionary spending had been subject to tight limits 40 in addition mainstream economists pointed out the coming costs of an aging population 41 they urged against tax cuts and in favor of making long overdue investments in education and improvements to crumbling infrastructure all measures that would make the economy healthier and more equitable in the long term 42 instead in a display of unprecedented partisanship and dysfunctional lawmaking congress rushed through changes to the tax code that ran completely counter to the preferences of the american people 43 there were no public hearings allowing affected taxpayers to express their views on the proposed changes 44 the congressional majority drafting the legislation on a strictly partisan basis behind closed doors openly admitted the pressure from their wealthy donors to pass favorable tax changes and their fear that failure to do so would mean no additional campaign funds 45 the tax cuts that emerged from this tortured process and were signed into law by president donald trump will enable the wealthy to further enrich themselves and their families including by gaming the tax code even more than they have in the past the tcja is already expanding the class of well heeled tax advisers who have a vested interest in seeing tax cuts continue unfettered 46 the returns on investment for those who participate in this corrupt feedback loop are immediate and substantial even as hundreds of billions to trillions of dollars in tax revenue are lost this dysfunctional tax policymaking process and the ways in which the ultrawealthy unduly influence legislation pose a serious threat to u s democracy the major provisions of the tax law that benefited the wealthy included a reduction in the top individual income tax rate from 39 6 percent to 37 percent a new 20 percent deduction for many forms of pass through business income and a large increase in the exemption from the individual alternative minimum tax in addition the tcja dramatically weakened the estate tax and cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent a boon to the wealthy who own the majority of stock the tax policy center estimated that the new law increased after tax incomes for people with incomes of more than 1 million by 3 3 percent compared to only 1 3 percent or less for people earning less than 100 000 47 in dollar terms the disparity appears even more stark millionaires received an average tax cut of 69 840 while people making less than 100 000 received a tax cut averaging only 453 moreover if lawmakers respond to the huge cost of the tax cuts by cutting spending on medicare medicaid supplemental nutrition assistance program benefits or other programs middle and low income taxpayers could be disproportionately affected and find themselves worse off than if there had been no tax cuts at all 48 the many new loopholes and tax cuts in the tcja are a windfall to the wealthy and corporations however as egregious as they are they represent just one layer of icing on what was already a very rich cake the fundamental failing of the current tax system the fact that it is tilted in favor of the wealthy long predated the tcja the assets held by those at the top have been accumulating for decades and merely increasing tax rates on the future realized income from those assets will do little to slow the rate at which those assets are likely to grow eliminating reducing or offsetting the wide array of tax advantages for those who hold the largest amount of capital assets is an important first step toward restoring balance in the u s tax system and addressing income and wealth inequality there are many ways to tax extreme wealth including a wealth tax there are several options to better tax extreme wealth one approach would be to tax net worth above a very high threshold on an annual basis lawmakers considering this innovative tax should analyze a number of options and design possibilities in addition to this direct approach of a tax on net worth there are many ways to better incorporate wealth into the existing tax system to ensure that extreme wealth does not slip through the cracks a wealth tax a tax on extreme wealth would address concerns about wealth inequality in a straightforward manner and recognize that individuals ability to pay tax is a function of both their income and their wealth under this type of tax wealthy individuals would assess the total value of all of their assets at the end of the year and subtract any debts they owe to arrive at their net worth or wealth a small tax would then be imposed on their net worth drawing from examples in other countries and proposals advanced by tax experts in the united states other features should include comprehensive base the base in a wealth tax the amount on which the tax is applied is an individual s net worth or wealth ideally no assets should be excluded from the tax this broader base would increase the revenue raised by the tax countries where wealth taxes did not work out well in part struggled with exemptions for specific types of assets 49 exempting assets both adds to administrative complexity and encourages wealthy taxpayers to shift the composition of their assets in order to avoid tax the need for specific asset exemptions is greatly diminished if there is a very high uniform exemption amount so that the tax only applies to the very wealthy uniform exemption a direct tax on wealth typically is applied only to the amount of an individual s wealth that exceeds a uniform exemption amount or threshold the higher the exemption amount the fewer families that will be affected by the tax under a proposal advanced by sen elizabeth warren d ma for example only families with wealth exceeding 50 million would be affected by the tax according to economists emmanuel saez and gabriel zucman at this exemption amount the top 1 percent of income earners would pay 97 percent of the tax 50 low and progressive rates tax experts recommend a relatively low tax rate if the wealth tax will be imposed on an annual basis this rate would keep growth at the very top in check and it would also take back a small portion of the untaxed gain accrued over previous years proposed annual rates for wealth taxes have varied but are usually very low 51 some proposals appropriately call for progressive rates or higher marginal tax rates for the most extreme levels of wealth 52 as with all taxes there are challenges to administering a wealth tax opponents claim that the tax would be unconstitutional though the counterarguments for that claim are robust as discussed later in this report two administrative challenges to a wealth tax relate to valuation and tax avoidance valuation a wealth tax requires adding up the total value of an individual s assets before subtracting the cost of any debts the individual owes for publicly traded assets such as stock valuation is relatively easy however ownership interests in a nonpublicly traded business and other hard to value assets can present greater challenges while this is perhaps the single biggest challenge of administering a wealth tax it is not necessarily as difficult as detractors claim moreover administrative mechanisms and proxies can be developed for valuing assets under provisions in the current tax code tax administrators and accountants already have experience with the process of totaling assets and valuing them for purposes of the estate and gift tax and for charitable contributions 53 most u s localities also impose real and personal property taxes which require valuation finally some argue that the value of certain types of assets change frequently an issue that can be addressed by averaging in any event fluctuation in value of assets should not be a reason to abandon a wealth tax altogether in our digital world where there is greater information sharing between the tax authorities of different countries locating and monitoring the value of assets seems to be less of a problem than it once was tax avoidance and evasion another potential challenge of imposing a tax on net worth is that the very wealthy may attempt to evade the tax by shifting assets offshore or avoid the tax by shifting the composition of their assets toward assets that are more difficult to value these problems are not new and there are many strategies already developed by tax policymakers and administrators to address these issues in other areas including the estate tax 54 an analysis of the wealth tax in switzerland also suggests that the avoidance problem may be exaggerated 55 all taxes have administrative challenges that must be weighed against the potential benefits which may be significant under a wealth tax a wealth tax would gradually tax a portion of the wealth that has accumulated over the past several decades as the structural failings of the tax code enabled extreme wealth accumulation while also placing a check on the accumulation of even larger fortunes going forward in addition it would improve fairness between extremely wealthy individuals who receive little if any wage salary or other income that is taxed as ordinary income and regular wage or salary earners who have little if any wealth and who also pay a substantial amount of payroll tax and to the extent that the revenues from a wealth tax are used to improve opportunities for others through public investments such as in education health care child care and paid leave the tax would help make the prosperous u s economy more inclusive finally a wealth tax recognizes that the wealthy have benefited either directly or indirectly from a wide range of government goods and services a wealth tax would rebalance the tax code toward a more coherent concept of ability to pay and would gradually address the enormous amounts of untaxed wealth accumulated especially by the top 0 1 percent over the past few decades from tax cuts and the soaring after tax profits of corporations and large pass through businesses other options for increasing taxes on the very wealthy while a comprehensive wealth tax is a direct way to rebalance the u s tax system and begin to remove the strong bias in favor of the wealthy there are other options for increasing taxes on excessive ownership of capital assets and the income they generate like a wealth tax these approaches would help restore the principle of ability to pay some of the options that follow could and in some cases should be accomplished simultaneously they are not necessarily substitutes for each other or for a wealth tax though policymakers should consider potential interactions of these proposals with each other and with existing provisions of the tax code mark to market taxation of unrealized capital gains because the wealth tax above is imposed on a person s net worth it falls on the full value of a wealthy individual s assets minus any debts they owe not just on the increases in value that have accrued on the assets while the person has owned them still since a substantial portion of wealth at the top consists of unrealized gains taxing them annually would go a long way toward balancing the tax code that is because the ability to defer paying taxes on the unrealized gain is one way that the wealthy increase their wealth even as wage earners who hold few if any capital assets see most of their income taxes withheld from their paychecks 56 under this approach tax would be paid each year on any unrealized gain that occurred during the previous year the owner s basis in the asset what they paid plus any taxes already paid on gains in earlier years is subtracted from the value of the asset at the end of the year with the net gain included in income to be taxed that year preferably at ordinary tax rates tax policy experts refer to this option as mark to market taxation of capital assets because it functions as if all capital assets were sold with any gains taxed and repurchased at the market price at the end of the year with the taxpayer s new basis marked to the market price at the end of the year 57 as with a wealth tax publicly traded assets are more easily taxed under this approach since there is a readily ascertainable market price however non publicly traded assets such as private businesses are harder to value proponents of mark to market taxation have developed various suggestions for how to handle assets that are more difficult to value typically they suggest not taxing the assets annually but instead imposing an extra charge at the time of realization that takes away the benefit of deferring the tax upon sale the taxpayer would pay both income tax on the gain that is the value that exceeds the basis plus an extra charge representing the time value of the benefit of avoiding tax until realization 58 eliminate stepped up basis and tax unrealized gains before transferring assets to heirs when a person dies a final income tax return must be filed on the decedent s behalf however as mentioned above this tax return does not have to include the unrealized untaxed gain on any assets held at death heirs who inherit those assets do not have to pay tax on that gain either they take as their basis in the asset the market value at the time they receive it regardless of any other proposals that are adopted to rebalance the taxation of work and wealth lawmakers should repeal the stepped up basis rule and require that unrealized capital gains be included in the final income tax return of the deceased tax inheritances the same as paychecks and close trust loopholes the current federal estate tax is effectively a wealth tax however the estate tax is only imposed once in an individual s lifetime and has been eroded to the point where it only applies to the value of an estate exceeding 11 2 million per person or 22 4 million per couple 59 only 0 07 percent or 1 in 1 400 estates will be affected by the estate tax for 2018 one option to address this problem is to reinvigorate the estate tax by lowering the exemption amount and increasing the tax rate this would ensure that a larger amount of previously untaxed wealth is taxed before it is transferred to heirs alternatively new york university law professor lily batchelder has proposed replacing the current estate tax with an inheritance tax 60 the current estate tax already effectively falls on heirs because the tax presumably reduces what they might otherwise inherit an inheritance tax would expressly recognize this dynamic and impose the tax on each heir who inherits assets rather than on the estate of the decedent inheritances would therefore be viewed as income to the heir and taxed accordingly gifts could also be subject to tax with an overall lifetime exemption amount applying to the total value of all gifts and inheritances received for example all individuals could have a lifetime exemption of 2 million in this case the inheritance tax would begin to apply when the total value of any gifts or inheritances they receive over their lifetime exceeds this amount there are many benefits to a unified gift and inheritance tax perhaps most importantly it represents a more accurate way to measure a person s ability to pay under current law a person who inherits 50 million but makes an annual salary of 100 000 pays the same amount of tax as a person who makes the same annual salary but inherits nothing less than 1 percent of heirs in a given year inherit more than 1 million so an exemption amount of 1 million or more would only affect a relatively small number of lucky heirs 61 an inheritance tax would also encourage the wealthy to spread their wealth among heirs or other recipients of bequests such as charities under either of these options it is also important to close loopholes in the tax code that currently enable the very wealthy to transfer ownership of wealth assets to heirs without paying tax former president barack obama and others have identified and proposed fixes to various types of trusts and other mechanisms allowing this type of tax avoidance 62 tax capital gains and dividends as ordinary income one clear way to rebalance the tax system between wages and wealth would be to increase the tax on capital gains and dividends which currently are subject to a tax rate of 20 percent significantly lower than the top marginal rate of 37 percent on ordinary income a higher tax rate on capital gains might encourage the wealthy to hold on to their assets for longer so increasing the tax rate on capital gains should be combined either with the mark to market system of taxing unrealized capital gains on an annual basis or with repeal of the stepped up basis rule mentioned above unlike a wealth tax a mark to market regime or the estate tax an increase in the tax rate on capital gains does not reach unrealized untaxed gain however a higher rate on realized gains would equalize the treatment of income from work and income from selling assets and thus reduce the ability of the very wealthy to amass even more wealth increase irs enforcement funding and take other steps to close the tax gap funding for the irs has decreased significantly over the past several years and this has hampered the agency s efforts to obtain uncollected taxes from very wealthy individuals as mentioned above it is far less costly for the irs to collect taxes from lower income taxpayers with simpler returns a letter from the irs known as a correspondence audit often can elicit compliance from the taxpayer without any further effort or expense on the part of the agency while ensuring that higher income taxpayers are paying what they owe can be complex and time consuming the return on investment may be much greater the biggest challenge is that congress has failed to provide the resources the irs needs to hire employees with the expertise to audit high end tax returns indeed the irs has approximately the same number of auditors today as it did in the 1950s when the economy was a fraction of the size it is today 63 increased irs funding could be used to hire additional auditors increase audit rates for wealthy taxpayers and establish a minimum audit rate compliance improves when third parties are required to report income information to the irs such as when an employer sends the irs a 1099 tax form confirming the income it has provided to an employee form 1099 is required from third parties for a wide variety of types of income including payments to an attorney prizes and awards medical and health care payments and more however very little information reporting is required for capital income lawmakers should establish additional information reporting by third parties on capital income to help close the gap in tax collections among wealthy taxpayers these enforcement measures would reduce tax avoidance by high income taxpayers under current law and would provide an important complement to any of the measures proposed above myths about the taxation of wealth an individual s wealth clearly affects his or her ability to pay taxes critics who oppose taking wealth into account for tax purposes tend to resort to an array of dubious arguments and outright falsehoods to push back against measures to rebalance the tax code myth 1 taxing wealth is clearly unconstitutional critics of a wealth tax claim that it is unconstitutional under article i section 2 of the u s constitution which states that representatives and direct taxes must be apportioned among the states according to their population a tax on wealth cannot be apportioned according to population without applying a different tax rate in each state an absurd proposal because states differ in terms of how many wealthy citizens live there and the size of their wealth thus the question is whether a wealth tax is a direct tax subject to this clause of the constitution there is robust debate on the constitutionality of a wealth tax but the case for constitutionality is strong and should even appeal to the current conservative leaning u s supreme court given the narrow interpretation of direct taxes adopted shortly after ratification of the constitution in article i section 8 the framers of the constitution expressly granted broad taxation powers to congress for the purpose of carrying out its other powers such as paying federal debts and providing for the common defense and general welfare of the country the requirement that direct taxes be apportioned cited above is found in a separate clause and was part of a notorious political compromise to deal with the divisive issue of slavery the full clause reads representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states which may be included within this union according to their respective numbers which shall be determined by adding the whole number of free persons including those bound to service for a term of years and excluding indians not taxed three fifths of all other persons 64 as constitutional law professor bruce ackerman summarizes he south would get three fifths of its slaves counted for purposes of representation in the house and the electoral college if it was willing to pay an extra three fifths of taxes that could be reasonably linked to overall population 65 the only other mention of a direct tax is found in article i section 9 which clarifies no capitation or other direct tax shall be laid unless in proportion to the census or enumeration herein before directed to be taken 66 professor ackerman explains that this provision was likely included to ensure that future direct taxes would be apportioned according to the same formula used to determine representation in the u s house of representatives 67 given the outstanding debt owed by southern states to the new federal government both sides had reason to ensure that the rules of taxation and representation were consistent in 1796 less than 10 years after ratification of the constitution a majority of the supreme court which included four framers who had participated in the development of the constitution recognized the political nature of the direct tax clauses and established a rule of reason for interpreting it in the case of hylton v united states justice samuel chase wrote the rule of apportionment is only to be adopted in such cases where it can reasonably apply 68 the court upheld a carriage tax finding that it could not reasonably be apportioned fairly among the states and thus was not a direct tax for the next 100 years the supreme court continued to apply this reasonableness standard to uphold a number of different types of taxes this history along with the abolition of slavery in 1865 should be enough to convince any constitutional originalist of the prudence of not extending the meaning of direct tax beyond the capitation and real estate taxes expressly included in the term up until that time 69 as professor ackerman argues if the early justices believed that the direct tax clauses should be narrowly construed while slavery still existed it makes no sense to expand the clauses after the rest of the bargain with slavery had been repealed 70 opponents of a wealth tax often rely on the 1895 supreme court decision in pollock v farmers loan trust company which used an unprecedented and broad interpretation of direct tax to strike down an income tax the case created a public furor at the time because it expanded the direct tax limitation to strike down the income tax during the gilded age a time of extreme income and wealth inequality the pollock case is widely viewed as an aberration its core finding that an income tax was unconstitutional was effectively overturned by the 16th amendment which allows congress to impose a tax on income from whatever source derived 71 after the pollock decision the supreme court returned several times to the reasonableness test of hylton to uphold taxes on inheritances and corporate incomes 72 it is also worth noting that pollock was decided during a dark period of constitutional history in which the court struck down many democratically adopted economic and social policies such as the plessy v ferguson decision which upheld racial segregation on louisiana trains and decisions striking down minimum wage requirements maximum hour protections and limitations on the use of child labor 73 although the application of the pollock decision to an income tax was overridden by the 16th amendment the supreme court has never overturned the direct tax interpretation specifically as it might apply to a wealth tax however in deciding that hypothetical case it would be difficult for the court to ignore the extreme income and wealth inequality that exists today a broad interpretation of what constitutes a direct tax would serve only to worsen growing income and wealth inequality by limiting an important tool the power to tax conferred by the constitution on the federal government to provide for the general welfare 74 the logical conclusion of striking down a wealth tax would be the disintegration of the principles on which our democracy was based that all are equal under the law 75 it is not surprising then that many highly respected legal experts have expressly stated that they believe a wealth tax such as the one recently proposed by sen warren would be constitutionally permissible 76 myth 2 a higher top income tax rate is an effective substitute for a wealth tax higher top marginal tax rates on the highest labor incomes alone would not affect a great deal of wealth or the gains that wealth generates to begin with a very large share of the reported income of the wealthy namely capital gains and dividends is taxed at much lower rates meaning that the tax code would be more progressive at the top if there were no preference for this type of income moreover because the tax code does not tax gains until assets are sold a large amount of wealth is not included annually as part of taxable income and may never be subject to income tax at all if held until the owner dies the tax code would still be tilted heavily in favor of the uber wealthy if the only change were a higher top tax rate on ordinary income especially if the tax rate on dividends and realized capital gains remained low myth 3 taxing wealth would materially harm economic growth taxing capital is an essential part of developing a tax system that is fair and based on an individual s ability to pay the idea that any taxation of wealth inevitably impedes economic growth is both overly simplistic and challenged by many experts and economists as nobel prize winning economist joseph stiglitz notes rising inequality implies falling aggregate demand because those at the top of the wealth distribution tend to consume a smaller share of their income than those of more modest means 77 taxes to fund the government and improve distribution are not necessarily in conflict with economic growth in fact the government is integral to a better performing economy 78 in particular recent research shows that taxing wealth is unlikely to hinder economic growth when the tax falls on economic rents or if revenues from a wealth tax are used to make social welfare enhancing public investments which may have a higher rate of return than private investments 79 economic rents in recent decades have reached near historic highs and have significantly contributed to wealth inequality in the united states meanwhile government investments in education and infrastructure can provide a positive rate of return for the economy as a whole at a minimum these investments are essential to sustaining a robust economy in the long term 80 in fact many studies have shown that highly concentrated wealth correlates with poor economic growth over the long term in times of high concentration of wealth taxing wealth may improve growth by breaking up unproductive capital which is then free to be used more productively 81 some economists cite the united states during the mid 20th century when economic growth was high despite a more robust estate tax as an example of this phenomenon 82 finally it seems unlikely that a tax on the ultrawealthy would harm innovation which is a precursor to productivity growth university of southern california professor michael simkovic refutes the claim that innovation and growth require shifting more wealth and resources into the hands of a small number of billionaires there is little if any overlap between billionaires or half billionaires and the nobel prize 83 and most authors of patents are middle or upper middle class 84 to reach lucrative commercial success patented inventions may require substantial business skills related to commercialization and expanding production skills that patent authors seldom have on the other hand those with the requisite business skills depend on the patent author s innovation 85 additionally peer reviewed studies show that increasing wages increases work effort while increasing wealth actually reduces work hours 86 in light of these data it appears that a policy directing revenues from a wealth tax toward public investments in science and education would be more likely to enhance and improve innovation myth 4 wealth is comprised of previously taxed income so a wealth tax would constitute double taxation critics try to paint wealth as completely comprised of previously taxed income but this is not the case as mentioned above much of the wealth at the top consists of either unrealized gain or other income that has never been taxed for example many wealthy people hold a significant number of assets acquired by inheritance according to professor lily batchelder about 40 percent of all wealth in the united states consists of inheritances and inheritances represent about 4 percent of annual aggregate household income 87 notably lottery and other gambling winnings are fully taxable under the income tax 88 but heirs do not have to pay taxes on their inheritances conclusion as long as the wealthy can use their money to unduly influence the political system and the structure of the u s tax system in their favor efforts to rebalance the tax code will be difficult to implement tax code changes that place a heavier burden on extreme wealth must be accompanied by structural improvements to our political system including reforms to the campaign finance system and changes in the legislative process such as greater transparency around proposed tax code changes and rules to govern conflicts of interest among legislators in a world of global markets and digital assets that can be transferred with the click of a button and where the top 1 percent holds as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent the twin juggernauts of income inequality and wealth inequality are likely to keep growing under this scenario the wealthy will keep seeking additional ways to shield their wealth from taxation taking the tax code even further from the core principle of ability to pay rebalancing the tax code to address this reality will require accounting for the extreme and growing stock of wealth at the top only then can we find our way toward an economy that works for everyone about the authors alexandra

topic 1 poverty reduction through growth assessing and strengthening the linkages through mcc programs background mcc s guiding objective and mission statement is poverty reduction through growth growth as the main driver of poverty reduction derives from strong empirical evidence of the positive correlation between economic growth and poverty trends over time dollar and kraay 2003 2015 it also derives from theory factor accumulation rising productivity and growth in incomes work to not only expand the pie for potential redistributive purposes but raise the labor and business incomes over the long run the correlation approaches 1 this fact underpins the mcc model together with evidence that 1 foreign aid provided under the right conditions good governance is effective in promoting growth levy 2014 burnside dollar 2004 and 2 private investment represents the main source for sustained growth in productivity and income in general policies and institutions that expand economic opportunities and raise returns for broad segments of a country s economy are likely to drive both poverty reduction and economic growth mcc attempts to target policies and institutions that will enhance investment and entrepreneurship and thereby labor agricultural and business incomes across a range of sectors with the potential to reduce poverty this approach underscores mcc s role as an effective aid agency with a clear line of sight to poverty reduction nonetheless under some circumstances one cannot always assume that efforts to foster growth will result in sustainable poverty alleviation mcc seeks to understand when and how these linkages may break down whether at an economy wide level or in sectors where mcc invests and what measures can be taken to strengthen linkages to poverty reduction mcc s current practice and economic rationale for the past decade mcc has utilized the hausmann rodrik velasco approach from harvard s center for international development 2008 to identifying the investment focus of mcc compacts since then country compacts have been designed around a binding constraints to growth analysis to identify the specific factors that prevent a country from alleviating its binding constraints mcc later introduced a link from binding constraints to intervention design a root cause analysis which unpacks the constraints into greater detail and identifies the issues which cause or perpetuate the constraints since 2017 mcc has instituted as a required investment criterion that its projects alleviate a root cause of a binding constraint to economic growth see mcc compact development guidance in addition interventions are subject to rigorous cost benefit analysis cba and the estimated distribution of benefit streams across the population are modeled as well using the logic and data available linked to the cba by conventional income categories extreme poor poor near poor and non poor however mcc s process typically does not incorporate the distributional impact of an intervention as part of project selection since the analysis is done after cost benefit analysis nor does the mcc process include a comprehensive assessment of the obstacles to an intervention s transmitting benefits to the poor understanding whether and how such linkages may be strengthened can serve to help the agency better leverage such benefits questions for mcc practice given this context an issue mcc wants to explore with the economic advisory council is whether mcc s current growth diagnostics approach root cause analysis and program economic analysis continues to best position mcc to deliver sustainable poverty reduction several other aid institutions have adopted specific goals with distributional objectives beyond the elimination of extreme poverty most visibly the world bank with its twin goal of supporting income growth and well being of the bottom 40 shared prosperity in such cases significant resources are committed to analysis of the drivers of distributional outcomes usaid adopted a modified approach to the constraints to growth analysis to bring in social inclusion for example by including analysis of labor market impact and the ability of different socio economic groups to participate in growth opportunities across productive sectors the imf has recently published research pointing to greater inequality negatively impacting on growth performance and productivity ostry et al 2019 and has modified some specific areas of policy advice to reflect this mcc is interested to explore whether greater emphasis should be given to building on the assets of the poor and internalizing distributional analysis of investments and policy reform supported in mcc compacts some specific points give rise to questions for further investigation analysis and debate mcc seeks the latest evidence to help it strengthen the linkages between growth and poverty reduction through its programs and poses the following questions for the eac with broad based growth widely accepted as the foundation for long term poverty reduction when and how should mcc place any additional emphasis on distributional outcomes important for social stability in a manner consistent with its data and evidence driven approach to compact design what is the state of current theory and evidence on the mechanisms linking economic growth and poverty reduction or undermining the links are there qualifiers on the nature of growth the quality of growth which argue for attention to special attributes environmental distributive intertemporal in which contexts or situations should mcc be concerned about and commit resources to assess obstacles to the transmission of benefits to the poor in mcc s growth diagnostics root cause analysis or economic analysis of interventions how should mcc take into account the possible negative influence of inequality on growth does existing evidence warrant this how does high or increasing inequality serve to entrench deficits in opportunity lack of assets political power or other conditions for the poor these broad questions give rise to several questions that may warrant further attention in mcc s work in which contexts is evidence of a negative impact of inequality on growth sufficiently strong to warrant additional policy attention are there tools to identify those country or sector contexts how could such areas best leverage mcc s focus on broad based growth to reach the poor in countries where evidence on growth incidence shows a highly skewed distribution e g lesotho with negative growth for the lowest deciles should the constraints to growth analysis be modified to identify growth factors that support a different pattern are there key shifts in the growth opportunity set for small open economies with the development of global value chains disruptive technologies and other factors reducing employment and returns to labor how should mcc factor such realities into its approach to the mission of poverty reduction through growth poverty is often geographically concentrated in specific regions and inter regional migration is one strategy for escaping poverty is there a case to be made for subnational constraints to growth analysis and special attention to lagging regions under what circumstances can good and bad influences on inequality be adequately distinguished to guide compact design topic 2 leveraging private financing for development growth and poverty reduction a paradigm shift on how development will be financed is required to unlock the resources needed to achieve the sustainable development goals oda must be targeted increasingly to crowd in other funding sources i for low income countries lics on the basis of poverty vulnerability and limited fiscal capacity and ii for middle income countries mics by playing an increasing role to leverage and catalyze public and private sources of financing imf wb development committee 2015 background there has been much attention to moving from billions to trillions in development financing to low and middle income countries in support of the sustainable development goals sdgs crowding in private investment the un estimates that 3 9 trillion is required annually for the sdgs while overseas development assistance oda flows are less than 4 of this domestic resources tax non tax revenues are the most important source of development finance but low income countries lics remain very dependent on concessional development finance accounting on average for about 30 of total funding in lics but less than 5 in lower middle income countries lmics private development finance potentially has a vital role to play in financing the shortfall it is already the second largest source of finance in lmics but is still tiny for most lics in recognition of this many have called for using foreign assistance to help leverage private financial flows to lics and lmics in particular for physical infrastructure mcc has engaged in measures to attract private capital into development compacts from its start apart from indirect support through efforts to improve the business environment mcc compacts in jordan ghana liberia benin and central america have supported private participation in state owned enterprises and have combined private financing with mcc s grant finance to expand the overall financial impact pursuant to the better utilization of investments leading to development or build act signed into law in october 2018 the us will establish a new development finance corporation dfc providing a new impetus in mcc to identify opportunities to leverage private finance for development the dfc is authorized to make loans guarantees take equity positions provide insurance extend technical assistance etc to facilitate private sector participation in economic development of low or lower middle income countries mcc will share its results focused approach with the dfc but seeks to also find opportunities to collaborate directly to facilitate private investment in mcc countries and is developing a strategy for future institutional collaboration mcc s current practice the mcc supports private sector investment and entrepreneurship as the primary driver of sustainable growth to reduce poverty country compact development begins with an analysis of the binding constraints to growth in particular an assessment of constraints to private investment and entrepreneurship binding constraints that have been identified cover several areas deficits in infrastructure services has been the most common energy water transport etc but also human capital deficits weak land markets and management and in some instances costly access to finance high levels of corruption taxation costly regulation and other issues with the business environment itself have been identified as binding e g in tunisia lesotho while mcc has traditionally focused on infrastructure projects emphasis is increasingly being placed on complementary policy and institutional reforms that aim at capacity of the public sector and ensuring sustainability of public services over time experience with mobilizing or leveraging private capital in mcc supported development projects e g through credit enhancement structured finance or supporting public private partnerships is still relatively limited but experience is growing there have been successful examples of mcc support to public private partnerships for port construction benin waste water treatment jordan and technical support for structuring ppps guatemala el salvador grant facilities have helped mobilized private financing indonesia benin and attracted independent power producers ipps ghana these examples illustrate the use mcc s grant resources to reduce risks or boost returns to private investors attracting foreign project financing that would otherwise be unlikely to materialize the main objective of credit enhancement ppps guarantees or other leveraging instruments whether attracting debt or equity is to influence the risk return calculus of private investors to induce them to commit resources this and other measures e g improving sector governance may serve to improve the incentive frameworks for more efficient provision of infrastructure and other services mcc s authority is limited to using its own grant resources but in collaboration with the dfc or other international financial institutions there may be greater potential for collaborating with other instruments of support the extent to which such enhancements or subsidies are necessary or beneficial will depend on the country and project context and the perceived risk factors most of the countries where mcc operates are perceived as high risk and low capacity or sub investment grade and are unable to attract institutional capital without some credit enhancement or guarantee many lack sovereign risk ratings that provide risk metrics commonly referenced by foreign investors the lack of ratings is typically a sign of political or macroeconomic instability or weak rule of law and contract enforcement which accentuate both political and commercial risk and domestic investors or banks generally lack the tenor or resources to finance large scale infrastructure moreover to the extent such blended finance ppp or other private financing opportunities may increase countries de facto debt burden beyond sustainable levels this is problematic several mcc countries are heavily indebted face macro and fiscal policy challenges and therefore have limited scope to take on new debt foreign currency denominated debt is particularly risky as the debt service burden is potentially much harder to manage macroeconomic and or political volatility that can weaken the domestic currency and amplify the debt burden domestic currency financing avoids or reduces this risk and may further serve to stimulate domestic financial deepening questions for mcc practice in keeping with mcc s evidence driven model understanding the root causes of sovereign and commercial risk is central to understanding which interventions can be effective and sustainable it can also guide mcc s efforts to optimally leverage private capital for development purposes blended finance can be used along with policy and institutional reform to address the root causes of market failures in the provision of insurance or credit asymmetric information including principal agent problems externalities or government failures high taxes corruption poor property rights this is the logic behind the policy based guarantee the world bank has used in a number of countries to combine policy reform focusing in general on business environment and public financial management reforms with credit enhancement to attract private capital into development programs lessons from the world bank experience may be relevant to mcc as it explores collaboration with the dfc given mcc s significant presence in financing infrastructure mcc often seeks to build the legal foundations public capacity and preparation facilities for ppps or in the power sector independent ipp arrangements in partner countries opportunities will nonetheless be constrained by mcc s country selection system as well as limitations imposed by mcc s authorizing legislation mcc s role in more advanced lmics with ready access to international capital markets like indonesia may be limited in low capacity sub investment grade countries there may be greater scope for actively employing blended finance instruments or guarantees where appropriate as with other mcc programs and projects activities involving blended financing will need to be justified on the same basis as other programs and meet mcc s investment criteria including demonstrating that discounted social benefits are expected to exceed the opportunity costs of the project capital committed from all sources as compared with the counterfactual of no such public investment of funds questions to explore what are the main economic issues that should help to guide mcc s support for greater leveraging of finance through guarantees ppps and other mechanisms how can mcc strategically and systematically identify risk factors relevant to encouraging blended finance and capital mobilization how best can mcc factor macroeconomic risk debt capacity and contingent liabilities be addressed in formulating mcc s approach to leveraged finance in sub investment grade environments using grant financing to crowd in private capital has a strong intuitive appeal are there risks of mcc support crowding out private capital inflows under what circumstances and how can these risks be assessed and or mitigated what metrics and tools are available to help identify and prioritize financial leveraging opportunities for mcc consistent with the model of identified binding constraints and root causes are there likely opportunities for blending finance in most countries regardless of the constraints found binding under what conditions are there likely to be opportunities for domestic capital mobilization local currency for mcc to explore financial mobilization and support for capital market deepening what lessons from experience e g guarantco a nonprofit providing local currency finance and guarantees for infrastructure can guide mcc opportunities how might mcc s five year fixed compact period limit such engagement capital mobilization local currency for mcc to explore financial mobilization and support for capital market deepening what lessons from experience e g guarantco a nonprofit providing local currency finance and guarantees for infrastructure can guide mcc opportunities how might mcc s five year fixed compact period limit such engagement are there particular types of market or institutional failures or other root causes common to lics or lmics that underpin high sovereign and commercial risk which mcc focus on could a model of targeted policy and institutional reforms accompanied by grant finance support to incentivize institutional investors be a model in lics or lmics for mcc to consider similar to policy based guarantees what relevant evidentiary basis and lessons mcc might draw on for considering such approaches topic 3 analyzing and prioritizing obstacles to regional integration background in 2018 the us congress granted mcc the authority to engage in concurrent compacts for the purposes of regional investments in principle this authority may help mcc achieve its mission to reduce poverty through economic growth in situations such as where a regional investment strategy would be more efficient in alleviating a binding constraint to economic growth in one or more countries e g by transmitting electricity from a low cost producer to a high cost producer greater intra regional trade in goods and services would be growth enhancing and poverty reducing regionally coordinated policy action such as in tax trade environmental regulatory product standards or foreign investment and competition policies is needed to solve a costly coordination failure including by avoiding beggar thy neighbor policies or a race to the bottom or can incentivize domestic governance reforms such as through regional standards reporting and transparency requirements coordination failures occur that result in the under provision of infrastructure crossing international borders such as a trans border rail line or highway because each country s investment would only be viable when the other country also invests there are important economies of scale in the provision of productive factors such as specialized human capital or infrastructure there are important externalities accruing across borders or finally the costs and benefits of an investment are asymmetric across countries thus requiring facilitation or compensatory investment by a donor issues for mcc consistency with mcc s current model current model mcc s approach to developing its single country compacts is based upon the premise that partner countries have limited financial resources and state capacity and that policy action requires the expenditure of scarce political capital it also embraces the notion of country specificity while there are common themes of under development each country differs in terms of what precisely inhibits its ability to achieve prosperity therefore mcc takes prioritization seriously and begins the development of country compacts with a data driven identification of binding constraints to broad based economic growth this is followed by an analysis of the root causes of the identified constraint s and project scoping and design are meant to flow from these two analytical steps further committing to this approach mcc recently adopted as one of its investment criteria that projects it invests in alleviate a root cause of a binding constraint to growth see mcc compact development guidance proposed approach to developing regional investments mcc s pursuit of regional investments requires some adaptations to this approach recognizing the vast array of potential obstacles to regional integration mcc has proposed replacing the foregoing investment criterion with the requirement that a project address an economically significant obstacle to growth and poverty reduction through regional integration compact development may begin with a project concept proposed by a government donor mcc staff or other stakeholders once identified the problem area implied by a project concept can be assessed for its economic significance and the project for its economic rationale but without necessarily understanding whether or where more significant obstacles or constraints may lie at the same time mcc s planned approach calls for a stage of problem definition and root cause analysis this process in some ways reverses mcc s initial steps which as described above are predicated on data driven prioritization of problems to address there have yet to be any regional projects selected for investment but this process could have implications for mcc s ultimate impact and the viability of projects pursued analytical challenges mcc still needs to identify feasible analytical tools to prioritize among regional issues to address context notwithstanding the greater complexity of prioritizing constraints in a regional context mcc would like to establish as data driven and comprehensive an approach as is feasible for identifying potentially high impact areas of intervention theoretical opportunities are vast as discussed above particularly as applied to several eligible countries at once this past december for instance mcc s board selected five countries for the purposes of exploring potential concurrent regional compact programs benin burkina faso ghana ivory coast and niger with the aim of arriving at a project involving at least a subset of two for its first concurrent regional compacts mcc also decided to prioritize sectors where the opportunity for tangible cross border infrastructure investments appeared highest e g the transport and power sectors along with any associated policy and institutional reform support lack of a feasible prioritization framework at present mcc is interested in pursuing a set of agreed feasible analytical tools to prioritize among regional issues to address to our knowledge no accepted analytical framework exists to test the full span of possible constraints to growth through regional integration such as exists for a single country s growth in the form of the growth diagnostics approach authored by hausmann rodrik and velasco 2006 moreover those frameworks which could be constructed would appear to require exponentially more data including on movements of people trade in services prices and price disparities across spatial units and time to implement than mcc typically allocates to its early analytical steps approximately 4 6 months approach to date in its first tentative approaches to this problem mcc has done the following 1 estimated gravity models to benchmark country pairs level of trade in goods and detect significant deviations from expectation 2 reviewed existing country growth diagnostics mcc systematic country diagnostics world bank and diagnostic trade and integration studies unctad where available and 3 noted the general implications of comparative indicators on various dimensions of regional integration available from the african union and the world bank s doing business however there is little guarantee that with such general yet partial information the most significant economic obstacles can come into focus challenges the evidence linking sustained broad based growth to poverty reduction is compelling notwithstanding the need to look at the strength of these linkages case by case however the poverty implications of regional programs are likely to be more complex although even under single country programs one sector or group of producers or consumers may benefit much more than others under regional integration based on standard trade theory there is greater risk that groups of producers or consumers could experience at least short run economic losses such losses have proven difficult for governments to manage politically or economically therefore the need to understand the likely channels of impact appears even greater for regional investments key questions for the eac what are the available analytical approaches to identifying and prioritizing obstacles to growth and poverty reduction with a regional dimension in a given context what are the most promising avenues to attempt given typical data limitations and mcc s time constraints how could the existing theory and evidence on the benefits of regional integration for growth and poverty reduction help shape mcc s approach to concurrent compacts whether in terms of country selection sector problem area focus or approach within sectors to what extent could mcc reduce the scope of its attention to certain sectors a priori without a high risk of omitting key constraints are there certain areas of regional integration that are likely to be most promising for fostering growth and poverty reduction in africa what are the main risks in terms of missed opportunities for positive impact of constraining possible avenues to a relatively short list of countries and sectors and or of failing to conduct an objective ex ante prioritization analysis how can such risks be mitigated what are the potential benefits of this approach what types of regional projects raise the greatest risk of causing harm to the poor and how can mcc ensure that the poor are positioned to benefit from enhanced regional integration looking forward are there risks posed by emerging economic trends or disruptive technologies that are likely to be accentuated or reduced through greater regional integration april 2019
victor c ariole when you are marginalized by those who appropriate to themselves greater stakes in politics or economics your views are also seen as marginal so also everything about africa is seen either as marginal or at best as emerging nigeria being the most populous country in africa is still seen as marginal or an emerging economy so its budget can only take the shape of a marginal budget in a world dominated by knowledge economy as majority of its people remain in the margins of knowledge acquisition seventy percent in the north uneducated 11million out of school hence a budget of margins just for tiny portion of nigeria reacting as termites what i read in the budget of supposedly great economies of the west is how to reduce budget deficit not necessarily what they earn or what they spend though reducing budget deficit imply such issues as earnings and spending focus is on waste eliminator not to create ants to destroy their wealth it also implies that as long as people are productive and at work deficit reduction could mean an austerity measure which has never worked as stimulus has always prevailed basically the us congress refusal to approve 5billion border wall of the usa s president is to reduce the huge budget deficit that the usa has been incurring over the years 23trillion debt yet it is the economy rated as greatly performing with more people getting into the job market than any other country it is also known that the mayor of new york operates far greater capital budget than found in nigeria s current budget of mere n8trillion about 20 billion yet 23 of capable hands in nigeria are not finding jobs to enhance the overall economic carrying capacity of nigeria that shows greater marginalization upon which budgeting could only be seen as voodoo budgeting hinged on weak thinking or marginal thinking what is there to budget for when most nigerians seem to be on their own except the politicians marginal activity is what the proposed earning and spending of the budget is based and it could only yield marginal result that exclude the majority or operates in disdain of capable hands begging to be included so as to form the real norm yet to be used in the budgeting process one of the basics you learn in mba class that concerns accounting is that until average cost equates marginal cost where marginal cost is seen as the contribution of each activity in the assumed average cost of all activities remaining proportional to the value of such activity to the entire activity it is seen as not yet optimizing this is where subsidy tends to be seen as eroding optimization process in effect nigeria s budgeting process that always see the legislators raising the oil benchmark is completely a weak thinking process and quite a voodoo economic activity as generally the oil price is not determined by nigeria but by those who are directly or secretly in charge of both the oil pricing mechanism and its supply chain the leading powers and even the central bank of nigeria that must ensure that it does not release into nigeria s economy more than nigeria is contributing to the world albeit marginally vis √† vis what such greater stakeholder see as partaking in the average costing of maintaining the global economy costed and regulated by seen and unseen hands of organizations like uno imf world bank nato etc these are strategic organizations incurring costs towards regulating world s economy and they are very strict in making sure that a given nation does not earn more that it deserves sanctions could be imposed or whatever they deem necessary to frustrate such nation s economic prospects nigeria has been clamouring to be among the 20 most developed economy in the world for decades and a small country like taiwan had been there for decades and taiwan basically operates its budget on earning as function of added value from whatever it is importing from others to reach at final products which is better in attaining optimization nigeria needs to think along that line in its budgeting process as against the legislators arbitrarily raising oil price like taiwan like south korea smaller in size but greater in gdp than nigeria the minimalist way of evaluating our legislators must be to see the laws that they are making that give nigerians and investors operating environment that encourages adding values to what the nigerian knowledge base its people and its resources comparative advantage prospects add in terms of national wealth for example it was known that south korea enacted a law and greatly marketed that law which enabled any investor in the 70s to come with a given amount of dollar and open industry with some tax free benefits as long as such industry engaged in exportable goods their aim was for foreign reserve booster and it worked some nigerians were known to have participated in the making of that prosperity it was even a time when people there were eager to acquire nigerian university degrees paying for it in dollars in south korea as nigeria takes back manufactured products like air conditioners fridge and computers today south korea is one of the 20 most industrialized nations from their former poor state in effect till nigeria starts getting out of the margins with its paltry earnings that is far below its optimization capacity it will be baseless discussing marginal budgetary presentation that makes more mockery of the system as legislators go into executive function of allocating more funds to themselves instead of questioning spending that do not reflect right earnings i have never heard anywhere that legislators make more appropriation to themselves as against either adopting or querying the spending patterns of the executive the current budget of about n8trillion does not reflect the production capacity of nigeria upon which taxation could be extracted from the entire nigeria s people and resources hence quite a marginal budget and as majority of nigerians remain marginalized in the production system so also will the progress of the entire country remain marginalized in the greater economy of the world time to open the space and allow youthful nigerians and women participate effectively in a small scale operations for more wealth creation and it is seen in the great input of the diaspora as reflected in their remittance and gnp which has not been matched by internal policy of citizen diplomacy as no succor for some of them thriving abroad ariole professor of french and francophone studies university of lagos

investment managers story continues in the euro zone there is not a big risk free market twenty years down the line it may be different for ahmed the main issue is that credit risk in the bloc is not uniform the 19 members each run their own fiscal policies budget rules are too loosely policed to ensure adherence and euro exit remains a theoretical possibility so wealthier members such as germany

speech at the european federation of public service unions annual congress trade unions and the future dublin the rds tuesday 4 june 2019 a chairde let me say at the outset how pleased i am to have been invited to address you here today having been a member of a trade union for over 50 years please be assured that i believe fully in the purpose and importance of a union may i begin by thanking kevin callinan deputy general secretary of f√≥rsa for the invitation to speak here this morning at this the annual conference of the european public service unions epsu your federation with its over 8 million members across europe 200 000 of whom are members of the five irish affiliations including f√≥rsa which is the largest public sector union in this country i am delighted that the epsu conference attended by some 600 delegates today and held every five years is taking place in dublin for this is indeed a city with a proud tradition within the trade union movement the 1913 lockout in dublin was a seminal period in the formation of collective representation for the working classes in this country more than 20 000 workers were either locked out of their jobs by their employers or went on strike it marked a watershed in irish labour history the principle of union action and workers solidarity had been firmly asserted as president i have been privileged to be asked to speak in the past of the role of larkin connolly and others of trade unionists and particularly of the brave and neglected women trade unionists and their importance to our history in the late 19th and early 20th century while drawing strength and courage from the exemplary bravery and determination of these individuals and indeed from more contemporary figures like mary manning the shopworker from irish grocery chain dunnes stores who in 1984 refused to handle the sale of fruit from south africa in protest at the apartheid regime the labour movement draws its strength from its collectivity from the hundreds of thousands of people willing to demonstrate solidarity in their workplace towards their fellow citizens and towards people all over the world these were themes i addressed inter alia in the littleton lecture on the lockout of 1913 and again when i gave the second phelan lecture on the future of work epsu works hard to deliver better working conditions improved health and safety and enhanced rights for its members negotiating best practice agreements that improve the working lives of european public service workers and ensuring quality services for citizens of particular concern for epsu is the issue of gender inequality an issue to which i shall return later in my speech public services on which all citizens rely are under increasing strain from budget cuts liberalisation austerity low pay and poor working conditions tax avoidance by multinationals impacts on the sustainability of public finances in turn impacting on public services the role that epsu plays in standing up for the rights of citizens including migrants both in the workplace and in the services your members deliver is also critical in ensuring that the most vulnerable citizens in our countries are protected from exploitation i note that congress will shortly debate a motion in relation to migrant workers in ireland only one in four workers are now members of a trade union of whom over half are public service workers this reflects a decline in private sector trade union membership in 1980 almost two thirds of irish workers were members of trade unions however there are encouraging signs that this trend is reversing with evidence of new recruitment the trade union movement we must continually remind ourselves emanates from a powerful proud tradition on which in turn civil rights movements the anti apartheid movement and equal rights movements could call for support it is important that we also acknowledge on all parts of this island the role of the trade union movement from its beginnings down to our times in opposing sectarianism the trade union movement lest we forget has also been an international one and it correctly sees as edward phelan did in his day in his harris lecture with john maynard keynes in 1931 that migrating unemployment from one setting to another effectively positioning wage levels in competition with each other in a downward spiral could be disastrous for global economies an over reliance on the economic orthodoxy of today with limited space allowed to discover new knowledge and adherence to what we now know to be bogus expertise all played their part in the unfolding of and response to the economic and social catastrophe that was the great recession which this country with others experienced just a decade ago in these times our new circumstances require a higher degree of economic literacy if such mistakes are to be avoided in recurring once again this requires i suggest consideration of a new ecological social paradigm based on economic heterodoxy such as that proposed by prof ian gough and others that recognises the limits of the world s natural resources as well as the role that unrestrained greed has played in creating the climate crisis in his book heat greed and human need gough outlines how the alternative paradigm is rooted in the concept of human need over greed it espouses gender equality redistribution and a reconfigured social consumption and investment strategy that transfers resources and technology from rich countries to developing countries as the key means to achieve this eco social welfare state the eco social policies that underpin such an economic paradigm must simultaneously pursue both equity social justice and sustainability sufficiency goals within an activist innovation state with substantial public investment and greater regulation and planning furthermore socio economic measures are also required to offset any regressive impacts of the ecological transition for lower income groups and to reverse growing levels of inequality it is apposite that the theme of your congress is fighting for a union for all such a title calls to mind the notion of inclusivity while ireland has been at the forefront of truly enormous social change in recent years which has advanced inclusivity it has yet to achieve an acceptable level of cohesion as is the case in much of the eu results from several recently held referenda on issues such as divorce marriage equality and abortion rights herald a more progressive and inclusive modern ireland on the level of personal or identity issues one which espouses compassion and tolerance over judgement and shame such progress demonstrates an increasingly liberal and secular society with an emphasis on personal freedoms i would argue that this move towards an articulation of the desire for individual rights can be more perfectly compatible with the objectives of social cohesion social connectedness and the move towards an eco social model which i advocate in this speech unfortunately however i am struck by a growing divergence between such societal progress at the level of personal freedoms on the one hand and the speed with which this country and many others globally are proceeding with regard to social equity or labour policy and in particular workers rights and conditions this leads me to question the future role of the international labour organisation the only surviving international institution that was created from the ashes of world war i which in its constitution refers to social justice as being essential to lasting universal peace in our present circumstances almost 100 years after that constitution was first proclaimed that spirit of idealism and of vital moral purpose is more urgently required than ever yet it is seriously undermined this begs the question of how can the ilo re dedicate itself to its founding mission in the context of an ongoing assault on workers rights i believe that the founding message given expression in an achievable agenda of the ilo must be vigorously brought to the attention of the world by all of us who believe in equity and the dignity of work how much better it would be if the necessary elements of what constituted social cohesion formed the basis of the discourse that prevailed on the streets of the world rather than the excluded being abandoned to become the prey of xenophobes homophobes and racists being positive i suggest that all of the prevailing ruling concepts in our present economic discourse flexibility globalisation productivity innovation social protection decent work are capable of being re defined given shared moral resonance made useful within the context of an ecological social paradigm to these i will speak in more detail shortly on the subject of ecology it cannot be denied that the most pressing issue facing us all as a global community and inhabitants of a planet that is in peril owing to insatiable unrestricted consumption of the earth s finite natural resources since the onset of the anthropocene i speak of course of the climate crisis let me say first that i see the role of public servants as being transformative in acting as champions for climate action both in terms of mitigation and adaptation public servants have the capacity given a real opportunity to shape and implement policies in these spheres that will reduce the impact of climate change and enable society to adapt to the most destructive effects of a changing climate which we are already beginning to witness first hand through for instance the increased severity and frequency of storms and extreme weather events there exists now a great opportunity to give leadership and for trade unions to play a strong role in pushing for fair ambitious and binding international agreements on greenhouse gas emission reduction targets while the eu has a set of binding emissions targets for 2020 and 2030 we must now plan for full decarbonisation of our european economies by 2050 encouraging the rest of the world to follow suit and urging in the strongest possible terms the usa to re consider its regressive and pernicious decision to leave the global paris agreement unions can seize the opportunity of providing a lead role in developing a strategy for a just transition for workers and communities to ensure that we are all part of a sustainable low carbon economy and benefit from decent and green jobs in ireland this will mean that those impacted by the closure of unsustainable carbon intensive electricity production for example must be offered re skilling opportunities to enable them to find suitable jobs in other areas such as the green economy or opportunities with sustainable incomes in other parts of society it is my strong belief that the trade union movement can create a creative and enduring future for us members now and in the future by being a key proponent of gough s new eco social political economy emphasising responsible economics understanding that the concept of growth ad infinitum is inherently flawed recovering a discourse that had fallen prey to an uncritical embrace of neoliberal mantras and advocating an economic model of pluralism which emphasises the finite nature of the earth s natural resources and the role that rich nations must play in ameliorating the crises in which we find ourselves as gough puts it himself consumption and consumption based emissions ignored by the green growth agenda must be given equal priority in the rich world issues of global equity almost entirely absent from international climate negotiations so far must be discussed and confronted affluence has a class as well as a national dimension the case that ian gough makes is impressive combining these concerns of domestic justice with both international and inter generational justice in a global equity framework is one worthy of consideration by all partners one worthy of support by trade unions such a framework which is founded on a needs based society could have a conjoined positive effect on the multiple crises in which the global community finds itself it also implies the end of a capitalism without responsibility as to consequences as we have come to know it moving beyond growth to a steady state sustainable economy this begs the question as to whether the transition route to sustainable wellbeing is achievable everything depends as scholars such as gough klien and others have identified on the nature variability flexibility and reformability of capitalism your trade union has correctly placed gender equality as one of its core objectives i believe that in order for unions to credibly fight for the promotion of gender equality in the workplace there must first be greater gender equality within union structures themselves i also see the inclusion of gender issues in collective bargaining as being fundamental given the ongoing gender pay gap related to this is a wider objective of protecting vulnerable marginalised workers many of whom are women many are migrants these groups need an ever stronger voice sylvia walby has argued in her book crisis that the economic and fiscal crises which we have lived through over the past decade and the resulting recession experienced severely in ireland has cascaded through society and the ensuing fiscal crisis over government budget deficits and austerity has led to a political crisis which in turn now threatens to become a democratic crisis borne unevenly the effects of the crisis are exacerbating existing class and gender inequalities there is considerable under utilised capacity in the economy as a consequence of the failure to encourage the completion of the transition in the gender regime from a domestic to a public form this incomplete transition is at least in part because of the priority accorded to developing a neoliberal rather than social democratic form walby argues that the future consequences of the crisis depend upon whether there is a deepening of democracy and of democratic institutions including within the eu within such considerations must be the issue of the relation of the economy to social policy and the role of the economy as instrument or determinant of public good globalisation is a topic to which i return frequently in my speeches as president a key conundrum that has not been solved by most governments globally relates to how we can make globalisation work for citizens when what has been its presentation to date lacks legitimacy among much of the citizenry in other words is an ethical sustainable form of globalisation possible naomi klein among others has shown how corporations have unethically exploited workers in the world s poorest countries often those with appalling human rights records in pursuit of greater profits as klein has written in her book no logo when manufacturing is so highly devalued it follows that the people doing the production work become highly devalued as well the shift in corporate priorities has left factory workers and craftspeople in a precarious position the lavish spending in the 1990s on marketing mergers and brand extensions has been matched by resistance to investing in production facilities and labour multinationals search the globe for factories that can make their products as cheaply as possible and by contracting out the manufacturing work multinationals can shed all responsibility for the working conditions inside these factories the contracting allows multinationals to re focus on the needs of their brands as opposed to the needs of their workers it follows that left unchecked such a form of globalisation will lead to a wider gap between rich and poor with the poor getting poorer globalisation clearly tests values that may have been multi laterally agreed to achieve an acceptance across borders as minimally ethical globalisation and its impact requires to be managed by accountable multilateral institutions so that it for example supports fundamental human rights and leads to long lasting development and prosperity for citizens in general particularly the poorest the trade union movement has played and must continue to play a leading role so that workers are not made the casualties of globalisation but rather that globalisation is made to work for the world s workers as to the task of redefining work we are also witnessing increases in precarious employment contract working and an ongoing casualisation of labour as has been so well documented by guy standing noam chomsky and others the new emerging trends in work practices so called innovations are only innovations to my mind insofar as they maximise profits for employers and reduce employees labour rights i see this trend as part of an inexorable race to the bottom and i believe that regulation is required in order to protect those most vulnerable in society from being exploited as a result of the most adverse effects of these new models of work for example dr p√°draig carmody has shown in recent research how ride sharing and virtual capital have resulted in a hollowing out of the formal sector and a rise in the so called precariat worker whereas many speak of the sharing economy a more accurate way to describe it might be the on demand economy where firms divest themselves of their responsibilities to employees reducing the structural power of labour this represents an undermining of any social contract between the parties with regard to how an abuse of digitalisation assists in this regard we see online workers often are not covered by employment law or collective agreements and seldom have access to social security paid leave or paid training owing to the fact that the platforms require workers to register as self employed these recent developments in the world of work are nothing less than a recrudescence of some of the worst practices of the 19th century the co ordination and direction of employees by an algorithm owned by a company should never be allowed to divest the employer of their responsibility any less than a bogus self employment does after all one of the great victories of the trade union movement was the regulation of piecework these old practices must not be allowed re emerge under the cloak of supposed innovation it must remain an important objective of the left and of unions to reverse the systematic neglect and devaluation of working class lives the ongoing displacement of secure certain regular employment for which trade unions were established by uncertain precarious jobs and characteristic chronic insecurity is a major cause for concern workers are too often expected to demonstrate what is called flexibility by which is meant a willingness and ability to readily respond to changing circumstances and expectations without adequate information or recompense this flexibility is often not matched however with any security of tenure or appropriate income by employers with the vista of zero hour contracts now appearing ever more prevalent an uncritical globalisation pursued without consideration as to impact or social consequences it can be shown has had a negative impact on climate change more goods being produced and consumed more transport of goods across longer distances shorter product obsolescence cycles and a more consumerist and materially driven society they all come at a significant price in terms of the impact on finite natural resources and greenhouse gas emissions i have not spoken of the so called softer impacts of globalisation such as cultural homogenisation as well as adverse effects on local communities and economies for this is perhaps one of the greatest problems with globalisation macroeconomist exponents can all too easily evaluate the economic benefits of globalisation narrowly on aggregateacross countries but fail to capture the harder to quantify negative intangibles to which i refer i was heartened to read in the recent world bank report efficiency that even that organisation hardly a bastion of left wing social democratic thinking now believes there is justification in going beyond efficiency and fostering more inclusive growth globally after decades of mainstream economic commentary espousing the virtues of privatisation deregulation and a smaller role for the state we now appear to be at a turning point in the economics discourse thanks to the insightful contributions of economists like mariana mazzucato and sylvia walby mazzucato in her books the entrepreneurial state and the value of everything effectively rebukes the austerity fuelled worldview that in order to restore growth after the 2008 financial crisis all that was needed was to reduce deficits by cutting public spending arguing instead that government investment in areas like education research and technology is a key component of economic growth even orthodox institutions such as the international monetary fund have slowly evolved their thinking on austerity as a strategic tool believing that it can be self defeating as keynes argued over 80 years ago if governments cut spending during a downturn a short lived recession can become a fully fledged depression this is precisely what occurred in ireland when the economic recession of 2008 turned into an economic depression in 2009 with an economic recovery delayed until 2014 this prolongation and intensification of the economic bust resulted in a deepening of the experience of as well as a widening of the exposure to a range of attendant social ills that were a direct result of a prolonged period of constrained under investment by the state many of which have not yet been resolved long before mazzucato the spiritual fathers of creative thinking in the public sector keynes and polyani called on policymakers not just to think about counter cyclical spending as a way to reduce the impacts of recessions and avoid over heating economies but also to think strategically to identify how investments can help shape citizens long term prospects for the better polyani went so far as to argue in the great transformation that free markets themselves are products of state intervention outcomes of public and private actions this astute observation has become conveniently forgotten in much of the austerity based neoliberal commentary around the recent economic crisis mitchell and fazi s reclaiming the state argues in the contemporary context of brexit britain and trump s america with national sovereignty high on the agenda that the state must be reclaimed if we are to transform societies for the people s benefit despite the ravages of neoliberalism the state still holds the capacity and much of the resources for democratic control of a nation s economy and finances the authors advocate a new paradigm of economic heterodoxy in which ideas are grounded in post keynesian institutional feminist social and importantly ecological economics this is an epistemological challenge to the neo classical economic orthodoxy that espouses with rigidity the assumptions of rationality and individualism as the equilibrium nexus as an alternative it offers economics dealing with the institutions history social structure nexus this is the form of political economy discourse that is most promising young and not so young academics are struggling for its right to be taught in universities and institutions reclaiming the state is a work that called for a drastic expansion in the state s role while the authors include a broad re nationalisation of specific sectors of the economy most notably the financial sector mitchell and fazi also call for a new and updated notion of planning one which places the commanding heights of economic policy under democratic control to enable the urgently needed socio ecological transformation of production and society the latter project however needs to be presented not simply as a resile to the previous models of renationalisation this would clearly be insufficient in the context of new challenges the role of the state needs to be defined anew as well as the concept of sovereignty in such a way that it is shared can flow for the benefit of workers beyond borders can because it is a transition taking place in several countries have a regional character one that is exemplary to global economic systems any narrowly defined concept of productivity capturing in a simplistic way merely the efficiency of production utilising the four factors of production while it may be important to understand in an increasingly competitive enterprise environment is an insufficient concept when examined from a labour productivity perspective it is problematic because growth in labour productivity often does not lead to commensurate improvements in the incomes of workers as evidence from studies conducted by tony atkinson and others suggests but is instead captured by the owners of capital itself often speculative rather than productive this is not only inequitable but it places a value on the role of capital that is far higher than other factors of production such as labour and entrepreneurship and is inherently volatile given its speculative nature such volatility has clear downstream impacts on labour markets in instances in which speculative capital does not perform in the markets as well as was envisaged resulting inevitably in the need to cut back on other factors of production with labour being the most easily adjusted assisted by increasingly flexible labour markets i wish to revisit briefly if i may the concept of work itself andrea komlosy in her recent contribution work the last 1 000 years argues that the often limited definition and classification of work has never corresponded to the historical experience of most people whether in colonies developing countries or the industrialised world the gap between common assumptions and reality grows even more pronounced in the case of women and other groups excluded from the labour market i am minded to re visit the related philosophical concept of the dignity of labour much advocated by ghandi in which all types of jobs are respected equally no occupation is considered superior and none of the jobs should be discriminated on any basis is this not the ethic of work in the public service for the public good i believe a corollary of this concept is that a return to the fundamentals of decent secure jobs would be a widespread increase in job satisfaction a better sense of accomplishment and improvements in quality of life across nations a vision in which these concepts become more embedded in the citizenry and in particular employers is perhaps provocative even radical as it attempts to upturn the commonly held assertion that money and wealth accumulation is the primary motivation behind humans desire to work there is in addition a significant growing and important body of economic research focusing on the marginal utility of income the incremental change in satisfaction that is due to a unit change in income which shows that satisfaction peaks at relatively modest income levels and that steep diminishing marginal returns are evident as people s preference for additional leisure time becomes higher than their preference for additional income robert and edward skidelsky s book how much is enough money and the good life is a spirited argument against blindly accepting the faustian bargain of insatiability within contemporary capitalism we need to focus much less on making money and much more on cultivating the things that matter leisure knowledge friendship it appears that the old adage money doesn t bring happiness is a truism that even economists can now demonstrate empirically however the young of the world with their proximity to each other to nature to the joy of shared culture are well ahead of them as are those who sing the anthems of their unions behind banners as they march creating a society that is more equal one in which all work is valued and all jobs are decent and fulfilling is not an easy task given the current milieu however the political economic concept of deliberative democracy provides us with a means with which we may engage and promote such a vision across the citizenries of europe j√ºrgen habermas has written persuasively on this topic asserting that political decisions should be the product of fair and reasonable discussion and debate among citizens it follows therefore that we must become more aware as citizens about the often obscured or consciously hidden ideological assumptions that lie behind policy choices this means that we need to foster universal political economic literacy to deal with new and existing challenges and a better understanding of the nature of value and what constitutes happiness as part of a coordinated discourse trade unions have a crucial role in ensuring that governments labour policies are ethically grounded but unions also have a role in realising this vision of a more ethically minded citizenry and a new eco social economic paradigm the components of which i have elucidated in this speech one of the ways in which to do this is to re establish or embed and enhance glaucon s social contract between the citizen and the state something which has been heavily eroded in much of europe following decades of attack from a prevailing neoliberal orthodoxy eroding labour rights through laissez faire policy and an almost fetishised embrace of unfettered globalisation trade unions have a vital role in turning around this tide by advocating a rights based approach to quality work and engaging in the deliberative democratic process what are the lessons we have learned from the economic crisis and the self regulating market i believe there are many in politics policymaking academia the commentariat citizens at large who have turned a corner having re evaluated often strongly held beliefs with an appreciation that the state has an important role that good regulation does matter be it in the financial construction or healthcare sectors all sectors in which we in ireland have seen the catastrophic and sometimes tragic effects of under regulation and or lack of enforcement my vision is of a europe with excellent public services at its core good jobs in the public sector mean quality services for citizens your members appreciate only too well that the services they deliver are not a cost to society but an investment in our communities this message must be taken to the heart of europe the centrality of individualism as a source of values with its emphasis on individual consumption insatiable acquisitiveness wealth accumulation and an ill informed hostility to the state its institutions also those who work in them has had a corrosive effect i hope that we are on a pathway of learning as peoples across europe that we must avoid the excessive materialism that was apparent for example in this country during the so called celtic tiger and that we move away from narcissistic individualism and towards collective solidarity neither should there be a notion of any trade union member being described as a former member joining belonging sharing the trade union values is a life choice anticipated by the young cherished to the end by those who are union people several global studies such as the world happiness report as well as qualitative research such as that by esping andersen clearly demonstrate that those countries that manage to foster this collective solidarity that abide by the principal of a strong social contract that believe in the benign and even transformative possibilities of the state and its institutions that provide universal social protection all report the highest quality of life and life satisfaction using both objective and subjective measurements mitchell and fazi identify as a prerequisite for the construction of a new international ist world order the realisation that based on interdependent but independent sovereign states the political right today is winning because it is capable of weaving powerful narratives of collective identityin which national sovereignty is defined in nativist nationalist or even racist terms progressives must thus be able to provide equally powerful narratives which recognise the human need for belonging and connectedness that belonging i believe must fly over borders unions must work not only at home but in the european union they are willing to build with others may i conclude by stating that i believe the related battle for decent work is a defining battle of our times i hope that your conference proves to be a fruitful and enjoyable experience and that you will all continue to play your part in defending the hard won rights of workers across europe as we continue to face the challenges and obstacles to a fairer society you have a powerful voice and one that i know can give leadership on the new form of economy and that you will use wisely as you demonstrate and realise the benefits of solidarity and seek to reclaim an understanding of work as the foundation for the achievement of other human rights and a strong foundation for a life of dignity fulfilment and flourishing go raibh mile maith agaibh go l√©ir

by g parthasarathy the swearing in ceremony on 26 may 2014 marking narendra modi s first term as prime minister in office was distinctly different from those one had witnessed earlier in new delhi apart from local dignitaries and the diplomatic corps the heads of government of all neighboring saarc south asian association for regional cooperation countries afghanistan pakistan maldives sri lanka bangladesh bhutan and nepal along with the prime minister of mauritius were also invited to his inauguration moreover unlike in the past there was significant public participation given the size of the audience the swearing in was administered in the forecourt of the rashtrapati bhavan by then president pranab mukherjee just over five years later modi discarded his earlier practice of inviting all the neighbours giving important clues about the likely direction of india s foreign policy over the next five years the heads of government of all eastern neighbours bangladesh myanmar thailand sri lanka nepal and bhutan along with the prime minister of mauritius were at the inauguration last week the president of kyrgyzstan who is also chairman of the shanghai cooperation organization was also welcomed as a special invitee modi s sweeping victory in the recent general elections has been regarded as remarkable not merely in india but also beyond our shores but his second swearing in at the rashtrapati bhavan has understandably raised some eyebrows as there was a distinct change in the list of invited countries on this occasion unlike in 2014 there was no presence of the prime minister of pakistan many naturally attributed this to the pulwama terrorist attack and the retaliatory airstrikes on the jaish e mohammed terrorist training centre in balakot but deep shifts in india s foreign policy outlook have been under the works for several years now calibrated policy change the absence of pakistan s prime minister was the outcome of a carefully calibrated policy change effected after the uri terrorist strike in 2016 india responded to that attack with surgical strikes on multiple terrorist camps and supporting pakistan army posts across the line of control while many in india would certainly not have welcomed the presence of prime minister imran khan in rashtrapati bhavan especially after the recent tensions the rationale for his not being invited needs to be carefully understood even as relations with pakistan were steadily deteriorating ever since the terror attacks in pathankot and uri in 2016 the modi government came to the conclusion that countries across the world were also losing patience with pakistani doublespeak on terrorism across its borders in both india and afghanistan there was no doubt that pakistan s army was sponsoring this terrorism new delhi was then also cultivating islamic countries like saudi arabia and the united arab emirates uae who were amongst the main funders and backers of pakistan sensing growing american and european anger and discontent with pakistan s continuing sponsorship of terrorism in india and afghanistan india commenced turning the screws on pakistan financially militarily and diplomatically financially india actively participated in the us led effort to use the international financial action task force fatf to cut off or drastically reduce pakistan s access to financial aid from western donors and institutions like the world bank and the asian development bank adb while china continued bilateral assistance to pakistan for the china pakistan economic corridor beijing could not weaken the international financial squeeze on pakistan led by the us this squeeze continues forcing pakistan which desperately needs funds from the international monetary fund imf to be seen as demonstrably taking action like clamping down on groups like the lashkar e taiba and the jaish e mohammed these moves were accompanied by concerted efforts by india to isolate pakistan diplomatically in south asia at the 2016 brics brazil russia india china and south africa summit in goa where russian president putin and chinese president xi jinping together with the presidents of brazil and south africa led their respective delegations india decided to exclude the participation of saarc countries which included pakistan it chose instead to invite the leaders of its eastern neighbours who are regionally linked to it under the bimstec grouping comprising bangladesh myanmar thailand nepal bhutan and sri lanka while pakistan was thus denied interaction with world leaders on indian soil a clear message was sent worldwide that india would make pakistan pay a heavy price for sponsorship of terrorism india s message about its readiness to do what is necessary to isolate pakistan regionally was reinforced tellingly barely a month later when india announced that prime minister modi would not attend the forthcoming saarc summit scheduled to be held in islamabad on 15 19 november 2016 contrary to public criticism that efforts to isolate pakistan in saarc would fail and new delhi would find itself isolated bangladesh and bhutan followed suit backing india within days bangladesh announced the growing interference in the internal affairs of bangladesh by one country has created an environment which is not conducive to hosting of the saarc summit in islamabad in november 2016 afghanistan s reaction was even sharper with kabul declaring due to the increased level of violence and fighting as a result of imposed terrorism on afghanistan the president ashraf ghani with his responsibilities as the commander in chief will be fully engaged and will not be able to participate in the saarc summit in the present circumstances bhutan s reservations were similarly expressed nepal sri lanka and maldives thereafter pulled out of the summit discarding saarc the decision by india to discard saarc as the primary grouping for promoting regional cooperation including for trade and economic cooperation was preceded by a number of pakistani actions over the years these actions made it clear that islamabad was determined to stall progress on promoting cooperation in crucial areas like regional trade investment and terrorism when the saarc grouping was set up in 1985 the expectation was that it would serve as the focal point for regional economic integration and devise modalities for cooperation in areas like education environment tourism and terrorism as globalization spread rapidly in the 1990s it soon became clear that saarc should follow the example set by groups like the european union eu and association of southeast asian nations asean to integrate economies and promote regional trade and investment a preferential trade agreement between saarc countries was signed in 1993 and came into force in 1995 in the meantime saarc leaders set up an eminent persons group to draw up a road map for economic integration in south asia this group recommended in 1999 that saarc should strive to make south asia a free trade area by 2010 a customs union by 2015 and an economic union like the eu by 2020 a deadline that is just one year away after prolonged discussions saarc ministers agreed on south asian free trade area safta in 2004 at the saarc summit in kathmandu article 5 of the agreement states each country shall accord national treatment to the products of other countries it was agreed that customs duties on all goods traded would be reduced to zero by 2016 pakistan has thereafter blatantly flouted the provisions of safta by drastically limiting the list of items that can be imported from india india s free trade agreement concluded with asean however now covers exchanges in both goods and services while pakistan is grossly flouting the provisions of a signed agreement on free trade in goods it is clear that given its opposition there can be no hope of it agreeing to free trade in services as an integral part of its look east policies india signed a free trade agreement with asean covering ten asean member states on 13 august 2009 annual trade with asean has now reached 81 3 billion interestingly india also has comprehensive economic cooperation partnerships with japan south korea singapore and malaysia which cover free trade in both goods and services our trade relations over the past decade have resulted in the formation of a free trade zone for us extending from our shores across the bay of bengal to the shores of south korea japan and the philippines the way ahead one of india s most remarkable diplomatic achievements has been that it has settled its maritime boundaries with all its eastern neighbors this was done not only with bilateral agreements on maritime boundaries with sri lanka myanmar thailand indonesia and bangladesh but also tripartite agreements to determine tri junctions with myanmar and thailand indonesia and thailand and sri lanka and maldives even arriving at an agreement to demarcate our maritime frontiers with pakistan will not be difficult once an agreement is reached on demarcating the land boundary in the sir creek area in gujarat pakistan however remains our only neighbor with whom maritime boundaries have not been finalized india has finalized its land and maritime boundaries with all its partners in bimstec we also have free trade agreements with all bimstec member states we are ready to provide transit facilities to bangladesh ports if our landlocked neighbors nepal and bhutan find our port facilities inadequate for their needs we make extensive use of colombo in sri lanka for international trade we are now looking at prospects for land corridors through myanmar to thailand and possibly vietnam pakistan allows the transit of goods from afghanistan to india across its soil while denying india this same route for its exports to afghanistan this is a gross violation of the entire concept of free transit of goods between members of a regional free trade agreement india also faces problems on extradition of persons involved in acts of terrorism on its soil finding safe haven in pakistan the mastermind of the 1993 terrorist bomb explosions in mumbai dawood ibrahim lives comfortably in one of the high end suburbs of karachi pakistan denies his presence on its soil zakiur rehman lakhvi one of the masterminds of the 2009 terrorist attack in mumbai lives comfortably under military protection in pakistan these pakistani actions violate the letter and spirit of the saarc regional convention on suppression of terrorism pakistan is now going through a serious economic crisis with its foreign exchange reserves falling periodically to just around 10 billion despite regular doles from china saudi arabia and the uae us led economic pressures could however deny cash strapped islamabad the money it needs desperately from the imf world bank the adb and oil rich arab countries like saudi arabia and the uae these donors would be reluctant to bail out pakistan while it faces pressures from the international community for its links to terrorist groups which are fomenting terrorism in india and afghanistan in these circumstances actions like denying pakistan international legitimacy by isolating it in south asia as we are now doing serve a useful purpose they contain pakistan s ability to inflict damage on its neighbors by using terrorism as an instrument of state policy india will in course of time engage pakistan diplomatically and discreetly to assess how sincere rawalpindi is in dismantling its infrastructure of terrorism diplomatic and backchannel contacts will inevitably be utilized to directly ascertain what pakistan proposes to do on issues like terrorism india has to be careful on this score as imran khan s government is widely perceived as being subservient to the army in the conduct of not just pakistan s foreign and security policies but also in crafting the country s internal politics economic management and internal security the new foreign minister s jaishankar has personally dealt with countries that influence pakistan for decades he has dealt with pakistan directly as foreign secretary for over three years he is a realist especially on issues of national security g parthasarathy is a former diplomat he served as india s high commissioner to pakistan and myanmar

1x 1 3x 1 for the purposes of calculation of this ratio as of march 31 2019 adjusted ebitda is calculated on the last twelve months basis net working capital as of march 31 2019 remained flat compared to december 31 2018 as the increase in contract liabilities over the first quarter of 2019 due to an increase in sales was offset by a decrease in contract liabilities from the utilization of prepayments for annual subscriptions received from our customers in the fourth quarter of 2018 net debt remained flat as net cash generated from operating activities of p375 million was offset by the acquisition of a 25 01 ownership interest in llc skillaz for p232 million and capital expenditures net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio declined from 1 3x to 1 1x due to an increase in adjusted ebitda we are pleased with the operational and financial results that the company has achieved in the first quarter of 2019 said mikhail zhukov ceo of headhunter group plc headhunter group s strategy is to drive growth in russian regions as well as in small and medium accounts to support these priorities the company has recently carried out significant organizational capability upgrades we are happy to see strong customer base expansion in both areas while at the same time increasing arpc across all customer segments we continue making significant investments into our brand and into driving new users to our platform which now holds over 38 million cvs we are also introducing new solutions allowing our clients to source candidates outside of our main platform which gives our clients access to even more relevant candidates and makes recruiting through headhunter even more efficient the company is delivering on its ambitious technology road map with a particular focus on mobile platforms in the first quarter of 2019 over 77 of our traffic came via mobile devices and more than half of our traffic came from visitors who only used our mobile platform we are happy to kick off our life as a public company with this strong set of quarterly results and we are excited to explore the opportunity ahead of us to the benefit of our shareholders operating segments for management purposes we are organized into operating segments based on the geography of our operations our operating segments include russia belarus kazakhstan and other countries as each segment other than russia individually comprises less than 10 of our revenue for reporting purposes we combine all segments other than russia into the other segments category seasonality revenue we generally do not experience substantial seasonal fluctuations in demand for our services and our revenue remains relatively stable throughout each quarter however as our customers are predominately businesses and use our services mostly on business days our quarterly revenue is affected by the number of business days in a quarter with the exception of our services that represent stand ready performance obligations such as subscriptions to access our cv database which are satisfied over the period of subscription including weekends and holidays public holidays in russia predominantly fall during the first quarter of each year which results in lower business activity in the quarter accordingly our first quarter revenue is typically slightly lower than in the other quarters for example our first quarter revenue in our russia segment in 2017 and 2018 was 21 1 and 20 9 respectively of total russia segment revenue for the year the number of business days in a quarter may also be affected by calendar layout in a specific year also the government of russia decides on an annual basis how public holidays that occur on weekends will be reallocated to business days throughout the year as a requirement of the labor code of russia as a result the number of business days in a quarter may be different in each year while the total number of business days in the year would remain the same this affects our revenue in a particular quarter and year on year revenue growth rate for that quarter if the allocation of business days in the comparable period was different in addition when a calendar layout in a specific year provides for several consecutive holidays or small number of business days between holidays or holidays adjacent to weekends hr managers of our customers may take short vacations further contributing to the decrease in business activities in these periods the following table illustrates the number of business days by quarter for the years 2017 to 2019 in 2019 the total number of working days is the same as in 2018 but there is 1 business day more 2 business days less and 1 business day more in the first quarter second quarter and third quarter respectively and the same number of business days in the fourth quarter number of business days as of total business days per year 2019 2018 2017 2019 2018 2017 first quarter 57 56 57 23 1 22 7 23 1 second quarter 59 61 61 23 9 24 7 24 7 third quarter 66 65 65 26 7 26 3 26 3 fourth quarter 65 65 64 26 3 26 3 25 9 100 0 100 0 100 0 total year 247 247 247 therefore in the first quarter of 2019 we saw a positive impact from the additional business days in the quarter as compared to the first quarter of 2018 however an opposite effect is expected in the second quarter of 2019 as compared to the second quarter of 2018 operating costs and expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization most of our expenses are not linked directly to our revenue our operating costs and expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization consist primarily of personnel and marketing expenses personnel and marketing expenses cumulatively accounted for 77 4 and 78 9 of our total operating costs and expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization for the years ended december 31 2018 and december 31 2017 respectively marketing expenses are more volatile in terms of allocation to quarters which is affected by the decisions we make about how we realize our strategy in a particular year which can differ from year to year therefore total marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue for a particular quarter may not be fully representative of the whole year personnel expenses are relatively stable over the year however they are also affected by other dynamics such as our hiring decisions costs and expenses such as share based compensations or foreign exchange gains or losses can be significantly concentrated in a particular quarter the first quarter segment external expenses in our russia segment in 2017 and 2018 were 23 0 and 25 5 respectively of the total russia segment external expenses for the year net income and adjusted ebitda even though our revenue remains relatively stable throughout each quarter the seasonal revenue fluctuations described above affect our net income as a result of revenue seasonality our profitability in the first quarter is usually lower than in other quarters and for the full year because our expenses as percentage of revenue are usually higher in first quarter due to lower revenue for example our adjusted ebitda margin was 36 4 for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 46 7 for the full year 2018 our profitability is also affected by our decisions on timing of expenses as described above contract liabilities our contract liabilities are affected by the annual subscriptions renewal cycle in our key accounts customer segment a substantial number of our key accounts renew their subscriptions in the first quarter and prepay in the fourth quarter of a previous year as per our normal payment terms as a result we receive substantial prepayments from our customers in the fourth quarter and our contract liabilities usually increase substantially higher during the fourth quarter for example our contract liabilities as of march 31 june 30 september 30 and december 31 2018 were p1 607 million p1 548 million p1 553 million and p2 073 million respectively net cash generated from operating activities our net cash generated from operating activities is affected by seasonal fluctuations of business activity as explained in revenue and by substantial prepayments from our customers see contract liabilities as well as by our decisions in regard to timing of expenses see operating expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization and to a lesser extent by payment terms provided to us by our largest suppliers such as tv advertising agencies and others net working capital our net working capital is primarily affected by changes in our contract liabilities as discussed above as our contract liabilities are usually higher in the fourth quarter our net working capital is usually the lowest in the fourth quarter for example our net working capital of march 31 june 30 september 30 and december 31 2018 was p 2 044 million p 2 048 million p 2 036 million and p 2 623 million respectively first quarter 2019 results our revenue was p1 678 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 compared to p1 274 million for the three months ended march 31 2018 revenue for the three months ended march 31 2019 increased by p405 million or 31 8 compared to the three months ended march 31 2018 primarily due to the increase in revenue in our russia segment revenue in our russia segment was p1 556 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 compared to p1 189 million for the three months ended march 31 2018 revenue in our russia segment increased by p367 million or 30 8 this was primarily due to the growth in the number of paying small and medium accounts by 73 8 in the other regions of russia and by 15 9 in moscow and st petersburg and the increase in arpc in key accounts in moscow and st petersburg by 17 2 driven by price

medium accounts continues to grow in key accounts in moscow and st petersburg we increased arpc by 17 2 in the first quarter of 2019 driven by the increase in prices e g 10 on average for subscriptions and 18 for a single standard type job posting the increase in usage of job postings by this category of customers and reducing discounts arpc in other customer segments was affected by price increases discussed above and the increased usage of services per customer offset by the accelerated intake of new customers who as evidenced by historical statistics initially have a lower arpc for example in other regions of russia in key accounts and small and medium accounts arpc remained flat however the arpc of customers acquired before january 1 2018 in these customer segments has increased by 12 and 18 respectively operating costs and expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization operating costs and expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization were p934 million

compared to the three months ended march 31 2018 the main factors that contributed to the increase in personnel expenses are i hiring 107 people during the second third and fourth quarters of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019 primarily in our development sales and production teams in our russia segment and ii the indexation of wages in the first quarter of 2019 these changes were partially offset by the decrease of employee expenses under our management incentive agreement marketing expenses marketing expenses decreased by p28 million or 9 9 for the three months ended march 31 2019 compared to the three months ended march 31 2018 the decrease in marketing expenses was primarily due to the decrease in tv marketing expenses as the result of a lower share of the total annual marketing budget allocated to the first quarter this year other general and administrative expenses our office rent and maintenance expenses decreased by 17 5 to p44 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 compared to the three months ended march 31 2018 at january 1 2019 we initially adopted ifrs 16 the new accounting standard that introduced a single on balance sheet accounting model for lessees as a result we as a lessee have recognized right of use assets representing our rights to use the underlying assets and lease liabilities representing our obligation to make lease payments we have applied ifrs 16 using the modified retrospective approach accordingly the comparative information presented for 2018 has not been restated and is presented as previously reported under ias 17 and related interpretations we recognized p18 455 thousand of depreciation charges and p8 777 thousand of interest costs from leases in the first quarter of 2019 our professional services increased by 30 0 to p81 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 as a result of increased ipo related expenses net foreign exchange loss net foreign exchange loss was p23 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 an increase of p22 million compared to a p1 million loss for the three months ended march 31 2018 the net foreign exchange loss for the three months ended march 31 2019 reflects the appreciation of the russian ruble to u s dollar during the first quarter of 2019 as we decided in 2018 to convert substantial russian ruble denominated cash amount into u s dollar in light of a dividend we were considering to pay at that time which was not paid depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization were p165 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 compared to p144 million for the three months ended march 31 2018 depreciation and amortization increased by p21 million or 14 6 primarily due to a depreciation charge of p18 million related to right of use assets recognized as of january 1 2019 under the new standard ifrs 16 leases see other general and administrative expenses finance income and costs finance income was p26 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 compared to p19 million for the three months ended march 31 2018 finance income increased by p7 million or 34 6 due to an increase in available cash balances that were deposited finance costs were p168 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 and they remained flat compared to p166 million for the three months ended march 31 2018 income tax expense income tax expense was p177 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 compared to p102 million for the three months ended march 31 2018 the increase of p75 million was primarily due to the increase of profit before income tax from p88 million in the three months ended march 31 2018 to p416 million in the three months ended march 31 2019 the decrease in the effective tax rate from 115 4 for the three months ended march 31 2018 to 42 5 for the three months ended march 31 2019 was caused mainly by the decrease in the proportion of non deductible expenses and an unrecognized deferred tax asset relative to the profit before income tax the increase of the effective tax rate from 33 0 for the year ended december 31 2018 to 42 5 for the three months ended march 31 2019 was primarily due to a tax expense associated with our tax restructuring net income loss net income was p239 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 compared to p 14 million net loss for the three months ended march 31 2018 net income increased by p252 million compared with the three months ended march 31 2018 primarily due to the reasons described above adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda was p774 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 compared to p440 million for the three months ended march 31 2018 and it increased by p333 million primarily due to the increase in revenue offset by the increase in operating expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization and the net foreign exchange loss adjusted net income adjusted net income was p373 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 compared to p131 million for the three months ended march 31 2018 adjusted net income increased by p242 million compared with the three months ended march 31 2018 primarily due to the reasons described above cash flows net cash generated from operating activities for the three months ended march 31 2019 net cash generated from operating activities was p375 million compared to p175 million for the three months ended march 31 2018 the change between the periods of p200 million was primarily driven by an increase in sales which resulted in an increase in net income adjusted for non cash items and items not affecting cash flow from operating activities and an increase in trade payables primarily due to increase in payables to employees and suppliers these changes were partially offset by an increase in income taxes paid due to an increased tax base and a decrease in the movement of contract liabilities in the three months ended march 31 2019 as compared to three months ended march 31 2018 net cash used in investing activities for the three months ended march 31 2019 net cash used in investing activities was p290 million compared to p52 million for the three months ended march 31 2018 the change between the periods of p238 million was primarily due to the acquisition of a 25 01 ownership interest in llc skillaz net cash used in financing activities for the three months ended march 31 2019 net cash used in financing activities was p574 million compared to p229 million for the three months ended march 31 2018 the change between these periods was primarily due to a loan repayment of p270 million to the associate of a non controlling shareholder and an increase in the bank loan repayments from p200 million in the three months ended march 31 2018 to p245 million in the three months ended march 31 2019 in accordance with the repayment schedule capital expenditures our additions to property and equipment and intangible assets in the three months ended march 31 2019 were p85 million an increase of p16 million compared to p69 million for the three months ended march 31 2018 primarily due to p34 million in office renovation costs in three months ended march 31 2019 as we are planning to redesign our offices in moscow and yaroslavl in 2019 and have allocated a budget of p220 to p250 million for this purpose in this year partially offset by p41 million acquisition of

should european countries want the euro to replace the dollar as the world s dominant reserve currency the sino us trade war may offer a window of opportunity the souring of ties between the world s two largest economies will indicate the extent to which china can switch some of its giant reserve holdings to another hard currency and also point to the limitations the euro zone faces in providing a viable alternative story continues below advertisement remove ad in the post world war two era no asset has ever fully matched us government bonds for size liquidity and credit quality it is the closest any global security has come to being perceived as a cash like risk free asset with over 16 trillion worth of paper in circulation yet a year into a bitter tariff war there are some signs of beijing s discomfort at being both the united states biggest trade adversary and one of its biggest creditors recent data showed china sold more us treasuries in march than it has in any month over the past 2 1 2 years if that proves to be more than a one month quirk speculation will rise about where it is diverting those reserves and the euro zone the world s biggest trading bloc tops the list of likely spots story continues below advertisement remove ad on size alone euro zone government bonds appear to provide a credible landing pad outstanding securities are almost two thirds of the overall treasury market there are signs already of greater chinese interest in europe bankers attribute record asian demand for recent spanish french and belgian debt sales to beijing and china has stepped up buying debt from europe s quasi sovereign entities bankers told reuters in particular the european stability mechanism esm a euro zone guaranteed aaa a1 rated bailout fund story continues below advertisement remove ad asian investors snapped up 33 of the esm s recent 2 billion euro 10 year bond data from international financing review shows asian takeup for esm s euro issues last year was 4 5 but for chinese reserve managers to shift hundreds of billions of dollars from treasuries to europe s single currency the euro bloc needs to address key shortcomings i find it hard to square the circle how such a huge treasury holding can be diversified away given the landscape we are in said salman ahmed chief investment strategist at lombard odier investment managers in the euro zone there is not a big risk free market twenty years down the line it may be different for ahmed the main issue is that credit risk in the bloc is not uniform the 19 members each run their own fiscal policies budget rules are too loosely policed to ensure adherence and euro exit remains a theoretical possibility so wealthier members such as germany remain net savers that run balanced budgets or even surpluses while others mostly in southern europe are dogged by high debt the resulting mix of credit and political risks make it harder to see the aggregate euro zone bond market as a true mirror of the us treasury universe ross hutchison a fund manager at aberdeen standard investments says it boils down to the fact the united states has a federal nature that the euro area hasn t got yet additionally distortions stemming from years of bond buying stimulus by the european central bank mean available euro government bonds are far fewer than may appear while euro government debt outstanding is around 9 5 trillion the ecb is estimated to hold roughly a quarter and the kind of safe securities that reserve managers seek are even scarcer aaa rated debt from germany the netherlands and luxembourg totals around 2 5 trillion less if ecb holdings are discounted debt from slightly lower rated france belgium and austria would add another 3 trillion italy on the other hand has the bloc s biggest government bond market worth 2 3 trillion but its poor debt to gdp ratio sluggish economy and populist policies make its bonds riskier and its credit rating is a notch or two above junk so in times of stress investors clamour for german bonds while in italy yields spike threatening to undermine local banks that hold these securities italian 10 year yields are at 2 5 versus germany s minus 0 22 such risks have chipped away at the euro s fortunes as a reserve currency international monetary fund data shows it comprises 20 of global central bank holdings from 26 in 2009 the decline is linked to the 2011 greek debt crisis that then ravaged spain italy portugal and ireland highlighting risks of default by a member state and redenomination of euro debt into a new currency common bond european officials are keen to counter the dollar s hegemony and at a conference last month they debated ways to win the euro a stronger international role but they made no mention of the one measure that could resolve the issue at a stroke joint debt issuance via common euro zone bonds such securities would pool the bloc s risks and offer safer securities than those from most individual nations olli rehn bank of finland governor and an ecb governing council member said last week a safe asset would help enhance the euro s international role offering hope the issue will be on the agenda of the new european commission later this year a common bond would be more significant than the creation of another tltro in boosting demand for euros globally and reserve managers would be part of that story said david owen chief european economist at jefferies he was referring to the ecb s cheap multi year loans maybe there will be more focus on pushing forward this agenda and taking advantage of the u s and china having this trade spat owen added others however note that wealthier states oppose any common bond programme fearing they will end up footing the bill also across europe populist and anti establishment movements are on the rise with the agenda of slowing integration and returning power to national capitals such groups grabbed a greater share of the vote in eu parliamentary elections last month albeit less than expected if anything the trend is towards decentralisation of power ahmed said

net debt to adjusted ebitda 1 ratio 1 1x 1 3x 1 for the purposes of calculation of this ratio as of march 31 2019 adjusted ebitda is calculated on the last twelve months basis net working capital as of march 31 2019 remained flat compared to december 31 2018 as the increase in contract liabilities over the first quarter of 2019 due to an increase in sales was offset by a decrease in contract liabilities from the utilization of prepayments for annual subscriptions received from our customers in the fourth quarter of 2018 net debt remained flat as net cash generated from operating activities of p375 million was offset by the acquisition of a 25 01 ownership interest in llc skillaz for p232 million and capital expenditures net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio declined from 1 3x to 1 1x due to an increase in adjusted ebitda we are pleased with the operational and financial results that the company has achieved in the first quarter of 2019 said mikhail zhukov ceo of headhunter group plc headhunter group s strategy is to drive growth in russian regions as well as in small and medium accounts to support these priorities the company has recently carried out significant organizational capability upgrades we are happy to see strong customer base expansion in both areas while at the same time increasing arpc across all customer segments we continue making significant investments into our brand and into driving new users to our platform which now holds over 38 million cvs we are also introducing new solutions allowing our clients to source candidates outside of our main platform which gives our clients access to even more relevant candidates and makes recruiting through headhunter even more efficient the company is delivering on its ambitious technology road map with a particular focus on mobile platforms in the first quarter of 2019 over 77 of our traffic came via mobile devices and more than half of our traffic came from visitors who only used our mobile platform we are happy to kick off our life as a public company with this strong set of quarterly results and we are excited to explore the opportunity ahead of us to the benefit of our shareholders operating segments for management purposes we are organized into operating segments based on the geography of our operations our operating segments include russia belarus kazakhstan and other countries as each segment other than russia individually comprises less than 10 of our revenue for reporting purposes we combine all segments other than russia into the other segments category seasonality revenue we generally do not experience substantial seasonal fluctuations in demand for our services and our revenue remains relatively stable throughout each quarter however as our customers are predominately businesses and use our services mostly on business days our quarterly revenue is affected by the number of business days in a quarter with the exception of our services that represent stand ready performance obligations such as subscriptions to access our cv database which are satisfied over the period of subscription including weekends and holidays public holidays in russia predominantly fall during the first quarter of each year which results in lower business activity in the quarter accordingly our first quarter revenue is typically slightly lower than in the other quarters for example our first quarter revenue in our russia segment in 2017 and 2018 was 21 1 and 20 9 respectively of total russia segment revenue for the year the number of business days in a quarter may also be affected by calendar layout in a specific year also the government of russia decides on an annual basis how public holidays that occur on weekends will be reallocated to business days throughout the year as a requirement of the labor code of russia as a result the number of business days in a quarter may be different in each year while the total number of business days in the year would remain the same this affects our revenue in a particular quarter and year on year revenue growth rate for that quarter if the allocation of business days in the comparable period was different in addition when a calendar layout in a specific year provides for several consecutive holidays or small number of business days between holidays or holidays adjacent to weekends hr managers of our customers may take short vacations further contributing to the decrease in business activities in these periods the following table illustrates the number of business days by quarter for the years 2017 to 2019 in 2019 the total number of working days is the same as in 2018 but there is 1 business day more 2 business days less and 1 business day more in the first quarter second quarter and third quarter respectively and the same number of business days in the fourth quarter number of business days as of total business days per year 2019 2018 2017 2019 2018 2017 first quarter 57 56 57 23 1 22 7 23 1 second quarter 59 61 61 23 9 24 7 24 7 third quarter 66 65 65 26 7 26 3 26 3 fourth quarter 65 65 64 26 3 26 3 25 9 100 0 100 0 100 0 total year 247 247 247 therefore in the first quarter of 2019 we saw a positive impact from the additional business days in the quarter as compared to the first quarter of 2018 however an opposite effect is expected in the second quarter of 2019 as compared to the second quarter of 2018 operating costs and expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization most of our expenses are not linked directly to our revenue our operating costs and expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization consist primarily of personnel and marketing expenses personnel and marketing expenses cumulatively accounted for 77 4 and 78 9 of our total operating costs and expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization for the years ended december 31 2018 and december 31 2017 respectively marketing expenses are more volatile in terms of allocation to quarters which is affected by the decisions we make about how we realize our strategy in a particular year which can differ from year to year therefore total marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue for a particular quarter may not be fully representative of the whole year personnel expenses are relatively stable over the year however they are also affected by other dynamics such as our hiring decisions costs and expenses such as share based compensations or foreign exchange gains or losses can be significantly concentrated in a particular quarter the first quarter segment external expenses in our russia segment in 2017 and 2018 were 23 0 and 25 5 respectively of the total russia segment external expenses for the year net income and adjusted ebitda even though our revenue remains relatively stable throughout each quarter the seasonal revenue fluctuations described above affect our net income as a result of revenue seasonality our profitability in the first quarter is usually lower than in other quarters and for the full year because our expenses as percentage of revenue are usually higher in first quarter due to lower revenue for example our adjusted ebitda margin was 36 4 for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 46 7 for the full year 2018 our profitability is also affected by our decisions on timing of expenses as described above contract liabilities our contract liabilities are affected by the annual subscriptions renewal cycle in our key accounts customer segment a substantial number of our key accounts renew their subscriptions in the first quarter and prepay in the fourth quarter of a previous year as per our normal payment terms as a result we receive substantial prepayments from our customers in the fourth quarter and our contract liabilities usually increase substantially higher during the fourth quarter for example our contract liabilities as of march 31 june 30 september 30 and december 31 2018 were p1 607 million p1 548 million p1 553 million and p2 073 million respectively net cash generated from operating activities our net cash generated from operating activities is affected by seasonal fluctuations of business activity as explained in revenue and by substantial prepayments from our customers see contract liabilities as well as by our decisions in regard to timing of expenses see operating expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization and to a lesser extent by payment terms provided to us by our largest suppliers such as tv advertising agencies and others net working capital our net working capital is primarily affected by changes in our contract liabilities as discussed above as our contract liabilities are usually higher in the fourth quarter our net working capital is usually the lowest in the fourth quarter for example our net working capital of march 31 june 30 september 30 and december 31 2018 was p 2 044 million p 2 048 million p 2 036 million and p 2 623 million respectively first quarter 2019 results our revenue was p1 678 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 compared to p1 274 million for the three months ended march 31 2018 revenue for the three months ended march 31 2019 increased by p405 million or 31 8 compared to the three months ended march 31 2018 primarily due to the increase in revenue in our russia segment revenue in our russia segment was p1 556 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 compared to p1 189 million for the three months ended march 31 2018 revenue in our russia segment increased by p367 million or 30 8 this was primarily due to the growth in the number of paying small and medium accounts by 73 8 in the other regions of russia and by 15 9 in moscow and st petersburg and the increase in arpc in key accounts in moscow and st petersburg by 17 2 driven by price increases and an increase in the usage of our services by this type of customer the following table breaks down revenue by product for the

regions outside of moscow and st petersburg and small and medium accounts continues to grow in key accounts in moscow and st petersburg we increased arpc by 17 2 in the first quarter of 2019 driven by the increase in prices e g 10 on average for subscriptions and 18 for a single standard type job posting the increase in usage of job postings by this category of customers and reducing discounts arpc in other customer segments was affected by price increases discussed above and the increased usage of services per customer offset by the accelerated intake of new customers who as evidenced by historical statistics initially have a lower arpc for example in other regions of russia in key accounts and small and medium accounts arpc remained flat however the arpc of customers acquired before january 1 2018 in these customer segments has increased by 12 and 18 respectively operating costs and expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization operating costs and expenses exclusive of

or 12 9 for the three months ended march 31 2019 compared to the three months ended march 31 2018 the main factors that contributed to the increase in personnel expenses are i hiring 107 people during the second third and fourth quarters of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019 primarily in our development sales and production teams in our russia segment and ii the indexation of wages in the first quarter of 2019 these changes were partially offset by the decrease of employee expenses under our management incentive agreement marketing expenses marketing expenses decreased by p28 million or 9 9 for the three months ended march 31 2019 compared to the three months ended march 31 2018 the decrease in marketing expenses was primarily due to the decrease in tv marketing expenses as the result of a lower share of the total annual marketing budget allocated to the first quarter this year other general and administrative expenses our office rent and maintenance expenses decreased by 17 5 to p44 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 compared to the three months ended march 31 2018 at january 1 2019 we initially adopted ifrs 16 the new accounting standard that introduced a single on balance sheet accounting model for lessees as a result we as a lessee have recognized right of use assets representing our rights to use the underlying assets and lease liabilities representing our obligation to make lease payments we have applied ifrs 16 using the modified retrospective approach accordingly the comparative information presented for 2018 has not been restated and is presented as previously reported under ias 17 and related interpretations we recognized p18 455 thousand of depreciation charges and p8 777 thousand of interest costs from leases in the first quarter of 2019 our professional services increased by 30 0 to p81 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 as a result of increased ipo related expenses net foreign exchange loss net foreign exchange loss was p23 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 an increase of p22 million compared to a p1 million loss for the three months ended march 31 2018 the net foreign exchange loss for the three months ended march 31 2019 reflects the appreciation of the russian ruble to u s dollar during the first quarter of 2019 as we decided in 2018 to convert substantial russian ruble denominated cash amount into u s dollar in light of a dividend we were considering to pay at that time which was not paid depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization were p165 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 compared to p144 million for the three months ended march 31 2018 depreciation and amortization increased by p21 million or 14 6 primarily due to a depreciation charge of p18 million related to right of use assets recognized as of january 1 2019 under the new standard ifrs 16 leases see other general and administrative expenses finance income and costs finance income was p26 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 compared to p19 million for the three months ended march 31 2018 finance income increased by p7 million or 34 6 due to an increase in available cash balances that were deposited finance costs were p168 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 and they remained flat compared to p166 million for the three months ended march 31 2018 income tax expense income tax expense was p177 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 compared to p102 million for the three months ended march 31 2018 the increase of p75 million was primarily due to the increase of profit before income tax from p88 million in the three months ended march 31 2018 to p416 million in the three months ended march 31 2019 the decrease in the effective tax rate from 115 4 for the three months ended march 31 2018 to 42 5 for the three months ended march 31 2019 was caused mainly by the decrease in the proportion of non deductible expenses and an unrecognized deferred tax asset relative to the profit before income tax the increase of the effective tax rate from 33 0 for the year ended december 31 2018 to 42 5 for the three months ended march 31 2019 was primarily due to a tax expense associated with our tax restructuring net income loss net income was p239 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 compared to p 14 million net loss for the three months ended march 31 2018 net income increased by p252 million compared with the three months ended march 31 2018 primarily due to the reasons described above adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda was p774 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 compared to p440 million for the three months ended march 31 2018 and it increased by p333 million primarily due to the increase in revenue offset by the increase in operating expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization and the net foreign exchange loss adjusted net income adjusted net income was p373 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 compared to p131 million for the three months ended march 31 2018 adjusted net income increased by p242 million compared with the three months ended march 31 2018 primarily due to the reasons described above cash flows net cash generated from operating activities for the three months ended march 31 2019 net cash generated from operating activities was p375 million compared to p175 million for the three months ended march 31 2018 the change between the periods of p200 million was primarily driven by an increase in sales which resulted in an increase in net income adjusted for non cash items and items not affecting cash flow from operating activities and an increase in trade payables primarily due to increase in payables to employees and suppliers these changes were partially offset by an increase in income taxes paid due to an increased tax base and a decrease in the movement of contract liabilities in the three months ended march 31 2019 as compared to three months ended march 31 2018 net cash used in investing activities for the three months ended march 31 2019 net cash used in investing activities was p290 million compared to p52 million for the three months ended march 31 2018 the change between the periods of p238 million was primarily due to the acquisition of a 25 01 ownership interest in llc skillaz net cash used in financing activities for the three months ended march 31 2019 net cash used in financing activities was p574 million compared to p229 million for the three months ended march 31 2018 the change between these periods was primarily due to a loan repayment of p270 million to the associate of a non controlling shareholder and an increase in the bank loan repayments from p200 million in the three months ended march 31 2018 to p245 million in the three months ended march 31 2019 in accordance with the repayment schedule capital expenditures our additions to property and equipment and intangible assets in the three months ended march 31 2019 were p85 million an increase of p16 million compared to p69 million for the three months ended march 31 2018 primarily due to p34 million in office renovation costs in three months ended march 31 2019 as we are planning to redesign our offices in moscow and yaroslavl in 2019 and have allocated a budget of p220 to p250 million for this purpose in

speech at the european federation of public service unions annual congress trade unions and the future dublin the rds tuesday 4 june 2019 a chairde let me say at the outset how pleased i am to have been invited to address you here today having been a member of a trade union for over 50 years please be assured that i believe fully in the purpose and importance of a union may i begin by thanking kevin callinan deputy general secretary of f√≥rsa for the invitation to speak here this morning at this the annual conference of the european public service unions epsu your federation with its over 8 million members across europe 200 000 of whom are members of the five irish affiliations including f√≥rsa which is the largest public sector union in this country i am delighted that the epsu conference attended by some 600 delegates today and held every five years is taking place in dublin for this is indeed a city with a proud tradition within the trade union movement the 1913 lockout in dublin was a seminal period in the formation of collective representation for the working classes in this country more than 20 000 workers were either locked out of their jobs by their employers or went on strike it marked a watershed in irish labour history the principle of union action and workers solidarity had been firmly asserted as president i have been privileged to be asked to speak in the past of the role of larkin connolly and others of trade unionists and particularly of the brave and neglected women trade unionists and their importance to our history in the late 19th and early 20th century while drawing strength and courage from the exemplary bravery and determination of these individuals and indeed from more contemporary figures like mary manning the shopworker from irish grocery chain dunnes stores who in 1984 refused to handle the sale of fruit from south africa in protest at the apartheid regime the labour movement draws its strength from its collectivity from the hundreds of thousands of people willing to demonstrate solidarity in their workplace towards their fellow citizens and towards people all over the world these were themes i addressed inter alia in the littleton lecture on the lockout of 1913 and again when i gave the second phelan lecture on the future of work epsu works hard to deliver better working conditions improved health and safety and enhanced rights for its members negotiating best practice agreements that improve the working lives of european public service workers and ensuring quality services for citizens of particular concern for epsu is the issue of gender inequality an issue to which i shall return later in my speech public services on which all citizens rely are under increasing strain from budget cuts liberalisation austerity low pay and poor working conditions tax avoidance by multinationals impacts on the sustainability of public finances in turn impacting on public services the role that epsu plays in standing up for the rights of citizens including migrants both in the workplace and in the services your members deliver is also critical in ensuring that the most vulnerable citizens in our countries are protected from exploitation i note that congress will shortly debate a motion in relation to migrant workers in ireland only one in four workers are now members of a trade union of whom over half are public service workers this reflects a decline in private sector trade union membership in 1980 almost two thirds of irish workers were members of trade unions however there are encouraging signs that this trend is reversing with evidence of new recruitment the trade union movement we must continually remind ourselves emanates from a powerful proud tradition on which in turn civil rights movements the anti apartheid movement and equal rights movements could call for support it is important that we also acknowledge on all parts of this island the role of the trade union movement from its beginnings down to our times in opposing sectarianism the trade union movement lest we forget has also been an international one and it correctly sees as edward phelan did in his day in his harris lecture with john maynard keynes in 1931 that migrating unemployment from one setting to another effectively positioning wage levels in competition with each other in a downward spiral could be disastrous for global economies an over reliance on the economic orthodoxy of today with limited space allowed to discover new knowledge and adherence to what we now know to be bogus expertise all played their part in the unfolding of and response to the economic and social catastrophe that was the great recession which this country with others experienced just a decade ago in these times our new circumstances require a higher degree of economic literacy if such mistakes are to be avoided in recurring once again this requires i suggest consideration of a new ecological social paradigm based on economic heterodoxy such as that proposed by prof ian gough and others that recognises the limits of the world s natural resources as well as the role that unrestrained greed has played in creating the climate crisis in his book heat greed and human need gough outlines how the alternative paradigm is rooted in the concept of human need over greed it espouses gender equality redistribution and a reconfigured social consumption and investment strategy that transfers resources and technology from rich countries to developing countries as the key means to achieve this eco social welfare state the eco social policies that underpin such an economic paradigm must simultaneously pursue both equity social justice and sustainability sufficiency goals within an activist innovation state with substantial public investment and greater regulation and planning furthermore socio economic measures are also required to offset any regressive impacts of the ecological transition for lower income groups and to reverse growing levels of inequality it is apposite that the theme of your congress is fighting for a union for all such a title calls to mind the notion of inclusivity while ireland has been at the forefront of truly enormous social change in recent years which has advanced inclusivity it has yet to achieve an acceptable level of cohesion as is the case in much of the eu results from several recently held referenda on issues such as divorce marriage equality and abortion rights herald a more progressive and inclusive modern ireland on the level of personal or identity issues one which espouses compassion and tolerance over judgement and shame such progress demonstrates an increasingly liberal and secular society with an emphasis on personal freedoms i would argue that this move towards an articulation of the desire for individual rights can be more perfectly compatible with the objectives of social cohesion social connectedness and the move towards an eco social model which i advocate in this speech unfortunately however i am struck by a growing divergence between such societal progress at the level of personal freedoms on the one hand and the speed with which this country and many others globally are proceeding with regard to social equity or labour policy and in particular workers rights and conditions this leads me to question the future role of the international labour organisation the only surviving international institution that was created from the ashes of world war i which in its constitution refers to social justice as being essential to lasting universal peace in our present circumstances almost 100 years after that constitution was first proclaimed that spirit of idealism and of vital moral purpose is more urgently required than ever yet it is seriously undermined this begs the question of how can the ilo re dedicate itself to its founding mission in the context of an ongoing assault on workers rights i believe that the founding message given expression in an achievable agenda of the ilo must be vigorously brought to the attention of the world by all of us who believe in equity and the dignity of work how much better it would be if the necessary elements of what constituted social cohesion formed the basis of the discourse that prevailed on the streets of the world rather than the excluded being abandoned to become the prey of xenophobes homophobes and racists being positive i suggest that all of the prevailing ruling concepts in our present economic discourse flexibility globalisation productivity innovation social protection decent work are capable of being re defined given shared moral resonance made useful within the context of an ecological social paradigm to these i will speak in more detail shortly on the subject of ecology it cannot be denied that the most pressing issue facing us all as a global community and inhabitants of a planet that is in peril owing to insatiable unrestricted consumption of the earth s finite natural resources since the onset of the anthropocene i speak of course of the climate crisis let me say first that i see the role of public servants as being transformative in acting as champions for climate action both in terms of mitigation and adaptation public servants have the capacity given a real opportunity to shape and implement policies in these spheres that will reduce the impact of climate change and enable society to adapt to the most destructive effects of a changing climate which we are already beginning to witness first hand through for instance the increased severity and frequency of storms and extreme weather events there exists now a great opportunity to give leadership and for trade unions to play a strong role in pushing for fair ambitious and binding international agreements on greenhouse gas emission reduction targets while the eu has a set of binding emissions targets for 2020 and 2030 we must now plan for full decarbonisation of our european economies by 2050 encouraging the rest of the world to follow suit and urging in the strongest possible terms the usa to re consider its regressive and pernicious decision to leave the global paris agreement unions can seize the opportunity of providing a lead role in developing a strategy for a just transition for workers and communities to ensure that we are all part of a sustainable low carbon economy and benefit from decent and green jobs in ireland this will mean that those impacted by the closure of unsustainable carbon intensive electricity production for example must be offered re skilling opportunities to enable them to find suitable jobs in other areas such as the green economy or opportunities with sustainable incomes in other parts of society it is my strong belief that the trade union movement can create a creative and enduring future for us members now and in the future by being a key proponent of gough s new eco social political economy emphasising responsible economics understanding that the concept of growth ad infinitum is inherently flawed recovering a discourse that had fallen prey to an uncritical embrace of neoliberal mantras and advocating an economic model of pluralism which emphasises the finite nature of the earth s natural resources and the role that rich nations must play in ameliorating the crises in which we find ourselves as gough puts it himself consumption and consumption based emissions ignored by the green growth agenda must be given equal priority in the rich world issues of global equity almost entirely absent from international climate negotiations so far must be discussed and confronted affluence has a class as well as a national dimension the case that ian gough makes is impressive combining these concerns of domestic justice with both international and inter generational justice in a global equity framework is one worthy of consideration by all partners one worthy of support by trade unions such a framework which is founded on a needs based society could have a conjoined positive effect on the multiple crises in which the global community finds itself it also implies the end of a capitalism without responsibility as to consequences as we have come to know it moving beyond growth to a steady state sustainable economy this begs the question as to whether the transition route to sustainable wellbeing is achievable everything depends as scholars such as gough klien and others have identified on the nature variability flexibility and reformability of capitalism your trade union has correctly placed gender equality as one of its core objectives i believe that in order for unions to credibly fight for the promotion of gender equality in the workplace there must first be greater gender equality within union structures themselves i also see the inclusion of gender issues in collective bargaining as being fundamental given the ongoing gender pay gap related to this is a wider objective of protecting vulnerable marginalised workers many of whom are women many are migrants these groups need an ever stronger voice sylvia walby has argued in her book crisis that the economic and fiscal crises which we have lived through over the past decade and the resulting recession experienced severely in ireland has cascaded through society and the ensuing fiscal crisis over government budget deficits and austerity has led to a political crisis which in turn now threatens to become a democratic crisis borne unevenly the effects of the crisis are exacerbating existing class and gender inequalities there is considerable under utilised capacity in the economy as a consequence of the failure to encourage the completion of the transition in the gender regime from a domestic to a public form this incomplete transition is at least in part because of the priority accorded to developing a neoliberal rather than social democratic form walby argues that the future consequences of the crisis depend upon whether there is a deepening of democracy and of democratic institutions including within the eu within such considerations must be the issue of the relation of the economy to social policy and the role of the economy as instrument or determinant of public good globalisation is a topic to which i return frequently in my speeches as president a key conundrum that has not been solved by most governments globally relates to how we can make globalisation work for citizens when what has been its presentation to date lacks legitimacy among much of the citizenry in other words is an ethical sustainable form of globalisation possible naomi klein among others has shown how corporations have unethically exploited workers in the world s poorest countries often those with appalling human rights records in pursuit of greater profits as klein has written in her book no logo when manufacturing is so highly devalued it follows that the people doing the production work become highly devalued as well the shift in corporate priorities has left factory workers and craftspeople in a precarious position the lavish spending in the 1990s on marketing mergers and brand extensions has been matched by resistance to investing in production facilities and labour multinationals search the globe for factories that can make their products as cheaply as possible and by contracting out the manufacturing work multinationals can shed all responsibility for the working conditions inside these factories the contracting allows multinationals to re focus on the needs of their brands as opposed to the needs of their workers it follows that left unchecked such a form of globalisation will lead to a wider gap between rich and poor with the poor getting poorer globalisation clearly tests values that may have been multi laterally agreed to achieve an acceptance across borders as minimally ethical globalisation and its impact requires to be managed by accountable multilateral institutions so that it for example supports fundamental human rights and leads to long lasting development and prosperity for citizens in general particularly the poorest the trade union movement has played and must continue to play a leading role so that workers are not made the casualties of globalisation but rather that globalisation is made to work for the world s workers as to the task of redefining work we are also witnessing increases in precarious employment contract working and an ongoing casualisation of labour as has been so well documented by guy standing noam chomsky and others the new emerging trends in work practices so called innovations are only innovations to my mind insofar as they maximise profits for employers and reduce employees labour rights i see this trend as part of an inexorable race to the bottom and i believe that regulation is required in order to protect those most vulnerable in society from being exploited as a result of the most adverse effects of these new models of work for example dr p√°draig carmody has shown in recent research how ride sharing and virtual capital have resulted in a hollowing out of the formal sector and a rise in the so called precariat worker whereas many speak of the sharing economy a more accurate way to describe it might be the on demand economy where firms divest themselves of their responsibilities to employees reducing the structural power of labour this represents an undermining of any social contract between the parties with regard to how an abuse of digitalisation assists in this regard we see online workers often are not covered by employment law or collective agreements and seldom have access to social security paid leave or paid training owing to the fact that the platforms require workers to register as self employed these recent developments in the world of work are nothing less than a recrudescence of some of the worst practices of the 19th century the co ordination and direction of employees by an algorithm owned by a company should never be allowed to divest the employer of their responsibility any less than a bogus self employment does after all one of the great victories of the trade union movement was the regulation of piecework these old practices must not be allowed re emerge under the cloak of supposed innovation it must remain an important objective of the left and of unions to reverse the systematic neglect and devaluation of working class lives the ongoing displacement of secure certain regular employment for which trade unions were established by uncertain precarious jobs and characteristic chronic insecurity is a major cause for concern workers are too often expected to demonstrate what is called flexibility by which is meant a willingness and ability to readily respond to changing circumstances and expectations without adequate information or recompense this flexibility is often not matched however with any security of tenure or appropriate income by employers with the vista of zero hour contracts now appearing ever more prevalent an uncritical globalisation pursued without consideration as to impact or social consequences it can be shown has had a negative impact on climate change more goods being produced and consumed more transport of goods across longer distances shorter product obsolescence cycles and a more consumerist and materially driven society they all come at a significant price in terms of the impact on finite natural resources and greenhouse gas emissions i have not spoken of the so called softer impacts of globalisation such as cultural homogenisation as well as adverse effects on local communities and economies for this is perhaps one of the greatest problems with globalisation macroeconomist exponents can all too easily evaluate the economic benefits of globalisation narrowly on aggregateacross countries but fail to capture the harder to quantify negative intangibles to which i refer i was heartened to read in the recent world bank report efficiency that even that organisation hardly a bastion of left wing social democratic thinking now believes there is justification in going beyond efficiency and fostering more inclusive growth globally after decades of mainstream economic commentary espousing the virtues of privatisation deregulation and a smaller role for the state we now appear to be at a turning point in the economics discourse thanks to the insightful contributions of economists like mariana mazzucato and sylvia walby mazzucato in her books the entrepreneurial state and the value of everything effectively rebukes the austerity fuelled worldview that in order to restore growth after the 2008 financial crisis all that was needed was to reduce deficits by cutting public spending arguing instead that government investment in areas like education research and technology is a key component of economic growth even orthodox institutions such as the international monetary fund have slowly evolved their thinking on austerity as a strategic tool believing that it can be self defeating as keynes argued over 80 years ago if governments cut spending during a downturn a short lived recession can become a fully fledged depression this is precisely what occurred in ireland when the economic recession of 2008 turned into an economic depression in 2009 with an economic recovery delayed until 2014 this prolongation and intensification of the economic bust resulted in a deepening of the experience of as well as a widening of the exposure to a range of attendant social ills that were a direct result of a prolonged period of constrained under investment by the state many of which have not yet been resolved long before mazzucato the spiritual fathers of creative thinking in the public sector keynes and polyani called on policymakers not just to think about counter cyclical spending as a way to reduce the impacts of recessions and avoid over heating economies but also to think strategically to identify how investments can help shape citizens long term prospects for the better polyani went so far as to argue in the great transformation that free markets themselves are products of state intervention outcomes of public and private actions this astute observation has become conveniently forgotten in much of the austerity based neoliberal commentary around the recent economic crisis mitchell and fazi s reclaiming the state argues in the contemporary context of brexit britain and trump s america with national sovereignty high on the agenda that the state must be reclaimed if we are to transform societies for the people s benefit despite the ravages of neoliberalism the state still holds the capacity and much of the resources for democratic control of a nation s economy and finances the authors advocate a new paradigm of economic heterodoxy in which ideas are grounded in post keynesian institutional feminist social and importantly ecological economics this is an epistemological challenge to the neo classical economic orthodoxy that espouses with rigidity the assumptions of rationality and individualism as the equilibrium nexus as an alternative it offers economics dealing with the institutions history social structure nexus this is the form of political economy discourse that is most promising young and not so young academics are struggling for its right to be taught in universities and institutions reclaiming the state is a work that called for a drastic expansion in the state s role while the authors include a broad re nationalisation of specific sectors of the economy most notably the financial sector mitchell and fazi also call for a new and updated notion of planning one which places the commanding heights of economic policy under democratic control to enable the urgently needed socio ecological transformation of production and society the latter project however needs to be presented not simply as a resile to the previous models of renationalisation this would clearly be insufficient in the context of new challenges the role of the state needs to be defined anew as well as the concept of sovereignty in such a way that it is shared can flow for the benefit of workers beyond borders can because it is a transition taking place in several countries have a regional character one that is exemplary to global economic systems any narrowly defined concept of productivity capturing in a simplistic way merely the efficiency of production utilising the four factors of production while it may be important to understand in an increasingly competitive enterprise environment is an insufficient concept when examined from a labour productivity perspective it is problematic because growth in labour productivity often does not lead to commensurate improvements in the incomes of workers as evidence from studies conducted by tony atkinson and others suggests but is instead captured by the owners of capital itself often speculative rather than productive this is not only inequitable but it places a value on the role of capital that is far higher than other factors of production such as labour and entrepreneurship and is inherently volatile given its speculative nature such volatility has clear downstream impacts on labour markets in instances in which speculative capital does not perform in the markets as well as was envisaged resulting inevitably in the need to cut back on other factors of production with labour being the most easily adjusted assisted by increasingly flexible labour markets i wish to revisit briefly if i may the concept of work itself andrea komlosy in her recent contribution work the last 1 000 years argues that the often limited definition and classification of work has never corresponded to the historical experience of most people whether in colonies developing countries or the industrialised world the gap between common assumptions and reality grows even more pronounced in the case of women and other groups excluded from the labour market i am minded to re visit the related philosophical concept of the dignity of labour much advocated by ghandi in which all types of jobs are respected equally no occupation is considered superior and none of the jobs should be discriminated on any basis is this not the ethic of work in the public service for the public good i believe a corollary of this concept is that a return to the fundamentals of decent secure jobs would be a widespread increase in job satisfaction a better sense of accomplishment and improvements in quality of life across nations a vision in which these concepts become more embedded in the citizenry and in particular employers is perhaps provocative even radical as it attempts to upturn the commonly held assertion that money and wealth accumulation is the primary motivation behind humans desire to work there is in addition a significant growing and important body of economic research focusing on the marginal utility of income the incremental change in satisfaction that is due to a unit change in income which shows that satisfaction peaks at relatively modest income levels and that steep diminishing marginal returns are evident as people s preference for additional leisure time becomes higher than their preference for additional income robert and edward skidelsky s book how much is enough money and the good life is a spirited argument against blindly accepting the faustian bargain of insatiability within contemporary capitalism we need to focus much less on making money and much more on cultivating the things that matter leisure knowledge friendship it appears that the old adage money doesn t bring happiness is a truism that even economists can now demonstrate empirically however the young of the world with their proximity to each other to nature to the joy of shared culture are well ahead of them as are those who sing the anthems of their unions behind banners as they march creating a society that is more equal one in which all work is valued and all jobs are decent and fulfilling is not an easy task given the current milieu however the political economic concept of deliberative democracy provides us with a means with which we may engage and promote such a vision across the citizenries of europe j√ºrgen habermas has written persuasively on this topic asserting that political decisions should be the product of fair and reasonable discussion and debate among citizens it follows therefore that we must become more aware as citizens about the often obscured or consciously hidden ideological assumptions that lie behind policy choices this means that we need to foster universal political economic literacy to deal with new and existing challenges and a better understanding of the nature of value and what constitutes happiness as part of a coordinated discourse trade unions have a crucial role in ensuring that governments labour policies are ethically grounded but unions also have a role in realising this vision of a more ethically minded citizenry and a new eco social economic paradigm the components of which i have elucidated in this speech one of the ways in which to do this is to re establish or embed and enhance glaucon s social contract between the citizen and the state something which has been heavily eroded in much of europe following decades of attack from a prevailing neoliberal orthodoxy eroding labour rights through laissez faire policy and an almost fetishised embrace of unfettered globalisation trade unions have a vital role in turning around this tide by advocating a rights based approach to quality work and engaging in the deliberative democratic process what are the lessons we have learned from the economic crisis and the self regulating market i believe there are many in politics policymaking academia the commentariat citizens at large who have turned a corner having re evaluated often strongly held beliefs with an appreciation that the state has an important role that good regulation does matter be it in the financial construction or healthcare sectors all sectors in which we in ireland have seen the catastrophic and sometimes tragic effects of under regulation and or lack of enforcement my vision is of a europe with excellent public services at its core good jobs in the public sector mean quality services for citizens your members appreciate only too well that the services they deliver are not a cost to society but an investment in our communities this message must be taken to the heart of europe the centrality of individualism as a source of values with its emphasis on individual consumption insatiable acquisitiveness wealth accumulation and an ill informed hostility to the state its institutions also those who work in them has had a corrosive effect i hope that we are on a pathway of learning as peoples across europe that we must avoid the excessive materialism that was apparent for example in this country during the so called celtic tiger and that we move away from narcissistic individualism and towards collective solidarity neither should there be a notion of any trade union member being described as a former member joining belonging sharing the trade union values is a life choice anticipated by the young cherished to the end by those who are union people several global studies such as the world happiness report as well as qualitative research such as that by esping andersen clearly demonstrate that those countries that manage to foster this collective solidarity that abide by the principal of a strong social contract that believe in the benign and even transformative possibilities of the state and its institutions that provide universal social protection all report the highest quality of life and life satisfaction using both objective and subjective measurements mitchell and fazi identify as a prerequisite for the construction of a new international ist world order the realisation that based on interdependent but independent sovereign states the political right today is winning because it is capable of weaving powerful narratives of collective identityin which national sovereignty is defined in nativist nationalist or even racist terms progressives must thus be able to provide equally powerful narratives which recognise the human need for belonging and connectedness that belonging i believe must fly over borders unions must work not only at home but in the european union they are willing to build with others may i conclude by stating that i believe the related battle for decent work is a defining battle of our times i hope that your conference proves to be a fruitful and enjoyable experience and that you will all continue to play your part in defending the hard won rights of workers across europe as we continue to face the challenges and obstacles to a fairer society you have a powerful voice and one that i know can give leadership on the new form of economy and that you will use wisely as you demonstrate and realise the benefits of solidarity and seek to reclaim an understanding of work as the foundation for the achievement of other human rights and a strong foundation for a life of dignity fulfilment and flourishing go raibh mile maith agaibh go l√©ir

a n old saying if you owe the bank 100 it s your problem if you owe 100m it s the bank s the adage is silent on debts like america s to china of more than 1 1trn the iou looks like a source of leverage for china s leadership a reason for president donald trump to be cautious in waging trade war lest his counterpart xi jinping command the people s bank of china pboc to dump its treasury bonds and plunge america into a fiscal crisis an editorial on may 29th in the people s daily a communist party mouthpiece suggested that china might restrict exports to america of rare earths which are used in smartphones electric vehicles and much more seen against fresh threats the 20bn worth of long term bonds china sold in march might seem a shot across the bow yet china s bond pile is more blunderbuss than laser guided missile it is as likely to miss or blow up as to strike its target listen to this story enjoy more audio and podcasts on ios or android your browser does not support the element china s bond buying began innocently enough its leaders eager to follow the time tested path to export led development favoured an undervalued currency in the early 2000s as rapid growth in output and exports put upward pressure on the exchange rate the pboc sold yuan and bought dollars most of which it parked in american treasuries cheap funding looked like a boon to america at the time awash in red ink because of tax cuts and foreign wars but as so often with china something too small to notice quickly became too large to ignore china s official holdings of american government debt rose from just under 100bn in 2002 to a peak of nearly 1 3trn in 2013 it now manages the yuan against a basket of currencies rather than the dollar alone and no longer buys very many treasuries but the reserve hoard remains its value as an economic weapon is dubious however the point of a bond dump would be to saturate the market for treasuries america s hefty government debt needs continuous rolling over and its stonking deficits add to the pile at a pace of about 1trn per year investors for now keep buying but china by selling treasuries might ply the market with more bonds than it can easily digest to keep overfilled investors coming back america s government might need to offer higher interest rates a big enough jump in borrowing costs could force it to choose between growth crushing fiscal austerity and a fiscal crisis but treasuries are not a typical security in 2011 for example standard poor s a ratings agency cut america s sovereign credit rating citing its soaring debt and dysfunctional politics markets promptly gobbled up more treasuries than ever the yield on the ten year bond soon fell by more than a percentage point this anti gravity effect derives from america s hegemonic role in finance it issues the world s primary reserve currency and its most prized safe asset the always healthy appetite for american debt grows in times of economic uncertainty even when america itself is the cause of the trouble if chinese bond sales rattle global markets the flight to safety might well sop up the new treasury supply even if markets remained calm chinese sales might prove a mere annoyance an analysis published by the federal reserve in 2015 suggested that 1 5trn in bond purchases would be expected to reduce ten year treasury yields by between 40 and 50 basis points a comparable rise in yields induced by chinese bond sales would be uncomfortable but hardly a disaster especially since the fed could intervene if rising yields threatened america s economy the fed is currently shedding 15bn worth of treasury bonds each month as it unwinds the unconventional stimulus measures used after the financial crisis were china to start selling the fed could simply resume buying bond yields are only part of the picture china bought its treasuries to stop the yuan appreciating too quickly were it to sell them and convert the proceeds back into yuan its currency would rise hurting its already beleaguered exporters and delighting mr trump china could instead try to swap its treasuries for other foreign assets alas no other government bond market matches america s for size and safety german bunds are rock solid but in short supply thanks to german fiscal surpluses france italy and japan offer large markets but more risk all would fume if china turned its cash their way causing their currencies to appreciate hurting their exporters and perhaps inducing deflation which they already struggle against their governments might respond by raising tariffs on china a disastrous outcome for beijing buried treasuries china could use a bit of depreciation to offset american tariffs investors know this and may be selling yuan now to avoid future losses china s recent treasury sales probably represent an effort to keep the depreciation orderly using dollars to buy yuan from bearish investors rather than the start of a belligerent bond dump if the pace remains slow then china could offload more of its american bonds without angering other trading partners but also without causing america much discomfort if any moreover as market forces push the yuan down the value to china of dollar assets is obvious they provide china with a bit more macroeconomic autonomy in a global economy dominated by the dollar america s place at the centre of global finance is unassailable in the short term yet neither america nor china appears to understand just why its position is so commanding china might like to discomfit america by becoming a credible alternative hegemon if investors could flee american assets in response to bad behaviour america might behave better but challenging america would require open markets transparent financial institutions and the rule of law all of which is difficult for an authoritarian regime america seems just as clueless a protectionist bully is an unappealing steward of the world economy in abusing its privilege it undermines the shared trust that makes treasuries an asset without equal this trade war has been built on mistaking strengths for weaknesses and weaknesses for strengths

as trade tensions escalate china dumps u s bonds but diversification out of usts would take years euro zone bonds would benefit euro a long way from usurping dollar as key reserve currency by sujata rao and dhara ranasinghe london june 4 reuters should european countries want the euro to replace the dollar as the world s dominant reserve currency the sino u s trade war may offer a window of opportunity the souring of ties between the world s two largest economies will indicate the extent to which china can switch some of its giant reserve holdings to another hard currency and also point to the limitations the euro zone faces in providing a viable alternative in the post world war two era no asset has ever fully matched u s government bonds for size liquidity and credit quality it is

chinese reserve managers to shift hundreds of billions of dollars from treasuries to europe s single currency the euro bloc needs to address key shortcomings i find it hard to square the circle how such a huge treasury holding can be diversified away given the landscape we are in said salman ahmed chief investment strategist at lombard odier investment managers advertisement advertisement in the euro zone there is not a big risk free market twenty years down the line it may be different for ahmed the main issue is that credit risk in the bloc is not uniform the 19 members each run their own fiscal policies budget rules are too loosely policed to ensure adherence and euro exit remains a theoretical possibility so wealthier members such as germany remain net savers that run balanced budgets or even surpluses while others mostly in southern europe are dogged by high debt the resulting mix of credit and political risks make it harder to see the aggregate euro zone bond market as a true mirror of the u s treasury universe advertisement advertisement ross hutchison a fund manager at aberdeen standard investments says it boils down to the fact the united states has a federal nature that the euro area hasn t got yet additionally distortions stemming from years of bond buying stimulus by the european central bank mean available euro government bonds are far fewer than may appear while euro government debt outstanding is around 9 5 trillion the ecb is estimated to hold roughly a quarter and the kind of safe securities that reserve managers seek are even scarcer aaa

is america falling behind the technological and scientific frontier does public funding effectively drive scientific innovation and should the federal government ensure all americans capture the benefits of new technologies on this episode mit economics professor jonathan gruber discusses his new book jump starting america how breakthrough science can revive economic growth and the american dream jonathan gruber is the ford professor of economics at mit jonathan has long been involved in crafting public health policy and is considered a key architect of both romneycare and obamacare what follows is a lightly edited transcript of our conversation you can download the episode by clicking the link above and don t forget to subscribe to my podcast on itunes or stitcher tell your friends leave a review now the premise of the book as illustrated in the title is to jump start america which suggests that right now the scientific economic engine is certainly not operating as it should would it be wrong to say that that america is still at the technological and scientific frontier compared to other advanced economies or is someone ahead of us you know i don t think there s any one answer to that i think that america overall is still the most scientifically advanced nation in the world but in some areas we re falling behind and in others we ve fallen behind what s quite striking and we have some examples in the book are areas which are american born american perfected but that america has backed off of and other countries are taking the lead most strikingly in medical research and biotechnology research leading experts predict that within 10 years we will fall behind china in what has been a us dominated area i guess the subtext to my question was is it china because there seems to be this panic among policymakers that china is taking the lead often they mention artificial intelligence and you mentioned biotech just how overblown or accurate are those fears you mentioned biotech and there may be something to that but more broadly do you think we still have a lead over china or are they catching up rapidly in a number of areas i think we need to avoid china bashing for the purpose of china bashing i think what we focus on in china is the fact that they have learned a key lesson from our history that in area after area when it comes to fundamental scientific advancement the private sector will not do the research involved or the basic science involved the public sector has to lead and where china is running ahead of us is in public sector investment in science in the mid 1960s the us spent 2 of our entire gdp one of every fifty dollars for government financing of research that government financing gave birth to both the greatest middle class the world has ever seen and products ranging from satellites to pharmaceuticals to the dustbuster today that number has fallen 0 7 of gdp china is ramping up towards 2 5 of gdp now you asked the question have they passed us yet when will they pass us i would say that simon and i are not technology futurists but we re technology optimists and we believe that there s a huge possible technology frontier out there and that the company that finds that frontier is going to be the one that really puts the resources in to find it i mean is it possible to spend a lot of money on scientific research train a lot of scientists have a lot of smart people in your country and even have some big goals and yet not be a science and technology powerhouse i think of the soviet union which spent money on innovation research had all kinds of scientists in some areas maybe the world s best scientists and yet aside from brief periods overall they were nowhere close to as innovative and scientifically advanced as the united states you know it s a great question and i think that if you look at history certainly a motivation for a major investment our side was in the area where they got ahead of us which was sputnik now the missile gap that people worried about turned out to be illusory and they didn t have as big a lead as they thought but we certainly didn t have as big a lead as we thought basically it motivated what we did or if you look at world war ii i think one of the most compelling examples for those who aren t history buffs among your listeners is to recognize that when hitler blitzed through europe in the spring of 1940 it was with technologies we didn t know he had that we didn t know existed america was backwards at that point we were dominated by europe in terms of scientific expertise and only when motivated by the war did we develop the technologies that won the war likewise motivated by sputnik we invented the technologies that gave birth to the modern american economy in many ways such as digital computing and pharmaceuticals so i think you re absolutely right we can t over react to what we see in other countries that s why i wouldn t be so worried i d be somewhat worried if it was just us versus china but it s not just china the us used to be far and away the world leader in terms of government investment in basic science and r d we re now barely in the top 10 in terms of share of gdp and this is in a world where discoveries are getting hard if anything we should have ever increasing investments in r d not ever declining now i want to make clear that i generally agree with the premise of the book and that i would probably like to see more funding for basic research so i m just trying to question my own beliefs here i guess i see it as one thing if you have a specific sort of goal in mind and then government can direct funds and scientists toward that goal for example getting to the moon the atomic bomb some particular military technology is government as effective in areas where perhaps the goals aren t quite so clear or is it then imperative that if we re going to do this we pick some goals very carefully or are we going to start funding lots of sciences and just see what happens i think there s two answers to your question depending on whether you re talking about politics or substance in terms of politics goals do matter we talked to a lot of people in washington who said yes science is cool but we don t really have the money right now and we re not sure where to put the money in i think goals do matter and that s where understanding what china is up to matters we ll talk later about how the division of funding geographically across america matters too in terms of actual investment i don t think goals matter so much i mean if you look at some of the most important investments we ve made in technology in pharmaceuticals and health they weren t about some big national priority at the right time people just made smart decisions one of my favorite examples in the book is about what happened in the mid 1980s when a nobel prize winning biologist who d won the nobel prize for understanding how to map the human gene and had a successful startup under his belt called biogen wanted to create a company with the seemingly very long run task of mapping the human genome no private funder would give him any money they said look it s going to take too long and what s in it for us once you map it it s public we don t get any money out of it fortunately the federal government put 3 billion into the human genome project once again a project with a goal but not some national priority it just caught the fancy of some people in congress we put in 3 billion over 13 years to map the human genome today the genomics industry which is currently dominated by the us is responsible for 280 000 jobs in the us with an average pay of 70 000 a year and in one year alone genomics based companies pay 6 billion in taxes to the federal and state governments that is twice our 13 year investment there s something which didn t come from some big overriding national priority it just came from good instincts some leadership and finding where the private sector is not getting the job done to take a step back could you briefly talk about how the us originally decided to become an economic power that was based on science and why we stopped doing that yeah i mean the history is fascinating i m not really that knowledgeable about it so this is where i probably learned the most in doing the book the history as i said really begins with vannevar bush in world war ii when hitler blitzed across europe meanwhile in 1939 the us produced six tanks we had torpedoes that didn t explode when they hit the ships soldiers practiced with broomsticks instead of guns and vannevar bush knocked on fdr s door he was a prominent scientist former dean at mit and he said i think we can win the war if you give me unlimited money to hire as many scientists as i want to invent the technology we need to win the war and fdr amazingly said yes and at one point vannevar bush s organization employed two thirds of all the physicists in the us and did in fact invent the technology that was crucial to us winning the war for example radar which was originally invented in the uk but was perfected here in the us and turned the tide of the battle of the atlantic but more importantly it set up not only wartime applications but peacetime applications remember what was the first microwave called the radar range so much of our private sector innovation came out of these public sector investments and then after world war ii vannevar bush really had his greatest insight which was look we won the war with science let s win the peace with science and he wrote a famous report called science the endless frontier which proposed that the federal government continue massive science funding now interestingly coming to the politics point from a few minutes ago that report kind of languished for a while until sputnik and then the man on the moon which got people excited that led to the ramp up and the ramp up as i said was that by the mid 1960s we spent about 2 of gdp on public r d but then three things happened first the scientist got a little ahead of themselves we started doing things like promising free power for all or nuclear powered pens and not worrying enough about the dangers of radiation or as rachel carson points out in silent spring the dangers of ddt second the politicians and the scientists stopped seeing eye to eye it was easy to see eye to eye when there was a clear enemy when there wasn t the politicians then wanted to do some silly things like supersonic jet aircraft the scientists told them no that s not a good idea and the politicians got mad and as we say in the book if you speak truth to power power will cut your funding then the third thing that happened was that budgets got tight first the vietnam war then the growth of great society programs then the reagan anti tax revolution and most recently the debt ceiling fights so the ramp up of science funding is bipartisan and the ramp down of science funding is bipartisan and it continues to fall to this day now it s about 0 7 of gdp and falling what does 0 7 work out to how much are we spending on the federal level in today s dollars we are spending about 250 billion less than we spent at our peak so gdp is you know about 20 trillion so instead at our peak we were spending 400 billion a year now we re spending something like 150 billion so we re spending 150 billion you would want us to get back to the share of gdp level that we saw in the 1960s no you know i don t know what the right answer is we proposed a very bold initiative of about another 100 billion about another 5 of gdp which is back to where we were in the early 1980s so importantly it would take us back toward the top of the world is in terms of public funding of r d we re not proposing going all the way back i m not saying it s a bad idea but we don t want to be that bold others may want to go further but that s the number we re putting out there you mentioned that when there was a sense of crisis you mentioned the space race we invested in science because we didn t want to lose i think it was lbj maybe it s apocryphal but he said he did not want americans to go to sleep under the light of a communist moon so that was important we needed to get to the moon some people today have suggested maybe climate change is that crisis that will get people interested in spending a lot more but of course you have a good chunk of the country that questions whether the climate crisis is a crisis so do we need that do we need some sort of catalyst maybe a fear of chinese advancements i don t think we need as much of a catalyst because i think we also need to correct one crucial mistake that was made in the initial ramp up of science which was not explained to the american public science policy is economic policy investments in science create jobs and growth and i think we need to recognize that science investments are not just about competing with china and inventing cool stuff but actually about renewing american growth back toward the levels we saw when we were pushing the technological frontier in a way we re not doing today look we re not going to land a man on the moon we re not going to have that challenge i think china can be some of that challenge but i think the real way to move this forward is to recognize that we are growing slowly and there s a demand as is emphasized in the book in lots of parts of the country for good jobs and science policy is the way forward on that that s right so when i think of some of the obstacles one obstacle i think of is that while we need to do this to boost economic growth and productivity there seems to be a lot more skepticism about the fact that even if science leads to more innovation which leads to more productivity which leads to more economic growth whether or not the rest of the country really benefit from that growth so why bother doing that if most people don t benefit that s a criticism you must come across that is the motivation for the book i mean the book motivation was twofold one was to get growth going but the other was to do it in a way that shares the prosperity so the first third is history the second third is economics and the third part is our proposal and our proposal really has three parts the first is more money we discussed why that makes sense the second is spreading that money around the country and recognizing the opportunities elsewhere in america besides the six coastal cities that have dominated economic growth in the last 30 years we can spread that to other places places that have great opportunities so what we do in the book is we just go to the data we say look how many places in america are big they have least a hundred thousand people who are working age are well educated they have at least 25 with a college education and are affordable they have a house price of less than 265 000 on average which up here in boston sounds like monthly rent we found 102 places in 36 states with 80 million people in them that fit those criteria from rochester new york which has great promise for growth around the optics and photonics industry to ames iowa which is doing incredible things with innovative agricultural technology to huntsville alabama where they still have the legacy of the missile program all around the country we have places that have great opportunities but are not growing rapidly because all the oxygen is sucked out of the room by new york dc la san francisco seattle and boston so we have to share geographically that s the first way i can answer your question but there s another way too which is the third part of our proposal one fundamental flaw of science policy in the post war decades was that it was very elitist and focused on the coasts you know all the guys who did it were mit and harvard and berkeley guys and it was all about being on the coast we want to fix that the second problem was there wasn t a recognition that the public sector needs to capture and redistribute the benefits of this growth so here s a simple example every single new pharmaceutical entrant from 2010 to 2016 was based on nih funded research yet much of the returns don t go to the us taxpayer instead they go to corporations that increasingly don t pay tax they go to very highly compensated executives so the other sense in which we need to share the prosperity is how do we make sure the benefits of this new technology get delivered that s why we suggest what we call an innovation dividend here s how that would work the government would capture some of the returns to this new technology invest it in a fund and then redistribute that to every american as a flat dividend just like alaska does with their oil revenues the alaska permanent fund pays out a 1 000 to 2 000 dividend every year it lifts 17 to 20 thousand alaskans out of poverty and it is widely popular in a very conservative state so let s capture some of this upside and let s return that in a way to make sure that americans see the benefits of this now i m going to say again that i like the idea of increasing this investment i mean i really like it i might even go further than you and maybe raise taxes to pay for it i wouldn t have a problem with that but i do have two problems with the other part of the plan the first part is the geographical distribution here s a quote from enrico moretti an economist who has written a lot about innovation hubs and so forth if you look at the history of america s great innovation hubs they haven t found one that was directly explicitly engineered by an explicit policy on the part of the government it s really hard this is not how innovation hubs and clusters get developed they often get developed because of idiosyncratic factors like a local firm succeeds and it starts attracting more firms like that and this creates a cluster that then becomes stronger and stronger and that feeds on itself so is there an example that you know of at least in this country where government has been able to create a hub of innovation and science where none existed before well i think it comes down to the definition of government created is there a planned city where the government has said we re going to plop in the middle of nowhere this city and create a technology hub no that has absolutely not worked that does work in china okay but we don t have a good record of that that said we have an incredible record of government investments in science leading to the growth of cities so i ll give you two examples one is my backyard kendall square okay kendall square which is the dozens of acres around mit not a huge area was a total dump when i was an undergraduate my co author simon jonson s quote is you used to have to leave kendall square in order to get mugged it was a dump no one was there today it is the most expensive real estate in america tied with midtown manhattan why because federal nih funding led by the biotech boom was centered in kendall square around mit now did the federal government pick boston no that s absolutely right but the federal government led it let me give then another example which is my favorite example in the book which city in america is the home of the us computer microsimulation industry and the largest university by enrollment in the country i d ask how many of your listeners guessed orlando florida i ve asked 700 people this question and only five have gotten it right the story is fascinating so what happened was in 1956 the editor of the orlando sentinel endorsed a little known politician for president named lyndon b johnson he continued to endorse him in 60 64 in 1964 johnson calls him up and says what would you like and he says well orlando would like a navy base being lyndon johnson he did not let the fact that orlando s landlocked stop him from granting that wish he gave them a landlocked navy base what do you do at a landlocked navy base you train people including a small battle simulation training unit so in 1978 the president of a medium sized university the university of central florida decided to buy a bunch of land below the university he asked the navy if they would move their now computer simulation unit off the navy base to be below the university and to set up a research park around it today the central florida research park based on the government funding still an ongoing 1 4 billion of government funding a year is the third largest research park in america with 10 000 employees and that area of east orange county which is 45 minutes east of disney has added a hundred thousand jobs in 30 years based on government investment working with the private sector so the answer is no we cannot do soviet style the government knows best and pick some corn field the middle of nowhere and build a city but we can partner with the private sector to make this work so the difference is enrico is right that we haven t said the government said this city s going to win but where i would differ from enrico is that the government has partnered with the private sector to make many of the cities and technological hubs of america today work i think we can do that again if and this is the big if we can set up a proper apolitical mechanism for doing so well some people say that would be the big if that the 102 potential tech hubs that you determined might get funded on a reasonable basis if we had maybe some sort of tech hub equivalent of an infrastructure bank of experts but once it gets through the political meat grinder it s going to end up being cities with a lot of political pull who have representatives that are chairmen of committees influential governors or mayors and the whole thing s going to end up being a political mess look i mean one nice thing about writing a book as opposed to legislation jim is that we are optimistic we are fundamentally optimistic it s an optimistic book but we are also realists we re realistic and acknowledge this will not work if that happens if that happens it s a bad idea but that doesn t have to happen and we can look to an example from one of the hardest decisions the us government has ever had to make which is closing military bases okay that s a really hard thing to do local people could go nuts so what did the us do we set up an apolitical body called the base realignment and closing commission remember from house of cards season 1 that s what the guy was testifying in front of it did the hard work of creating a list of bases to close that congress had to vote on it on an up or down basis congress couldn t cherry pick and it closed 300 military bases over several rounds opening new technology hubs is a cakewalk compared to closing a military base so we ve done this before but once again that s not saying it s a guarantee we re just saying there is a roadmap to do it it will not work unless we can depoliticize it unless we can make sure that there s a competition so what we do is we suggest a competition we say let s learn from amazon amazon is a real motivating example for our book they had a competition for hq2 but it was a destructive competition where cities bid by giving bigger and bigger tax breaks to try to be the place they d go let s instead use a constructive competition where cities bid by showing they have the potential to be a new technology hub that they have the educational resources in place that they have a plan for infrastructure that they have a plan to grow sustainably so they don t become the new seattle where everything s unaffordable let s have a competition like that but i agree with you it s not going to work unless we can figure out a way to make an apolitical mechanism to run it a couple of weeks ago we had biotech entrepreneur safi bahcall on the podcast he also has a book out and he s made a similar argument to yours about the need to expand federal funding for science research but he was very much opposed the idea of some sort of dividend arguing that the point of this research system has been to seamlessly transfer knowledge to the private industry which then turns that knowledge into useful products and economic growth those products and their benefits and the economic growth from them that s the dividend that s the benefit if it results in a cancer cure that s the benefit not something else do you worry that you might be muddling the idea of what the point of this system is for by saying that the actual products and the growth generated by them that s not enough that we have to have this other sort of benefit to sell it politically well you know it s really interesting i mean first of all let me be very clear jim we are not claiming that we have the only correct answer unlike many book authors we are hoping to raise as many questions as we answer in this book so i think you re asking a great question here is why we think it s a good idea because we think that what your guest said is well and good and you know we ve had other business leaders say that they say don t worry we ll just pay our taxes but they don t and growth sure we ll get more growth out of this and that is a huge dividend i think the innovation dividend we talk about is the minor part of the dividend but we think right now we don t want to put a lot of resources into something which just creates rich entrepreneurs who don t pay their taxes if i was setting up an ideal economic system i would do this redistribution through a properly designed tax system but we don t have that so what we re saying is you can think of it as insurance this would not be the major source of return but just a backstop insurance to make sure that the public sees the benefits and the benefits don t just go into the pockets of ultra rich entrepreneurs who pay no taxes and to the extent that we want to provide direction for this research do we want basic research in areas that hold sort of the greatest technological promise or in areas with the greatest long run economic benefits that are likely to remain in the us because you re talking sort of about the political aspect so is the objective to have science that may produce something fantastic that benefits everyone or science where the economic impact will really help the us and where the benefits like the jobs will all be more in the united states than elsewhere you know i m going to answer your question with a yes i think we want both and i think what is critical is a portfolio approach to this problem that s why we think it s critical to not you know we ve had some people say well that s a good idea so why don t you just set up one or two of these technology hubs well the problem is if you set up one or two then you do have to pick we don t want to pick we want to cast a wide net and look like i said we are not futurists we don t know what the most successful technology is going to be but we re optimists there are tons of great ideas out there we go through a great example you know synthetic biology which conveniently was on the cover of the economist the week our book came out as a growth area that s something where once again it was invented in the us perfected in the us and now the research lead is going on in china because the government s backed off of funding it basically we need to think about areas which are great scientific advances but also i think we need to think about science policy as economic policy and we need to think about making sure that we re going to do things that create jobs that may lead us to want to make sure it s not all just investments in ai and machine learning but also in and other things i think the interesting open question which could be a real key if this goes forward to be the center of the debate is how much of it is green energy i mean in some sense that s the classic case of market failure where the private sector is not investing enough in clean energy given the problems we face how much of its clean energy this can create a lot of jobs but there might not be the demand for clean energy right now so does that make sense without a carbon tax you know does it make sense to invest a lot of money in clean energy when coal s still cheap this is the kind of difficult question where if we can just have this conversation that would be a great start do you think both parties have elements that provide objections to this because i can see on the left there s a lot of concern about nuclear power on the right there s certainly a concern about using green energy as the focal point at all in this research there s also just generally skepticism about science funding we saw that in the obama administration where there was concern that some of this money was going toward existing companies and wasn t used for sort of pure basic research so i can see where there are stumbling blocks on both sides do you see those and do you see those as significant i think that s a pessimistic way to put it i think there s support on both sides and i think that everybody is excited about science you know maybe not as much out front in the republican party right now but behind closed doors there s a lot of excitement on both sides about science i think the big issue that we hear is yeah sure we like science but where s the money going to come from and that s why we think that politically there s benefit to this sort of spreading around the country i think economically you can make strong arguments on one side or another we ve also heard people say look our elitist friends say all the smart guys are in cambridge why would you want to spend the money elsewhere i think that s rather elitist but i understand you can make arguments on that front but politically if we spread the money around that will help get people interested to make people realize that science can be a national priority we think we can build this from the ground up we ve talked to a lot of local politicians from cities on our list who are saying yeah this is exactly what we re looking for we need to have the opportunity to compete with new york and boston in terms of actually getting these kinds of federal resources so i think that if you think about the political support i think what really makes it work is a combination of an excitement about science on both sides of the aisle combined with an interest by local leaders in using it as development policy we ve had a lot of guests on who talk about innovation and productivity autonomous cars the question of whether productivity will stop growing we ve had robert gordon all kinds of folks the question i ve started to ask is this what is your positive story to tell people who may be anxious about the future people who when they hear about more science research think it just sounds like we are going to create a lot more things and a lot more devices to replace people so what is your story of here s how this works out we have a country that s growing faster with a better distribution of opportunity that takes us toward a future we can look forward to what is your good news happy ending story well i think i already gave you my good ending story unfortunately i blew my shot with the human genome project where a 3 billion investment over 13 years created 280 000 jobs with an average wage of 70 000 a year those are good jobs that americans are holding because we went first if you go first you get the jobs not all of them but going first helps so i think that s a great example of something that s not robots not ai the other point to make is that look the robots are coming whether we like it or not the question is who makes them so if we re going to deal with a future of robots let s think about being the guys who have the jobs making the robots not the guys who just got their jobs replaced by the robots and i think that s another motivator for why we need to do this activity now

it s hard to believe that transnational corporations who sought and gained access to low cost non union chinese labor and more than one billion chinese consumers in the 1990s and 2000s could not have foreseen the day that china itself would compete in advanced technology products and markets it turns out that globalization like trade itself never was free and would always produce discontents not just among the workers and communities discarded by those globally outsourcing corporations but recently among national security cold warriors looking for ways to contain new enemies above all china one u s trade policy expression of this discontent are tariffs on steel and aluminum imports not just those from china but also the european union japan mexico canada and other members of the world trade organization the trump administration justified those tariffs and threatened others on automobile imports from europe mexico canada and japan under section 232 of the trade expansion act of 1962 as required for core industries critical to u s national security a department of commerce report argued the united states defense industrial base depends on the american owned auto sector for the development of technologies that are essential to maintaining our military superiority inside u s trade iust subscription required former steel industry lawyer and current u s trade representative robert lighthizer has been unsatisfied by negotiations at the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd to reduce china s state subsidized steel production capacity china the world s largest producer consumer and exporter of steel is not a member of the oecd section 232 justified tariffs are one expression of that dissatisfaction the trump administration s erratic responses of discontent extend to north america too just 13 days after withdrawing section 232 tariffs on mexico and canada to expedite their legislatures ratification of the revised north american free trade agreement president trump announced on may 30 that a five percent tariff would be imposed on imports from mexico beginning on june 10 the announcement was harshly criticized by both business groups and republican members of congress who support ratification of the new nafta the tariff would increase five percent a month to a maximum 25 percent if the trump administration determined that the mexican government had not acted adequately to prevent undocumented migrants and narcotics from crossing the border into the united states the administration has also taken aim at other ways china supports its businesses and industrial strategy in may the u s japan and the european union proposed world trade organization rules to limit subsidies for products from all state owned enterprises china has insisted that any new rules on industrial subsidies and state owned enterprises be linked to reforms of agricultural subsidies the u s and eu both heavy agricultural subsidizers have rejected such a linkage iatp has for decades criticized the lack of wto agricultural subsidy reform to prevent and discipline agricultural export dumping on may 13 china released a proposal on wto reform which included the linkage framework plus dispute resolution reforms and stated it would host a meeting in november to discuss reform proposals the announcement in may of national security justified u s export bans on semi conductors and other components to the chinese computer technology giant huawei represents a further escalation of the trade related cold war some trade policy analysts believe that the trump administration s prohibition on u s firms to do business with huawei and persuasion of other countries to follow its lead could result in long lasting section 301 tariffs a multi purpose u s trade agreement enforcement tool as well as the section 232 tariffs iust this use of the national security claim to erect trade barriers has been strongly contested at the wto despite u s warnings that the wto s legitimacy and viability would be jeopardized if it allowed members to dispute the section 232 tariffs a wto panel ruled in april that the current disputes could proceed a former head of the wto s appellate body said that he thought the section 232 tariffs would be very difficult to defend in terms of organizational rules iust the trump administration almost certainly will not comply with any adverse wto rulings the price of the trade related national security measures as well as of the section 301 justified tariffs is high and likely to grow the longer that there is no u s china agreement according to the federal reserve bank of new york the trump administration s 25 percent tariff on 200 billion of chinese exports to the united states will cost u s households about 106 billion a year if maintained this figure excludes the impacts of five percent or greater tariffs on imports from mexico according to the may 2018 list of u s demands china s government is to work with china importers to engage in trade transactions that would reduce the trade deficit by at least 200 billion by 2020 fulfillment of this demand seems very unlikely following the u s embargo on business with huawei and its pressure on other countries to blacklist huawei and other chinese technology companies following the second round of chinese tariff retaliation the u s department of agriculture announced a yet to be finalized 16 billion program of commodity credit corporation ccc retaliation compensation the largest share of these program payments like the first round of 12 billion of compensation in late 2018 probably will go to the largest 10 percent of farm corporations and farm partnerships the 28 billion in total ccc funds for trade policy triggered compensation responds to tariff retaliation mainly from china but also from the european union mexico canada and india the ccc a u s government owned enterprise has borrowing authority of 30 billion for all its chartered purposes to stabilize support and protect farm income and prices as a result the ccc will have only 2 billion more to distribute until it is replenished if the u s china negotiations deadlock congress would have to increase that borrowing authority for more trade related payments in 2020 president trump continues to appeal to the patriotism of farmers to suffer economic harm for the sake of putative long term gains for the whole u s economy but as one analysis noted from the perspective of china s government the ultimate goal of retaliatory tariffs is to inflict economic loss on politically influential interest groups in the united states turning them into lobbyists for easing trade restrictions for the largest agriculture operations shielded considerably by the ccc payments continued patriotic sacrifice may well be possible through 2020 but the 90 percent of farm operations that are not or less ccc payment protected may have no option but to become such lobbyists or to file for bankruptcy let s compare the value of the ccc program in the transactional terms that have characterized trump administration diplomacy china suggested that it might purchase 30 billion of u s agricultural products over a yet to be determined period of a u s china memorandum of understanding that ambassador lighthizer claims to be exempt from congressional review iust in 2017 china imported about 24 2 billion of u s agricultural goods that figure declined to 16 7 billion in 2018 and the usda s economic research services ers forecasts a drop to 9 4 billion in 2019 usda is currently restructuring downsizing and planning to relocate the parts of ers that are unpopular with the white house relative to the 2017 2019 reduction of 14 8 billion in agricultural exports to china plus the 28 billion cost of trade related taxpayer compensation by the end of 2019 from a trade transactional viewpoint china s proposed 30 billion of purchases of u s agricultural products over a time yet to be defined does not appear to be a good deal remarkably according to a federal reserve bank of minneapolis survey low and declining farmgate prices paid by u s agricultural processors and exporters are the top 2019 concern of 75 7 percent of those agricultural lenders surveyed tariff and trade related issues were the top concern of just 10 percent or perhaps not so remarkably as harwood schaefer and daryll ray recently wrote over the last 150 years there have been only three times totaling maybe 15 or so years that exports have resulted in profitable prices for major crops in general wwi wwii and the mid 1970s rather than betting the farm on export markets vulnerable to policy and financial market shocks they propose u s agricultural policy measures to strengthen farmgate prices by correlating supply to demand such measures might be decried as socialism during the current u s electoral season but if there are no agreements bilateral as the u s prefers or multilateral as china has proposed for wto reform iust absent u s policy reform u s farmers can only hope that climate related events will drive down supply and drive up prices in the u s futures markets as has happened for corn in the second quarter of 2019 some business groups advocate a trade in goods and tariff relief only agreement with china that would not address cross sectoral issues e g cyber security to reduce tariff triggered economic pain and the likelihood that the current cold war becomes a hot one however christopher painter a former state department cyber security official was cited in iust asking if you re not addressing the huge long term issues like this which go to the heart of our economic future why do this deal if you do however negotiate such long term issues can you do so effectively with tariffs and threats of higher tariffs as your chief technique of persuasion if the u s congress upon which the trump administration depends for ccc reauthorization cannot find a way to reduce the geopolitical damage of the administration s trade policy the next administration may inherit a new cold trade war with unreliable allies such as russia brazil hungary and saudi arabia at that point tariffs levied unilaterally by the u s without wto trade dispute resolution authority will be an antiquated policy weapon like a cavalry horse in a bot war

seasonal fluctuations in demand for our services and our revenue remains relatively stable throughout each quarter however as our customers are predominately businesses and use our services mostly on business days our quarterly revenue is affected by the number of business days in a quarter with the exception of our services that represent stand ready performance obligations such as subscriptions to access our cv database which are satisfied over the period of subscription including weekends and holidays public holidays in russia predominantly fall during the first quarter of each year which results in lower business activity in the quarter accordingly our first quarter revenue is typically slightly lower than in the other quarters for example our first quarter revenue in our russia segment in 2017 and 2018 was 21 1 and 20 9 respectively of total russia segment revenue for the year the number of business days in a quarter may also be affected by calendar layout in a specific year also the government of russia decides on an annual basis how public holidays that occur on weekends will be reallocated to business days throughout the year as a requirement of the labor code of russia as a result the number of business days in a quarter may be different in each year while the total number of business days in the year would remain the same this affects our revenue in a particular quarter and year on year revenue growth rate for that quarter if the allocation of business days in the comparable period was different in addition when a calendar layout in a specific year provides for several consecutive holidays or small number of business days between holidays or holidays adjacent to weekends hr managers of our customers may take short vacations further contributing to the decrease in business activities in these periods the following table illustrates the number of business days by quarter for the years 2017 to 2019 in 2019 the total number of working days is the same as in 2018 but there is 1 business day more 2 business days less and 1 business day more in the first quarter second quarter and third quarter respectively and the same number of business days in the fourth quarter number of business days as of total business days per year 2019 2018 2017 2019 2018 2017 first quarter 57 56 57 23 1 22 7 23 1 second quarter 59 61 61 23 9 24 7 24 7 third quarter 66 65 65 26 7 26 3 26 3 fourth quarter 65 65 64 26 3 26 3 25 9 100 0 100 0 100 0 total year 247 247 247 therefore in the first quarter of 2019 we saw a positive impact from the additional business days in the quarter as compared to the first quarter of 2018 however an opposite effect is expected in the second quarter of 2019 as compared to the second quarter of 2018 operating costs and expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization most of our expenses are not linked directly to our revenue our operating costs and expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization consist primarily of personnel and marketing expenses personnel and marketing expenses cumulatively accounted for 77 4 and 78 9 of our total operating costs and expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization for the years ended december 31 2018 and december 31 2017 respectively marketing expenses are more volatile in terms of allocation to quarters which is affected by the decisions we make about how we realize our strategy in a particular year which can differ from year to year therefore total marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue for a particular quarter may not be fully representative of the whole year personnel expenses are relatively stable over the year however they are also affected by other dynamics such as our hiring decisions costs and expenses such as share based compensations or foreign exchange gains or losses can be significantly concentrated in a particular quarter the first quarter segment external expenses in our russia segment in 2017 and 2018 were 23 0 and 25 5 respectively of the total russia segment external expenses for the year net income and adjusted ebitda even though our revenue remains relatively stable throughout each quarter the seasonal revenue fluctuations described above affect our net income as a result of revenue seasonality our profitability in the first quarter is usually lower than in other quarters and for the full year because our expenses as percentage of revenue are usually higher in first quarter due to lower revenue for example our adjusted ebitda margin was 36 4 for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 46 7 for the full year 2018 our profitability is also affected by our decisions on timing of expenses as described above contract liabilities our contract liabilities are affected by the annual subscriptions renewal cycle in our key accounts customer segment a substantial number of our key accounts renew their subscriptions in the first quarter and prepay in the fourth quarter of a previous year as per our normal payment terms as a result we receive substantial prepayments from our customers in the fourth quarter and our contract liabilities usually increase substantially higher during the fourth quarter for example our contract liabilities as of march 31 june 30 september 30 and december 31 2018 were p1 607 million p1 548 million p1 553 million and p2 073 million respectively net cash generated from operating activities our net cash generated from operating activities is affected by seasonal fluctuations of business activity as explained in revenue and by substantial prepayments from our customers see contract liabilities as well as by our decisions in regard to timing of expenses see operating expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization and to a lesser extent by payment terms provided to us by our largest suppliers such as tv advertising agencies and others net working capital our net working capital is primarily affected by changes in our contract liabilities as discussed above as our contract liabilities are usually higher in the fourth quarter our net working capital is usually the lowest in the fourth quarter for example our net working capital of march 31 june 30 september 30 and december 31 2018 was p 2 044 million p 2 048 million p 2 036 million and p 2 623 million respectively first quarter 2019 results our revenue was p1 678 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 compared to p1 274 million for the three months ended march 31 2018 revenue for the three months ended march 31 2019 increased by p405 million or 31 8 compared to the three months ended march 31 2018 primarily due to the increase in revenue in our russia segment revenue in our russia segment was p1 556 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 compared to p1 189 million for the three months ended march 31 2018 revenue in our russia segment increased by p367 million or 30 8 this was primarily due to the growth in the number of paying small and medium accounts by 73 8 in the other regions of russia and by 15 9 in moscow and st petersburg and the increase in arpc in key accounts in moscow and st petersburg by 17 2 driven by price

medium accounts continues to grow in key accounts in moscow and st petersburg we increased arpc by 17 2 in the first quarter of 2019 driven by the increase in prices e g 10 on average for subscriptions and 18 for a single standard type job posting the increase in usage of job postings by this category of customers and reducing discounts arpc in other customer segments was affected by price increases discussed above and the increased usage of services per customer offset by the accelerated intake of new customers who as evidenced by historical statistics initially have a lower arpc for example in other regions of russia in key accounts and small and medium accounts arpc remained flat however the arpc of customers acquired before january 1 2018 in these customer segments has increased by 12 and 18 respectively operating costs and expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization operating costs and expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization were p934 million

compared to the three months ended march 31 2018 the main factors that contributed to the increase in personnel expenses are i hiring 107 people during the second third and fourth quarters of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019 primarily in our development sales and production teams in our russia segment and ii the indexation of wages in the first quarter of 2019 these changes were partially offset by the decrease of employee expenses under our management incentive agreement marketing expenses marketing expenses decreased by p28 million or 9 9 for the three months ended march 31 2019 compared to the three months ended march 31 2018 the decrease in marketing expenses was primarily due to the decrease in tv marketing expenses as the result of a lower share of the total annual marketing budget allocated to the first quarter this year other general and administrative expenses our office rent and maintenance expenses decreased by 17 5 to p44 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 compared to the three months ended march 31 2018 at january 1 2019 we initially adopted ifrs 16 the new accounting standard that introduced a single on balance sheet accounting model for lessees as a result we as a lessee have recognized right of use assets representing our rights to use the underlying assets and lease liabilities representing our obligation to make lease payments we have applied ifrs 16 using the modified retrospective approach accordingly the comparative information presented for 2018 has not been restated and is presented as previously reported under ias 17 and related interpretations we recognized p18 455 thousand of depreciation charges and p8 777 thousand of interest costs from leases in the first quarter of 2019 our professional services increased by 30 0 to p81 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 as a result of increased ipo related expenses net foreign exchange loss net foreign exchange loss was p23 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 an increase of p22 million compared to a p1 million loss for the three months ended march 31 2018 the net foreign exchange loss for the three months ended march 31 2019 reflects the appreciation of the russian ruble to u s dollar during the first quarter of 2019 as we decided in 2018 to convert substantial russian ruble denominated cash amount into u s dollar in light of a dividend we were considering to pay at that time which was not paid depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization were p165 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 compared to p144 million for the three months ended march 31 2018 depreciation and amortization increased by p21 million or 14 6 primarily due to a depreciation charge of p18 million related to right of use assets recognized as of january 1 2019 under the new standard ifrs 16 leases see other general and administrative expenses finance income and costs finance income was p26 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 compared to p19 million for the three months ended march 31 2018 finance income increased by p7 million or 34 6 due to an increase in available cash balances that were deposited finance costs were p168 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 and they remained flat compared to p166 million for the three months ended march 31 2018 income tax expense income tax expense was p177 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 compared to p102 million for the three months ended march 31 2018 the increase of p75 million was primarily due to the increase of profit before income tax from p88 million in the three months ended march 31 2018 to p416 million in the three months ended march 31 2019 the decrease in the effective tax rate from 115 4 for the three months ended march 31 2018 to 42 5 for the three months ended march 31 2019 was caused mainly by the decrease in the proportion of non deductible expenses and an unrecognized deferred tax asset relative to the profit before income tax the increase of the effective tax rate from 33 0 for the year ended december 31 2018 to 42 5 for the three months ended march 31 2019 was primarily due to a tax expense associated with our tax restructuring net income loss net income was p239 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 compared to p 14 million net loss for the three months ended march 31 2018 net income increased by p252 million compared with the three months ended march 31 2018 primarily due to the reasons described above adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda was p774 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 compared to p440 million for the three months ended march 31 2018 and it increased by p333 million primarily due to the increase in revenue offset by the increase in operating expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization and the net foreign exchange loss adjusted net income adjusted net income was p373 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 compared to p131 million for the three months ended march 31 2018 adjusted net income increased by p242 million compared with the three months ended march 31 2018 primarily due to the reasons described above cash flows net cash generated from operating activities for the three months ended march 31 2019 net cash generated from operating activities was p375 million compared to p175 million for the three months ended march 31 2018 the change between the periods of p200 million was primarily driven by an increase in sales which resulted in an increase in net income adjusted for non cash items and items not affecting cash flow from operating activities and an increase in trade payables primarily due to increase in payables to employees and suppliers these changes were partially offset by an increase in income taxes paid due to an increased tax base and a decrease in the movement of contract liabilities in the three months ended march 31 2019 as compared to three months ended march 31 2018 net cash used in investing activities for the three months ended march 31 2019 net cash used in investing activities was p290 million compared to p52 million for the three months ended march 31 2018 the change between the periods of p238 million was primarily due to the acquisition of a 25 01 ownership interest in llc skillaz net cash used in financing activities for the three months ended march 31 2019 net cash used in financing activities was p574 million compared to p229 million for the three months ended march 31 2018 the change between these periods was primarily due to a loan repayment of p270 million to the associate of a non controlling shareholder and an increase in the bank loan repayments from p200 million in the three months ended march 31 2018 to p245 million in the three months ended march 31 2019 in accordance with the repayment schedule capital expenditures our additions to property and equipment and intangible assets in the three months ended march 31 2019 were p85 million an increase of p16 million compared to p69 million for the three months ended march 31 2018 primarily due to p34 million in office renovation costs in three months ended march 31 2019 as we are planning to redesign our offices in moscow and yaroslavl in 2019 and have allocated a budget of p220 to p250 million for this purpose in this year partially offset by p41 million acquisition of

while dollar has been pressured for most of the day receding risk aversion seems to be giving in a hand in early us session the greenback is riding on recovery in both us yield and stocks and trades mildly higher adding to that chicago fed president charles evans maintains that current interest rate is appropriate however st louis fed president james bullard has come out yesterday and become the first policymaker to call for rate cut already the greenback will need some more solid economic data to give it sustainable rebound staying in the currency markets swiss franc and yen are so far the weakest one for today as stock markets recovery naturally but it s rather mixed elsewhere rba cut interest rate earlier today and governor philip lowe indicates more are on the table but aussie is just mixed euro attempted for rally but was capped by slower than expected cpi reading uk is for now the strongest one even though uk pmi construction dropped back to contraction region the current markets will need some more time to sort out their directions technically dollar breached near term support levels against euro aussie and canadian but it s refusing to give up for now and no follow through selling is seen yet focus remains on 1 1263 in eur usd 0 6988 in aud usd and 1 3429 in usd cad in europe currently ftse is up 0 46 dax is up 1 49 cac is up 0 67 german 10 year yield is down 0

current monetary policy setting has been appropriate chicago fed president charles evans insisted in a cnbc interview that the economy remains solid and interest rate is at the right place he said our current setting has been appropriate but if we sense that there was some greater uncertainty some softening we d have to take that into account and ask are we getting in the way of the economy while markets are betting on fed rate cuts this year evans said they are something that i haven t yet seen in the national data in particular he pointed out that consumption and employment continued to be strong even though business investment as not as strong as he d like eurozone unemployment rate dropped to record low cpi slowed to 1 2 eurozone unemployment rate dropped to 7 6 in april down from 7 7

reading since the snow related downturn in construction output during march 2018 additionally there was the sharpest drop in workforce numbers since november 2012 and commercial work remains the weakest performing category tim moore associate director at ihs markit said may data reveals another setback for the uk construction sector as output and new orders both declined to the greatest extent since the first quarter of 2018 survey respondents attributed lower workloads to ongoing political and economic uncertainty which has led to widespread delays with spending decisions and encouraged risk aversion among clients uk fox backs hunt to be pm dealmaking is part of his dna uk trade minister liam fox said he s backing foreign minister jeremy hunt in the race to be the next prime minister he told bbc radio in this contest i ll be backing my friend jeremy hunt who is an impressive foreign secretary an entrepreneur by background where dealmaking is part of his dna fox added he understands that we have to message to europe that we will leave if we cannot get an appropriate deal but we ll try to get a deal meanwhile fox also warned of the prospect of a no deal might well be used by those who seek to break up the uk to use that as a weapon in that particular battle both i think in northern ireland and potentially in scotland rba lowe possibility of lower interest rates remains on the table rba governor philip lowe used a speech to explain today s rate cut he emphasized that the decision is not in response to a deterioration in our economic outlook but its to support employment growth and to provide greater confidence that inflation will be consistent with the medium term target the timing of today s cut was due to accumulation of evidence of subdued inflation significant spare capacity in the labor market and collectively these factors have contributed to delayed progress in returning inflation to the 2 3 per cent target range meanwhile rba board has not yet made a decision on whether there will be more interest rate reduction he noted that current set of forecasts were based on assumptions that cash rate would follow the path implied by market pricing which was for the cash rate to be around 1 per cent by the end of the year but a range of other possible scenarios and much will depend on how the evidence evolves especially on the labour market he added it is possible that the current policy settings will be enough that we just need to be patient but it is also possible that the current policy settings will leave us short given this the possibility of lower interest rates remains on the table rba cuts cash rate to assist faster progress in employment and inflation rba cut cash rate by 25bps to 1 25 as widely expected the objective of the cut is to assist with faster progress in reducing unemployment and thus achieve more assured progress towards the inflation target more importantly rba leaves the option open for more rate cut it will continue to monitor developments in the labour market closely and adjust monetary policy for the objectives on the economy rba expects growth to be around 2 75 in 2019 and 2020 outlook for household consumption is the main domestic uncertainty which is affected by a protracted period of low income growth and declining housing prices the central bank noted the tick up in unemployment to 5 2 in april but the data suggests that australian economy can sustain a lower rate of unemployment rba also noted lower than expected inflation outcomes which suggest subdued inflationary pressures across much of the economy but inflation is still expected be at 1 75 in 2019 and 2 00 in 2020 separately the australian financial review reported that treasurer josh frydenberg met executives of the big four banks of f commonwealth bank of australia westpac banking corp australia and new zealand banking group and national australia bank issues on interest rates housing slump

the non gaap financial measures these non gaap financial measures are measurements of financial performance that are not prepared in accordance with u s generally accepted accounting principles and computational methods may differ from those used by other companies non gaap financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable gaap measures and should be read only in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap management uses both gaap and non gaap measures when planning monitoring and evaluating the company s performance the primary purpose of using non gaap measures is to provide supplemental information that may prove useful to investors and to enable investors to evaluate the company s results in the same way management does management believes that supplementing gaap disclosure with non gaap disclosure provides investors with a more complete view of the company s operational performance and allows for meaningful period to period comparisons and analysis of trends in the company s business further to the extent that other companies use similar methods in calculating non gaap measures the provision of supplemental non gaap information can allow for a comparison of the company s relative performance against other companies that also report non gaap operating results non gaap diluted earnings per share excludes to the extent applicable the impact of the following items stock based compensation amortization of acquisition related intangibles and previously the net amortization of debt discount on the company s convertible senior notes as well as income tax adjustments these items are excluded because the decisions that give rise to them are not made to increase revenue in a particular period but instead for the company s long term benefit over multiple periods specifically management is excluding the following items from its non gaap earnings per share as applicable for the periods presented in the q1 fy20 financial statements and for its non gaap estimates for q2 and fy20 stock based expenses the company s compensation strategy includes the use of stock based compensation to attract and retain employees and executives it is principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of our stockholders and at long term employee retention rather than to motivate or reward operational performance for any particular period thus stock based compensation expense varies for reasons that are generally unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period amortization of purchased intangibles the company views amortization of acquisition related intangible assets such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company s research and development efforts trade names customer lists and customer relationships and in some cases acquired lease intangibles as items arising from pre acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition while these intangible assets are continually evaluated for impairment amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles is a static expense one that is not typically affected by operations during any particular period gains on strategic investments net upon the adoption of accounting standards update 2016 01 on february 1 2018 the company is required to record all fair value adjustments to its equity securities held within the strategic investment portfolio through the statement of operations as it is not possible to forecast future gains and losses the company assumes no change to the value of its strategic investment portfolio in its gaap and non gaap estimates for future periods income tax effects and adjustments the company utilizes a fixed long term projected non gaap tax rate in order to provide better consistency across the interim reporting periods by eliminating the effects of items such as changes in the tax valuation allowance and tax effects of acquisition related costs since each of these can vary in size and frequency when projecting this long term rate the company evaluated a three year financial projection that excludes the direct impact of the following non cash items stock based expenses and the amortization of purchased intangibles the projected rate also assumes no new acquisitions in the three year period and considers other factors including the company s expected tax structure its tax positions in various jurisdictions and key legislation in major jurisdictions where the company operates for fiscal 2020 the company uses a projected non gaap tax rate of 22 5 which reflects currently available information as well as other factors and assumptions the non gaap tax rate could be subject to change for a variety of reasons including the rapidly evolving global tax environment significant changes in the company s geographic earnings mix due to acquisition activity or other changes to the company s strategy or business operations the company will re evaluate its long term rate as appropriate source salesforce related links

preliminary economic assessment the pea or pea report of its toroparu gold project in the mazaruni cuyuni district of guyana the toroparu project or project the pea report is being prepared in accordance with national instrument ni43 101 by srk consulting us inc srk and will be filed on sedar and the company s website within 45 days of the date hereof the toroparu project has been re scoped to include the sona hill satellite deposit modification of the project s processing strategy to start with gold only production from a carbon in leach circuit cil for the initial ten years followed by an expansion of the project in year 11 to add flotation processing capacity and the streaming agreement with wheaton precious metals international 1 this pea report summarizes the results of the re scoping at base case metal prices of us2 1 300 gold au 16 00 silver ag 3 00 copper cu a pea is preliminary in nature it includes inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves and there is no certainty that the preliminary economic assessment will be realized the pea documentation of mining production quantities will replace the 2013 prefeasibility study the 2013 pfs statement of mineral reserves3 the pea is based on exploitation of measured indicated and inferred mineral resources while the 2013 pfs is based on the exploitation of proven and probable mineral reserves inferred resources from the mineral resource estimate comprise 5 of the resources used in the production schedule reported in the pea the conclusions and results of the pea replace the conclusions and results from the 2013 pfs key aspects and findings from this pea study include 4 5 million ozs au production with 3 64 million ozs produced in au dor√© bars over 24 year life of mine lom up from 3 7 million ozs from the 2013 pfs 1 476 million ozs mozs au dor√© over 10

indicating that project returns are both robust at historic au prices and positively leveraged to higher au prices wheaton pmpa pursuant to the wheaton pmpa wheaton and the company agreed that the company will sell and wheaton will buy 10 of the payable au and 50 of the payable ag as those terms are defined in the wheaton pmpa from the production at the toroparu project in consideration for such sale wheaton has agreed to pay certain upfront deposit amounts according to a schedule set out in the wheaton pmpa as project costs as defined in the wheaton pmpa are incurred for initial construction of the project in the process of building the economic model for the pea the company has estimated revised upfront payments from wheaton while the company believes that the estimates are reasonable it should be noted that wheaton has not participated with sandspring in the calculation of the estimates nor has wheaton agreed with or approved of the revised estimated payments dor√© only initial phase under the pea during the initial 10 years of production the initial phase au dor√© with a ag by product will be recovered from a cil process instead of recovering au and cu from a au bearing cu concentrate as described in the 2013 pfs gold production increase life of mine during the initial phase the re scoped production schedule estimates an average production rate of 175 000 ozs

production and averages 217 000 ozs au per year through year 24 producing an additional 3 040 million ozs of au processing throughput is increased in the expansion phase to 23 kt d 8 4 mt y with the addition of a parallel 11 5 kt d flotation circuit the pea base case indicates that the cost of the expansion phase can be financed from internally generated cash flows the pea estimates a life of mine lom production of 4 5 million ozs of au 4 46 million ozs payable ag and 124 7 million pounds of payable cu as by products reduced initial capex the pea estimates pre production capital expenditures of 378 million the pre production capital expense is 123 million less than the 501 million estimated in the 2013 pfs aisc all in sustaining costs aisc are estimated to be 812 ounce oz au produced over the lom in the pea base case project payback the project payback is estimated at 2 92 years in the pea base case the 2013 pfs the base case for the economic parameters in the 2013 pfs were estimated using a au price of 1 400 the estimated parameters of the project from the 2013 pfs were as follows and are set out for ease of reference only pfs economics at 1 400 parameter pfs after

project that have occurred since the 2013 pfs was issued with the reduction of pre production capex by more than 120 0 million the increase in total gold production and the wheaton pmpa upfront deposit the economics of the re scoped project compare favorably to those of the 2013 pfs even though it is modeled at a gold price that is 100 less per ounce than the 2103 pfs munson noted that under the pea model the project has new project finance metrics he stated the reduction of pre production capex becomes even more significant when coupled with the upfront deposit under the wheaton pmpa based solely on our calculations which we believe are reasonable the wheaton contribution through the remaining upfront deposit to the pre production capex could be 106 million this contribution of the remaining upfront deposit from wheaton and the reduction in up front capex reduces sandspring s financing requirement from 501 million under the 2013 pfs to 272 million a reduction of 229 million or some 54 under the pea base case only the upfront capex will require outside funding exploration success at our sona hill satellite deposit provided the opportunity to re focus the project on gold dor√© which will provide a much simpler operational start up compared to the dual processing stream of leach and flotation modeled in the 2013 pfs with this re scoped plan all of the gold in the initial phase will be produced in dor√© bars instead of a mix of dor√© and gold rich copper concentrates of the total lom gold production some 3 64 million ozs will be produced in dor√© as opposed to 2 9 million ozs in the 2013 pfs munson continued we are continuing to investigate the outsourcing of mining operations and thermal power generation and if we are successful in those investigations and negotiations our up front capex will be further reduced although of course we expect our operating expense to increase to some degree production schedule the pea is based on processing 5 095 million oz of au at an average mill feed grade of 1 01 g t au from 156 35 million tonnes mt of mineralized saprolite and fresh rock over a 24 year mine life the schedule is based on initial phase years 1 to 10 processing 1 606 million oz au at an average grade of 1 20 g t au from 41 5 mt of saprolite and fresh rock through a 11 5 kt d 4 2 mt y cil circuit and expansion phase years 11 to 24 processing 3

production capital 232 million of expansion capital 341 million sustaining capital costs 40 0 million for the kurupung run of river hydroelectric plant krhp and 26 million closure costs table 2 pre production capital requirement is estimated at 378 million with a project financing requirement of 272 million assuming an estimated upfront deposit payment of 106 million under the wheaton pmpa phase 2 expansion capital requirements of 232 million are estimated for production years 9 and 10 which include 52 million for mining fleet expansion 116 million for process plant expansion including construction indirects 29 million for infrastructure expansion 35 million for owners cost risk contingencies the pea estimate for the expansion phase includes 40 million of capital investment in the krhp an owner operated 50 mw run of river hydroelectric facility currently at the pre feasibility stage of development under a memorandum of understanding mou with the government of guyana for self generated power the pea indicates that the cost of the krhp can be financed from internally generated cash flows construction of the krhp is scheduled over a 2 5 year period during production years 7 to 9 with partial electricity production commencing in year 9 and full production in year 10 the pea estimates 293 million in operating cost savings for the project from reduced power tariffs based on 79 availability of hydropower and 21 thermal power generation during the 14 5 years krhp power is available for phase 2 of the mine life years 9 5 to 24 the pea estimate is based on a 100 owner operated project sandspring is in discussions with a number of mining and power generation contractors for contracts that defer a portion of the pre production capital cost in exchange for 7 to 10 year operating agreements that will repay the capital from project operating cash flows additionally estimated cost of new equipment supported by budget quotes from vendors do not reflect discounts for negotiated prices bulk purchasing or used equipment purchases where appropriate any of which could lead to reductions in actual capital costs relative to the prices used in the pea capital cost estimate mining the pea mine plan provides for the excavation of 156 35 mt of processable mineralization which is included in the mineral resource estimate and 495 159 mt of waste for a combined total of 651 5 mt of material at a lom stripping ratio of 3 17 1 mining will be conducted with conventional open pit mining techniques over a 24 year mine life from three pits toroparu se zone 1 2 km se of

the non gaap financial measures these non gaap financial measures are measurements of financial performance that are not prepared in accordance with u s generally accepted accounting principles and computational methods may differ from those used by other companies non gaap financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable gaap measures and should be read only in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap management uses both gaap and non gaap measures when planning monitoring and evaluating the company s performance the primary purpose of using non gaap measures is to provide supplemental information that may prove useful to investors and to enable investors to evaluate the company s results in the same way management does management believes that supplementing gaap disclosure with non gaap disclosure provides investors with a more complete view of the company s operational performance and allows for meaningful period to period comparisons and analysis of trends in the company s business further to the extent that other companies use similar methods in calculating non gaap measures the provision of supplemental non gaap information can allow for a comparison of the company s relative performance against other companies that also report non gaap operating results non gaap diluted earnings per share excludes to the extent applicable the impact of the following items stock based compensation amortization of acquisition related intangibles and previously the net amortization of debt discount on the company s convertible senior notes as well as income tax adjustments these items are excluded because the decisions that give rise to them are not made to increase revenue in a particular period but instead for the company s long term benefit over multiple periods specifically management is excluding the following items from its non gaap earnings per share as applicable for the periods presented in the q1 fy20 financial statements and for its non gaap estimates for q2 and fy20 stock based expenses the company s compensation strategy includes the use of stock based compensation to attract and retain employees and executives it is principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of our stockholders and at long term employee retention rather than to motivate or reward operational performance for any particular period thus stock based compensation expense varies for reasons that are generally unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period amortization of purchased intangibles the company views amortization of acquisition related intangible assets such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company s research and development efforts trade names customer lists and customer relationships and in some cases acquired lease intangibles as items arising from pre acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition while these intangible assets are continually evaluated for impairment amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles is a static

future gains and losses the company assumes no change to the value of its strategic investment portfolio in its gaap and non gaap estimates for future periods income tax effects and adjustments the company utilizes a fixed long term projected non gaap tax rate in order to provide better consistency across the interim reporting periods by eliminating the effects of items such as changes in the tax valuation allowance and tax effects of acquisition related costs since each of these can vary in size and frequency when projecting this long term rate the company evaluated a three year financial projection that excludes the direct impact of the following non cash items stock based expenses and the amortization of purchased intangibles the projected rate also assumes no new acquisitions in the three year period and considers other factors including the company s expected tax structure its tax positions in various jurisdictions and key legislation in major jurisdictions where the company operates for fiscal 2020 the company uses a projected non gaap tax rate of 22 5 which reflects currently available information as well as other factors and assumptions the non gaap tax rate could be subject to change for a variety of reasons including the rapidly evolving global tax environment significant changes in the company s geographic earnings mix due to acquisition activity or other changes to the company s strategy or business operations the company will re evaluate its long term rate as appropriate source salesforce related links
proposed nominees stephen moore and herman cain having dropped out of contention discussion continues over the trump administration s possible next nomination to the federal reserve s board of governors the views of the latest candidate under consideration by the administration judy shelton have revived a question that commentators raised earlier about moore and cain should favoring some kind of gold standard disqualify a nominee from occupying one of seven seats on the board here let me disclose that i worked with judy shelton on the atlas economic research foundation s sound money project but the argument that follows is about the general status of arguments favoring the gold standard and not about her specific candidacy in other respects my answer will be no favoring a gold standard in a serious manner should not disqualify a nominee from holding a seat on the board of governors journalist sebastian mallaby author of a weighty biography of alan greenspan seems to think that favoring the gold standard should disqualify a nominee outright and this despite his pointing out that greenspan generally considered to have been qualified for the job of chairman was well known to be a gold standard advocate at the time of his appointment in 1987 what has changed mallaby suggests that the relative merits of a gold standard have so diminished with the decline of inflation since 1987 that favoring the gold standard is no longer respectable mallaby also seems to take for granted that the credit boom fostered by the fed s holding rates too low for too long followed by bust financial crisis and the great recession of 2002 09 has done nothing to bolster the case for an alternative to our status quo of a discretionary fiat monetary system it must of course be granted that adopting a gold standard or any other reform in order to restrain inflation is less urgent when the inflation rate is lower if the average inflation rate were our exclusive concern and if we could trust the central bank to keep the inflation rate as low under a fiat standard as it was under the classical gold standard then it would be pointless to reinstitute a gold standard but while the inflation rate today is certainly lower than it was in the 1970s and 1980s it is still not as low today as it was under the classical gold standard the inflation rate was only 0 1 percent over britain s 93 years on the classical gold standard it was only 0 01 percent in the united states between gold resumption in 1879 and 1913 by contrast during the most recent ten years april 2009 to april 2019 of the united states current fiat money system the cpi u price index rose 19 8 percent for an annualized inflation rate of 1 8 percent over the last 50 years since april 1969 shortly before president nixon closed the gold window the index has risen by 604 percent at the compound annualized inflation rate by 4 0 percent although it has diminished in urgency the case for a gold standard based exclusively on mean inflation remains a gold standard has more to offer than an anti inflation program however as mallaby recognizes shelton herself makes more than an anti inflation argument she also argues in favor of gold as an international monetary standard that no one nation can manipulate that is the advantages of a common world currency are unlikely to be gained through the widespread adoption of any national fiat currency large to medium nations that can manage their own currencies well enough will decline to dollarize for example because they recognize that they would then be at the mercy of us monetary policy gold by contrast can provide what former chinese central banker zhou xiaochuan called an international reserve currency that is disconnected from individual nations and is able to remain stable in the long run thus removing the inherent deficiencies caused by using credit based national currencies unlike shelton zhou did not endorse an international gold standard as a means to achieve the end he sought shelton s inspiration is not zhou of course but rather nobel laureate robert mundell sometimes considered the father of the euro mundell emphasized that the transaction costs of currency balkanization and the very limited effectiveness of fighting unemployment with devaluation mean that there is an upper limit on the desirable number of currency areas the logical extension of mundell s concerns favors a single global monetary standard there are at least three additional arguments for a gold standard that others have made since the great recession first in contrast to the status quo system a gold standard combined with free banking would have restrained the boom and the bust second in contrast to fiat standards gold standards historically have exhibited lower price level uncertainty at medium to long horizons which means lower yield premia and thicker markets for 20 year bonds reducing an important obstacle to financing long range real investment projects what the dollar will be worth twenty years from now remains far less certain than it was under the classical gold standard and third as alan greenspan has noted in the light of recent sovereign debt problems a gold standard without bailouts provides greater fiscal discipline restraining government over indebtedness unlike those who want to prevent the fed from conjuring money out of thin air mallaby believes that the past decade has witnessed a momentous experiment in monetary conjuring and that the results have been positive without qe1 through qe3 the economic recovery after the 2008 crisis would have been even more sluggish we can all agree that the recovery was relatively sluggish but as stephen roach argued in 2018 that the us economy saw roughly 2 annual growth over the past nine plus years versus a 4 norm in earlier cycles provides a prima facie reason to doubt the effectiveness of the qe programs this is not to blame qe for delaying recovery but to say that the case for its speeding recovery is doubtful there is now a substantial body of empirical studies on whether qe was effective many of them skeptical stephen williamson 2017 for example notes that real gdp recovered from the financial crisis slightly faster in canada than in the us the bank of canada followed interest rate policies similar to the fed s but did not conduct qe policies mallaby adds that the alleged downside of qe a surge in inflation has failed to materialize but why it has failed to materialize because the fed used interest on reserves ior paid for the first time in 2008 to keep qe created excess reserves bottled up in the banking system between them low market rates and ior made it worthwhile for banks and large banks especially to accumulate excess reserves instead of trying to dispose of them and thus prevented money in the hands of the public from growing any faster this is evident by looking at the fed s time series for m1 or m2 over which we find no increase in the rate of growth of money held by the public no increase in the growth of dollar spending on goods and services and no rise in the inflation rate the qe programs combined with ior did not substantially ramp up aggregate demand then what was the point of the combination qe enabled the fed to purchase more than 3 trillion in mortgage backed securities and long term treasuries ior allowed it to bottle up what it worried would otherwise have been inflationary effects besides inflation and international considerations the only additional reasons that mallaby recognizes for favoring a gold standard are moral reasons these he does not associate as most would with honest money or a system that does not characteristically redistribute wealth by unevenly injecting new money instead he cites 1 the view that the power to tax undergirds the demand for fiat money which as he says is irrelevant and 2 the opposition to central bank bailouts of insolvent financial institutions with regard to the second mallaby imagines an inherent tradeoff between the moral hazard generated by bailouts avoided by the gold standard and the damage created by contagious panics avoided by fiat money the case against gold supposes that the latter will do more damage but in fact there is no such tradeoff because contagious panics are not endemic to banking systems under a gold standard even ones that lack an official lender of last resort this is evident if one looks at the record of banking systems other than the united states unusually fragile system between 1863 and 1913 canada during the same period had no central bank no bailouts and also no banking panics the key to avoiding panics is not fiat money or last resort lending as we should have learned in 2007 9 but the absence of legal restrictions or privileges that weaken the banking system that absence was how canada differed from the us system pre 1914 the scottish system similarly differed from the english system in the 19th century and similarly exhibited greater stability mallaby declares that modern central banking is one of those elite inventions that generally works the gold standard has given way to the phd standard and we are all the better for it that is certainly the orthodox view at the federal reserve must all the governors hold it skepticism toward that view based on the evidence that the fed has failed to live up to the standard set by the pre fed classical gold standard even given the united states artificially weak banking system is warranted a heterodox appreciation for the classical gold standard and a desire to see the federal reserve perform at least as well should not be grounds for disqualification from a seat at the table where monetary policy is made after all that is what is presently at stake one seat out of seven the board of governors nomination process is not a referendum on restoring the gold standard and there is no risk that one governor today can restore the gold redeemability of the us dollar when alan greenspan never did so in more than 18 years at the helm mallaby warns us that although shelton s lone vote would not alter fed policy her elevation would give voice to a maverick perspective encouraging other gold believers such as sen ted cruz r tex or sen rand paul r ky to speak up more freely but is wider debate over our monetary constitution really something to fear is the consensus around the institutional status quo really so fragile that we need to squash every maverick perspective lest public officials might speak up more freely for unpopular ideas for an overview of the contemporary merits and feasibility of a gold standard see white 2015 on the track records of canada scotland and other free banking systems see dowd 1993 briones and rockoff 2005 and white 2015
teachers in arizona rally for higher wages and more funding for public schools in front of the state capitol in phoenix on april 26 2018 the state regained ownership of its capitol buildings earlier this year after selling them in 2009 to shore up its finances in academic year 2016 state funding for public schools on a per pupil basis adjusted for inflation was lower in 29 states compared with 2008 and was down the most in arizona ralph freso getty images overview nearly 10 years after the end of the great recession state governments have put the worst behind them but the deepest downturn since world war ii also has lived up to early predictions that states would face a lost decade because of missed economic and revenue growth 1 the legacy of the lost decade is easily overlooked given the second longest u s economic expansion on record arguably the longest bull market for stocks in u s history unemployment at near historic lows and a recent spurt in the growth of state tax revenue although the 18 month recession which ended in june 2009 may seem long ago a closer look reveals that many states are still coping with lingering maybe even lasting effects on their finances like a family that suffered a job loss or pay cut during the recession states missed out on billions of dollars in tax revenue even if a family s earnings are now back to par the household faces consequences from those years when it was unable to save for college add to retirement accounts or fix the roof likewise even though total state tax revenue recovered nearly six years ago from its losses in the downturn many states are still dealing with fallout from the tough choices they had to make to fill budget holes during the recession including recent strikes by teachers who went years without pay raises higher tuition at public universities complaints from local governments living with less state aid mounting repair bills for public infrastructure and smaller state workforces state policymakers also feel pressure to replenish rainy day funds for the next inevitable downturn even though their budgets are squeezed by higher health care costs and unfunded pension liabilities to be sure most states annual finances were better off heading into 2019 legislative sessions than they had been in 10 years as the pew charitable trusts fiscal 50 tool shows states combined inflation adjusted tax revenue was more than 13 percent higher than at its 2008 peak just before receipts plunged and the lost decade began states rainy day funds collectively held more money than in any year on record and many governors in 2019 proposed spending increases to help fill some of the holes gouged by the recession including about 20 seeking pay raises for teachers and at least 17 requesting extra dollars for higher education to curb the need for tuition hikes 2 fiscal 50 state trends and analysis quick view fiscal 50 state trends and analysis an interactive resource from the pew charitable trusts allows you to sort and analyze data on key fiscal economic and demographic trends in the 50 states and understand their impact on states fiscal health but the recent surge in tax revenue already has begun to sputter raising uncertainty over how much of the gains were temporary in reaction to 2017 s federal tax overhaul rather than a trend meanwhile states face a backlog of spending demands that have piled up over the past decade here are 10 ways that states face a legacy from the lost decade 3 these examples show that states collectively or in significant numbers still haven t completely shaken off the effects of the downturn download the data the recession undercut states largest source of revenue tax dollars states missed out on an estimated 283 billion when collections fell and remained below 2008 s level until 2013 after adjusting for inflation 4 that figure likely underestimates the amount of forgone revenue because it does not reflect potential growth in tax receipts under normal economic circumstances temporary federal stimulus aid from the american recovery and reinvestment act including 147 billion in medicaid and education funds helped offset some of the shortfall 5 still states were left with less to invest in higher education public employee pensions infrastructure and other needs even though total state tax collections in late 2018 were 13 4 percent higher than a decade ago based on quarterly tax revenue collections adjusted for inflation nine states still were taking in fewer tax dollars than at their peak before receipts fell in the 2007 09 downturn 6 the bottom line is that not all states have regained the purchasing power they had at their peaks and are still playing catch up in some spending categories download the data nationally spending from states general funds the largest source of state expenditures has surpassed pre recession levels by 4 3 percent after adjusting for inflation but states recoveries have varied widely 7 in fiscal year 2018 23 states still spent less in inflation adjusted terms than in fiscal 2008 when they were just starting to get hit by the recession 8 spending increases approved for fiscal 2019 which ends june 30 for most states would still leave an estimated 17 states with lower expenditures than before the recession in real dollars 9 as states economies slowed dwindling tax revenue triggered budget shortfalls to balance their books states relied on a mix of tax increases budget cuts and savings but cuts in some state programs haven t been restored even in the 27 states where spending in inflation adjusted dollars had surpassed fiscal 2008 totals by fiscal 2018 not all programs were back to previous levels spending in nine states in fiscal 2018 was more than 10 percent below fiscal 2008 levels nowhere was spending down more than in alaska by nearly a third compared with a decade ago still 14 states were spending at least 10 percent more than at the start of the recession led by north dakota s 53 percent jump since fiscal 2008 download the data state financial support for higher education the third biggest slice of state budgets was still 13 percent below its high before the downturn on a per student basis after adjusting for inflation cuts were widespread with 40 states in fiscal 2018 reporting lower per student funding which includes appropriations to public colleges and universities financial aid to students and their families and research grants to institutions 10 faced with diminished tax revenue and the need to balance budgets many states reduced their higher education spending in the wake of the recession many states now rely primarily on tuition revenue from students and their families rather than state support to fund public higher education nationally tuition dollars collected by public universities jumped 43 percent per student from 2008 to 2018 after adjusting for inflation 11 state financial support peaked at 9 248 per full time equivalent student in fiscal 2008 and fell by about a quarter to its lowest level of 6 888 in fiscal 2012 12 state support has partially recovered but still remained 13 percent below fiscal 2008 levels in 2018 at 8 073 per student 13 in total dollar terms this meant states spent 88 2 billion in 2018 7 percent less than in 2008 after adjusting for inflation 14 preliminary data show that total nominal state support for higher education increased in 2019 for the seventh year in a row though support is expected to remain highly sensitive to economic slowdowns 15 download the data seven years after the recession ended state funding per pupil for public elementary and secondary schools the largest area of states general fund budgets stood at 6 745 nationally below 2008 levels by about 1 7 percent or nearly 120 per pupil after adjusting for inflation 16 state support per pupil was lower in a majority of states 29 in academic year 2016 compared with 2008 according to the most recent available data and was down at least 10 percent in nine of those states initial data for 2017 and 2018 show that more than 20 states continued to provide less per pupil funding than at the start of the recession 17 primary and secondary schools receive roughly 45 percent of their funding from the state with a nearly equal share from local governments 18 the mix varies widely so both funding streams are important in gauging the recession s full effect on education after the downturn both state and local funding fell on a per pupil basis when faced with declining tax revenue although the 50 state total for this combined funding has surpassed 2008 levels schools in 20 states still received fewer dollars per pupil from state and local funds in 2016 wrapped up in school funding are teacher salaries which on average were still below pre recession levels in 2016 in real dollars 19 but how much teachers earn and who funds their salaries differ significantly by state even an increase in per pupil spending doesn t necessarily mean more dollars for salaries and classrooms for example an increase also could reflect rising pension contributions download the data in the wake of the recession state governments reduced investing in infrastructure as a share of the economy state spending on fixed assets such as highways sidewalks airfields electronics or software has been falling since 2009 20 in real dollars state governments investments in infrastructure dropped by 3 2 percent from 2007 to 2017 with ups and downs along the way but infrastructure spending relative to gross domestic product gdp dropped almost every year between a 2009 peak and 2017 following more than two decades of stability in fact 2017 marked the lowest level of funding as a share of the economy in more than half a century states declining infrastructure investment relative to gdp is a sign that spending on fixed assets has not kept pace with economic growth because state level data on infrastructure investment by category are unavailable a look into combined investments by states and localities shows that infrastructure types were affected differently 21 for example transportation structures such as air transportation and mass transit systems seem to have been prioritized with a nearly 30 percent increase in spending funding for highways and streets which generally receive the most state and local infrastructure investment dropped 6 percent between 2007 and 2017 while spending on the second largest recipient educational structures such as schools fell 14 percent after accounting for inflation download the data in the recession s wake many local governments had to manage with less money from their states total state aid to localities was down by 5 3 percent at its post recession low point in fiscal 2013 and was still slightly lower by just 0 8 percent at the end of fiscal 2016 than before the recession after adjusting for inflation but local governments in 26 states received less state aid in fiscal 2016 than in fiscal 2008 the last year before tumbling tax revenue led to budget cuts and forced states to cut spending the decline in state aid to local governments ranged from less than 0 5 percent in pennsylvania to 22 8 percent in arizona compared with fiscal 2008 cutbacks in state aid put a strain on local budgets and exposed cities and other localities to greater risk of financial problems for local governments together state aid is the second largest source of revenue after tax dollars and significant cuts can lead to difficult decisions about raising other revenue or cutting spending download the data one way for states to cut spending during downturns is to reduce their payroll whether through early retirements buyouts or layoffs state agencies can cut spending by shrinking their workforce the 2007 09 recession was no different total state employment excluding teachers and other public school staff peaked at slightly above 2 8 million public employees in 2008 as states had not yet borne the brunt of the recession 22 after shedding almost 170 000 jobs and reaching its lowest point in 2013 the state workforce nationwide started to grow slightly however in 2018 more than a decade after the recession began state governments across the u s still had fewer employees having lost 4 7 percent or more than 132 000 jobs from the peak with fewer workers on government payrolls lawmakers options for reducing spending in a future recession are reduced download the data in addition to pent up demand to restore spending cuts from the recession states face the challenge of rebuilding rainy day funds to prepare for the next economic downturn at the end of fiscal 2018 these funds held more money than in any year on record but at least 19 states still had smaller rainy day funds as a share of general fund operating costs than in fiscal 2007 the last full budget year before the recession hit for many states though even pre recession levels were inadequate to plug huge budget gaps caused by the last recession seven states had less than a week s worth of operating costs in rainy day funds in fiscal 2018 including wisconsin 6 8 days kentucky 3 0 days illinois 0 1 day and pennsylvania less than 0 1 day three had nothing kansas montana and new jersey although there is no one size fits all rule for how much states should save the clock is ticking on their chances to use the economic expansion to rebuild reserves download the data medicaid costs borne by the states surged following the recession after the phaseout of a one time infusion of federal economic recovery dollars the extra federal aid helped states deal with a spike in enrollment in the health insurance program for low income americans after people lost jobs and income during the downturn even after the economy improved medicaid continued to consume a greater share of state revenue than before the recession nationwide medicaid expenses accounted for 17 1 cents of every state generated dollar in 2016 compared with 14 3 cents in 2007 just before the recession 23 although the federal government covers at least half of the total costs of insuring medicaid recipients the portion shouldered by states is their second biggest expense after k 12 education 24 higher medicaid costs can limit what states have left to fund other priorities such as schools transportation and public safety preliminary figures indicate that the dollars states spent on medicaid also increased in 2017 and 2018 even though a leading cost driver enrollment growth began to slow 25 some of the increase was due to states for the first time picking up a small share of the costs of insuring newly eligible low income adults under the affordable care act s optional expansion of medicaid coverage through 2016 the period shown in figure 9 the federal government covered 100 percent of the costs of the expansion population states began picking up 5 percent of the costs for this population in 2017 and will gradually increase their share to 10 percent by 2020 download the data the recession didn t cause states pension funding problems but it did compound them first by reducing investment returns on the assets that states had saved to fund their employees retirements and second by squeezing state budgets and making it even more difficult to fully fund their annual pension payments 26as a result the gap grew between how much states had saved and how much they needed to cover the pension benefits promised to public workers the greater the gap the more a state would need to set aside annually simply to keep its pension debt from growing as of fiscal 2016 states had enough set aside to cover just 66 percent of their total pension liabilities the lowest level since fiscal 2003 the earliest available data the shortfall between pension assets and liabilities amounted to a collective debt of 1 35 trillion by fiscal 2016 taking into account new accounting standards that raised the 50 state total by roughly 100 billion 27 greater than expected investment returns on the back of a booming stock market in fiscal years 2017 and 2018 helped shrink the 50 state total unfunded pension liability though estimates show that it remained near historic highs 28 however market losses in the first half of fiscal 2019 threatened to reverse the progress states may have made in whittling down their pension debt 29 conclusion despite nearly 10 years of national economic growth in what would be the longest u s expansion on record by the end of june 2019 states haven t fully erased the effects of the recession instead of reaching the light at the end of the tunnel as the lost decade ends some see the tunnel simply getting longer certainly budget pressures have eased in several ways but in the aggregate states still have not fully restored cuts in funding for infrastructure public schools and universities the number of state workers and support for local governments even where 50 state results have recovered many individual states still lag behind nearly a fifth of states collect less revenue than before the downturn more than a third have smaller rainy day funds and almost half spend less from their general fund budgets than a decade earlier meanwhile fixed costs for medicaid and underfunded public pension systems are higher in almost every state one risk is that another recession could hit before states fully recover from the 2007 09 downturn cementing reduced levels of support for some of those services both fiscal and

the following statement was published on june 8 1989 just four days after the chinese government s brutal military crackdown on students and workers in tiananmen square 1 the international committee of the fourth international and the workers league proclaim their unshakeable solidarity with the embattled workers and student youth of china who are engaged in a life and death struggle against the murderous regime of the beijing stalinists the bloody massacre in tiananmen square like those carried out in east berlin in 1953 budapest in 1956 and gdansk in 1970 has once again exposed the counter revolutionary depravity of stalinism the most insidious and sinister enemy of socialism and the working class a reign of terror prevails in beijing soldiers and secret police are combing the city trying to hunt down workers and students who participated in the mass protests of the last two months there are reports that mass detention centers are being set up and that the regime is planning to carry out mass executions but despite this unrestrained terror the stalinist regime has not been able to suppress the mass movement that is sweeping the country by thursday june 8 demonstrations and other forms of mass protests were being reported in dozens of cities shanghai has been shaken by the biggest demonstrations in 40 years industrial production is paralyzed and local authorities are claiming that the city s economy is on the verge of collapse barricades have been erected at more than 100 road intersections in nanjing on the yangtze river students and workers are demonstrating and blocking major transport systems in chengdu the provincial capital of sichuan there are reports of clashes between angry crowds and the police according to agence france press martial law has been imposed and more than 300 people have been murdered by troops canton in the south is at a standstill in wuhan the main north south railway line of china has been shut down by more than 10 000 workers and students in xian located in the northwest province of shaanxi the city gates have been blocked by more than 100 000 workers and students industry is reported paralyzed by strikes other cities in which mass protests are reportedly underway include harbin changchuan dalian qingdao loyang and tianjin 2 their hands dripping with blood deng xiaoping li peng and their cronies in the bureaucracy denounce their victims as counter revolutionaries what a contemptible and obvious lie stalinism pins this label on all those who oppose the privileges of the bureaucracy and its betrayals of the chinese revolution and the cause of international socialism in fact the mass killings of the past week are the political culmination of a decade during which the beijing stalinists have worked systematically to restore capitalism to china and reintegrate its economy into the structure of world imperialism the main purpose of the terror unleashed by the beijing regime is to intimidate the chinese masses and crush all opposition to its deliberate liquidation of the social conquests of the chinese revolution this is why president george bush while shedding crocodile tears for the victims of tiananmen square went out of his way to reassure his beijing allies that american imperialism is determined to preserve its strategic relation with china since richard nixon was welcomed to beijing by mao zedong and zhou en lai in 1972 during the height of the bombing of north vietnam china has become the thirteenth largest trade partner of the united states 14 3 billion in 1988 up 37 percent over 1987 and a major source of low paid labor for american and other foreign multinational conglomerates at present 450 american companies including the bechtel group ibm mcdonnell douglas general electric chrysler and at t have various types of technology transfer equity joint venture and co production agreements in china in 1988 alone us investors signed contracts for 269 projects worth 370 million economic ties between european and japanese imperialism and china are no less intimate japan is china s biggest source of private and government loans and its second largest trading partner after hong kong as for europe overall trade between china and the economic community has grown from 3 billion in 1978 to 12 billion last year a senior representative of westdeutsche landesbank girozentrale recently boasted that china was replacing south korea and taiwan as a source of low cost commodities imported into germany these are the interests for whom the white house was speaking when it declared the world has a stake in china s economic progress national security and political vitality the us hopes to see the continuing implementation of economic and political reforms which undoubtedly will also help advance these goals 3 not since the final bloody days of the regime of chiang kai shek has such brutality been unleashed against the chinese masses the carnage which took place in tiananmen square and the white terror which has followed it will live in their collective consciousness even long after the crimes committed during the past week are avenged let us review a few of the accounts which have appeared in the press before this final assault the soldiers had formed a line around tiananmen square facing out students and other citizens formed their own line about 300 yards east down changan boulevard facing in toward the soldiers the soldiers were singing army songs the students were singing the national anthem and the internationale in between songs they taunted each other with slogans and insults later a chinese military doctor described part of the scene one young man was shot his girlfriend turned toward the soldiers and screamed why she was shot through the head the soldiers never expected the students to be so brave the doctor said and the students never expected the soldiers to be so brutal the doctor said tanks continued to flatten the tents and the bodies mechanical sweepers and trash compactors came next finally the doctor said the mass of crushed body parts was doused with gasoline and set on fire detroit free press june 5 1989 at fu xing hospital following the massacre a witness reported that blood was flooding in the hallway the youngest killed is seven years old the youngest wounded is three the killers are the 27th army as they were shooting at the people they laughed and yelled at the people pekinese show your guts windsor star june 6 1989 soldiers also beat and bayonetted students and workers after daybreak on sunday witnesses said usually after some provocation but sometimes entirely at random i saw a young woman tell the soldiers that they are the people s army and they mustn t hurt the people a young doctor said after returning from one clash sunday then the soldiers shot her and ran up and bayonetted her i ran away so i couldn t tell if she lived or died new york times june 5 1989 a convoy of five tanks and 22 armored troop carriers roared along central changan avenue early this morning spraying both sides of the streets with bullets one carrier aimed its gun at the beijing hotel the city s oldest and unleashed a burst of fire a foreign witness saw the bodies of at least 50 dead on the pavement protestors displayed ghastly evidence of the bloodletting including headless corpses a teacher from the beijing foreign languages institute told this story a girl in the crowd heard that her younger brother had been killed and lost her composure and ran toward the soldiers we tried to stop her but the troops opened fire they shot her seven times even as she was crawling we have people shot in the head chest stomach legs even the eyes said a nurse as she gave an injection to a 27 year old student whose lower leg was shattered the government is so rotten said the student his shirt drenched with the blood of another youth next to him who had been shot in the head they don t care how many people died one doctor said he handled the body of a man in his mid 20s who had been choked to death by metal chains the soldiers had hidden in their hats for crowd control it s just repulsive the lengths they went to he said detroit news june 5 1989 again and again beijing residents insist and foreign witnesses back this up the armored guns simply began to spit when a cluster of people was perceived from the tank turrets and there were not a few instances attested by at least one japanese witness where the columns halted poured gasoline on the bodies set them afire and went on their way having destroyed any evidence that they had committed a crime new york times june 6 1989 near the square li tienguo a pla veteran said he saw troops kick a 12 year old girl in the chest and crush her heart they just kicked and kicked her and she died there across the street from me we wanted to pull her body away but they shot at us he said wall street journal june 6 1989 4 regardless of the immediate outcome of the present stage of the crisis the massacre in tiananmen square has not ended the political revolution in china rather having now been baptised in blood the revolution will enter a new and more politically conscious level of development the naive illusions that the stalinist regime could be reformed under the pressure of mass protests have been shattered the tragic events of the past week have powerfully vindicated the emphasis placed by the fourth international upon the necessity of the revolutionary overthrow of the stalinist bureaucracy by the working class as leon trotsky the founder of the fourth international wrote more than 50 years ago all indications agree that the further course of development must inevitably lead to a clash between the culturally developed forces of the people and the bureaucratic oligarchy there is no peaceful outcome for this crisis no devil ever yet voluntarily cut off his own claws the soviet bureaucracy will not give up its positions without a fight the development leads obviously to the road of revolution the revolution betrayed 5 when these words were written they applied to the stalinist regime in the ussr but they are no less valid today for the stalinist regimes in china southeast asia and eastern europe never has the perspective of political revolution assumed such burning urgency in the final stages of their death agony all the stalinist regimes have set their sights upon the restoration of capitalism for decades the parasitic bureaucracies concerned above all with the defense of their privileges have sabotaged the development of genuine scientific socialist planning which at any rate can develop only on the basis of an international revolutionary program now confronted with the collapse of their reactionary national economic schemes and an aroused working class the stalinists are seeking to secure their own interests on the basis of capitalist property and the development of the closest ties with world imperialism they are ruthlessly dismantling state owned industry and agriculture revising the legal statutes to permit private ownership of the means of production encouraging the development of direct ties between privately owned cooperatives and imperialist enterprises and in the form of special economic zones placing entire regions at the disposal of imperialist multinationals for unrestricted exploitation the imperialists understand very well the significance of the policies now being implemented by the stalinists the financial times of london offered this assessment of the program of the polish stalinists the last task which the polish united workers party has given itself is to secure capitalism in poland against what the country s leadership fears might be the violent objections of its citizens mr wladislaw baka the puwp s politburo member with responsibility for the economy can lament that while the command economy has been largely left behind still market mechanisms do not fully work either the issue is whether we overcome the problem or slide back down the political will of the party is very important in effecting this conversion to a market economy 6 this reference to the violent objections of the polish people indicates the acute awareness of the imperialists and their stalinist agents that the restoration of capitalism cannot be achieved without the violent counter revolutionary suppression of the working class this is what accounts for the fascist like brutality utilized by the beijing bureaucrats against the unarmed population the consequences of a decisive defeat of the chinese proletariat by the stalinist regime and this has by no means been achieved would be the complete liquidation of all the remaining social conquests of the chinese revolution and the unrestricted reorganization of the economy on new capitalist foundations of necessity the regime presiding over such a counter revolutionary transformation would be of a fascist character indeed the features of such a regime are already visible if only in embryonic form in the military terror that governs beijing today an astute bourgeois commentator writing from beijing reported what he has been told by the aging stalinist leaders about their plans for china they have been talking a good deal lately of the south korean model a hard nosed dictatorship efficient profit making low wages upwardly mobile a place of high technology and high production there some say is the path for china and they have already constructed an ideology to go along with the south korean model it s what they call authoritarianism new york times june 6 1989 7 the propagandists of the bourgeoisie describe the crimes of the beijing regime as the work of communism this is in keeping with the decades old practice of equating stalinism with its most irreconcilable enemy revolutionary marxism however never has the identification of stalinism with marxism socialism and communism been more transparently cynical hypocritical and dishonest the economic political and military relations between the beijing regime and american imperialism are so intimate that they simply cannot be covered over in fact the military architects of the terror in beijing have worked closely with their imperialist counterparts according to the new york times all of china s senior officers have had extensive contact with the american military and the most promising of its colonels have attended courses at american military schools emerging chinese military thinking is based on the american model and china s modernization program is largely dependent upon american technology and equipment june 6 1989 8 moreover the social catastrophe which has engulfed china is the direct product of bureaucracy s restorationist policies having repudiated central planning the chinese economy is at the mercy of the anarchic forces of the world capitalist market the creation of innumerable private links between provincial enterprises and foreign capitalists has undermined what was considered the greatest single achievement of the 1949 revolution the unification of china as budding capitalist entrepreneurs in the provincial bureaucracies make their separate deals with the imperialist multinationals the central government has virtually lost control over the country s balance of payments the foreign debt has doubled over the last four years to nearly 40 billion inflation is raging out of control from last year s average rate of 18 5 percent the cost of living index rose at an annual rate of 27 4 percent in january and 28 4 percent in february the bureaucracy s desperate attempts to control inflation with new austerity measures have had the main effect of worsening the social conditions of the working class even in the much vaunted special economic zones the conditions of the laboring masses are appalling we quote from the authoritative china trade report of april 1989 guangdong is in chaos in terms of infrastructure and food supplies it can no longer cope with the influx of people who for several years have staffed its booming processing factories done construction jobs regarded as beneath the locals and taken up marginal and illegal occupations that problem became acute with the onset of the current austerity drive the freeze on loans and shortage of raw materials has meant that many factories are only operating a three day week the 25 percent cut in construction has also reduced the province s demands for labor many of those who came to seek wealth end up as beggars hawkers and even prostitutes living in slum shanty towns outside the cities canton in particular 9 while the economic policies pursued by the bureaucracy have had a devastating impact upon the conditions of the working class student youth and millions of poor peasants it has led directly to the enrichment of broad sections of the bureaucracy the corruption which has been denounced so vehemently by workers and students is an external form of a social process involving the conversion of bureaucrats and their family members into capitalist entrepreneurs and middlemen deng pufang the son of deng xiaoping who runs the kanghua development corporation is only the most obvious representative of this tendency it is estimated that 10 000 companies have what the economist of london described as privileged links with party bureaucrats of these 134 can boast top officials ministers or the equivalent on their payroll they serve these companies often owned by relatives by making available to them key commodities which are purchased at state subsidized low prices for sale on the world market at enormous profit such illegal sales of fertilizers netted the social parasites an estimated rmb 42 million approximately 12 million last year alone the resulting shortage of fertilizers has had a devastating impact on the poor peasantry there have been reports that peasants have resorted to violence to obtain fertilizers for their crops like the old landlords of prerevolutionary china the regime has responded by shooting down peasants engaged in such looting the bureaucracy s policy has resulted in a broad social stratification and regional inequalities it has facilitated the growing integration of production in the regions of changjiang zhujiang and the minnan delta together with the liagong and shandong peninsulas into the imperialist world market the result has been to separate these traditionally more prosperous coastal areas from the less productive interior resulting in huge income disparities for example in 1986 the annual per capita rural income in zhujiang province reached rmb 609 290 70 38 percent more than in the typical interior province of hunan and 126 percent more than the poor interior province of gansu only six years earlier the incomes in zhujiang and hunan were identical while gansu lagged behind by only 30 percent within regions and the cities the disparities are even greater particularly between workers in the state owned enterprises and the growing strata of private owners according to one recent study of private businesses in beijing they were reporting an average net income of rmb 4 908 in 1987 with private transport operators reporting an average rmb 9 348 real income is believed to be at least twice as high as the private owners routinely under report in order to evade taxes the average wages of workers in the state owned enterprise on the other hand was only rmb 2 678 a thin layer of china s population has enriched itself as a result of the bureaucracy s restorationist policies while the vast majority of poor peasants rural laborers and the urban working class has seen its real income and social conditions steadily eroded the stalinist leadership has sought to create a social base for itself by upholding the interests of this social layer of capitalists private businessmen and rural bourgeoisie together with those of foreign capital against those of the masses 10 in the form of the beijing regime the chinese working class confronts what is in the final analysis a ruthless agency of world imperialism only the revolutionary overthrow of this regime by the working class can stop the restoration of capitalism and prevent the complete re enslavement of china by imperialism but the preparation of this political revolution requires the development of a chinese section of the fourth international based on the complete assimilation of all the strategic lessons drawn by the trotskyist movement represented today by the international committee in the course of the protracted development of the chinese revolution 11 the evolution of the beijing regime is a crushing historical indictment of all the petty bourgeois tendencies which have claimed over the last 40 years that maoism is not merely a progressive variant of stalinism but even a genuine revolutionary ideology that has surpassed the outmoded orthodox marxism of trotsky and the fourth international according to the pabloites the most persistent exponents of this view maoism demonstrated that the achievement of socialism did not depend upon the construction of an international proletarian party based on the perspective of world socialist revolution rather parties based predominantly on the peasantry or other nonproletarian forces could come to power and then within the framework of a national economy carry out the socialist transformation of society this process did not require indeed it precluded the independent political mobilization of the working class and the creation of its own organs of power 12 this revisionist conception was advanced in its most compelling form by the political godfather of pabloite revisionism isaac deutscher who wrote as far back as 1963 it must be emphasized again that to the end trotsky s strength and weakness alike were rooted in classical marxism his defeats epitomized the basic predicament by which classical marxism was beset as doctrine and movement the discrepancy and divorce between the marxist vision of revolutionary development and the actual course of class struggle and revolution the victory of mao zedong deutscher argued invalidated the classical marxist conception upheld by the fourth international of the decisive world historical role of the proletariat in the socialist revolution the industrial proletariat was not the driving force of the upheaval mao s peasant armies substituted themselves for the urban workers and carried the revolution from country to town deutscher the prophet outcast pp 514 20 this argument was in reality nothing more than a sophisticated apology for stalinism in general and the policies of mao zedong in particular it served to legitimize the abandonment of the chinese proletariat by the stalinists in the aftermath of the decapitation of the communist party at the hands of chiang kai shek in 1927 from this defeat which was the product of stalin s policy of collaboration with the chinese bourgeoisie mao drew the lesson that it was futile to base the development of the revolutionary party on the urban proletariat rather the communist party ccp had to base itself on another social force the peasantry 13 in the years that followed mao pursued this peasant orientation while zealously upholding the class collaborationist line demanded by stalin indeed the two elements of mao s policy were organically connected the program advanced by mao was not socialist but limited to demands of a bourgeois democratic character while seeking to preserve an alliance with sections of the chinese bourgeoisie in accordance with the stalinist theory of the bloc of four classes mao disavowed any specifically socialist aims this was not a political ruse but a faithful expression of the maoist party s petty bourgeois social base as late as 1945 mao s proposed program for a coalition government pledged that proper profits under reasonable management of state private and cooperative enterprises will be assured thus both labor and capital will work jointly for the development of industrial production it was only in october 1947 that mao finally called for the overthrow of the kuomintang dictatorship and as the regime of chiang kai shek disintegrated beneath the weight of its own corruption and popular hatred achieved victory two years later the defeat of chiang kai shek and the formation of the people s republic marked an enormous blow to world imperialism which after a century of plundering china now found itself unable to continue the exploitation of one quarter of humanity the liberation of china from direct imperialist oppression and the subsequent nationalization of the means of production laid the basis for a rapid growth in production and a campaign to overcome the backwardness which had made china one of the world s most impoverished nations 14 nonetheless the state which emerged from the 1949 revolution cannot be equated with that established by the russian revolution of 1917 while mao and the leadership of the ccp claimed to represent the working class they had come to power not through a proletarian revolution but at the head of the people s liberation army which was overwhelmingly peasant in its composition the nature of this regime which issued from the 1949 revolution is decisive in understanding the subsequent struggles in china and in particular the powerful upsurge of the proletariat against the bureaucracy today in a letter to the chinese left oppositionists in 1932 trotsky had accurately warned of the potential consequences of the victory of such a peasant army the commanding stratum of the chinese red army has no doubt succeeded in inculcating itself with the habit of issuing commands the absence of a strong revolutionary party and of mass organizations of the proletariat renders control over the commanding stratum virtually impossible the commanders and commissars appear in the guise of absolute masters of the situation and upon occupying cities will be rather apt to look down from above upon the workers the demands of the workers might often appear to them either inopportune or ill advised the coming to power of the maoist leadership verified this analysis completely the ready made bureaucracy in command of the people s liberation army concentrated all power in its own hands from the very origins of the revolution the working class was politically disenfranchised and oppressed by a privileged bureaucracy which rested on the army and the peasantry and defended its own power and interests in the period leading up to the defeat of chiang at no time had mao issued a call for a revolutionary uprising of the proletariat though workers in the cities were entering into struggle rather he maintained his strategy of from the countryside to the city i e of the peasant army liberating the working class this was entirely bound up with the stalinist perspective of the two stage revolution and bloc of four classes mao did not want a workers insurrection because he planned to form new democracy a bourgeois state in alliance with sections of the petty bourgeoisie and national bourgeoisie once cities were liberated by the people s liberation army strikes and other independent workers struggles were routinely suppressed mao s first government a coalition with bourgeois and petty bourgeois elements corresponded to the stalinist conception of a democratic stage which was to last for several decades it pledged to defend private property and even imperialist interests and postponed serious land reform 15 the chinese trotskyists who opposed these policies and fought for the independent mobilization of the working class were murdered and thrown into prison by the hundreds at the hands of the maoists never to be released one of the few who survived the anti trotskyist purges has given an account of the work carried out by the genuine revolutionary leaders of the chinese working class during the three and a half years between the communist takeover of shanghai late in may 1949 and the nation wide round up of trotskyists in december 1952 our comrades worked in many varied fields the younger members of the internationalist workers party continued to bring out a journal with the title marxist youth never flinching to raise criticisms of the new regime whenever necessary many of our comrades took an active part in the agrarian reform movement and not a few joined the pla to fight in its campaigns to liberate the rest of the country those in industry led many strikes against capitalist employers thus challenging the new government s policy of collaboration between workers and capitalists in many areas they became leaders of the masses not only because they acted as staunch champions of the workers interests but also because the workers who came under their influence were deeply impressed in a period where marxism was much in vogue by their command of revolutionary marxist politics we continued to grow both in numbers and in influence throughout those three and a half years which is the main reason why the ccp s secret police finally carried out their nation wide raid on the trotskyists in december 1952 wang fan hsi chinese revolutionary pp 252 53 16 on the international arena the maoists had no interest in following the example of the october 1917 revolution unlike lenin they did not seek to build an international revolutionary party but rather stood on the stalinist platform of socialism in one country in the early 1950s under the combined pressure of economic dislocation following world war ii and china s historical backwardness together with the korean war and the economic blockade imposed by us imperialism the maoist regime was forced to move more rapidly than originally planned in the expropriation of the capitalists and the expansion of the nationalized sector of the economy the chinese economy became closely tied to that of the soviet bloc nonetheless neither stalin nor mao ever proposed the unification of their two states into a common soviet union of socialist republics neither proceeded on the basis of the internationalist interests of the proletariat but rather on the narrow national interests of the privileged bureaucracies which they represented this is the real content of the characterization of china as a deformed workers state with the emphasis on the word deformed the fourth international unconditionally defended the nationalized property relations established in china at the same time it recognized the bureaucratically deformed origins of the maoist regime as its dominant feature making its overthrow through political revolution the only way forward for the construction of socialism this is inseparably bound up with the necessity to extend the world socialist revolution to which the policies of the maoist regime have consistently represented an obstacle 17 china s economic and political development has been dominated by the zig zag policies of a bonapartist regime a regime seeking to balance itself between conflicting class interests in china which has been continuously rent by internecine struggles confronted with the economic and cultural backwardness of china and the insoluble contradictions of the utopian scheme of building socialism in one country the maoist leadership attempted to overcome these obstacles with bureaucratic adventures the first of these was the so called great leap forward which began in 1958 economic planning was abandoned in favor of exhortations to the people to produce more and the military style organization of labor in peasant communes without a conscious centralized plan all of these efforts served to drive the economy to the brink of collapse and threatened to create famine in a number of areas this situation was further exacerbated by the withdrawal of soviet aid and technicians after the break in relations between beijing and moscow faced with this economic fiasco mao came under increasing attack within the party leadership from 1961 to 1965 the bureaucracy swung to the right in its economic policies relying heavily on economic incentives to spur production and thus increasing social differentiation particularly in the countryside as a consequence of the failure of the great leap forward mao was forced to share power within the bureaucracy handing over his position as head of state to liu shao chi after a period of apparent peaceful coexistence within the bureaucracy mao launched the misnamed great proletarian cultural revolution of 1966 67 for purposes of his own internal struggle with bureaucratic rivals and ultimately in order to strengthen the bureaucracy itself mao sought to mobilize support outside the party first among the student youth and later elements of the lumpen proletariat and poor peasants who were organized in the so called red guards the reactionary character of this movement was most clearly manifested in its open encouragement of peasant individualism the rejection of economic planning and the distribution and sale of supplies intended for the cities virtually all culture and science was denounced as bourgeois scientists artists and intellectuals were ruthlessly repressed while the political doggerel in mao s little red book was raised to the level of an official state religion for its part the proletariat maintained an attitude of hostility to the red guard activities repeatedly fighting off their attempts to seize the factories or take control of cities however this period did see an independent movement of the working class which came into struggle on its own demands challenging the bureaucracy as a whole this included the first mass strikes in china since the 1949 revolution at the end of 1966 and beginning of 1967 dock workers in shanghai launched a stoppage which soon spread to other major ports and was joined by the chinese rail workers radicalized workers in shanghai spontaneously moved to form independent factory committees against the state controlled unions and set up a citywide organization called the headquarters of the revolutionary revolt of the shanghai workers the attitude of the maoist leadership to this eruption of working class struggle exposed their fraudulent claims about the proletarian character of the cultural revolution the bureaucrats denounced the striking workers for succumbing to economism and the chief of the cultural revolution group mao s main mouthpiece during this period issued a stern warning to the shanghai proletariat declaring as workers their main job is to work joining in the revolution is only secondary they must therefore go back to work faced with this movement of the proletariat mao swiftly turned to the army upon which he had firmly based his rule all the while first he claimed that the people s liberation army represented the workers and peasants in uniform and should therefore be the leading force in the cultural revolution under this guise troops were sent into the factories and worksites to suppress strikes and spur productivity ultimately the army was turned against the red guards to suppress the very movement which mao had called forth once mao had achieved his objective the routing of the liu shao chi faction in the bureaucracy the entire movement was swiftly brought to a halt in the wake of the cultural revolution and in the midst of the economic chaos which it had created the maoist leadership carried out another lurch to the right on the international arena this was manifested in the rapprochement with us imperialism with nixon brought to beijing during the us bombing of vietnam and the maoist regime s embracing of reactionary dictatorships including that of pinochet in chile 18 internally mao initiated a similar reconciliation with procapitalist elements inaugurating a line of march which has accelerated continuously since his death in 1976 under the slogan adopted by the deng xiaoping leadership to get rich is glorious today this has reached a point in which virtually all the land collectivized after 1949 has been restored to private ownership restrictions on private ownership of industry have been largely dismantled and the massive penetration of foreign capital has been encouraged in the special economic zones all of this has created levels of social inequality and misery unseen since the overthrow of the kuomintang dictatorship moreover in the treaty under which the british colony of hong kong is to be returned to china in 1997 the stalinist bureaucracy has agreed to maintain capitalist property relations under the formula one country two systems in other words the state apparatus controlled by the chinese stalinists will become the protector of hong kong capitalists against the working class whatever tactical questions divide the bureaucracy today it stands united on the program of capitalist restoration and many within it have taken personal advantage of these policies to enrich themselves through capitalist enterprises this evolution of the regime founded by mao has determined the explosive character of the revolutionary movement which is now emerging in the working class contained within this movement is a social consciousness of the gains of the chinese revolution and a determination to defeat the bureaucracy s attempts to devour these gains with its restorationist program and ever greater accommodation to imperialism 19 in the light of this entire historical experience it is now possible to fully appreciate the astonishing farsightedness of trotsky s analysis on the basis of the theory of permanent revolution trotsky insisted that the liberation of china from the grip of imperialism the liquidation of the feudal legacy of poverty and backwardness and the reorganization of society on a socialist basis was possible only through the revolutionary mobilization of the peasantry under the leadership of the socialist proletariat moreover the development of china along socialist lines could be achieved only through the victory of the proletariat in the advanced capitalist countries over the imperialist bourgeoisie trotsky insisted that no matter how impressive the successes of mao s peasant armies they could not serve as a substitute for the independent revolutionary mobilization of the working class he warned that without the revival of the revolutionary movement of the chinese proletariat then the peasant war even if fully victorious will inevitably arrive in a blind alley leon trotsky on china p 527 20 in the days following the brutal massacre there have been innumerable reports of divisions and even splits within the bureaucracy and the military even if this is the case the chinese workers cannot base their struggle on the divisions and maneuvers within the ruling caste but only on their own independent strength they must take advantage of these divisions to advance their own independent program of political revolution this requires the building of a new revolutionary party of the chinese proletariat the political revolution is not the replacement of one bureaucratic leader with another nor merely the piling up of greater and greater democratic reforms while in china this revolution has begun under slogans demanding democratic rights and an end to corruption even these demands cannot be realized outside of the working class carrying out the forcible revolutionary overthrow of the bureaucracy as a whole and establishing for the first time in china s history genuine independent organs of workers power soviets and on the basis of them a real workers government 21 the events in china today provide the most powerful confirmation of the perspective of political revolution first elaborated by trotsky in the revolution betrayed his monumental analysis of the degeneration of the first workers state in the soviet union he characterized the soviet union as a transitional and inherently unstable society whose subsequent development could proceed along two possible lines either the bureaucracy would pave the way to capitalist restoration opening up the country to imperialist penetration and drawing largely from its own ranks a new class of capitalist exploiters or the working class would defend the gains of the october revolution through the revolutionary overthrow of the stalinist bureaucracy and the re establishment of workers democracy and thereby unify its struggle with that of the international working class in the capitalist countries fighting for the overthrow of world imperialism trotsky characterized this revolution as political and not social because it would not be compelled to overthrow the nationalized property relations and planned economy established by the 1917 revolution but rather depose the bureaucracy and introduce major reforms in the economy for the benefit of the working class this perspective retains its full force in relation to china today the chinese stalinist bureaucracy has already proceeded far down the road of capitalist restoration and therefore the political revolution in china today will have major social implications first and foremost the necessity for the working class and its revolutionary party to expropriate the class of capitalists sponsored by the bureaucracy together with the foreign multinationals which have been allowed to resume the exploitation of chinese labor what remains of china s planned economy must be reorganized from top to bottom to meet the needs not of the privileged bureaucrats and capitalists but those of the masses production must be placed under the control of factory committees freely elected by the workers and the quality and pricing of commodities should be put in the hands of a democratically organized consumers cooperative over the past decade the procapitalist course of the beijing bureaucracy has vitiated many of the social gains made by the 1949 revolution in the countryside this has resulted in the increasing impoverishment of the masses of poor peasants and rural proletariat in order to benefit a nascent rural bourgeoisie which is closely knitted with the ruling strata itself in carrying out the political revolution against the bureaucracy the revolutionary proletariat must mobilize the vast majority of poor peasants and agricultural workers behind it by fighting against the oppression and social stratification which has been fostered in the countryside by the bureaucracy s restorationist policies such a political revolution by the chinese proletariat would create the greatest shock waves of social revolution throughout asia and internationally breaking with the stalinist straitjacket of socialism in one country and linking up its forces with those of the workers of asia and internationally in the common struggle to put an end to imperialism the chinese workers would create the real foundations for developing socialism in china as part of the development of world socialism 22 this perspective of political revolution developed by trotsky in struggle against stalinism has been upheld and defended only by the international committee of the fourth international icfi founded in 1953 to combat the growth of opportunism in the fourth international the international committee has consistently battled against the theories of pabloite revisionism which rejected political revolution insisting on the capacity of the stalinist bureaucracies to reform themselves and even play a revolutionary role on the world arena based on this perspective the pabloite revisionists vilified the chinese trotskyists as refugees from the revolution as they were being brutally repressed by mao whom the pabloites extolled as a great revolutionary leader even as late as 1969 the pabloite leader tariq ali proclaimed that mao s stature as one of the greatest revolutionary leaders of this century is beyond question today the program for which the chinese trotskyists fought is revealed as the only one for the achievement of a socialist china while the policies of maoism have created only capitalist restoration and collaboration with imperialism the events in both china and the soviet union with the open turn of the bureaucracies to capitalist restoration and the upheaval of the masses of workers taking the road of political revolution have discredited the retrograde theories of pabloism and vindicated the icfi s protracted struggle against this opportunist revisionism the chinese events have likewise unmasked all the opportunist charlatans who attempted to declare gorbachev and his procapitalist policies of perestroika and glasnost to represent some road forward for the political revolution confronted with the emergence of a real political revolution during his summit in beijing with deng xiaoping gorbachev could not contain his organic hostility to the revolutionary struggle of the working class against bureaucracy and denounced the demonstrators as hotheads the gorbachev regime has not hesitated to declare its solidarity with the butchers of tiananmen square a statement drafted by gorbachev s politburo and passed unanimously by the bogus soviet congress of people s deputies refused to condemn the killings declaring instead now is not the time for unconsidered hasty conclusions and statements of course the events happening in china are an internal affair of the country gorbachev understands very well that similar upheavals are on the agenda in the soviet union and he is no less prepared than deng xiaoping and li peng to resort to atrocities when the time comes the wave of terror unleashed by the deng xiaoping bureaucracy has not defeated the struggle of the chinese proletariat on the contrary the killings and arrests have only demonstrated the political bankruptcy of the totalitarian bureaucracy as it attempts to defend its privileges and the interests of world imperialism against the movement of the masses the powerful uprising of the workers which has dominated the recent events in china is inseparably bound up with the movement of the working class throughout asia and internationally the chinese workers are being driven onto the road of political revolution against the maoist bureaucracy in beijing as masses of workers in neighboring south korea are waging mighty battles against foreign and native capital and as the proletariat throughout the world is undergoing a profound radicalization expressed above all in the revolt against its traditional stalinist social democratic and trade union bureaucratic leaderships these events above all demonstrate the unpostponable necessity of building a revolutionary party of the chinese russian and eastern european proletariat to overthrow the parasitic stalinist bureaucracies in a political revolution as a decisive component of the world socialist revolution this is the great historic challenge which now confronts the international committee of the fourth international

would match the rba rate cut as they sourced most of their funding from international money markets maybe the risk is that they pass most of it on but not all of it she told daily mail australia on tuesday clearly the treasurer has made some comments encouraging them to do so but there s also the sense it s a commercial decision if we look at what s happened to bank profitability over the last six to 12 months it s come under pressure announcing the rate cut decision reserve bank of australia governor philip lowe noted unemployment had risen to 5 2 per cent in april despite skills shortages in some parts of australia the reserve bank of australia has cut the cash rate for the first time since august 2016 citing rising unemployment and a slowing domestic economy pictured is the rba building in sydney s martin place despite these developments there has been little further inroads into the spare capacity in the labour market of late he said in a statement why the rate cut is bad news while homeowners would be rejoicing at tuesday s interest rate cut it s not a good sign for the economy the reserve bank of australia cuts the cash rate in a bid to stimulate a slowing economy announcing the decision governor philip lowe forecast australia s gross domestic product growing by 2 75 per cent in 2019 and 2020 which is significantly below the annual growth pace of 3 4 per cent reached in the middle of last year he also noted how unemployment had risen in april to 5 2 per cent following two consecutive months of increase economists from jpmorgan and amp capital are expecting the rba to cut the cash rate three more times taking it to a new record low of 0 5 per cent by may 2020 down from 1 25 per cent now were rates to fall much further the rba would have less room to move should there be a global economic shock rates at that level are also close to zero which means the rba would be engaging in quantitative easing which is effectively the printing of more money or the buying of government bonds to stimulate the economy the us federal reserve and the european central bank have already engaged in this practice of boosting the supply of money outside this unorthodox economic management lower interest rates weaken the australian dollar which makes overseas holidays and imported goods more expensive lower interest rates are also bad for retirees who live off their savings advertisement ms auld said a slowing domestic economy made the case for the latest rate cut it s clear that growth in the economy has downshifted over the last couple of quarters she said it s well below potential growth which is one problem australia s gross domestic product in the december quarter slowed sharply to 2 3 per cent dr lowe was expecting growth of 2 75 per cent on average in 2019 and 2020 which is significantly lower than the expansion pace of 2018 unemployment has risen now for two consecutive months dr lowe blamed a trade war between the united states and china australia s biggest trading partner for the rate cut decision without naming the global superpowers the outlook for the global economy remains reasonable although the downside risks stemming from the trade disputes have increased he said australia s inflation rate of 1 3 per cent is also well below the reserve bank s two to three per cent target inflation has softened over the past 12 months and it sort of feels like the best of the labour market is now behind us ms auld said there s more risk from here the unemployment rate goes up rather than down uncertainty about the global economy has also weighed on the reserve bank board s mind one thing that has shifted quite noticeably in the last few weeks is the global backdrop ms auld said global feels like it s on a weaker footing and that s pretty relevant for a small open economy like australia jpmorgan is expecting the reserve bank to cut rates again in august following by two more cuts in february and may which would take the cash rate to 0 5 per cent amp capital shares this view this takes base interest rates to a new record low of 1 25 per cent the anz bank however has already defied treasurer josh frydenberg s call for lenders to match the rba s 25 basis point cut pictured are houses at bellevue hill in sydney s eastern suburbs real estate data group corelogic s head of research tim lawless said the interest rate cut was likely to help the sydney and melbourne housing markets in particular recover from the downturn this follows an easing of lending rules by the australian prudential regulation authority and promised income tax cuts by the re elected coalition government lower mortgage rates as well as renewed confidence following the federal election are likely to see an improvement in housing market activity he said reserve bank of australia governor philip lowe cited rising unemployment and weak economic growth for his decision to cut interest rates to a new record low of 1 25 per cent however mr lawless expected the housing market recovery to be slow even though the australian prudential regulation authority last month scrapped a rule requiring lenders to assess a potential borrower s ability to service a 7 25 per cent home loan rate we aren t expecting a rapid reversal in house price declines due to ongoing tight credit policies and more broadly economic uncertainty as global

rating of the equity market in india said chief investment strategist at in an interview with sanam mirchandani hartnett said he believes india and china are the most attractive equity markets from a long term perspective because they have the largest number of good companies edited excerpts the main drivers of equity markets are always two things interest rates and corporate earnings trade war is secondary in terms of equity markets and is not the driving force the s p 500 has effectively risen from 600 to 3 000 in the last 10 years and the trade war has had no impact if the trade war affects interest rates and earnings only then it becomes important to date the trade war certainly has helped to put downward pressure on interest rates and has helped create a situation where central banks are more dovish in 2019 than they would otherwise be and actually this is a good thing the impact of the trade conflict on corporate earnings is a problem because it has affected the asian export cycle and the manufacturing cycle in the us europe and asia while the impact has been negative but certainly it s not catastrophic investors are right to be worried about trade but our advice has been do not change your portfolio dramatically simply because of trade conflicts the next move by the federal reserve is more likely to be a cut than a hike the question is when at bank of america merrill lynch we believe the cut is more likely to be next year than this year if there is any deterioration in either the american corporate earnings or the unemployment rate the fed may cut rate in 2019 the critical factor to be seen in the us is corporate bond yield because that s what allows the corporations to finance business unless corporate bond yields go up from the current low levels it is very difficult for equity prices to go down people are hedged because the markets certainly in the first four months of the year rose very dramatically while global commodity prices were up 15 20 equities were up 10 15 these are very big gains in four months no one really wants to go short on equity market because at the end of the day people believe that if the market goes down the fed will cut and the us will eventually cut a trade deal with china everyone is nervous and everyone wants to hold on to their profits and as a consequence it pushes people to hedge dramatically the critical thing for me continues to be interest rates the combination of economic growth inflation and the budget all of these things together with the fact that indian interest rates at 7 are much higher than us interest rate of 2 if all of these things make people buy indian debt and if you start to see indian interest rates move lower then yes it is possible that the indian stock market will re rate the stock market in india was at an all time high in january 2008 it was at an all time high in january of 2018 in dollar terms and even today it is at similar levels if the sensex in dollar terms can break out to a new high there is no doubt that international money will be looking to increase weight on india from a longer term perspective india and china are the most attractive equity markets because they have the largest number of good companies and then we have vietnam nigeria and brazil but i think if you were looking for a combination of investor trust in monetary and fiscal policies government policy and the corporate sector then india is always going to be up there in terms of choice for the emerging market investors in july this year the economic expansion in the us will become the longest expansion of all time it is 10 years or more into an economic expansion that said this expansion has been very different it has been very slow and it has been one that has gone hand in hand with lower interest rates coming back to manufacturing it means a lot for japan germany china and it means less for america and that s why the american economy is doing better than others because it is much more reliant on consumption there is a risk of recession without doubt in the next 18 months but i am not sure if that would be led by the manufacturing sector you have got to see the nonmanufacturing sector in the us unless that gets worse i don t think the manufacturing situation would matter much yes the trend will reverse the reason the emerging market equities have underperformed global equities is because em equities have underperformed the us market particularly the us tech you have a situation today where if you look at the market cap of let s say the indian stock exchange in dollar terms and if you look at that on an msci free float basis the market cap of india is roughly about a little less than 500 billion while facebook s market cap is over 500 billion therefore effectively facebook is larger than msci india which is crazy the story is not necessarily true for 2019 because this year probably the tech stocks will outperform but from 2021 22 onwards emerging markets will simply be better because the us market and tech stocks would be off their peaks the other factor that is key for emerging markets is that you need to continue to see people buy emerging market bonds for example the indian 10 year yield is about 7 if that can fall to around 6 or below that is going to be very critical to get people into emerging market equities so lower indian and emerging market interest rates coupled with lower us tech valuations would help emerging markets outperform over the medium term emerging markets is really a stock pickers environment one of the external factors that can be very harmful to both china and india is unanticipated rise in oil prices clearly the situation in iran is tensed going forward a lot will depend on what the iranians do rather than what the americans do the americans are not looking for a significant rise in the oil prices and we have seen president trump a number of times in the past six months intervening in the oil market as of now i am not convinced that oil prices are going to rise to a level which is really negative so far as india and china are concerned gold looks pretty good over the next six to 12 months for the simple reason that the dollar over the next six to 12 months is probably going to head lower in the short term i don t think you need to rush to buy gold but generally i think that gold price will do well over the medium term i wouldn t be surprised if it moves above 1 400 in the next 6 12 months with a costly dollar there is already a renewed enthusiasm for bitcoins it is partly because investors are looking for an alternative to the major currency once the dollar turns lower that will also sort of bleed into gold prices

capex could be 106 million this contribution of the remaining upfront deposit from wheaton and the reduction in up front capex reduces sandspring s financing requirement from 501 million under the 2013 pfs to 272 million a reduction of 229 million or some 54 under the pea base case only the upfront capex will require outside funding exploration success at our sona hill satellite deposit provided the opportunity to re focus the project on gold dor√© which will provide a much simpler operational start up compared to the dual processing stream of leach and flotation modeled in the 2013 pfs with this re scoped plan all of the gold in the initial phase will be produced in dor√© bars instead of a mix of dor√© and gold rich copper concentrates of the total lom gold production some 3 64 million ozs will be produced in dor√© as opposed to 2 9 million ozs in the 2013 pfs munson continued we are continuing to investigate the outsourcing of mining operations and thermal power generation and if we are successful in those investigations and negotiations our up front capex will be further reduced although of course we expect our operating expense to increase to some degree production

significant changes to the profile of the toroparu project that have occurred since the 2013 pfs was issued with the reduction of pre production capex by more than 120 0 million the increase in total gold production and the wheaton pmpa upfront deposit the economics of the re scoped project compare favorably to those of the 2013 pfs even though it is modeled at a gold price that is 100 less per ounce than the 2103 pfs munson noted that under the pea model the project has new project finance metrics he stated the reduction of pre production capex becomes even more significant when coupled with the upfront deposit under the wheaton pmpa based solely on our calculations which we believe are reasonable the wheaton contribution through the remaining upfront deposit to the pre production capex could be 106 million this contribution of the remaining upfront deposit from wheaton and the reduction in up front capex reduces sandspring s financing requirement from 501 million under the 2013 pfs to 272 million a reduction of 229 million or some 54 under the pea base case only the upfront capex will require outside funding exploration success at our sona hill satellite deposit provided the opportunity to re focus the project on gold dor√© which will provide a much simpler operational start up compared to the dual processing stream of leach and flotation modeled in the 2013 pfs with this re scoped plan all of the gold in the initial phase will be produced in dor√© bars instead of a mix of dor√© and gold rich copper concentrates of the total lom gold production some 3 64 million ozs will be produced in dor√© as opposed to 2 9 million ozs in the 2013 pfs munson continued we are continuing to investigate the outsourcing of mining operations and thermal power generation and if we are successful in those investigations and negotiations our up front capex will be further reduced although of course we expect our operating expense to increase to some degree production

includes 40 million of capital investment in the krhp an owner operated 50 mw run of river hydroelectric facility currently at the pre feasibility stage of development under a memorandum of understanding mou with the government of guyana for self generated power the pea indicates that the cost of the krhp can be financed from internally generated cash flows construction of the krhp is scheduled over a 2 5 year period during production years 7 to 9 with partial electricity production commencing in year 9 and full production in year 10 the pea estimates 293 million in operating cost

news national by staff reporter zimbabwe s restive workers hard hit by an unrelenting economic meltdown which has eroded their incomes have petitioned president emmerson mnangagwa pictured to organise an urgent tripartite negotiating forum tnf indaba this week to address the matter or face a crippling nationwide industrial action the ultimatum comes as prices of basic commodities continue to skyrocket almost daily as mnangagwa pleads with citizens to give his government s austerity for posterity measures a chance to turn around the country s economic fortunes but the workers and the general citizenry have dismissed the economic model as only benefiting the elite while suffocating the poor majority progressive teachers union of zimbabwe ptuz secretary general raymond majongwe said an industrial action was imminent as their efforts to engage the government had not yielded any fruitful results since schools opened for the second term early last month zimbabwe congress of trade union zctu president peter mutasa told newsday that after writing to mnangagwa last week highlighting workers plight government had agreed to initiate the dialogue process mutasa said public service labour and social welfare minister sekai nzenza wrote back indicating that two meetings would be held between today and wednesday to map the way forward the zctu general council met on may 23 and decided that the price increases and general decline in standards of living is unacceptable and workers cannot bear it anymore the poor working class which includes formal informal sectors and farmers are most affected many are not able to pay for medical care and are dying in homes many are starving because they are food insecure and the majority of workers are failing to pay school fees and rentals the situation is dire and the deafening silence from government is disturbing mutasa said the general council decided that we write to president mnangagwa highlighting the plight of workers and asking the government to convene an urgent tnf we wrote to him and the minister nzenza responded indicating that there were two meetings set for the 3rd and 5th of june to map the way forward for tnf however the general council was clear that in the event that government and business do not address the problems workers are facing immediately then zctu will call for a general strike we are currently consulting workers on the nature and timing of the strike should there be no quick resolution of the problems mutasa added nzenza was not reachable for comment yesterday apex council secretary general david dzatsunga confirmed the call for an urgent meeting saying previous salary agreements had been overtaken and rendered useless by the free falling economy the situation is no longer bearable negotiating for salary increases in this fast changing economic environment whatever we are doing is being overtaken by the economic downturn seriously there is need for a tripartite negotiation sooner rather than later the austerity which has been introduced by government is affecting workers businesses are charging goods and services in united states dollars but we are not being paid in us dollars it s an untenable situation which cannot just be solved through normal negotiations dzatsunga said amalgamated rural teachers union of zimbabwe artuz president obert masaraure said their members were already on strike we are calling for a three day job action starting monday today and ending on june 5 we are demanding salaries in us dollars or the interbank equivalent the current economic crisis has robbed us of our wages we are earning slave wages we can t feed our families we can t afford health care and we can t even send our children to school this three day job action marks the beginning of a series of protests which we will sustain until we receive a living wage masaraure said majongwe weighed in saying we have been engaging the government but they have not done anything to improve our salaries whether they believe it or not teachers are incapacitated they are 100 incapacitated there is bitterness among our teachers the new waves of price hikes made the situation even worse there is definitely going to be a strike we are still mobilising other teachers unions to avoid confusion as ptuz we cannot do it alone we are now moving towards declaring a strike
the us dollar s recent rise against the peso is raising concerns in colombia over inflation as importing goods from the united states has become more expensive local media on monday said that local markets and analysts are eagerly awaiting the release of the latest inflation figures of national statistics agency dane if the last month s increase of inflation lasts this could affect consumer prices for the middle and upper classes and manufacturing businesses like car factories that import parts from us manufacturing plants the dollar reached a peak of cop3 398 at one point on friday and could exceed the cop3 400 mark after markets in colombia open on tuesday monday was a bank holiday over the past month the peso lost 15 of its value while experts consulted by local media expected the dollar s hike to be temporary the director of national business association director andi bruce macmaster said the volatility between the two countries currencies is the main concern in the import sector we hope the market will stabilize and thus allow to meet budgets execute better investment plans and purchases of imported raw materials which are undoubtedly affected by the high volatility of the exchange rate andi director bruce macmaster via el tiempo according to a survey by citi experts expect the dane to announce an inflation rate of 3 3 compared to june last year this would be 0 2 percentage points higher than 2018 s inflation rate city colombia said in the report cited by economic newspaper portfolio that the effect of devaluation on inflation is a relevant risk but not sufficient to exceed the target range in a stressed scenario of an annual devaluation of 15 and an average exchange rate of 3 630 pesos for the rest of the year the impact of the transfer would not lead to inflation exceeding 4 citi colombia nevertheless the central bank last week suspended its purchases of dollars last week in an attempt to curb the peso drop a global slowdown in economic growth as a consequence of us president donald trump s trade war with china and threats to impose a similar war on mexico is colombia s main risk on the long term the most delicate part is when you think about what will happen to global growth and i think we are going to have an additional three months in which the global economic figures point to that risk of recession therefore it is not so easy to propose that the exchange rate will recover because the first thing we need is to change an issue that is not known if it will change and that is the foreign policy of the united states on trade economist daniel ni√±o via el tiempo

pundits and economic models predict that if nothing changes in the next two years on the economic front donald trump will be re elected in 2020 by a bigger margin than in 2016 to be sure the economy is usually the top priority for voters heading into a presidential election and the u s economy appears on paper to be doing well since trump moved into the white house according to the bureau of economic analysis real gross domestic product gdp increased at an annual rate of 3 2 percent in the first quarter of 2019 real gdp grew by 2 2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the national unemployment rate is at a low 3 8 percent with applications for unemployment benefits having declined to a 49 year low nonetheless while the economy looks strong the economic condition of most americans is anything but rosy and according to a federal reserve s report on the economic well being of u s households in 2018 roughly 40 percent of households would not be able to cover a 400 unexpected expense at the same time the majority of americans think that the economic system benefits mostly the wealthy and want to see the government do something about this situation as such the question is whether democratic presidential candidates have the vision and the boldness to put structural economic reforms on top of their pre election campaign bernie sanders and elizabeth warren have already positioned themselves as the ideas candidates for fixing the economy although wall street democrats will clearly oppose both of them in the absence of a plan to abolish capitalism drastic reforms to make it more equitable are a necessary precondition for the economic well being of the majority of people in the u s reforms that would likely prove to be detrimental to the economic interests of the super rich who are intent on accumulating ever higher amounts of wealth yet it is unclear what sort of reforms deserve top priority in today s u s economy to answer that question we interviewed robert pollin distinguished professor of economics and co director of the political economy research institute at the university of massachusetts amherst c j polychroniou bob the u s economy is said to be booming although democrats attribute this fact to the policies of the obama administration firstly is the u s economy in such a good shape as it appears to be on paper secondly for how long can the democrats go on giving credit to obama for today s signs of a strong economy robert pollin first of all based on the most standard measure of overall economic performance the growth rate of gross domestic product gdp the u s economy has not been booming under trump indeed over the two full years under trump 2017 18 real economic growth adjusted for inflation averaged 2 5 percent per year this is no better than the average for the full eight years since the great recession officially ended in 2010 over the 57 year period prior to the 2008 great recession 1950 2007 u s real economic growth averaged 3 4 percent per year the trump economy obviously hasn t come close to reaching this long term average growth trend it is true that the official unemployment rate is at a historic low at 3 8 percent of the labor force however let s also consider a broader official measure of unemployment coming from the u s labor department one which includes both the underemployed i e people in part time positions but seeking full time work as well as people who have become discouraged from looking for a job due to lack of success by this measure the unemployment rate rises to 7 3 percent if we also add in the roughly 5 million people who have dropped out of the labor market following the great recession that would bring the unemployment rate to 10 3 percent so while labor market conditions are indeed far better now than they were 10 years ago as we were just coming out of the great recession there is still a lot of distress among people trying to get jobs much less good jobs if the average wage had kept up with productivity over this 44 year period the average worker would be earning 49 an hour today the obama administration along with the federal reserve does deserve credit for helping to avoid a total financial collapse in 2008 that could have led to a depression as severe as the 1930s who knows where we would be today if a decade ago the unemployment rate had risen to say 25 percent as it did in the 1930s versus 10 percent during the great recession some democrats seek to generate greater support among voters by focusing on the stagnant wage narrative what are the economics reasons behind stagnant wages and is wage stagnation in itself a winning strategy wage stagnation has been a defining feature of economic reality under neoliberal capitalism for almost 50 years now in the u s and elsewhere the average real wage for non supervisory workers in the u s was about 23 an hour in 1972 that is the wage in 1972 expressed in today s dollars after adjusting for inflation as of 2016 it was about 22 an hour 4 percent lower meanwhile average labor productivity more than doubled between 1972 and 2016 if the average wage had kept up with productivity over this 44 year period the average worker would be earning 49 an hour today in other words the gains from rising productivity have flowed upward primarily to the top 1 percent this is the single most important factor driving the overall rise in u s inequality the basic explanation for wage stagnation is straightforward the loss of bargaining power by workers this is another central feature of neoliberalism workers have lost bargaining power for several interrelated reasons first unions have become historically weak and are therefore unable to give workers the support they need in bargaining in turn part of the reason that unions have been weakened is that corporations have become over time much more aggressive in asserting their power through for example outsourcing production jobs to low wage economies businesses can credibly threaten to their employees if you want a raise then fine we outsource to china this is what former federal reserve chair alan greenspan called the traumatized worker effect back in the mid 1990s this loss of worker strength has in turn led to labor laws that increasingly favor capital over labor including the notorious 2018 supreme court decision in the janus case that prohibits unions from requiring workers to receive fees for negotiating on behalf of the workers should the democrats focus on wage stagnation as an issue absolutely yes wage stagnation has been a major driver alienating working people who traditionally supported the democratic party trump has capitalized on this alienation by blaming immigrants for stealing jobs from u s residents the democrats need to explain the real reasons behind the persistence of wage stagnation and consequent rise of inequality today s progressive youth in the united states have made good jobs a central focus of their political and social demands what would constitute good jobs in a reformed u s economy there are three basic components to a good job good compensation levels including wages and benefits opportunities for advancement within a firm and significant autonomy i e decision making power in the workplace all three features are critical considering the last feature firms that operate with a significant degree of worker self management perform at least as well if not better than traditional top down hierarchical firms according to standard measures such as productivity household debt is once again on the rise after several years of sharp decline due to the recession that followed the 2007 08 financial crisis is this still related to stagnant wages or is it part of a larger story related to the culture of u s consumerism and the outreach of financialization in every aspect of u s economy and society in fact household debt rose sharply as of 2008 to nearly 100 percent of gdp then fell continuously to about 80 percent of gdp through 2016 the increase over the past two years in this ratio has been modest more to the point just before the great recession households were spending over 13 percent of their income to cover their interest and principal payments on their debts now they are spending less than 10 percent in general though the rise of household debt starting in the 1980s was certainly tied to wage stagnation as one major factor working class households took on more debt in an effort to maintain their living standard in the face of wage stagnation but there was a second factor also contributing to the rise of household debt this was at the other end of the income distribution wealthy households borrowed more to engage in speculative financial market activities both factors still operate today the green new deal has the greatest chance of achieving climate stabilization while also expanding job opportunities and improving mass living standards those who oppose a green new deal do so by citing its potentially adverse effects on jobs and growth yet the united nations environment programme sees the green economy as a net generator of jobs adequate wages safe working conditions job security and workers rights a set of conclusions which are also supported by your own individual research work on greening the economy shouldn t this message the economic benefits of a green economy then become central to all democratic presidential candidates campaigns this all depends on specifically what we mean by the green new deal and the specifics here are critical in my view and in my research around this question over the past decade the green new deal means four interrelated things 1 dramatic reductions in carbon dioxide co2 emissions through investing in energy efficiency and clean renewable energy especially solar and wind power co2 emissions should fall to zero by 2050 2 generating millions of good jobs through these clean energy investments 3 steadily ending dependence on fossil fuels as an energy source since burning coal oil and natural gas to produce energy is the single biggest source of all greenhouse gas emissions fossil fuel consumption should be eliminated altogether by no later than 2050 and 4 providing generous just transition support for workers and communities who are currently dependent on the fossil fuel industry for their livelihoods in my view these features of the green new deal should be front and center for any democratic party politician no matter what office they are seeking trump and his republican acolytes are insistent climate deniers given what we know about the science of climate change it is clear that we are courting ecological disaster by not advancing a viable global climate stabilization project as such any politician of any party or persuasion is embracing an immoral position by not supporting the most aggressive climate stabilization program possible the green new deal as i understand the program has the greatest chance of achieving climate stabilization while also expanding job opportunities and improving mass living standards in your view what other economic issues ought to be on top of the list for democratic presidential candidates the most obvious one is medicare for all enacting a single payer health care system in which everyone has access to good quality care without having to worry about costs i e premiums deductibles co pays and other out of pocket expenses will be transformative to people s lives of course there are other critical policies that must be advanced to create an egalitarian if still capitalist economy that is building a program capable of overturning the hegemony neoliberalism has maintained for 40 years and for thwarting the rise of trump style neofascism these include among others establishing a 15 minimum wage at the national level re writing labor laws so that they support workers right to organize and greatly strengthening financial regulations to weaken financial speculation and strengthen the channeling of investments into productive activities these financial market interventions should include the wall street tax a tax on all financial transactions that will discourage speculation while still generating up to roughly 200 billion a year in revenue stamping out racial and gender discrimination that are still obviously pervasive and reversing the trump administration s draconian treatment of immigrants before you go truthout faces a

china s position on the china us economic and trade consultations the state council information office of the people s republic of china june 2019 contents preface i economic and trade friction provoked by the us damages the interests of both countries and of the wider world ii the us has backtracked on its commitments in the china us economic and trade consultations iii china is committed to credible consultations based on equality and mutual benefit conclusion preface the china us commercial relationship serves as both the ballast and the propeller of the overall bilateral relationship at stake are the fundamental interests of the two peoples and the prosperity and stability of the world since the establishment of diplomatic relations between china and the us bilateral trade and economic relations have come a long way with expanding fields of cooperation at higher levels a mutually beneficial and win win relationship with strong complementarity and interlinked interests has been forged benefiting not only the two countries but also the entire world given the differences in stage of development and economic system it is inevitable that the two countries will experience differences and friction in their commercial cooperation the history of china us trade and economic relations has seen twists and turns and difficult situations by adopting a rational and cooperative attitude the two countries have managed to resolve previous conflicts bridge differences and render the bilateral commercial relationship more mature through dialogue and consultation since it took office in 2017 the new us administration has threatened additional tariffs and other measures and provoked frequent economic and trade friction with its major trading partners in response to the economic and trade friction unilaterally initiated by the us since march 2018 china has had to take forceful measures to defend the interests of the nation and its people at the same time committed to resolving disputes through dialogue and consultation china has engaged in multiple rounds of economic and trade consultations with the us in an effort to stabilize the bilateral commercial relationship china s position has been consistent and clear that cooperation serves the interests of the two countries that conflict can only hurt both and that cooperation is the only correct choice for both sides concerning their differences and frictions on the economic and trade front china is willing to work together with the us to find solutions and to reach a mutually beneficial and win win agreement however cooperation has to be based on principles there are bottom lines in consultations china will not compromise on major issues of principle china does not want a trade war but it is not afraid of one and it will fight one if necessary china s position on this has never changed to provide a comprehensive picture of the china us economic and trade consultations and present china s policy position on these consultations the chinese government hereby issues this white paper i economic and trade friction provoked by the us damages the interests of both countries and of the wider world trumpeting america first the current us administration has adopted a series of unilateral and protectionist measures regularly wielded tariffs as a big stick and coerced other countries into accepting its demands the us has initiated frequent investigations under the long unused sections 201 and 232 against its main trading partners causing disruption to the global economic and trade landscape specifically targeting china in august 2017 it launched a unilateral investigation under section 301 turning a blind eye to china s unremitting efforts and remarkable progress in protecting intellectual property and improving the business environment for foreign investors the us issued a myriad of slanted and negative observations and imposed additional tariffs and investment restrictions on china provoking economic and trade friction between the two countries turning a blind eye to the nature of the economic structure and the stage of development in china and the us as well as the reality of the international industrial division of labor the us insists that china s unfair and non reciprocal trade policies have created a trade deficit in bilateral commercial exchanges that constitutes being taken advantage of leading to unilateral imposition of additional tariffs on china in fact in today s globalized world the chinese and american economies are highly integrated and together constitute an entire industrial chain the two economies are bound in a union that is mutually beneficial and win win in nature equating a trade deficit to being taken advantage of is an error the restrictive measures the us has imposed on china are not good for china or the us and still worse for the rest of the world i the tariff measures the us imposed harm others and are of no benefit to itself the us administration has imposed additional tariffs on chinese goods exported to the us impeding two way trade and investment cooperation and undermining market confidence and economic stability in the two countries and globally the us tariff measures lead to a decrease in the volume of china s export to the us which fell by 9 7 percent year on year in the first four months of 20194 dropping for five months in a row in addition as china has to impose tariffs as a countermeasure to us tariff hikes us exports to china have dropped for eight months in a row5 the uncertainty brought by us china economic and trade friction made companies in both countries more hesitant about investing china s investment in the us continues to fall and the growth rate of us investment in china has also slowed down according to chinese statistics direct investment by chinese companies in the us was us 5 79 billion in 2018 down by 10 percent year on year6 in 2018 paid in us investment in china was us 2 69 billion7 up by only 1 5 percent year on year compared with an increase of 11 percent in 2017 with the outlook for china us trade friction unclear the wto has lowered its forecast for global trade growth in 2019 from 3 7 percent to 2 6 percent8 ii the trade war has not made america great again the tariff measures have not boosted american economic growth instead they have done serious harm to the us economy first the tariff measures have significantly increased production costs for us companies the chinese and us manufacturing sectors are highly dependent on each other many american manufacturers depend on china s raw materials and intermediary goods as it is hard for them to find good alternative suppliers in the short term they will have to bear the costs of the tariff hikes second the tariff measures lead to domestic price hikes in the us the import of value for money consumer goods from china is a key factor behind the long term low inflation in the us after the additional tariffs were imposed the final selling price of chinese products increased leaving american consumers effectively bearing some tariff costs according to research by the us national retail federation the 25 percent additional tariffs on furniture alone will cost the us consumer an additional us 4 6 billion per year9 third the tariff measures have an impact on us economic growth and people s livelihood a joint report by the us chamber of commerce and the rhodium group in march 2019 showed that under the impact of china us economic and trade friction us gdp in 2019 and the next four years could decrease by us 64 91 billion per year about 0 3 0 5 percent of total us gdp if the us imposes 25 percent tariffs on all chinese goods exported to the us us gdp will decrease by us 1 trillion in the next ten years cumulatively10 according to a research report in february 2019 by trade partnership an american think tank if the us imposes 25 percent additional tariffs on all imported chinese goods us gdp will decrease by 1 01 percent with 2 16 million job losses and an additional annual burden of us 2 294 on a family of four11 fourth the tariff measures lead to barriers to us exports to china the 2019 state export report published by the us china business council on may 1 2019 stated that in the ten years from 2009 to 2018 us exports to china supported over 1 1 million jobs the chinese market continues its importance to us economic growth forty eight states of the us have increased their goods exports to china during the last decade 44 of them by double digits while in 2018 when economic and trade friction worsened only 16 states increased their goods exports to china thirty four states exported fewer goods to china with 24 of them seeing a double digit decrease the midwestern agricultural states were hit particularly hard under tariff measures exports of american agricultural produce to china decreased by 33 1 percent year on year including a 50 percent drop in soybeans us businesses are worried that they might lose the chinese market which they have been cultivating for nearly 40 years iii us trade bullying harms the world economic globalization is a firmly established trend of the times beggar thy neighbor unilateralism and protectionism are unpopular the trade protectionist measures taken by the us go against the wto rules damage the multilateral trading system seriously disrupt global industrial chains and supply chains undermine market confidence and pose a serious challenge to global economic recovery and a major threat to the trend of economic globalization first the us measures are undermining the authority of the multilateral trading system the us has launched a series of unilateral investigations including those under sections 201 232 and 301 and imposed tariff measures these are a serious breach of the most fundamental and central wto rules including most favored nation treatment and tariff binding such unilateralist and protectionist actions have harmed the interests of china and other wto members more importantly they have undermined the authority of the wto and its dispute settlement system and exposed the multilateral trading system and international trade order to peril second the us measures threaten global economic growth with the shadow of the international financial crisis still lingering over the global economy the us government has escalated economic and trade friction and hiked additional tariffs provoking corresponding measures by the countries involved this disrupts global economic and trade order dampens world economic recovery and undermines the development of companies and the well being of people in all countries plunging the world economy into the recession trap global economic prospects released by the world bank in january 2019 revised its forecast for global economic growth down further to 2 9 percent citing continuous trade friction as a major downward risk12 the international monetary fund also marked down its projection of world economic growth for 2019 to 3 3 percent from the 2018 estimate of 3 6 percent in its world economic outlook report published in april 2019 suggesting that economic and trade friction could further depress global economic growth and weaken already anemic investment13 third the us moves disrupt global industrial and supply chains china and the us are both key links in global industrial and supply chains given the large volume of intermediary goods and components from other countries in chinese end products exported to the us us tariff hikes will hurt all the multinationals not least those from the us that work with chinese companies the tariff measures artificially drive up the costs of supply chains and undermine their stability and security as a result some businesses are forced to readjust their global supply chains at the expense of optimal resource allocation it is foreseeable that the latest us tariff hikes on china far from resolving issues will only make things worse for all sides china stands firm in opposition recently the us administration imposed long arm jurisdiction and sanctions against huawei and other chinese companies on the fabricated basis of national security to which china is also firmly opposed ii the us has backtracked on its commitments in the china us economic and trade consultations in response to the economic and trade friction started by the us china has been forced to take countermeasures as bilateral trade and investment relations took a hit for the well being of the chinese and american people and the economic development of the two countries both sides deemed it necessary to come to the negotiating table to seek a solution through consultation since they were launched in february 2018 the economic and trade consultations have come a long way with the two sides agreeing on most parts of the deal but the consultations have not been free of setbacks each of them being the result of a us breach of consensus and commitments and backtracking i the first us backtracking china had advocated resolving economic and trade friction through negotiation and consultation from the start in early february 2018 the us government expressed the wish that china send a high level delegation to the us to engage in economic and trade consultation demonstrating great goodwill and positive efforts china held several rounds of high level economic and trade consultations with the us characterized by in depth exchanges of views on trade imbalance among other major issues the two sides made substantial progress as they reached preliminary consensus on expanding china s imports of agricultural and energy products from the us however on march 22 2018 the us government unveiled the so called report on section 301 investigation of china falsely accusing china of ip theft and forced technology transfer and subsequently announced an additional tariff of 25 percent on us 50 billion of chinese exports to the us ii the second us backtracking taking a big picture view of the bilateral relationship the chinese government sent a working team again to the us to engage in genuine consultations on may 19 2018 china and the us issued a joint statement agreeing to refrain from fighting a trade war to continue high level communications and to actively seek solutions to respective economic and trade concerns the us publicly announced that it would suspend the plan for additional tariffs on chinese goods on may 29 2018 despite the opposition of its domestic business community and the general public the us administration tore up the consensus just ten days after the joint statement gratuitously criticizing china s economic system and trade policy while announcing the resumption of the tariff program starting from early july 2018 in three steps the us imposed additional tariffs of 25 percent on chinese exports worth us 50 billion and additional tariffs of 10 percent on us 200 billion of chinese exports which according to the us would be raised to 25 percent on january 1 2019 in addition the us threatened further tariffs on all remaining chinese exports leading to quick escalation of the economic and trade friction between the two countries in defense of its national dignity and its people s interests china had to respond in kind and raised tariffs on imports worth us 110 billion from the us iii the third us backtracking on november 1 2018 us president donald trump had a telephone conversation with chinese president xi jinping and proposed a summit meeting on december 1 the two presidents had a meeting on the margins of the g20 summit in argentina in accordance with their important consensus on economic and trade issues the two sides agreed to halt new additional tariffs for 90 days to allow for intensive talks geared toward the full elimination of all additional tariffs in the ensuing 90 days the working teams of china and the us held three rounds of high level consultations in beijing and washington d c reaching preliminary consensus on many matters of principle for the china us economic and trade deal on february 25 2019 the us announced the postponement of the additional tariffs scheduled for march 1 on us 200 billion of chinese exports to the us from late march to early april the working teams of the two countries held another three rounds of high level consultations and made substantial progress following numerous rounds of consultations the two countries had agreed on most of the issues regarding the remaining issues the chinese government urged mutual understanding and compromise for solutions to be found but the more the us government is offered the more it wants resorting to intimidation and coercion it persisted with exorbitant demands maintained the additional tariffs imposed since the friction began and insisted on including mandatory requirements concerning china s sovereign affairs in the deal which only served to delay the resolution of remaining differences on may 6 2019 the us irresponsibly accused china of backtracking on its position to shift the blame for the inconclusive talks onto china despite china s fierce opposition the us raised the additional tariffs on us 200 billion of chinese exports to the us from 10 percent to 25 percent which represented a serious setback to the economic and trade consultations on may 13 the us announced that it had launched procedures to slap additional tariffs on remaining chinese goods which are worth around us 300 billion these acts contradicted the agreement reached by the two presidents to ease friction through consultation and the expectations of people around the world casting a shadow over the bilateral economic and trade consultations and world economic growth in defense of its own interests china had to take tariff measures in response iv the us government should bear the sole and entire responsibility for this severe setback to the china us economic and trade consultations the us government accusation of chinese backtracking is totally groundless it is common practice for both sides to make new proposals for adjustments to the text and language in ongoing consultations in the previous more than ten rounds of negotiations the us administration kept changing its demands it is reckless to accuse china of backtracking while the talks are still under way historical experience has proved that any attempt to force a deal through tactics such as smears undermining and maximum pressure will only spoil the cooperative relationship historic opportunities will be missed a civilized country turns to forceful measures only when gentler approaches have failed after the us issued the new tariff threat the international community was widely concerned that china might cancel the consultation visit to the us it kept a close watch on the future direction of the china us trade negotiations bearing in mind the broader interests of trade and economic relations between the two countries china remained cool headed exercised restraint and sent a senior delegation to the us as agreed for the 11th round of economic and trade consultation from may 9 to 10 in doing so china demonstrated the greatest sincerity and a strong sense of responsibility for resolving trade disputes through dialogue in the following candid and constructive discussions the two sides agreed to manage differences and continue consultations china expressed strong opposition to the unilateral tariff increase by the us and stated its firm position that it would have to take necessary countermeasures china emphasized once again that trade deals must be based on equality and mutual benefit china will never compromise on major principles concerning china s core interests one prerequisite for a trade deal is that the us should remove all additional tariffs imposed on chinese exports and china s purchase of us goods should be realistic while ensuring that a proper balance in the text of the agreement is achieved to serve the common interests of both sides iii china is committed to credible consultations based on equality and mutual benefit the chinese government rejects the idea that threats of a trade war and continuous tariff hikes can ever help resolve trade and economic issues guided by a spirit of mutual respect equality and mutual benefit the two countries should push forward consultations based on good faith and credibility in a bid to address issues narrow differences expand common interests and jointly safeguard global economic stability and development i consultations should be based on mutual respect equality and mutual benefit it is only natural for china and the us the two largest economies and trading nations in the world to experience some differences over trade and economic cooperation what truly matters is how to enhance mutual trust promote cooperation and manage differences for the good of the common interests of the two countries and global trade order and in a strenuous effort to push forward the economic and trade consultations china remains committed to resolving issues through dialogue and consultation responding to us concerns with the greatest patience and sincerity properly handling differences while seeking common ground and overcoming obstacles to practical solutions during the consultations in accordance with the principle of mutual respect equality and mutual benefit china s only intention is to reach a mutually acceptable deal mutual respect means that each side should respect the other s social institutions economic system development path and rights core interests and major concerns it also means that one side should not cross the other s red lines the right to development cannot be sacrificed still the less can sovereignty be undermined as regards equality and mutual benefit we must ensure that the two sides in the consultations operate on an equal footing that results are mutually beneficial and that any final agreement is a win win one negotiations will get nowhere if one side tries to coerce the other or if only one party will benefit from the outcomes ii consultation involves working toward the same goal in good faith consultation calls for mutual understanding and genuine effort from both sides consultation is a process where the parties concerned seek consensus or make compromise through discussion many factors are at play in consultation it is perfectly normal during consultations for the parties to react differently to various changes at different stages based on their own interests the chinese government believes that economic and trade consultation is an effective way to solve issues none other than engagement with goodwill and a full understanding of the other s position can contribute to success otherwise it will be hard to reach a sustainable and enforceable deal as the parties will not find the ground for a long term and effective agreement good faith is the foundation of consultation the chinese government has engaged in these consultations with the us with the utmost credibility and the greatest sincerity attaching great importance to us concerns china has worked hard to look for effective paths and find ways to address differences the 11 rounds of high level consultations have made significant progress the outcomes of the consultations have not only served the interests of china but also those of the us as a result of both sides efforts to pull in the same direction china has kept its word during the consultations china has emphasized repeatedly that if a trade agreement is reached it will honor its commitments sincerely and faithfully iii china will not give ground on issues of principle every country has its own matters of principle during consultations a country s sovereignty and dignity must be respected and any agreement reached by the two sides must be based on equality and mutual benefit on major issues of principle china will not back down both china and the us should see and recognize their countries differences in national development and in stage of development and respect each other s development path and basic institutions while no one expects to resolve all issues through one single agreement it is necessary to ensure that any agreement will satisfy the needs of both sides and achieve a balance the recent us move to increase tariffs on chinese exports does not help to solve bilateral trade issues china strongly opposes this and has to respond to safeguard its lawful rights and interests china has been consistent and clear on its position that it hopes to resolve issues through dialogue rather than tariff measures china will act rationally in the interests of the chinese people the american people and all other peoples around the world however china will not bow under pressure and will rise to any challenge coming its way china is open to negotiation but will also fight to the end if needed iv no challenge will hold back china s development china s development may not be all smooth sailing difficulties or even perils are inevitable whatever the future might bring china is confident of meeting challenges head on turning risks into opportunities and opening new chapters china remains committed to its own cause no matter how the external environment changes the fundamental solution to economic and trade tensions is to grow stronger through reform and opening up with the enormous demand from the domestic market deeper supply side structural reform will comprehensively enhance the competitiveness of chinese products and companies we still have sufficient room for fiscal and monetary policy maneuvers china can maintain sound momentum for sustainable and healthy economic development and its economic prospects are bright china will continue to deepen reform and opening up china s door will not be closed it will only open even wider president xi jinping announced in his keynote speech at the opening ceremony of the second belt and road forum for international cooperation that china would adopt a number of major reform and opening up measures strengthen institutional and structural arrangements and promote opening up at a higher level measures to be taken include expanding market access for foreign investment in broader areas strengthening international cooperation on intellectual property protection increasing imports of goods and services implementing more effective international coordination on macro economic policies and putting more focus on the implementation of opening up policies a more open china will have more positive interactions with the world which in turn will advance the development and prosperity of both china and the world conclusion cooperation is the only correct choice for china and the us and win win is the only path to a better future as to where the china us economic and trade consultations are heading china is looking forward not backward disputes and conflicts on the trade and economic front at the end of the day need to be solved through dialogue and consultation striking a mutually beneficial and win win agreement serves the interests of china and the us and meets the expectations of the world it is hoped that the us can pull in the same direction with china and in a spirit of mutual respect equality and mutual benefit manage economic and trade differences strengthen trade and economic cooperation and jointly advance china us relations based on coordination cooperation and stability for the well being of both nations and the world 1 in february 2018 the global innovation policy center of the us chamber of commerce published the international intellectual property index 2018 noting that in 2018 china with a score of 19 08 rose to 25th among the 50

exciting new research is making economists and policymakers rethink much of what they thought they knew about fiscal policy the findings are compelling theoretically robust empirically sound and accepted by many of the world s leading economic thinkers no it s not the increasingly popular notion of modern monetary theory the research i am referring to was carried out by jason furman larry summers olivier blanchard and other leading economists it shows that the costs typically associated with an increase in government spending or cuts in taxes don t necessarily apply in a world of low inflation and low interest rates that might sound a bit like modern monetary theory but it fits much better into the world we live in we know that an increase in government spending has consequences if interest rates are anywhere above zero the government s increased demand for goods services workers and capital causes inflation to rise its demand for funds to cover the extra spending means it must sell bonds pushing up interest rates at the same time the central bank is increasing rates to cool the demand driven inflation the value of the local currency then rises making exports more expensive and less attractive than those from other countries of course government spending has benefits too if done well it improves people s lives boosts productivity gives dignity to the vulnerable and produces a more equal harmonious society policymakers must carefully balance these benefits against the costs of increased spending or must they furman summers and blanchard s research shows that in a world of low inflation and low interest rates the costs of increased spending are much less of a constraint a government can lift its spending with little or no impact on inflation interest rates or the exchange rate it can spend more money on worthwhile projects without facing the usual economic costs enter modern monetary theory which pushes these conclusions well beyond theoretical and empirical plausibility economics nobel laureate paul krugman has recounted his struggle to get its advocates to spell out exactly what they re arguing from what i understand the idea is that governments can increase their spending until full employment has been achieved regardless of whether interest rates and inflation are low and that they can finance the extra spending by directing the central bank to print new money there are several problems with this first modern monetary theory looks like a solution in search of a problem if its stated objective is to achieve full employment then it appears unnecessary in australia for example we generally regard an unemployment rate of around 5 per cent as full employment given that there will always be a degree of joblessness because of temporary mismatches of skills and people moving between jobs with unemployment currently at 5 2 per cent it s difficult to argue that such a radical approach is warranted in order to knock 0 2 per cent off the rate achieving an unemployment rate below the current level of full employment would be lovely but that will come with productivity growth rather than by printing money second increasing government spending is sensible if real interest rates are at zero and employment is far from full but if interest rates are higher than zero an increase in spending comes with trade offs higher inflation increased interest rates and an appreciated exchange rate these in turn hurt growth investment consumption and exports the idea that this increase in spending should be financed by printing money is particularly problematic during the global financial crisis when real interest rates were zero the central banks in many countries including the united states purchased government bonds while the government undertook fiscal stimulus to some this may look like modern monetary theory in action the central bank financing government spending but this is coincidence not coordination the us federal reserve bought government bonds when the economy was weak in order to get inflation back up to its 2 per cent target not to do barack obama a favour once inflation and interest rates were rising again it stopped buying bonds it stopped because in a world of above zero interest rates financing government spending by printing money would deliver a triple whammy of inflation inflation from increased government spending inflation from the central bank expanding the money supply and inflation from the central bank abandoning its inflation target since its objective is now financing government spending causing inflation expectations from wage bargainers businesses and consumers to skyrocket as they did in the 1970s modern monetary theory argues that governments can eliminate these consequences particularly all this inflation by raising taxes on their citizens this is too simplistic constantly changing tax rates is a very blunt instrument for controlling inflation to say the least and would much like rampant inflation make the economy a much less desirable place for investment taxes also come with costs taxing labour reduces incentives to work taxing savings reduces incentives to save and taxing investment reduces incentives to invest although these costs can be minimised by making taxes as efficient as possible they shouldn t be ignored and this is to say nothing of the political difficulties of constantly raising taxes on voters but the third and biggest blind spot of modern monetary theory is how it would work in an open economy like australia that trades with the world and relies on foreign savings to finance investment to sustain its standard of living modern monetary theory relies on the assumption that the rest of the world is happy to lend to us in our own currency but as soon as inflation interest rates the exchange rate and our business environment start to deteriorate the world becomes less accommodating in truth modern monetary theory only approaches plausibility if it is undertaken in an economy that is in a state of autarky meaning zero trade or foreign investment and has no private sector indeed this is the sort of economy that modern monetary theory would likely move us towards if it were implemented in australia if none of these arguments convinces you then remember that britain pursued modern monetary theory in the 1970s the consequences were as described above advocates of modern monetary theory might say that britain didn t do it properly but that would be persuasive only if britain were the sole example modern monetary theory is alive and well in venezuela today as it was in zimbabwe in 2008 yugoslavia in 1994 italy in the 1970s hungary in 1946 greece in 1944 weimar germany in 1923 and so on worst of all modern monetary theory is a distraction it is a distraction from the measures suggested by furman summers and blanchard s robust and nuanced research which highlights the circumstances under which worthwhile projects could be funded by an increase in government spending
elizabeth warren announced an agenda tuesday that she calls a plan for economic patriotism warren argues against claims that globalization or automation or a skills gap are causing job losses in the united states she blames instead washington policies to reverse these policies she proposes a new department of economic development that would replace the commerce department subsume other agencies like the small business administration and the patent and trademark office and include research and development programs worker training programs and export and trade authorities like the office of the u s trade representative the new department will have a single goal creating and defending good american jobs warren is stepping into a lively debate over the causes of job losses in the united states her initiative also speaks to a debate in political science about a rough bipartisan consensus on trade and industrial policy that has dominated u s politics for decades and whether this consensus is fracturing advertisement people in washington used to agree on economics up until the very recent past there appeared to be strong bipartisan agreement in washington on three basic principles of economic policy first the best way to ensure economic growth was through free trade and open markets second industrial policy looking to develop specific sectors in the economy or provide specific subsidies to firms was a bad idea and third the united states should act to promote free trade globally and open up economies that remained closed this would benefit u s firms but also the countries being opened up since they would be able to benefit from the economic efficiencies of open trade this consensus reflected a broad body of academic research according to which open trade had general benefits and the actors who wanted to close trade off were motivated by narrow protectionist interests as two scholars of international political economy david lake and jeffry frieden put it advertisement another effect of the establishment of a more or less consensual academic view of trade policy has been its transmission to policymakers observers and other participants today popular policy and journalistic analyses of trade policy issues simply take as given the hard fought arguments and findings of the scholarly community protection responds to interest group pressures economic characteristics of industries and products affect their ability and willingness to organize and receive favorable trade policies organized consumers can mitigate pressures for protection and so on under this consensus opening up trade relations might hurt narrow groups in the economy but consumers would end up better off the united states would benefit from a world trade system that limited everyone s power including the nation s own power to protect domestic markets from international trade prominent economists such as greg mankiw cast scorn on muggles and joe sixpack for focusing on how globalization threatened their livelihoods industrial policy which sought to shape industries was seen as retrograde and likely useless efforts by the government to pick winners when the free market could do a much better job international trade institutions such as the world trade organization wto made it very hard for governments to shape the economy national rules or regulations that were seen as impeding trade risked being targeted by wto rulings or by u s negotiators looking to make bilateral deals with specific countries that consensus has been disrupted advertisement the academic consensus on open trade has become more complicated in recent years economists such as david autor david dorn and gordon hanson find that opening up trade with china led to much bigger job losses than anyone expected other economists such as dani rodrik argued that the global free trade system imposed a straitjacket on national governments limiting their ability to regulate preventing them from protecting specific local values and hampering them from experimenting with industrial policy or other tools rodrik argued that in real life free trade agreements were dominated by special interests such as pharmaceutical companies and banks who were more interested in shaping other countries regulations for their own benefit than in working toward the general benefit he suggests there are other paths toward economic development than simple proposals for open markets however the bigger challenges to the consensus have so far come from politics rather than academic argument donald trump was elected president on a platform of changing the nation s approach to trade trump believed u s trade partners were taking advantage of america s foolish generosity this is why the trump administration has weakened the wto sought to radically remake trade relations with china undone trade deals such as north american free trade agreement and used questionable security arguments to justify limits on steel imports and possible tariffs on trade with mexico trump s preference for trade unilateralism has upset some u s firms and republican members of congress warren s plan is another blow to the consensus advertisement political scientists and economists are trying to figure out whether trump s populist challenge to trade is a sign of broader political changes some scholars argue that economic insecurity makes people more likely to vote for economic populists others such as autor and his colleagues find that increased exposure to trade has led to political polarization in the united states although there is vigorous debate over whether economic insecurity or racial attitudes or some combination best explain trump s support among voters there is another important question whether the united states will revert to its bipartisan free trade orientation in the near future there is significant evidence to suggest it might a majority of americans still see free trade as a good thing stephen chaudoin helen milner and dustin tingley argue that the commitment to free trade is in the united states interest and that even the trump administration will have to recognize this however warren s proposal differs from trump s broad but shallowly anchored antagonism toward trade in some important respects notably her proposals would entail a widespread institutional transformation by merging the u s trade representative s office into a broader department of economic development warren would subordinate trade negotiations to a broader economic development policy this would open up the way to full scale industrial policy warren proposes large scale investments in research and development massively expanded support for exporters and large scale training programs advertisement of course warren is just one contender for the democratic presidential nomination and it is entirely possible her plan will disappear and be forgotten as most politicians plans are however if the plan generates enthusiasm and perhaps similar competing proposals among other democratic contenders it could have important consequences for the once strong bipartisan consensus
new york president donald trump s plan to impose tariffs on mexican exports unless our neighbor does something he hasn t specified what to stop the flow of asylum seekers is almost surely illegal u s trade law gives presidents discretion to impose tariffs for a number of reasons but curbing immigration isn t one of them new york president donald trump s plan to impose tariffs on mexican exports unless our neighbor does something he hasn t specified what to stop the flow of asylum seekers is almost surely illegal u s trade law gives presidents discretion to impose tariffs for a number of reasons but curbing immigration isn t one of them it s also a clear violation of u s international agreements and it will reduce the living standards of most americans destroy many jobs in u s manufacturing and hurt farmers advertising but let s put all of that to one side and talk about the really bad stuff trump says that tariff is a beautiful word indeed but the actual history of u s tariffs isn t pretty and not just because tariffs whatever the tweeter in chief says are in practice taxes on americans not foreigners in fact it s now a good bet trump s tariffs will more than wipe out whatever breaks middle class americans got from the 2017 tax cut the more important fact is that until the 1930s tariff policy was a cesspool of corruption and special interest politics one of the main purposes of the 1934 reciprocal trade agreements act which eventually became the template for the modern world trading system was to drain that particular swamp by removing the capriciousness of previous tariff policy trump s erratic trade actions unconstrained by what we used to think were the legal rules brought the capriciousness back and good old fashioned corruption if it isn t happening already won t be far behind beyond that tariff policy is inextricably linked with the united states role as a global superpower central to that role is the expectation that the u s will be reliable and responsible that it will honor whatever agreements it makes and more broadly that it will make policy with an eye to the effects of its actions on the rest of the world trump is throwing all that away his mexican tariffs violate nafta which was supposed to guarantee free movement of goods within north america and our obligations under the world trade organization which like u s law permits new tariffs only under certain specified conditions so america has become a lawless actor in world markets a tariff policy rogue state but there s more by deploying tariffs as a bludgeon against whatever he doesn t like trump is returning america to the kind of irresponsibility it displayed after world war i irresponsibility that while obviously not the sole or even the main cause of the great depression the rise of fascism and the eventual coming of world war ii helped create the environment for these disasters it is i believe pretty widely known that america turned its back on the world after world war i refusing to join the league of nations slamming the doors shut on most immigration fortunately a few years after my grandparents got here what s less known i suspect is that america also took a sharply protectionist turn long before the infamous 1930 smoot hawley act in early 1921 congress enacted the emergency tariff act soon followed by the fordney mccumber tariff of 1922 these actions more than doubled average tariffs on dutiable imports like trump the advocates of these tariffs claimed they would bring prosperity to all americans they didn t there was indeed a manufacturing boom driven not by tariffs but by new products such as affordable cars and new technologies such as the assembly line farmers however spent the 1920s suffering from low prices for their products and high prices for farm equipment leading to a surge in foreclosures part of the problem was that u s tariffs were met with retaliation even before the depression struck the world was engaged in a gradually escalating trade war making things even worse u s tariffs put our world war i allies in an impossible position we expected them to repay their huge war debts but our tariffs made it impossible for them to earn the dollars they needed to make those payments and the trade war debt nexus created a climate of international distrust and bitterness that contributed to the economic and political crises of the 1930s this experience had a profound effect on u s policy after world war ii which was based on the view that free trade and peace went hand in hand so am i saying trump is repeating the policy errors america made a century ago no this time it s much worse after all while warren harding wasn t a very good president he didn t routinely abrogate international agreements in a fit of pique while america in the 1920s failed to help build international institutions it didn t do a trump and actively try to undermine them and while u s leaders between the wars might have turned a blind eye to the rise of racist dictatorships they generally didn t praise those dictatorships and compare them favorably to democratic regimes there are however enough parallels between u s tariff policy in the 1920s and trumpism today for us to have a pretty good picture of what happens when politicians think tariffs are beautiful and it s ugly paul krugman is a syndicated

donald trump s trade wars with china mexico and europe have sent global investment tumbling according to a world bank report that forecasts worldwide growth this year will slip back to levels not seen since 2016 the washington based lender to developing world countries said in its half yearly global health check that spiralling political uncertainty was to blame for a slowdown in trade and a collapse in investment spending that will push down gdp growth to 2 6 this year before inching up to 2 7 in 2020 the decision by the trump administration to impose higher tariffs on chinese imports and prolonged brexit uncertainty were among a string of events to increase the world bank s policy uncertainty index to a record high the report s gloomy findings were echoed in a speech on tuesday by the us federal reserve chair jerome powell who pledged to take appropriate measures to protect the us economy from the impact of trade wars in what was widely seen as a hint that the fed could cut interest rates in the coming months if the us economy cools powell told a monetary policy conference in chicago that the central bank was closely monitoring the implications of ongoing trade disputes he said we don t know how or when these issues will be resolved as always we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion stock markets tumbled last month as traders began to fear an escalation in washington s tit for tat with beijing over import tariffs oil prices have tumbled and investors have piled into safe haven assets such as gold with prices up 4 on tuesday and german sovereign bonds trump warned mexico last week that it could face higher tariffs on all its exports to the us if it failed to reduce migration washington said a 5 tariff on all goods would be imposed as early as next week and rise to 25 by october manufacturing output across the world has been especially hard hit with surveys showing a sharp decline in growth across most regions in the uk a major survey found manufacturing contracted last month the picture was gloomier still across ireland and continental europe where output slowed at an even faster pace the world bank said emerging economies in asia south america and africa were constrained by sluggish investment and risks are tilted to the downside it said in the report global economic prospects heightened tensions subdued investment that rising trade barriers increased the financial stress on trade dependent economies such as turkey and created sharper than expected slowdowns in major economies especially in europe developing world governments have reacted to the fall in private sector investment by borrowing to fill the gap increasing the risk of financial instability should global growth slow further david malpass the world bank group president said stronger economic growth is essential to reducing poverty and improving living standards current economic momentum remains weak while heightened debt levels and subdued investment growth in developing economies are holding countries back from achieving their potential malpass who was appointed earlier this year to succeed previous president jim yong kim added that developing world countries should hold back on borrowing further funds unless it was for growth and investment it s urgent that countries make significant structural reforms that improve the business climate and attract investment they also need to make debt management and transparency a high priority so that new debt adds to growth and investment sign up to the daily business today email or follow guardian business on twitter at businessdesk some countries expected by the world bank to see an improvement in gdp growth this year have already started to go backwards according to recent figures south africa s economy suffered its worst quarter since the financial crisis the economy shrank at an annual rate of 3 2 in the first three months of 2019 knocking it off course from the 1 1 growth expected by the world bank this year south africa s manufacturing mining and agricultural sectors all shrank in a blow to the newly re elected president cyril ramaphosa agriculture contracted by 13 mining fell 11 while manufacturing decreased by 8 8 year on year australia s economy has also slowed forcing the central bank to reduce interest rates to a record low of 1 25

the reserve bank cut interest rates on tuesday because we aren t spending or pushing up prices at anything like the rate it would like and things are even worse than it might have realised as the board met in martin place in sydney in canberra at 11 30 am the bureau of statistics released details of retail spending in april one month beyond the march quarter figures the bank was using to make its decision they show the dollars spent in shops fell in april slipping 0 1 per cent notwithstanding weakly growing prices and a more strongly growing population the march quarter figures the board was looking at were adjusted for prices they show that the volume of goods and services bought but not the amount paid for them fell in seasonally adjusted terms during the march quarter adjusted for population the volume bought would have fallen further we ll know more today the bureau of statistics will release population adjusted figures as part of the national accounts today the figures for the september quarter show that income and spending per person barely grew the figures for the december quarter show income and spending per person fell a second fall in the march quarter will mean two in a row what some people call a per capita recession gdp per capita growth most recent two quarters annualised australian national accounts even unadjusted for population economic growth is dismal during the september and december quarters the economy grew just 0 3 per cent and 0 2 per cent an annualised rate of just 1 per cent that s well short of the 2 75 per cent the treasury believes we are capable of and the lower than normal 2 25 per cent it has forecast for the year to june gdp growth most recent two quarters annualised australian national accounts we ve been doing it by ourselves as reserve bank governor philip lowe said in announcing the rates decision on tuesday the main domestic uncertainty continues to be the outlook for household consumption which is being affected by a protracted period of low income growth and declining housing prices the bank wants both inflation and employment higher and it wants us to spend more in order to do it lower rates should help although not for everybody mr lowe acknowledged this in a speech to a sydney business audience on tuesday night but he said households paid two dollars in interest for every one dollar of interest they received so while rate cuts hurt savers they benefit borrowers by more and over time should benefit all households by boosting the economy they also drive the dollar lower making australian businesses more competitive this cut will free up an extra a 60 a month for a typical mortgage holder another one will free up a total of 120 it s not much and there s doubt about whether it would do much but interest rates are about the only tool the reserve bank has it is required by its agreement with the government to aim for an inflation rate of between 2 per cent and 3 per cent on average over time treasurer and reserve bank governor statement on the conduct of monetary policy september 19 2016 reserve bank of australia uncomfortably for governor lowe underlying inflation abstracting from unusual moves which are quickly reversed has been below 2 per cent ever since he was appointed governor in late 2016 explaining his push for higher inflation to a business audience in sydney on tuesday night he said that while adherence to the target was intended to be flexible that flexibility was not boundless if inflation stays too low for too long it is possible that inflation expectations move lower that australians come to expect sub 2 per cent inflation on an ongoing basis if this were to happen it would be harder to achieve the medium term inflation goal so we need to guard against this possibility he is also required to aim for full employment he told the business audience that while for some years the bank and others had thought full employment meant an unemployment rate of 5 per cent the absence of inflation at 5 per cent and the persistence of underemployment where people wanted more hours meant it could and should go lower our judgement now is that we can do better than this that we can sustain an unemployment rate of 4 point something he said lower interest rates should help by making it easier for businesses to borrow to expand and giving consumers something in their pockets to buy from them if you don t succeed if that doesn t happen the bank will cut again tuesday s statement as good as said so the board will continue to monitor developments in the labour market closely and adjust monetary policy to support sustainable growth in the economy and the achievement of the inflation target over time tuesday s cut and the next will take the bank into uncharted waters where its so called cash rate what it pays to banks to deposit money with it overnight is close to zero as far as can be discerned it has never been that low in the 100 years the reserve bank has been in operation originally as the commonwealth bank of australia reserve bank cash rate since 1990 reserve bank cash rate since 1990 reserve bank of australia should inflation still not pick up and employment still not fall as far as it believes it could it will have to effectively cut its cash rate below zero forcing cash into the hands of banks by aggressively buying government bonds giving them little choice but to lend it to households and businesses in a process known as quantitative easing it has been done in the united states europe the united kingdom and japan and is by now anything but unconventional governor lowe would prefer the government to pull its weight by cutting tax and boosting spending especially on infrastructure and by policies that make australia more productive he said so on tuesday night the best approach to delivering lower unemployment and a stronger economy is through structural policies that support firms expanding investing innovating and employing people as we ease monetary policy it is in the country s interest that other policy options are considered too frydenberg s biggest concern treasurer josh frydenberg gets it he pointed out on tuesday that the yet to be approved tax offsets in the budget will give australians on up to 126 000 a cash bonus of up to 1 080 when they submit this year s tax return far more than the rate cut his biggest concern and the biggest concern of the governor might be that they don t spend it another concern would be that the banks don t pass the rate cut on the anz has said it will only cut mortgage rates by 0 18 points instead of the full 0 25 a decision frydenberg said let down customers westpac has cut by only 0 20 points the national australia and commonwealth banks have passed on the cut in full on tuesday night in sydney governor lowe addressed the question of whether the banks should have passed on the full cut head on my usual practice in answering this question has been to explain that there are a range of other factors that influence mortgage pricing and then say it all depends today though i would like to break with my usual practice and provide a clearer answer and that is yes there has been a substantial reduction in the cost of banks raising funds in wholesale markets average rates on retail deposits have also come down this means that the lower cash rate should be fully passed through into standard variable mortgage rates full pass through would also mean that the economy receives the full benefit of today s policy decision loading the governor is concerned that for their own reasons lenders such as anz and westpac are forcing him to cut rates lower than he should and making an already difficult job harder if he has to cut further he will but with the cash rate at just 1 25 per cent he would dearly love not to have to peter martin is a visiting fellow at the crawford school of public policy australian national university this article originally appeared on the conversation
some years ago i was a panel speaker at an event in sydney covering the topic of wage developments i shared the podium with a young woman who was something like nsw youth of the year it was at a time that employer groups were lobbying the conservative government to abandon penalty rates for workers in low wage industries hospitality tourism etc and strip powers from trade unions i spoke about how that agenda was designed to advance their class interests and fitted squarely with the neoliberal intent to redistribute real income away from workers towards profits the young woman followed and announced that class was dead and that there was no such thing as a worker anymore she said we are all entrepreneurs now prior to that as our national government was privatising our public companies such as qantas and telstra our prime minister announced we are all capitalists now referring to the idiocy of people buying shares in the companies that we collectively owned anyway while they were in public hands the more recent manifestation of this delusion that class is dead and we are all entrepreneurs is the so called gig economy it seems that we now have millions of people first young but increasingly older who think that entrepreneurship is about buying a cheap scooter and tearing around streets delivering pizzas in all weather to earn a few dollars while the companies that employ them or rather contract them walk away with millions these workers sorry entrepreneurs face a bleak future when there are no pizzas being ordered they have no shifts when they are sick they have no pay when they go on holidays they have no pay and when they get old they will have no superannuation sounds like a plan to make someone rich regular readers will know that i will not use services such as uber i wrote about that choice in this blog post why uber is not a progressive development august 16 2016 but the spread of these gig economy services is clearly increasing i often wonder when i am walking through city streets and a wave of cheap scooters buzz by with big boxes on the back whether these workers have any thought to their future when they get old or if they get sick there was a recent uk guardian article about uber drivers the uber drivers forced to sleep in parking lots to make a decent living may 8 2019 it was in the context of uber opening its shares to the public which the article noted would turn some millionaires on the board into billionaires the median wage of drivers is us8 55 an hour before taxes while for example the californian minimum wage is us11 per hour and the new york minimum wage is us15 per hour the article noted that some drivers have to drive 70 or 80 hours per week to make a bare living and uber has been increasing its cuts on trips a study from the university of chicago and rice university of the link found that its introduction in a metropolitan area leads to an economically meaningful increase in overall motor vehicle fatalities as drivers manically try to earn more while uber takes more a new york times article covering the uber ipo strike all you want uber won t pay a living wage may 10 2019 concluded that the problem for uber and everyone else is that its very business model excludes a future of fair labor practices a july 2018 report an earnings standard for new york city s app based drivers economic analysis and policy assessment studied the critical public policy challenge facing the city of new york the low pay of app based drivers it concluded that 1 the prevailing app based business model in new york city relies on drivers bearing responsibility for all vehicle capital and operating costs 2 pay for most drivers does not meet this standard a minimum wage of us15 per hour 3 app based drivers in nyc london paris and san francisco are not supplementing their pay from another job by using their otherwise idle cars most drivers are working more than full time and work hours are not flexible 4 the app business model relies upon very short wait times for passengers requesting rides which in turn depends on a large supply of available but idle drivers and vehicles so there is excess supply which ensures pay and conditions will always be driven down 5 forty percent of drivers have incomes so low they qualify for medicaid and another 16 percent have no health insurance 18 percent qualify for federal supplemental nutrition assistance nearly twice the rate for new york city workers overall and while the entrepreneurial dream might give succour to these workers striving to stay poor the reality is that uber is just using these people to establish a network and identity while they work on the technology robots to allow them to run their business using self driving cars whether it succeeds is another matter but for now the workers sorry entrepreneur drivers are the losers it is not just uber though a recent new york times article google s shadow work force temps who outnumber full time employees may 28 2019 gave us some insights into the google labour market it tells us that google s many temps and contractors a shadow work force now outnumbers the company s full time employees the data shows that as at march 2019 google worked with roughly 121 000 temps and contractors around the world compared with 102 000 full time employees google temps are usually employed by outside agencies they make less money have different benefits plans and have no paid vacation time economists claim they are puzzled by the flat wages growth in advanced nations given how low in some countries the unemployment rate has dropped for example germany the us and the uk but in germany the rise of the minijob has eroded the living standards of workers and created a pool of desperate workers in the uk the app based jobs and the zero hour jobs have been on the increase and in the us the same trend and all over really this is neoliberalism at its most advanced a myopic strategy to get as much real income into the hands of the few while the party lasts but there is also a storm brewing the mainstream economists keep claiming that fiscal deficits are undermining the future standards of living of workers an erroneous claim at best what is really going to undermine future material living standards is the degradation of work the lack of skill development the short term push for higher profits at the expense of workers rather than via significant capital investment the low household saving rates combined with high debt exposures and has populations age and dependency ratios rise what sort of old age will these gig economy workers face oh sorry i forgot they will be have a ubi the ubi myth is part of the whole neoliberal charade that we are talking about here like all these uber drivers are being free and creative while the the corporations or their owners pocket huge returns the rise of the gig economy is not about workers becoming freer within capitalism it is being driven by the fact that profits are higher when you can get workers to supply their own capital work for a pittance fund their own vacation period have no job security and have no pension and other entitlements and somehow we have bought the nonsense that these workers are not workers the companies engage them as independent contractors and despite the workers looking like workers operate under direction etc regulative authorities have been reluctant to prosecute and force the companies to recognise the true status of their labour forces a perfect storm is brewing again and this one is probably more endemic and structural than the problems that created the gfc there was a reason in the late c19th that trade unions formed and demands for the welfare state and job protections became a dominant voice we are heading back to that sort of massive exploitation of workers the wheel will turn again the other problem for a researcher is that there is a fairly poor data availability on this growing segment in the labour market the us bureau of labor statistics bls published an interesting article in may 2006 working in a gig economy which gave some sources of available data bls data blurs the gig workers with others we read that gig workers may be included in counts of workers who are part time self employed or hold multiple jobs but these counts also include workers who are not part of the gig workforce gig workers in the us could be in contingent or alternative employment arrangements or both as measured by bls the most recent bls data release for these categories was on june 7 2018 contingent and alternative employment arrangements summary it was accompanied by spotlight on statistics publication september 2018 a look at contingent workers we learn that in may 2017 1 3 8 percent of workers 5 9 million persons held contingent jobs that is those who do not expect their jobs to last or who report that their jobs are temporary 2 in february 2005 the last time the survey was conducted there were 4 1 per cent of workers in contingent work 3 as to the alternative employment arrangements the survey found that in may 2017 there were there were 10 6 million independent contractors 6 9 percent of total employment 2 6 million on call workers 1 7 percent of total employment 1 4 million temporary help agency workers 0 9 percent of total employment and 933 000 workers provided by contract firms 0 6 percent of total employment has the gig economy taken over although the data is less than convincing i examined the trends since 2005 the first list shows the changing proportion of the different types of contingent and alternative arrangement workers over the period of the two surveys the proportions have barely altered as the size of the employed labour force has expanded on the face of it though using this data it is not correct to claim that a higher proportion of jobs are becoming contingent or subject to alternative working arrangements in the us contingent 2005 4 1 per cent 2017 3 8 per cent independent contractors 2005 7 4 per cent 6 9 per cent on call workers 2005 1 76 per cent 1 68 per cent temporary help agency workers 2005 0 87 per cent 0 88 per cent workers provided by contract firms 2005 0 58 per cent 0 61 per cent workers with traditional arrangements 2005 89 1 per cent 89 9 per cent the next list shows the growth in real median weekly earnings for the two categories between february 2005 and may 2017 the evidence is mixed full time independent contractors where the gig economy is likely to be concentrated as fallen sharply over this period 6 8 per cent that group stands out in this dataset contingent full time 10 1 per cent part time 11 1 per cent independent contractors full time 6 7 per cent part time 3 2 per cent on call workers full time 20 4 per cent part time 3 8 per cent temporary help agency workers full time 1 28 per cent part time 7 9 per cent workers provided by contract firms full time 11 7 per cent part time 23 8 per cent all workers full time 7 2 per cent part time 1 5 per cent what about workers preferences the data shows that 1 55 1 per cent of contingent workers in 2017 wanted non contingent work 32 8 per cent were happy as they were 2 only 8 8 per cent of independent contractors preferred traditional arrangements 79 1 per cent were happy as they were 3 44 per cent of on call workers wanted traditional arrangements 43 8 per cent were happy as they were 4 46 4 per cent of temporary help agency workers wanted traditional arrangements 38 5 per cent were happy as they were it may be true that since the last survey may 2017 there has been rapid growth in gig economy jobs we will have to wait until the next data release and hopefully for some better more comprehensive data before we really know a job guarantee would alter the scene dramatically there have been progressives calls for a guaranteed minimum income to be paid to help these precarious workers for example in the uk guardian article june 2 2019 the gig is up america s booming economy is built on hollow promises robert reich writes that gig economy workers will need a guaranteed minimum basic income a subsistence level cushion against earnings downturns he also notes they will need a range of other insurance protections against the precarious nature of their work and he plays the tax the rich or variant card all of this should be financed by higher corporate taxes ideally in proportion to a corporation s use of gig workers whether we want these corporations to pay higher taxes is one thing but such a decision should never be justified or based on some erroneous notion that the government cannot provide services to precarious workers unless the rich pay more taxes that is a baseless conflation and very damaging to the progressive argument just as i oppose robin hood taxes which progressives wheel out because they want the evil global financial markets they hate to pay for their evil in some way i also oppose guaranteed minimum incomes as a solution to precarious conditions in the labour market if we do not like the labour market behaviour low pay low investment in training and skills outsourcing of responsibility for tools provision uber cars lack of security dangerous working conditions lack of entitlements such as sick pay holiday pay and pension provisions etc then as progressives we should not demand the government provide a pittance of ubi and leave the labour market to do its thing we should be working on policy interventions that wipe out the practices we dislike and consider damaging to well being so for example new york has brought in regulations forcing uber to pay workers a living minimum wage uber has stopped recruiting drivers there we should force gig economy employers that hide behind the independent contractor myth to bring all their workers into their employed workforce and subject them to standard entitlements if they don t like it then they can cease to trade we lived just fine before uber came along and we should demand the government introduce a job guarantee which would set all the minimum wage and non wage benefits and wipe out employers who only provided precarious jobs which workers had no choice but to accept if there was a job guarantee that provided meaningful work contributing to society then the workers in contingent or alternative arrangements who were unhappy with their situation could just leave and take a full time or whatever fraction they chose job guarantee job with a socially inclusive wage and other non wage benefits they would know it was secure and provided for their future via superannuation provisions etc conclusion it is hard to get a clear picture on the gig economy from a data perspective there are a lot of anecdotal horror stories but so far the data agencies have not yet caught up with the trends what appears to be the case is that a growing number of workers are becoming trapped in these go nowhere jobs which provide nothing for their future and many of these jobs can be provided and have been by traditional arrangements it is just that the employers don t grab as much profit under these arrangements that is enough for today c copyright 2019 william mitchell all rights reserved

car accidents are relatively common occurrences train wrecks are a little more out of the ordinary to be sure one would be hard pressed however to find many examples of a 15 lane pileup of 435 cars 100 semi trucks three trains and a small army of app rent scooters strangling the center of the capital of the united states of america except of course in the federal budget year after year the federal government passes spending bills so riddled with wasteful spending crony handouts and thoughtless debt accumulation that it s pretty much like a massive car crash so awful to watch that you can t even look away congress is once again considering a massive spending increase that could end up being a near total fiscal wreck dubbed a caps deal it s long past time for congress to take a serious and sober look at america s debt addiction and hit the brakes on out of control spending to avoid further deficit disasters the heritage foundation s blueprint for balance chapter titled the fiscal outlook explains what exactly a fiscal catastrophe looks like and what consequences are in store for all of us involved with the gross national debt in excess of 22 trillion nearly 105 of gross domestic product and mandatory spending like interest on previous debt social security medicare and medicaid consuming 72 of current tax revenue it s easy to think that america s fiscal woes have reached their worst point but that s not true our debt problems are about to get much worse looking at projections by the congressional budget office congress official federal scorekeeper one sees that the federal budget is on a rapid collision course with out of control deficits by 2025 the mere interest payments on the national debt are set to eclipse defense spending for a household this would be the equivalent of incurring credit card bills every month that are the same size as their mortgage payments meanwhile mandatory and entitlement programs are accelerating on auto pilot on course to consume the entirety of government revenue in just over 20 years this would mean that all spending set by congress defense education welfare infrastructure foreign aid tax expenditures and national security would need to be funded solely by deficits or congress would need to raise taxes significantly yet it is not merely a bad outlook by the numbers it s one thing to see the deficit problem as a current budgetary catastrophe but it s another to see it as a roadblock to future success as noted by economists at the mercatus center and others at the international monetary fund high national debt can seriously hamper a country s economic growth with creeping effects that result in a sudden and unpredictable crisis an increase in public debt beyond a certain sustainable threshold is associated with depressed economic growth with effects worsening when researchers factor in high private debt however higher debt also makes the u s a riskier buy for bond markets and interest rates might eventually soar if investors become more wary of the federal government s promise to service the debt left on the current trajectory high debt could very well threaten the ability of the american people to sit in the driver s seat of our economy watch the heritage foundation s panel discussion confronting the national debt the task of steering the federal government toward a sound and sustainable budget is possible only when one understands what exactly is wrong with the current budget and the problems it presents for america s future the heritage foundation s blueprint for balance offers a glimpse of the disaster ridden road to the future paved by fiscally reckless legislation and budgetary abdication but it also provides a panoramic view of the expressway of prosperity that limited and responsible american government could enable indeed with responsible spending fiscal discipline and honest legislation the united states can avoid the costly damages of washington s annual budgetary car wreck and pave the way for economic security and sustainable growth congress should begin this year by passing an actual budget that slows the growth in spending and the debt reforms entitlements and extends the tax cuts of 2017 permanently immediately lawmakers should refuse any caps deal or other spending increase without commensurate spending offsets to avoid doing further damage

from birch gold group this week your news to know rounds up the latest news involving precious metals and the overall economy stories include gold climbs as mexico tariffs show no country is safe gold is the one constant in an age of eroding trust and how vietnam chooses bullion over cashless transactions gold climbs as trump s mexico tariffs show no country is safe after a timid couple of months gold prices are once again trending upwards after news that president trump is planning to impose a 5 tariff on mexican goods citing financial markets troubled by illegal immigration as the reason reports newsmax even before the news global investors had been feeling the tension as trade talks with china went sour translating to a possible retaliation from the asian nation while tariffs on american goods are expected china s blacklist could also involve foreign firms in general heightening the appeal of bullion as a store of value some have also expressed concerns that china will begin massively dumping its share of u s bonds whether due to retaliatory reasons or to boost their deteriorating economy according to sergey raevskiy an analyst at sp angel investors are beginning to accept that the u s china trade standoff could last far longer and have greater implications than some had hoped china s own troubles are merely one piece of a puzzle however as more and more signs suggest that a global economic slowdown is imminent all this helped gold gain 1 7 in may snapping a three month downstream and pulling silver up along with it besides the prospect of added volatility a potential interest rate cut by the federal reserve also bodes extremely well for the precious metals market aside from the classic benefit of lower interest rates a rate cut would also boost gold as investors would largely interpret it as a sign that fed officials are concerned with the economic outlook gold is the one constant in an age of eroding trust in the last quarter of 2018 stocks posted what was likely their worst stretch in a decade small cap stocks fell by more than 20 while large cap equities dropped by 13 5 according to kitco gold gained 8 during the quarter and made a statement as an asset to look for in 2019 to ronald peter stoeferle a fund manager at incrementum ag and one of the co authors of the annual in gold we trust report this is the beginning of a trend where investors trust slowly but surely erodes in an interview with kitco stoeferle explained that this is part of an overarching theme where things like the media and geopolitical alliances come under increased scrutiny stoeferle says that the u s dollar s strength comes as a result of misplaced confidence in the domestic economy in reality u s debt has ballooned to a level higher than the debts of japan and the eurozone combined this weight is bound to be felt sooner rather than later stoeferle believes that the greenback s crumbling is already underway noting that the various flare ups and concerns from the eurozone have done little to bolster interest in the u s dollar as a safe haven this isn t likely to change for the better as the federal reserve s own data suggests a 28 chance of a recession in the u s in 2020 every time the figure climbed as high over the past 30 years a recession followed within two months time stoeferle and his firm are fully braced for this possibility noting that a market shift towards gold could happen at any moment given the right catalyst stoeferle sees 1 360 an ounce as the level that will attract mass buying in the gold market and signal the start of a bull run in vietnam a house can still be paid for with gold bars despite vietnam s economic boom newsmax reports its citizens are not yet sold on the idea of cashless transactions or in some cases even fiat currency as the nation s economy began expanding rapidly vietnamese prime minister nguyen xuan phuc felt the need to acclimatize his people with the idea of bank accounts and digital money the recent example of vietnamese citizen tran van nhan who paid for his 138 000 condo in equal parts with bullion and cash shows that tangible assets are hard to beat regarding his purchase nhan said that buying things with bullion is habitual in vietnam adding that neither party was inclined towards a bank transfer according to newsmax vietnam s citizens know all too well about the importance of wealth storage as the country faced a sky high inflation rate of 28 3 in 2008 economist nguyen tri hieu estimates that the vietnamese hold around 400 tons of gold which is usually stored in a home safe or a similarly secure location despite their central bank s many planned measures to promote a modern payments system it seems the people of vietnam are unlikely to want to let go of their gold any time soon according to standard chartered plc only 4 1 of vietnamese own credit cards while the rest prefer paper currency or bullion for their day to day purchases in the case of nhan a shop owner the paper currency is merely a method of obtaining more gold bullion when asked about his financial strategy nhan reiterated that he opts to purchase gold whenever possible due to

in its most recent financial stability report the federal reserve board of governors tempered a largely positive view of the u s financial system with several concerns about remaining vulnerabilities noticeably absent however were any major concerns over household balance sheets the report held instead that household borrowing has advanced more slowly than economic activity and is largely concentrated among low credit risk borrowers what is more this assessment came just after a historic announcement by the federal reserve in june 2018 that aggregate u s wealth had surpassed the 100 trillion mark for the first time in history this is important progress especially because of the outsized role that deteriorating household balance sheets played in the great recession many narratives have been told for exactly why that recession was as bad as it was but a common plot element is that declining house prices forced highly leveraged households to reduce consumption drastically for example economists atif mian kamalesh rao and amir sufi estimated that for every dollar of housing wealth lost households consumption decreased by 5 to 7 cents while that may not seem like much out of any given dollar the effect quickly becomes massive when added up across all home value losses suffered by all households furthermore using county and zip code level data mian rao and sufi show that this effect differs substantially across regions and that the consumption patterns of poorer areas with high leverage tend to be significantly more sensitive to changes in wealth in other words it is not merely the aggregate changes in wealth that are significant determinants of consumption but also the way that those changes in wealth are distributed across households a decline in house prices that occurs in a poorer area with high leverage is going to have a larger effect dollar for dollar than the same change made to a wealthy area with relatively low debt our data recent research by fed economists kartik athreya jos√© mustre del r√≠o and juan s√°nchez suggests that for individual borrowers financial distress is not a transitory phenomenon but rather a highly persistent one to put it differently while most people never have credit card payments over 120 days delinquent they found that among those who at some point do more than 30 percent spend at least a quarter of their time that way in this article we use a data set prepared for the follow up paper which is currently research in progress entitled the aggregate implications of household financial distress the methodology which is similar to that in mian rao and sufi creates a data set of household balance sheets at the zip code level and examines whether the change since the beginning of the economic recovery in 2010 has been as positive as it seems at the aggregate level zip codes being nothing more than a collection of individuals within certain geographical boundaries are thus used to represent individuals with certain characteristics four components of net wealth are considered total debt housing wealth stocks and bonds in constructing total debt we distribute total household and nonprofit liabilities from the federal flow of funds across zip codes to match the distribution in total debt found in the federal reserve bank of new york equifax consumer credit panel ccp data set housing wealth is measured simply as the median home price by zip code multiplied by the corresponding number of households finally stocks and bonds are found similar to total debt first by taking aggregate financial assets as recorded in the flow of funds then distributing them across zip codes to match the distribution of earnings on interest in the irs statistics of income soi data sets next in addition to these variables on net wealth by zip code we compute a measure of households financial distress at the zip code level specifically we track the percentage of people within a zip code that have reached at least 80 percent of their credit limit that is the maximum balance that they can hold on their bank issued credit cards in total the data that we will use for this article include yearly measures for some 38 977 distinct zip codes there are about 42 000 in the u s of these we have data from 36 944 in each of the three key years 2010 2015 and 2018 on which this analysis will be focused this will allow for a comparison of year over year changes in household balance sheets at the zip code level affording a much more disaggregated perspective than can be provided by national statistics the distribution of wealth growth since 2010 in table 1 the economic recovery since 2010 is divided into two periods based upon the monetary policy that presided over each in the first lasting until 2015 the federal reserve pushed interest rates near zero to stimulate the economy then beginning in december 2015 the federal reserve has been lifting interest rates for each period the table s bottom row displays the national average yearly growth rate for the corresponding category of wealth taken from the federal flow of funds just above that is the corresponding weighted average from our sample which is very close to the flow of funds rate in all cases while both periods saw similarly robust growth in terms of net wealth 7 4 percent for 2010 2015 and 6 2 percent for 2015 2018 the composition of that growth is quite different from 2010 to 2015 financial wealth was the strongest component of growth 6 9 percent and debt accumulation was very low 0 5 percent beginning in 2015 however u s housing wealth posted the largest gains 6 1 percent and brought with it faster debt accumulation as well 2 7 percent should house prices drop again households may find themselves more highly leveraged and vulnerable than they were at the beginning of 2015 the rest of the table shows the dispersion of these growth rates across zip codes in our sample ranked from lowest to highest in each category over the years 2010 2015 for example zip codes at the 90th percentile in terms of debt accumulation saw their debt grow by 6 2 percent annually well above the national average of 0 5 percent annually the dispersion is even wider from 2015 to 2018 similarly during the period 2010 2015 10 percent of zip codes experienced declines in financial distress the share of households that reached at least 80 percent of their credit limit greater than 1 9 percentage points while at the other extreme 10 percent of zip codes experienced increases in financial distress no less than 1 1 percentage points the differences are again more drastic for the period 2015 2018 with the best performing 10 percent of zip codes reducing financial distress by over 1 8 percentage points each year and the worst

zillow federal flow of funds u s census bureau and authors calculations notes zip codes have been divided into percentiles for each variable and period separately for example a zip code in the bottom 10 percent of debt growth may not be in the bottom 10 percent of financial wealth growth and a zip code in the top 10 percent of financial distress growth from 2010 to 2015 may not be in the top 10 percent of financial distress growth from 2015 to 2018 the financial distress columns show the annual percentage point change in the fraction of people in a zip code who have reached at least 80 percent of their total credit limit across all their bank issued credit cards from 2015 to 2018 for example the number of people with financial distress in an average zip code was increasing at a rate equal to 0 5 percent of their population each year the national change for household wealth was constructed from the federal flow of funds category of household and nonprofit real estate a geographic perspective another way of seeing the diversity in households financial stability is by plotting the data geographically figure 1 shows the average yearly change in financial distress between 2010 and 2015 and figure 2 does the same for 2015 and 2018 in figure 2 for example if a zip code s shading is in the category of 1 to 2 percentage points then the percentage of its population in financial distress increased by 3 to 6 percentage points from 2015 to 2018 we also marked only changes that are statistically different than zero which is why much of each map shows no change especially in large rural areas with small populations the national trend is immediately apparent in both maps while financial distress along our measure improved across most of the country from 2010 to 2015 it deteriorated with similar yearly magnitude from 2015 to 2018 at the same time it is equally apparent that this national trend masks a large amount of variation within states and even within counties to give some perspective on these numbers the national weighted average of borrowers reaching at least 80 percent of their credit limit in our sample was 16 5 percent 14 7 percent and 16 1 percent in the years 2010 2015 and 2018 respectively those zip codes in the deepest shade of red then were deteriorating each year by around an eighth or more of the national average compare that to the darkest shade of blue which marks zip codes that were improving each year by around an eighth or more of the national average that so many areas show these two extremes directly adjacent to one another points to how conditions of financial distress can diverge rapidly across neighborhoods this effect is particularly pronounced in major population centers where zip codes parcel out smaller areas of land such that they are impossible to distinguish in the national graphs of figures 1 and 2 consider for example hennepin county in minnesota and within that the city of eden prairie which is composed of three mutually adjacent zip codes 55344 to the east 55346 to the west and 55347 to the south the eastern zip code experienced almost no change in net wealth from 2010 until 2015 but a slight increase in financial distress while the western and southern zip codes experienced sizable increases in net wealth and slight decreases in financial distress over the same period after these changes in 2015 the share of residents in all three zip codes that had used at least 80 percent of their credit limit was nearly identical about 10 6 percent during the period from 2015 until 2018 however the eastern and southern zip codes each experienced increases in financial distress of about 6 percentage points putting them near the national mean of 16 1 percent in 2018 by contrast financial distress in the western zip code remained nearly unchanged over the same time period clearly the recovery experiences of these three zip codes were very different even though all of them are in the same city they share the same community center send their children to the same public high school and have but one mcdonald s restaurant what this distribution suggests about aggregate financial stability given that there has been a wide dispersion in measures of wealth growth across zip codes since 2010 it seems fair to reconsider what the current distribution of households financial conditions means for financial stability if it is the case that growth has been concentrated in the hands of wealthy zip codes with low leverage then the poor and high leverage zip codes that are more affected by wealth shocks may still be vulnerable what s more trends in less affluent groups are masked in nationally aggregated statistics by groups with more wealth imagine an economy with two people one of whom has 1 of wealth and the other 99 imagine further that the poorer individual s wealth drops to nothing the next year while the other s remains unchanged a nationally aggregated statistic will observe 100 of wealth in the first period and 99 in the next which represents a 1 percent decrease in net wealth the poorer individual however experienced a life changing 100 percent decrease given how the top 1 percent in our country has around 40 percent of all wealth this contrived example is not entirely unlike the real world life changing shocks to net wealth at the lowest percentiles may be entirely invisible under near trivial changes at the highest percentiles table 2 divides the zip codes into five groups quintiles in order of increasing average gross income per household and then reports average year over year changes like those of table 1 for each group from 2010 to 2015 for example the poorest group of zip codes made an average of 32 000 in gross income per household and had an average year over year growth rate in net wealth equal to 4 1 percent table 2 variations in balance sheet components and financial distress by income average year over year changes during two phases

statistics of income zillow federal flow of funds u s census bureau and authors calculations notes adjusted gross income is rounded to the nearest thousand financial distress shows the average annual percentage point change in the fraction of people in a zip code who have reached at least 80 percent of their credit limit strikingly since 2015 housing wealth debt and financial distress have all been rising fastest in the poorest zip codes by average gross income it was mentioned earlier that at the national level the rapid accumulation of housing wealth and debt in this period increased the economy s vulnerability to a housing price shock like the one that predated the great recession now it is seen that this change in vulnerability was concentrated among poorer households which makes intuitive sense given that they tend to have a higher percentage of their wealth in their homes and less in financial markets than do wealthier households by contrast housing wealth debt and financial distress all rose the slowest since 2015 for the wealthiest of households signaling that the aggregate growth in stability since 2015 against this type of housing shock may have been concentrated in the hands of those who need it the least for the moment though the strong increases in housing wealth for the lower income zip codes after 2015 have produced some of the largest gains in net wealth for that period which is a very positive thing if house prices remain high this comes as a strong reversal of the trend in the previous period after the end of the recession in 2009 the wealthier households in terms of gross income began to recover faster in terms of net wealth with the highest income group experiencing an average annual growth rate in excess of 8 percent until 2015 for all income groups our measurement of financial distress decreased on average each year from 2010 to 2015 and then increased on average in the years from 2015 to 2018 given that the period from 2015 to 2018 was also marked by federal reserve decisions to raise interest rates this was a relatively expensive time to accumulate debt and therefore an unfortunate period to show this trend in financial distress again the dynamics of financial distress across income groups are interesting while all groups saw distress decrease at approximately the same rate from 2010 to 2015 the increase in financial distress for the period that followed was concentrated in the poorest areas conclusion on almost every aggregate measure the national recovery in household balance sheets since 2010 has been positive even our measure of financial distress which increased nationally from 2015 until 2018 shows a net national decrease when compared against 2010 underneath that rosy narrative of recovery however lies substantial heterogeneity at the level of zip codes and mixed messages on the resiliency of many households to face another recession
l r independent candidate adam bierman newcomer michelle pirone lambros incumbent tim quinn and newcomer mia sacks at a forum at the first baptist church last month the polls are open from 6 a m to 8 p m on tuesday june 4 for the 2019 primary election if you are unsure of your polling location you can look it up on the new jersey voter information website by entering your address in princeton the only contested primary is the princeton council race three progressive democrats are seeking the party s nomination to run for the two seats up for grabs on the council the council term is three years there is no republican primary in past years the gop has sometimes had write in candidates in the primary progressive democrat adam bierman has decided to run as an independent to protest the endorsement process in princeton and will face the winners of the primary in the general election in november incumbent tim quinn will try to survive a challenge in the democratic primary by newcomers mia sacks and michelle pirone lambros who have both waged vigorous campaigns in case you are still undecided following are comments made by the democratic primary candidates at a forum last month the comments have been edited for brevity s sake affordable housing and the witherspoon jackson neighborhood pirone lambros it s important that we find creative solutions when we re building a new development and also new municipal revenue if we can offset residential property taxes because the residential property taxes are pushing working class and middle class people out of all the neighborhoods in princeton we need to find other revenue sources to do that the university is one source that we need to leverage better and the second source is driving the commercial property taxes that help offset residential property taxes when we re doing new development we need to do mix use smart growth projects that provide jobs opportunities and services so we are taking care of our working class and middles class so that we have a diverse mixed population let s have more ability to build duplexes triplexes and also auxiliary housing so that people can earn additional revenue for their homes by having cottages and in law suites that s the only way we re going to be able to hold our population quinn we need to get the zoning right get the zoning to match the reality on the ground we need to get the parking right regarding on street parking we have to get rid of this ridiculous overnight parking ban we have to let people park on the street and we have to reach the right balance of permit parking between businesses and neighbors we also have to do some of the work that i ve been doing on the neighborhood character initiative which is this idea of converting your home into a multi unit owner occupied residence sacks bob hillier along with the witherspoon jackson neighborhood corporation have really phenomenal plans for investing in african american owned businesses in this neighborhood the neighborhood needs to be rezoned for that part of the vibrancy of the neighborhood was that the residents could live and shop and play and commune with one another and that provided the social capital that was that was an economic driver and that has been lost mercer county has offered small business grants and i hope witherspoon jackson will be taking advantage of that governor murphy s focus on high tech and leveraging the example of the google lab on nassau street i would love to see more of that located in the witherspoon jackson as part of the neighborhood character initiative there does need to be a priority on making duplexes and accessory dwelling units available quickly having lived outside of princeton for quite some time i was shocked at how white it is and i think when you live here you you lose track of how it is increasingly less diverse even though the population has grown the african american population has declined we need to look at why coah housing and the legal settlement with fair share housing quinn i think council s focus has been on the best outcome for princeton which it is getting just the right number of affordable units i know that the talking points from the fair share housing center have been that somehow the council s trying to keep out black and brown people by dragging its feet on this i can tell you that that is not true this narrative that we re trying to keep people out is not true i think we want to get it right and land is more valuable in princeton than it is in other communities and there is a scarcity of land in princeton when compared to west windsor or robbinsville or other communities that settled so getting it right is important we are very close to possibly getting an agreement but with fair share housing a lot of times the goalposts are moved and when the goalposts move we are going to move but keep our commitment to doing what s right for princeton to reach a number and sites that welcome people into smart growth walkable communities that are near public transit and near possible employment sources sacks in terms of whether the length of the process reflected on some sort of attempt by the municipality to create a fence around princeton i can understand how people would have that impression from the outside looking in i do think that the length was unfortunate but that s not my sense of it and i think it s now a moot point because we re now at the end of the process and we have to look at what happens going forward what i m most concerned about is what we do next and i think it is counterproductive to have a town in which you say okay people you can live in our town through the coah process but you have to live way out there where you are not seen and heard and we don t have to interact with you and we re not going to shop with you you re welcome to live in our town as long as you re not not integrated into our social network and that is what smart growth is actually building affordable housing so that it s integrated into our town center so that children in particular which is another of my largest concerns are not stigmatized if you live in a complex that s entirely affordable housing children who go to school are labeled as part of an affordable housing complex and i don t think that s ideal i think it s very important to decouple the parking requirement if we just take that one step it will give us much more leeway for building affordable housing in a to a smart growth model pirone lambros i don t believe the mediation process is part of a plan to postpone or not have diversity in town everyone has social justice in mind and the best interest of the residents in mind and having affordable housing be throughout the town with the town having a mixed diverse population what i would like to speak to is the need to leverage these new developments to make sure that we get as much as we can from the developers coming in make 20 percent of units affordable maybe you can also leverage 30 percent for workforce housing i really like the idea because you can have housing for the firefighters for police for nurses for service workers who need to be close by and then the other part 50 percent market rate we can also look at micro units for singles so that we re not adding more classrooms we can look at senior housing for people who want to stay in princeton but downsize and sell their home and stay here we need to look at keeping down our costs as well as building princeton university s payments in lieu of taxes sacks the new council will be negotiating a new pilot with university and i look forward to being involved with that i do think that the best way to secure a deal that s a win win for both sides is not to vilify the other entity and to berate them i think it s to come into it in a positive way and reiterate that we are married as i have said before the university of the town cannot get divorced we both benefit the town would not be the town without the university we d be a boring suburban town the university has given tremendous history and life and intellectual diversity and cultural vibrancy to the town that said they do put a tremendous burden on our services on our roads on on on our staff i do think that there is tremendous amount more that they could do but i think the way to do that is not by making them the enemy it s by working with them in ways that both sides benefit and there are so many possibilities for us to do that in in ways that we benefit and they would benefit google lab i think we should replicate that throughout town i m excited in all the ways we can work with university in particular i ve i have gotten them involved with looking at how they can bring some of their abilities and expertise to the school district with facilities pirone lambros i have a finance and business negotiating background and i can be pretty tenacious there are a lot of new factors now that we need to look at including the firefighters but in general looking at what the centers of profit are at the university and whether or not they are being taxed in addition to that getting a better deal on the voluntary payment the third piece we need to find projects with the university that we can partner with them on a large institution like that wants to see where their money is going and we need to give them an exact accounting for where the money s going if they put their name on it and we partner together who cares what we name it or how much control we have we just need to get these projects done let s use their utilize resources they re doing a business incubator we can also look at best practices in other towns and see what they re doing in boston and providence in terms of voluntary payments so that we can then leverage that too quinn the university is ready to begin negotiations with the town and we expect it will be starting either late this year or possibly early next year we need a clear understanding each side needs a clear understanding of how we benefit each other we need to determine how the payments that were part of the settlement that are going to our most vulnerable homeowners right now how those are going to be folded into the upcoming agreement i see the current agreement as a floor and how far we go up is the issue we need to recognize too that the quality of life of the town is important to the university it helps attract faculty and students we need to welcome the university into the economic life and development of the town the first step is the hotel piece the new hotel and conference center they re not going to build it but we can partner with them to bring someone in who will build it the mercer county budget pirone lambros i m running for princeton council so the first deep dive i would do is looking at the municipal budget and understanding that and looking at the line items as part of my fiscal responsibility i m elected for in terms of the county i think that working together to improve shared services whatever we can do to save money working together and not vilifying the county in order to make it a better working relationship is important in terms of activism to understand and to have a citizen s finance advisory committee type of organization for the county would be something that citizens would have to advocate for it but i think it would be the same as the new council trying to get into the budget of the school district you need to keep those lines of communications between you but you have to keep those lines pretty delineated otherwise everyone is telling everyone else how to do their jobs quinn the most shocking thing to me to come out of the the cfac citizens finance advisory committee analysis of the county was that it was acknowledged at the top that it was an incomplete analysis that was based on partial data they didn t have all the information that they needed and they qualified it at the time this the problem the county needs to be more transparent about its budgeting process and make information available to citizens you can go on to the website of any municipality and find budget information that our citizens could not find on the county budget as far as the percentage that we pay to the county land is worth more in princeton real estate sells for higher prices than it does elsewhere in the county there s an equalization formula that sets the county tax and it s based on property sales and land values so i think we need to work with other municipalities as well and the county on the transparency issues i look at the money that i m sending to the county i d like to think is going to help a kid in trenton or ewing or one of the two dozen kids in princeton who go to mercer county community college every year so i agree that we need to a clear understanding of what we get for our money but we re not getting nothing sacks i totally agree that i would love for our to feel that our taxpayer dollars are going to help kids in trenton unfortunately we don t know because the information that would verify that is not available and what we re asking for the county is to set the same standard of transparent accountable governance for themselves that we set for ourselves in princeton we re not perfect but we have a cfac that has worked really hard in recent years to go over every aspect of our budget and certainly as a candidate i will focus on doing zero based budgeting and looking at every service and seeing if it s truly what the community wants however i also feel as an elected representative it s my responsibility to advocate for you at the county level and it is unfortunate that the initial exchange was played out on the newspaper but what we re asking the county is for an independent auditor to evaluate whether the formula that s being applied to princeton is fair and we also would like i don t think it s unreasonable to ask for timely updated documents that are on the website that are not upside down or illegible are out of date i just don t think that s unreasonable there are people who do this for a living the living these sort of comparative analyses it is not unreasonable that we would ask the county for an audit to provide a full accounting would you support a neighborhood economic development development plan for the witherspoon jackson neighborhood quinn i know that the witherspoon economic development corporation has contracted with a planner and we re going to get that planner together with our new planner who is back in town and who is from princeton we re going to see how we can make this happen you know that i think the last of the businesses to leave was was the barbershop and knowing what barber shops mean to the social life of african american communities i fully support mayor moore s vision and i m already starting to make the connections that are necessary experience matters pirone lambros yes you ve got a lot of development opportunities along the corridor on witherspoon street there are some buildings that need to be invested in the franklin lot is going to be developed into affordable housing but we can leverage that and have additional services we need an urgent care center here we need a laundromat we need food businesses we need a pharmacy this was a black and italian and irish community mid century people had their own businesses every other door was some other restaurant there were gardeners and my family did all kinds of construction they pulled themselves up by the bootstraps and they had retail stores and that s how they they they moved up unfortunately now the black community and the italian community both represent eight percent each of the population in princeton it used to be a lot higher than that we have this this need to have more small businesses we talked about incubators we talked about phil murphy s policy of putting together small business loans for small business start ups we need to attract that investment to princeton that s what we need to do in this municipal government for elected officials that s your job sacks i would just echo everyone s comments i think we all agree the zoning and parking and planning are already very much in the works i think that my responsibility on council is to support your vision i will support your plans and goals and visions for the neighborhood let me know how i can best support you on council i am really excited about what s happening in this neighborhood i think it could be a major economic driver for the whole town and a model for the rest of the state on vacant businesses in town quinn there are number of forces that council has no control over i walk my neighborhood every monday morning walking my dog when recycling out and i imagine that my neighborhood jugtown is not that much different from this neighborhood and other neighborhoods and you can count the number of amazon prime boxes that are being recycled and you can see that there are some forces that the town has no control over but there are other forces that we can the future of downtown or in this case uptown is more an experiential uptown with a focus on public spaces and experiences and not transactions i think it s easy to say what have you done in your two and a half years on council to prevent the flight of of stores from downtown when there are 13 empty storefronts right now in the in the uptown area and it s probably a similar number that were there five years ago and 10 years ago these are retail forces the council can support changing the zoning to allow more uses in those in those in those buildings i personally would love to see woolworth back on nassau street but woolworth isn t coming back sacks we can all wax nostalgic about hulit s shoes and so on part of smart growth is that we start start our discussion with the ability to have those goods and services near to us amazon is the elephant in the room it s it s not going to happen in 6 months we very much need to update our master plan to reflect the consolidated united princeton i proposed the inclusion of a new element to the master plan which would focus on economic development and i think that kind of comprehensive approach is needed none of us really have the answers because it s the big picture there s parking there s the amazon phenomenon there is one thing that is not talked about enough and that is the rents that are being charged the property owners are very upset about the parking rates but i think sometimes that s an attempt to deflect attention from the extraordinary high rates that they charge for rent so let s also be aware of the motivations of people from different sectors of the community to focus attention on certain things pirone lambros if you go to montclair morristown other towns they have amazon too and they re full morristown charges double in rent one of the biggest obstacles is we have too many barriers to entry for new businesses to get started here our permitting processes is onerous and expensive and too time consuming we can fix that that s something in our power and we can fix it quickly we re talking about it at the economic development committee the process is moving slowly and we need to move quicker there needs to be a sense of urgency we can t be dismissive that it is just amazon and the greedy landlords i don t buy that for a minute amazon is everywhere and others towns are thriving we could be thriving we should be thriving we are princeton and we have so much to offer there needs to be more more investment and we need to streamline it s great to put the economic development plan in our master plan but let s get it off the books get off paper and let s get it started let s do what we need to make it happen a separate master plans for the witherspoon jackson neighborhood quinn i would challenge the accuracy of the underlying assumption that the re examination of the master plan is a perfunctory exercise and that it has been rushed through by the members of the master plan subcommittee there were several meetings that were open to the public that were hours long where this was discussed it came to the planning board where there was a robust discussion and community involvement a separate master plan for witherspon jackson i don t know i would have to study the issue a little more i would have to speak with our with our planner to get his thoughts on it i think that before the master plan that we need to get the zoning right a separate element of the master plan for each neighborhood is intriguing to me i d certainly like to see a separate element for my neighborhood but all of this stuff takes time people think that government should be able to maneuver like a speedboat and it actually more maneuvers like a battleship or an aircraft carrier the stakes are high in princeton we have a citizenry that wants to be heard everyone s for rapid change but in princeton the stakes are high with a highly educated community and every neighborhood wants to be heard part of what happened with the school referendum was that they didn t take the time to have real engagement on a basic level it s easy to say yes i support it in concept if it s possible to have neighborhood elements in the master plan but i m not a planner and i don t know the answer to that and i d be leading you down the wrong path if i said yes let s do it sacks i would support that a master plan is a way of translating community goals and aspirations into land use laws and that s exactly where we should be doing it i think the witherspoon jackson neighborhood is the most at risk at the moment so it should be a priority for inclusion in the master plan i think it also provides the most economic potential and it s consistent with my interest in providing an economic action plan that will be an additional element master plan as many other communities have long had we are behind in our master plan the community element master plan if that would have been revised before the referendum we would have been in much better shape if you read the community element of the masterplan it talks about a princeton from 1992 there s not a single sentence in that entire element that reflects the current reality in princeton and the master plan is essentially the body of law that decision makers base their policy on and it s what the planning board makes their decisions based on it is essential that we get it right at a time when princeton is going through a tremendous change the master plan is what will enable the community to have a direct voice in shaping where we grow how we grow who s able to stay and who s able to come pirone lambros the master plan references two princetons our zoning ordinances have two princetons we need to harmonize that the master plan should take into account the witherspoon jackson community because it s different in terms of the economic development do we want to do special improvement districts in terms of stretched resources that s what was my idea about utilizing university experts for doing a 50 year master plan i ll go back to the the parking in terms of the roll out of the parking meters it was not executed properly to say the least and this is a matter of not listening to the stakeholders we re listening to consultants we paid 150 000 for parking meter studies there were also a lot of meetings with the stakeholders with businesses and the result was rolled out i was in those meetings and it was not rolled out the way we discussed i wanted to mention that because when we talked about executing on plans we need to think about the stakeholders i love the idea of working with the communities when we re doing is master plan so that when we roll out we re rolling out to that will really taking into account the stakeholders in a community the municipality s relationship with the princeton public schools sacks i think it should be a very close relationship i understand often and when you re running for municipal office the easy answer is to say well i m not running for school board so i believe that as a municipal official advocating in the same way that i would advocate for you at the county level i believe that advocating at the state level for school funding reform is essential for us here in princeton we are a growing community and we should have the support of the state it s been so unfortunate that we turn against one another rather than coming together and going to trenton and saying this is unacceptable this is this is how it s playing out in our community this pattern of being divided against one another is a very dysfunctional pattern in terms of planning for affordable housing and accommodating that in the schools to say there s a separation of church and state so to speak that would be a totally counterproductive approach pirone lambros with the referendum last year you had a referendum that was based on erroneous information in terms of what the growth was going to be we didn t even have a decision yet on what our affordablee housing obligation would be i know there are quarterly meetings when it comes to the big ticket items a lot more coordination needs to take place we need to move into shared services i don t know why we haven t done it yet there have been years of talk we have analysis paralysis here we could have solved the composting issue earlier if we were talking about shared services earlier valley road a blight it is full of asbestos it need to come down we need come to an agreement why can t we coordinate that we could put a school there and have room for the municipality let s sell borough hall to a private investor who will make it a hotel and a ratable we have underutillization in a town where there is high value and few places to develop quinn i am the first elected official on the council who also was elected to serve on the board of education part of my motivation in running for council was to bridge the gap between the board of education and and council at the time that i was serving on the board while the municipality was consolidating there was a lot of there were a lot of wild statements made about the schools and the school budget and and all the money that was being wasted in the schools and you know i knew it not to be true i knew that the school budget reflected the community values the town is built on education education is a community value that is reflected in our budget and is of the utmost importance to me personally now there are nine people who are elected to the board of education and i respect their role and i want to work collaboratively with them on shared services is moving forward we re hiring a consultant and we don t have the staff to do that study ourselves and we re looking beyond just the public works function we re looking at how we can share services with the schools the time is right and we need the right team in place in order to make it happen sacks michelle and i both had the same idea of using valley road for shared offices between the municipality and the school district so that we would have the recreation department and the facilities department all working together i think if they re all under one roof that will help streamline economic efficiencies and staff efficiencies there were a lot of lessons learned from the referendum i am part of the master plan subcommittee and we ve been meeting regularly with the school board to coordinate plans to discuss what sites are available for affordable housing and what sites are available should there need to be more schools or should we be capitalizing on our existing school spaces and build up there are lots of options but they re being discussed there will be a new facilities director and that is something that was heard by the school board and by the facilities committee and that s going to make a big difference in the final analysis with referendum there was a compromise that was reached and in my personal opinion and involved given the growth of mold in all of the schools in the past few years for us to deny them air conditioning is just unacceptable rent control pirone lambros bring in more revenue advocate for a higher ceiling for the senior tax freeze advocate for property assessment reform in other states there are other solutions quinn we have started discussions about rent control and are looking at other towns in new jersey who are doing that we need to make sure senior are aware of rehabilitation grants that are available to them sacks there is no princeton preference for affordable housing if we could come up with some legislation for senior for renting this would be one creative way we could help people remain in town what services would you cut pirone lambros we need to look at what vehicles we are using how many vehicles we have what we own we need to look at staff positions i ve been looking at the revenue side to see how we can still afford our services we re actually about to increase services because we are about to pay firefighters from speaking to volunteer firefighters we are not doing enough to recruit firefighters when you start using paid firefighters you start to lose volunteers so we are actually going in the wrong direction when it comes to services quinn yes 250 000 of our cable franchise fees has been going straight into tv 30 this was a model when cable television was brand new we ve offered tv 30 an off ramp to municipal funding all of our non statutory groups we ve sent a message that they need to up their fundraising princeton is not alone in terms of losing firefighters this is the result of the loss of the middle class in our town sacks we pay more for services than many other municipalities but my understanding is when we put it to the residents there is never a willingness to cut i would be willing to cut whatever there is a consensus to cut i would be willing to run a town hall where we all put little stickies up on all the services and talk about what we want to cut

recession even in the continent s usual powerhouse germany manufacturing is being hurt by global trade conflicts a slowdown in key export market china britain s looming departure from the european union and fundamental changes in an auto industry the question now is whether the industrial slowdown will drag down the rest of europe s economy spoiling hard earned gains in the jobs market after years of crisis and stagnation manufacturing weakness remains one of the key themes for the euro area said nicola nobile lead eurozone economist for oxford economics data released tuesday underlined the progress the 19 countries that use the euro currency have made in overcoming the debt crisis that broke out in 2010 and was followed by two recessions the economy grew 0 4 in the first quarter over the previous quarter and up 2 2 over the year earlier period the eurozone has now grown now for 24 straight quarters bringing unemployment to 7 6 in april that is the lowest since august 2008 on the eve of the great recession it s down from 12 1 in early 2013 and more than a million people have dropped off the unemployment rolls in the past year retail sales have grown steadily for six years lots of places are doing well unemployment is at just 2 7 in germany s bavaria region while construction firms in saxony in former east germany are turning work down because their order books are full at the same time the eurozone s manufacturing sector was shrinking in may with germany faring worst according to surveys by analytical firm ihs markit that slowdown was apparent in first quarter earnings reports by big corporate names particularly in the auto industry bmw a reliable profit machine for a decade reported an operating loss on its automotive business tire maker continental saw first quarter operating earnings slip 16 even as the company was able to outperform the global market in china the slump in demand for passenger cars in the second half of 2018 continued it said automotive wiring supplier leoni based in nuremberg likewise blamed weak automotive demand from china and increasingly europe as it reported an operating loss a key factor is the tariffs or import taxes that the united states has started to wield aggressively in an effort to reshape its trade relations the u s has imposed new tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of chinese goods and the chinese have responded with tariffs of their own u s president donald trump has put tariffs on steel and aluminum and threatened more on a variety of goods not only from china but also from longtime allies like europe canada and mexico among the biggest threats has been trump s proposal to put tariffs on imported cars the decision has been postponed for six months but remains a painful source of uncertainty andreas rees chief german economist at unicredit says that italy and germany have been exposed to hidden protectionism through more than 160 trade actions from the united states in lower profile areas such as subsidies for u s producers restrictions on doing business with government and licensing and quota restrictions while france has been hit with 143 those countries have imposed retaliatory measures although fewer of them the auto industry has its own troubles that go beyond tariffs such as heavy investment on developing battery powered cars that they will need to meet tough emissions limits in the european union and in china and then there is brexit since britain voted in 2016 to leave the european union its major trade partner uncertainty has been high for companies that don t know whether they will face new tariffs british politicians have been unable to agree on the terms of the exit causing a march deadline to be extended to oct 31 european central bank policymakers who say they don t see a recession coming will grapple with these conflicting signals thursday when they gather in vilnius lithuania to review monetary policy for the eurozone the inflation rate at 1 2 annually in may remains below the ecb s goal of just under 2 low inflation can be good for consumers but it also makes it harder for countries and companies to reduce debt and suggests growth isn t translating quickly enough to higher wages the central bank ended at 2 6 trillion euro 2 9 trillion stimulus program at the end of last year but is having to consider whether the economy needs more support ecb president mario draghi whose term ends in october has said that the bank stands ready to use all its tools if needed the bank could extend the earliest possible date for an interest rate increase from its current promise of not before the end of this year the bank s benchmark for lending to commercial banks is at zero while the rate on deposits the ecb takes from banks is minus 0 4 that unusual negative rate is a penalty aimed at pushing banks to lend the money copyright the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast

on may 29 argentine workers carried out a 24 hour general strike to protest collapsing living standards the closure of factories and destruction of jobs the work stoppage involved key sectors of the working class including teachers and dock and transportation workers as well as steel auto and other industrial workers this was the largest strike to hit the government of president mauricio macri the fifth since 2015 and came on the heels of one called on april 30 economic activity in the city of buenos aires and the suburbs that surround it home to 15 million people one third of argentina s population was nearly paralyzed the strike was also widely observed along the industrial belt that borders the paran√° river in c√≥rdoba rosario and other large urban and industrial centers with its strike call argentina s trade union bureaucracy appeared to signal an end to years of a semi formal truce with the macri administration and a turn toward the peronist electoral campaign of alberto fernandez and cristina fernandez de kirchner for president and vice president in elections set for october the reality however is that the argentine trade unions have facilitated nearly 20 years of attacks on jobs and living standards under both the macri administration and the peronist governments that preceded it current surveys of voters strongly suggest that macri s cambiemos coalition will not be re elected in national elections that will take place this october conditions of economic implosion that have resulted in plummeting living standards and pensions increasing unemployment and attacks on working conditions particularly for the youth have turned the working class and the sections of the petty bourgeoisie against macri s right wing government the may national strike was made to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the historic cordobazo the working class rebellion of may 1969 in the industrial city of c√≥rdoba the c√≥rdoba rebellion and other urban working class rebellions marked the beginning of the end of the bloody ongan√≠a military dictatorship 1966 1970 lacking revolutionary leadership and betrayed by peronism stalinism castroism and morenoism in 1969 argentine workers were not able to go further than ridding the nation of the ongan√≠a regime within seven years a far more repressive fascist military regime was to seize power killing imprisoning and torturing tens of thousands of workers last week s national protest strike and all those that have preceded it under both the corporatist peronist governments of nestor kirchner and cristina fernandez and the current right wing cambiemos administration have taken the form of cynical rituals designed to divert the militancy of the working class under the wing of the trade union apparatus and the ruling class harsh government imposed austerity policies beginning in 2015 and worsened by a debt deal with the international monetary fund have imposed budget cuts in combination with regressive food utility and fuel price increases that exceed the rates of inflation with the purpose of shifting resources from the working class and lower middle classes to the argentine oligarchy and the financial sector nationally and internationally those policies have pushed millions of workers young people and retirees below the poverty line this march a study conducted by the social debt observatory of the argentine catholic university uca revealed the urgency of the situation the report indicated that between 2017 and 2018 multi dimensional poverty using six criteria to measure poverty food health education employment and social security education and housing increased from 26 percent to 31 3 percent of households nearly 13 million people agust√≠n salvia who directed the uca study pointed out to the buenos aires news blog infobae that the study indicates a strong increase in multi dimensional poverty in the context of inflation and economic stagnation in essence behind this increase is the collapse of household incomes due to the fall in wages increasing unemployment and more temporary and part time jobs salvia reported that 20 percent of workers do not have steady formal jobs this social layer nearly 20 percent of the population has been marginalized while it is offered some monetary assistance it is denied effective measures of economic social and human development measures that are absent from the political agenda and debate the uca numbers paint a devastating picture according to the official rate of joblessness more than 9 percent of the labor force is unemployed that is only the tip of the iceberg over 34 percent of workers are underemployed and depend on contingent or temporary jobs particularly young workers up from 33 5 percent in 2017 six million argentines 7 9 percent do not have enough to eat up from 6 2 percent at the end of 2017 another 28 2 percent lack sufficient resources for medical care and medicines up from 26 6 percent the percentage of people living in inadequate housing including shanties crowded tenements or lacking water and sewer services rose to 27 1 percent in 2018 the uca report also raised the alarm in relation to the decay of argentine education children are now denied the right to decent primary and middle schools at the same time hundreds of thousands of students go to school hungry every day the education crisis is not new a 2018 statistical study by education historian r√≥mina de luca reports that since 2012 under the kirchner administrations only 40 percent of seventh grade students complete twelfth grade while this phenomenon is partially offset by a jump in adult school attendance rates of functional illiteracy have increased the most affected is the population of the industrial belt that surrounds buenos aires where the rate of multi dimensional poverty is now 41 1 percent up from 34 9 in 2017 forty one percent of school leavers in greater buenos aires are deemed functionally illiterate the official trade union federations organized no rallies for the may 29 strike in buenos aires there were marches into the city itself from the periphery and confrontations with buenos aires police seeking to block the protests the demonstrators many of whom rallied in downtown buenos aires were organized by pseudo left groups such as the workers left front fit the workers socialist movement mst and trade union dissidents they carried signs denouncing social conditions one of them read macri equals hunger and applauding the green wave of pro abortion activists that had rallied days before these tendencies are proposing the forging of a broad electoral front for the upcoming october elections laying the foundations for the creation of an argentine version of the spanish podemos or greek syriza parties in order to strangle and betray the struggles of the working class workers in argentina are confronting the same reality as workers across the world in venezuela mexico turkey the us and europe joblessness unemployment hunger and the destruction of democratic rights which cannot be resolved with national protest strikes nor with the national reformist programs advanced by the pseudo left in the wake of last week s national strike the class issues that were raised by the cordobazo of 1969 and which are posed today in a far sharper form urgently require building a revolutionary socialist leadership based on the international unity of the struggles of the working class to educate and lead the struggles of the working class to put an end to capitalism and usher in a socialist society toward that goal the central task in argentina and latin america is the building of sections of the international committee of the fourth international

london school of hygiene and tropical medicine uk 2university of exeter uk 3soas university of london uk trade and investment policy strongly influence diet nutrition and risk of non communicable disease but what does this mean in the context of recent global political developments key messages the 2030 agenda for sustainable development identified international trade as a structural driver of sustainable development including identification of the risk posed by international trade to the prevalence of non communicable disease ncd poor diet and nutrition are risk factors for ncds accounting for 40 of annual deaths from ncds trade and investment policy impact diet and nutrition through the food system and by affecting domestic policy and regulatory space relating to nutrition we outline key pathways of this trade nutrition impact on nutrition related ncd risk and consider their implications in the context of an evolving global trade regime non communicable diseases ncds constitute half the global burden of disease 1 and are associated with high health social and economic costs 2 the 2030 agenda for sustainable development adopted in 2015 recognised ncds as a major challenge for sustainable development and identified international trade as an important structural driver 3 trade and investment are associated with potential benefits to health 45 however since the 2008 food crisis which saw a surge in international cereal prices and in the context of the growing global prevalence of obesity the possible harmful impacts of trade on diet and nutrition have gained attention from researchers and policy makers 6 poor diet and nutrition are strongly linked to ncd risk accounting for around 40 of annual deaths from ncds 78 trade and investment agreements and policies influence diet through their impact on local food environments including price availability composition and promotion 9 this impact results from changes relating particularly to the import and export of agricultural and food products foreign direct investment and the effects on domestic policy 610 the evolving international trade regime has taken a recent turn however as seen in the current nationalist rhetoric evident in many countries but signified especially by the uk vote to leave the european union11 and the election of donald trump to the us presidency one of whose first actions was to withdraw the country from the trans pacific partnership agreement the trend of past years towards increasing trade liberalisation may therefore be at an end and with it concerns for nutrition related health problems international politics and changes to global trading relationships pose unpredictability trade is unlikely to contract however and its impact on health will remain critical to analyse we draw on existing literature to discuss three key pathways of the impact of trade and investment on nutrition and ncds and consider the implications of the evolving international trade regime impacts through food imports and exports global markets encourage countries to specialise in particular agricultural and food production for export including cash crops crops grown for profit such as wheat this increases global output of such products 6 countries can use imports to increase access to a greater variety of foods such as tropical fruits during winter this leads to greater homogenisation of food availability 12 the health impacts are dependent largely on the mix of foods healthy and unhealthy a country trades exporting primary produce such as unprocessed fruits and vegetables can negatively impact domestic food consumption if affected farmers might otherwise have grown food for a country s own use the promotion of crop exports can lead to increases in prices in local markets and have detrimental effects on local food security such as quinoa in bolivia13 and teff the staple grain of ethiopia14 several studies suggest however a larger share of land devoted to cash crops improves child nutrition through better incomes for farmers at least when certain conditions are met regarding women s roles in household decision making 1516 for the importing country nutritional impacts largely depend on the nutritional quality of the products imported unfortunately foods with the longest shelf lives and those most easily traded and stored are ultra processed foods those that are generally more energy dense and higher in fats sugars and salt they have a commercial advantage over fresh perishable products and are associated with overweight and obesity and ncds 17 evidence is mixed regarding the impact of food imports on nutrition and ncds a number of studies suggest positive outcomes such as improved dietary quality food security and reductions in underweight in low and middle income countries lmics an analysis of 30 lmics for example found no evidence of significant associations between more tariffs taxes applied to imports and exports and mean body mass index bmi although they did suggest higher tariffs were associated with lower bmi for poorer rural populations 6 while current trade conflicts between the us and china for example are likely to affect overall volume of trade growth 18 it is unlikely that the overall trend including in foodstuffs will be significantly affected or reversed this is further evidenced by the trans pacific partnership proceeding despite us withdrawal thus the patterns of health impact through food import and export will likely remain impacts through foreign direct investment foreign direct investment fdi is controlling ownership in a business in one country by an entity based in another fdi provides opportunities for companies to enter new markets for processed foods advertise and market their products more efficiently and create demand for their products while adapting to local consumer characteristics it is thought that fdi not trade is the preferred method for transnational food and beverage companies such as pepsico and unilever and retailers such as carrefour and kfc to enter new markets 6 several studies have found fdi to be an increasingly important driver of ultra processed food consumption and increases in overweight and obesity particularly in lmics 6 increases in soft drink consumption in mexico after increases in food imports and fdi by us firms following the north american free trade agreement in 1994 have been clearly documented by 2010 mexico had the highest consumption of soft drinks globally 300 l per capita annually 1920 similarly studies have found significant increases in per capita soft drink consumption attributable to removal of fdi restrictions in vietnam and peru 6 the public discourse around globalisation has changed in recent years and trump for example campaigned on an explicit anti globalisation platform in 2017 global fdi dropped by 16 this however was largely because of a decline in fdi in the uk and us while it remained stable in lmics 21 it is mainly in lmics that the fdi diet relationship has been observed likely because high income countries already have high levels of ultra processed foods impacts on policy and regulatory space for tackling nutrition goals the world trade organisation wto is the international body responsible for global trade rules between countries but since the 1990s an increasing number of regional and bilateral trade and investment agreements have been negotiated outside its system see box these new trade and investment agreements have problematic implications for domestic policy making 2223 especially concerning is the inclusion of the investor state dispute settlement mechanism through which companies can directly sue states if governments implement regulation that might lead to reduced profits 24 world trade organisation the world trade organisation wto is an intergovernmental organisation that regulates international trade it was established in 1995 replacing the general agreement on tariffs and trade which began in 1948 the wto deals with regulation on trade in goods services and intellectual property between participating countries by providing a framework for negotiating trade agreements and a dispute resolution process aimed at enforcing participating countries adherence to wto agreements which are signed by representatives of member governments the wto oversees about 60 different agreements which have the status of legal texts some of the most important include agreement on agriculture with three central pillars covering domestic support market access and export subsidies general agreement on trade in services which covers the service sector agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property rights which sets minimum standards for many forms of intellectual property regulation agreement on the application of sanitary and phytosanitary measures which sets constraints on members policies relating to food safety as well as animal and plant health agreement on technical barriers to trade which ensures that technical negotiations standards testing and certification procedures do not cause unnecessary obstacles to trade while the wto is the multilateral organisation governing international trade since the breakdown of the doha round of negotiations in 2008 many high income and some middle income countries have chosen to pursue trade and investment liberalisation through other means including through bilateral investment treaties and increasingly large regional trade and investment agreements such agreements are broader in scope than those negotiated under wto frameworks and often include provisions that go beyond what is included in wto agreements such provisions including in the investor state dispute settlement mechanisms provide processes for greater corporate influence on government policy under these new generation agreements there have been legal challenges to domestic policy affecting tobacco control as well as through wto mechanisms 25 tobacco control shows how trade and investment agreements have been used to increase corporate influence and serves as an example of risks to nutrition policy in 2011 phillip morris asia challenged the australian government s plain tobacco packaging policy based on a foreign investment protection provision in a 1993 bilateral investment treaty between australia and hong kong while the tobacco company failed in its bid to overturn australian tobacco laws 2017 some authors have noted the risk of such foreign investment provisions to nutrition policy 26 the implementation of domestic sugar taxes for example could be threatened by such provisions however wto mechanisms such as the technical barriers to trade committee meetings are also concerning for nutrition policymaking specific trade concerns have been raised at these meetings regarding nutrition labelling initiatives in chile ecuador indonesia peru and thailand 27 questions were asked about the justification of proposed labelling measures their consistency with international standards and the evidence of their effectiveness such developments may weaken nutrition policy initiatives in thailand after several wto member states raised concerns about thai food policy a children should take less message and a traffic light system showing sugar fat salt and energy content was abandoned in favour of a food labelling system preferred by industry 28 such challenges to domestic policy also result in policy chill with regulations less likely to be initiated in countries elsewhere 29 some countries have developed nutrition policy that is compliant with trade commitments ghana s policy to tackle the trade in fatty meat a standard applied to imported and domestic meat is one example 30 another is samoa reversing its 2007 ban on turkey tails a fatty meat as part of its accession to the wto in 2011 and subsequently developing a trade compliant nutrition policy 31 the wto working party overseeing samoa s accession raised two concerns about the ban these related to its effectiveness in tackling diets and ncds and the principle of non discrimination between imported and domestic foods given that many high fat foods were still available for purchase in samoa after removing the ban and acceding to the wto samoa undertook a study of its policy options and in 2016 implemented a nutrition policy compliant with its trade commitments 31 the effects of trade and investment agreements on state regulatory and policy space is less obvious and harder to tackle than other problems and yet it limits governments ability to tackle increasing rates of ncd including in regard to nutrition again much like the direct impact on overall levels of trade or fdi it seems unlikely this trend will dramatically change the progression of the trans pacific partnership agreement certainly suggests so discussion and conclusion tackling the unfolding ncd crisis means tackling trade and investment policy as it plays an important role in shaping diet and nutrition globally while the current trade regime may be evolving into something new analysis of past trade nutrition relationships suggests various impact pathways in particular trade openness appears to have contributed to shifts in dietary patterns and fdi is most strongly associated with increases in obesity and ncds while policymakers can exert control over fdi and transnational food companies by setting standards for processing labelling packaging and retailing large investor companies can be difficult to control after they enter a market with regulation required at many points from processing to packaging advertising and distribution 2232 some commentators have argued that the establishment of large companies constrains domestic policy space for tackling poor nutrition through lobbying and relocation threats 33 domestic nutrition labelling policies have sometimes been influenced by wto concerns however with the types of provisions often included in regional or bilateral trade and investment agreements there is now scope for countries to be sued by corporations for domestic policymaking in regard to nutrition exceptions in some cases negotiated for tackling tobacco control should be extended to nutrition there is however further scope for development of trade policy coherent with nutritional goals with an important role for governments in addition to the scope for countries to develop nutrition policy compliant with trade commitments using import barriers governments can use domestic policies to improve local food environments such as availability and access prices and affordability although dietary quality of foods available also requires consideration 34 given the high burden of malnutrition and ncds globally there is a critical need for further policy initiatives to tackle trade diets and nutrition we may be entering a new era in trade and health a change that will undoubtedly provide opportunities and risks for nutrition and ncds if current trends continue there is likely to be further rises in overweight and obesity and ncds the specifics of current changes are not able to be foreseen however and monitoring and analysis of trade health relationships will remain important as will the public health community s awareness of the role that trade plays in shaping nutrition and rates of ncds despite increasing isolationist rhetoric by some leaders trade will likely continue and will remain fundamental to diets and nutrition it is important that the public health community does not allow this rhetoric to detract attention from the importance of trade for nutrition especially the importance of changes to bilateral trade and investment agreements and away from trading blocs such as brexit and the decline of the wto such changes in fact provide greater imperative for public health community involvement in matters of trade and health footnotes

tayo oke if the united states president donald trump s sentiments and utterances are anything to go by one will have to conclude that all of his predecessors in office have been fools for allowing other countries to take advantage of the us in trade and economic interactions look we build their economy the president claimed of recent in reference to china he said that in total oblivion of the fact that it is the chinese who have been bailing out the us economy for the last decade through the purchase and holding of over a trillion dollar us treasuries government bonds needed to shore up america s manufacturing industry trump would like his electorate to think that in him they have a saviour of american jobs a champion of blue collar workers who would fight to put america first there can be nothing more myopic coming from the leader of the free world a phrase used often prominently by western democratic leaders to massage america s ego in exchange for its nuclear umbrella and a guarantee of free trade past american presidents have been astute enough to understand the potency of the soft power that their leadership of world capitalism gives them it is that even though the us does not get economic parity in many areas of international trade this is ok as long as the rest of the world kow tow to the us strategic vision of the world in other areas it is a delicate balance full of booby traps at times on both sides nonetheless it is what it is unspoken unwritten but glaringly obvious a delicate balance that trump is now busy upending under trump the us has decided to jettison the leader of the free world sobriquet because the sacrifices required to maintain that role are simply too much to bear for the workers or so the president thinks the ongoing trade spat between the us and the chinese telecom giant huawei is emblematic of this shift in focus for america it is an immutable fact that china will soon overtake the us as the largest economy in the world it is an economic dose of reality that grates and irks the neo cons right wing ideologues inside and outside governmental machine in america trump is a willing participant in their chorus of disenchantment of this reality he is even cheerleading their visceral reaction to the impending chinese global economic dominance to them chinese economic expansion may be unstoppable but at least they can use america s current financial leverage globally to clip the wings of the chinese to make life as uncomfortable as possible for them in their march towards the summit of economic power this is effectively the dawn of a new cold economic war in this wise china is being accused of all sorts of economic misdemeanours imaginable currency manipulation price fixing dumping of goods intellectual property theft stifling competition draining developing countries of their natural resources while saddling them with unaffordable debt etc the short response to the above is that yes china is guilty of many of the sins they are alleged to have committed and indeed committing but who says the us or any of its allies in the industrialised west is free of similar sins committed against less powerful nations around the world is it not said that those who live in glass houses should avoid throwing stones if indeed china is exploiting the developing world and stripping them of their resources what has the western world been doing pillaging africa s economic resources for the last two hundred years what is this newfound desire to protect africa s economies from rampaging chinese interest based on anyway is it based on guilt or the fear of losing the continent to chinese influence for the foreseeable future it is within this context that we can best understand the ongoing legal diplomatic tussle involving the us and huawei the us commerce department recently added the company to its entity list which means the us firms will require special permission to engage in business dealings with huawei google is the very latest internet giant to pull out of a deal with china as a result that means huawei will immediately lose access to updates to the android operating system and the next version of its smartphone outside china will also lose access to popular applications and services including the google play store and gmail application a big blow to huawei s bank balance no doubt but it is something that will force them to invent and innovate for alternatives the uk had earlier signed off on letting huawei to help build non core of the country s 5g infrastructure including antennas and other network components despite fears that huawei is a front for the chinese intelligence trump has put pressure on the us allies to desist from doing business with huawei huawei s equipment occupies every step of the network chain between your laptops and phones through to the data centres hosting the content you access according to experts huawei s equipment is especially prominent in the parts of the network closer to the data centres network switches gateways routes and bridges the kit that controls how and where data is sent these core infrastructure devices are said to touch everything traversing the internet and are critical to its functioning based on the foregoing the us and others do have a legitimate concern but it is not one that calls for boycott and killing off a rival huawei s capability for installing surreptitious espionage devices in their system can easily be matched by the us countermeasures in the same terrain as pointed out earlier the us interest in punishing huawei is less about its ability to effectuate security breaches of other countries devices on behalf of the chinese state and more about chipping away at the chinese economic global dominance curtailing it and rendering it less potent than it would otherwise be nigeria is likely to get sucked right into the middle of all this when the us starts instructing us as to which chinese company we should and should not engage with huawei will not be allowed to install the much desired 5g network for us in this country even for free as the us has placed the company on a blacklist with which we are naturally expected to comply in that case a strategic advantage to the us is an economic loss to us america still holds sway on our politics and economic life even though they mainly import a small quantity of oil from us they produce the largest barrels in the world on the other hand the bulk of our imports these days are from you guessed it china 31 5 india 8 1 germany 4 7 the uk 3 8 the netherlands 2 6 and france 2 2 that notwithstanding america is home to the imf and the world bank the institutions we mostly rely on for our finances america also has the military presence in africa that china neither has nor is interested in having it is only a matter of time before nigeria will be made to choose between a badly needed chinese

just when a trade agreement between the united states and china appeared to be in sight negotiators found themselves back at square one the immediate reason for the disruption was china s insistence on a substantially rewritten draft agreement which according to us president donald trump s administration reneges on previously agreed terms but the root cause of china s changes to the draft the reason behind its reluctance to meet us demands lies in a fundamental miscalculation by the trump administration simply put the us has been overplaying its hand the agreement that china rewrote would have obliged the chinese side to legislate some of the changes sought by the us and it was negotiated amid an aggressive us campaign against the chinese telecommunications giant huawei that campaign has included adding the company to america s trade blacklist thereby cutting off its supply of critical technologies and pushing allies to isolate the company as well while such actions will undoubtedly hurt huawei the company can eventually offset its losses by forging ties with other fast growing chinese tech companies for the rest of the world however the trump s administration s attacks on huawei and on china more generally will have far reaching consequences china is too deeply embedded in global supply chains simply to go away alienating the world s leading manufacturer and industrial producer with its consumer market of 1 4 billion people will severely disrupt global value chains and cast a shadow over the entire world economy the trump administration s miscalculations may have resulted partly from acting in haste in the hope of notching a win ahead of next year s presidential election but the us also seems convinced that it is up against a china with a particularly weak hand owing to the risk of a hard landing for its economy that is not the case while china imports relatively little from the us it may have more weapons than its opponent to deploy in this trade war beyond retaliating directly through tariffs on agricultural products and commercial aircraft it could tighten capital controls dump its unparalleled holdings of us treasury debt or allow its currency to depreciate the wave of competitive devaluations triggered by the latter option would destabilize the us dollar as well as the international monetary institutions so far however china has shown considerable restraint for example despite the renminbi s recent depreciation against the us dollar the people s bank of china has expressed its intention to maintain exchange rate stability even if deepening tensions with the us over trade and technology force it to take some short term retaliatory actions china is likely to maintain this restraint for the foreseeable future the reason is simple this moderate approach serves china s own long term interests both directly by supporting continued economic growth and development preserving social stability and protecting state integrity and indirectly by avoiding further costly disruptions to global markets ironically it also will compel china s commitment to the very structural reforms that the us claims to be seeking the trade war has highlighted the risks inherent in maintaining an open economy but rather than slam the door shut on the rest of the world china is attempting to protect the global economy s stability china s leaders do not believe that the trend of capitalist led globalization in which china has been both a leading beneficiary and increasingly a major contributor will be reversed any time soon because the us remains in china s view the world s preeminent defender of the free markets toward which china is moving its deviations from free market orthodoxy and abuses of state power could shake america s own economic foundations and threaten its institutions to be sure china and the us will most likely become increasingly estranged china will develop its own core technologies in order to end its dependence on the us and build up the strategic sectors that will propel its economic development but such technological progress on china s part will in any case require the country to implement structural reforms in particular it will have to protect intellectual property rights and establish more efficient capital markets in order to encourage basic scientific research technological innovation and entrepreneurship recognizing the role of capital markets in promoting technological innovation china will open a science and technology innovation board at the shanghai stock exchange later this month this is not to say that china will close the door on trade negotiations on the contrary the us china trade relationship does have its structural imbalances which china is willing to address but rather than allow the trump administration to push it to increase imports unilaterally an approach that is both naive and reckless china is insisting on resolving the problem in stages the world should support this method with the us in particular relaxing restrictions on exports to china and welcoming chinese investment in the us to many china and the us appear to be falling into the thucydides trap a self fulfilling prophecy in which a hegemon fearing a challenger brings about a war for global dominance but even as the economic contest between the two countries continues this outcome is far from inevitable a lack of mutual political trust has not prevented the us and china from engaging in mutually beneficial commercial collaboration over the last 40 years nor has it hampered the recent surge in cultural educational and other exchanges at a time when the two countries face many common challenges including climate change nuclear threats terrorism poverty and financial market stability one can only hope that the us administration once again shows the vision and wisdom needed to renew such cooperation with china zhang jun is dean of the school of economics
