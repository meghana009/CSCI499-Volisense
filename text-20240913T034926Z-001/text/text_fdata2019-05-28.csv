the minister of finance dr crispus kiyonga last friday presented the 1987 88 budget to the national resistance council the budget has already been hailed by a cross section of ugandans as the best since independence here is the 1987 budget in full state of the economy as found by the national resistance movement when the national resistance movement took over power in january 1986 production in all sectors was very low in the areas of agriculture implements such as hoes ploughs and tractors were in very short supply chemicals and seeds were not available to the population industry was extremely constrained by lack of raw materials and spare parts the roads were in a sorry state of disrepair and there were critical trans port bottlenecks involving trucks and other equipment electricity supply was either constantly breaking down or completely un available some areas in the country particularly the luwero triangle and the west nile region once among the richest in the country were nothing more than wasteland inhabitants having been either killed or displaced by the repressive regimes that came before us this sorry state of affairs was further compounded by the heavy external debt in 1985 debt servicing consumed 55 per cent of exports and in 1986 51 per cent on top of this mr chairman there was a huge money supply in the economy that had been building up since the early 1970s in summary therefore the nrm government found the following problems a severe shortage of supply of basic necessities like soap cloth housing blankets sugar and salt b severe bottlenecks involving shortage of transport badly damaged roads both trunk and feeder malfunctioning power and water supply lack of agricultural inputs unutilized capacity in the industrial plants c disruption of life in most parts of the country leaving behind displaced people orphans and widows d high level of insecurity e huge money supply in the economy f high rate of inflation g very unfavourable balance of payment position all this was happening in a country with substantial human and natural resources with a longer dash ample availability of fertile soils and a favourable climate indeed despite its problems uganda has continued to feed its people without significant resource to food aid this is the country that once had a diversified export base involving coffee cotton tea tobacco and copper but today the only export we can talk of is coffee in the mid 60s not only did uganda manufacture most of its basic requirements but had some surplus for export it is therefore saddening to note that today uganda belongs to the category of the poorest least developed countries in africa recent trends in the economic situation the economy of uganda has not experienced any growth for many years now this gross domestic product figures in 1946 prices indicate that between 1983 and 1985 gross domestic product declined at an average rate of 3 per cent per annum this decline continued in 1985 even though the decline in this year was somewhat less in 1986 the decline was further reduced however in 1985 and 1986 the monetary gross domestic product increased by 2 6 per cent and 0 8 per cent respectively improvement in 1986 was accounted for by substantial improvement in transport electric power forestry and the fishing industries service sectors namely government rents and miscellaneous services also showed substantial growth in 1986 in 1986 however agriculture and the manufacturing sectors registered declines mainly due to the severe shortage of foreign exchange to import raw materials spare parts and in puts in agriculture monetary agriculture which accounts for about 30 per cent of monetary gross domestic product declined by 9 6 percent in the same year mainly due to decline in production of major export crops cotton production for in stance declined from 16 300 tonnes in 1985 to 4 200 tonnes in 1986 and tobacco production fell from 1 600 tonnes to 900 tonnes decline was also experienced in the tea sector between 1985 and 1986 the developing world of which uganda is part is constantly faced with a number of major problems in the international economic scene the first is the currency fluctuations which frequently affect the balance of payments position the second factor is that the debt burden of poor countries increases every day the third factor is the constant fluctuations in prices of their exports in regard to this latter problem mr chairman it is note worthy that over the last months the price of coffee on the world markets has dropped more than one dollar per kilogramme this has considerably depressed our foreign earnings fourthly uganda like all other poor countries spends a large portion of its foreign exchange earnings to import petroleum products mr chairman although such a proportion of our export receipts is spent on the importation of petroleum products we are not protected from the fluctuations of the oil prices on the world market because we have no control over them it is against this background that the nrm government has formulated the recovery programme recovery programme following the takeover of power in january 1986 the national resistance movement immediately formed a broad based government and moved swiftly to re establish law and order all over the country the security situation is now very much improved in most parts of the country in those areas where there are still pockets of trouble the government is quickly getting the situation under control the government has now put in place a public investment programme this programme contains very few new projects most funds will be used for rehabilitation or completing on going projects accordingly emphasis is placed on provision for needs of industrial and agricultural rehabilitation on road rehabilitation and maintenance power generation and transmission and the provision of social infrastructure particularly health services the objective of the programme is to achieve rapid overall economic recovery and set a base for sustained economic development this will entail increasing the volume of the traditional exports and diversification of the export base promotion of efficient import substitution and better utilization of domestic resources recent economic policy announcement consequently on may 15 1987 your excellency mr president you announced a very comprehensive policy package this involved a change in the relationship between the uganda shilling from a factor of uganda shillings 14 to uganda shillings 60 to the united states dollar the producer prices were inert and by a factor of between 3 and 5 times prices for petroleum products were more than doubled the currency was demonetised by a factor of 100 and to assist in reduction of liquidity a conversion tax of 30 per cent on all cash holdings was applied mr chairman the government is quickly taking steps to build on these positive developments in the area of transport a number of trucks pick ups and buses have already been imported and many more are on order funds to finance reconstruction of the main trunk roads have al ready been secured these roads include 1 kampala mityana 2 mityana fort portal 3 jinja kampala 4 iganga jinja 5 kampala entebbe 6 katonga kabale through masaka and mbarara 7 katuna kabale 8 mbarara ishaka 9 ishaka katunguru 10 kampala wobulenzi 11 pakwach arua 12 masindi apac lira kitgum on top of these government has made arrangements for the reopening of feeder roads all over the country following the meetings we attended recently in paris government is now assured of adequate flow of foreign funds to finance key areas in the economy the government and the people of uganda are grateful to the international community for the support and assistance that they are receiving some industries have already placed orders for urgently required raw materials and fast moving spare parts installation of new machineries in some of the factories is going on as the inflow of foreign exchange picks up more and more of our factories will be availed foreign exchange to enable them utilize their otherwise redundant capacities specific orders have already been placed for inputs in agriculture and animal industries consequently the short supply situation that has been one of the factors responsible for inflation will soon be dealt with decisively also following the success of the paris meetings we have now rescheduled approximately us 70 million of our foreign debts this will mean that these funds will be available to apply to our recovery programme rather than repayment of the debts nearly all the projects in the investment plan that are to be implemented this year have received funding the challenge now before us mr chairman is to work harder to absorb the money we have borrowed it is to be expected mr chairman that the increased producer prices you announced coupled with importation of input goods will give rise to increased production in the economy the key utilities of power and water are vigorously being attended to as their recovery is conditional to improvements in the rest of the sectors supply resource budgeting and man agement policies the government finds it desirable and is committed to pursuing tight fiscal and monetary policies specific measures are being under taken in the tax administration area these will be outlined later on the expenditure side close linkage between revenue and expenditure will be adhered to this is to ensure that money budgeted for investment projects and maintenance work is available when required tight measures to control expenditure are being put into place the head count of civil servants is now complete this exercise has now defined precisely who should be on the pay roll a lot of unnecessary expenditure will be avoided following the findings of the census in addition to avoid fraud in the form of air purchasing and unnecessarily high prices a central purchasing department is being created this department will have the responsibility of doing major government purchasing for example for stationery and transport requirements as you know mr chairman a lot of government revenue is normally collected by ministries as proceeds for goods or services the government sells to the public the government does for instance sell products raised from its farms all over the country these may be food items animals or any other marketable commodity charging people for radio or television announcements is another example of how line ministries sell services to the public this money has up to date been collected by the ministries providing these services or selling the goods however the manner in which that money has been handled has left a lot to be desired i have therefore decided that this money which is popularly known as appropriations in aid will immediately be paid by the accounting officers to the treasury for crediting to the consolidated fund the current budget has taken into account all financing needs for each ministry discounting availability of appropriations in aid to the ministries concerned from today therefore appropriations in aid will form part of government revenue to be disbursed to ministries through normal budgeting from year to year in the area of the parastatal organisations the government is to insist on efficiency and positive results each parastatal organisation will be expected to pay dividends to the treasury all parastatal organisations will now be required to submit to the ministry of finance audited financial statements within six months of the year ended failure to conform to these and other stipulations will call for punitive measures mr chairman the nrm government while being committed to a mixed economy is acutely aware of the constraints it faces in resource availability accordingly therefore the government has set up a committee to study the parastatal sector this will assist government to decide on what it can at this stage manage to run in terms of financial requirements and management capabilities work is now advanced on preparation of guidelines to be used to decide what parastatals government should retain and which ones will either be wound up or sold to the private sector it is expected that by the end of the year these guidelines will be complete and operational work is also advanced on resolution of the departed asians properties custodian board an activated and strengthened verification committee is busy reviewing all claims to the properties the register of the properties has recently been up dated a board of valuers to value all the affected properties has been appointed and by the end of the year work on selling the properties not successfully claimed will have started the money obtained from the sales will be kept in a special account to be used to compensate former owners and or reinvested in the building of new structures the government mr chairman is committed to a steady reduction in its net indebtedness to the banking system as a start 50 per cent of the money realised from the conversion tax has gone towards retiring part of this public debt with these measures in the fiscal areas therefore there will be a reduction in credit to the government and this will make it easier for expansion in credit to the private and parastatal sectors the role of the private sector in uganda mr chairman the government recognises the important role the private sector plays in the economy this role is most pronounced first and foremost on the small holder peasant farms as these are held by individuals it is similarly pronounced in industry and in the transport sector in agriculture all the coffee exported and consumed at home is produced on peasant plots owned individually the production of cotton and tobacco is also carried out on individual peasant plots in the case of tea production is by big firms privately owned the role of the small holder in this industry is growing and being encouraged by the government as regards industry the vast majority of the industrial establishments are in the hands of the private sector and the government will continue encouraging the private sector s role in industrial development the industrial licensing act is currently under review to enhance investment in industrial production government intends to review all existing laws and decrees which deal with the protection and privileges of foreign investment with a view to harmonizing the law and consolidating it into one statute government recognizes however that what is even more important than the legislation is the creation of conducive environment that will give confidence to all investors it is therefore our intention to work to create and maintain a congenial climate for investment by both domestic and foreign investors foreign exchange management policy the new exchange has given rise to adequate price incentives for the production of tradable goods after the shortage of foreign exchange is alleviated and the domestic supply situation improves the government will gradually replace the current administrative system of foreign exchange allocation with an open general licensing ogl system under which importers will obtain import licences and foreign exchange immediately upon request initially the coverage of the ogl system will be limited to certain priority industries and to a number of priority items such as agricultural inputs and essential goods monetary policy mr chairman government in may changed the exchange rate of the uganda shilling vis à vis the us from 14 shillings to 60 shillings this exchange rate will continue to be operative i am glad to report mr chairman that the currency reform inclusive of the tax levy you announced in may this year was successfully and smoothly carried out all over the country in the same month this is further testimony to the popularity of the national resistance movement it is proof of the fact that the government is in full control of the security situation finally it also proves the correctness of the line that the government has taken on economic matters there is now respect and confidence in the new currency in recognition of this and your wisdom in having taken this measure mr chairman the population are referring to the new currency as the museveni dollar a recently carried out study by the bank of uganda has revealed that the monthly price index is falling for the middle income group the index in june fell by a factor of 16 3 percent relative to may while in the low income group the corresponding fall was 11 3 percent giving an average fall in the price index of 13 8 per cent the attitude of the population in respect to investment is changing positively a lot of investors are now turning away from the negative trend of speculation and are instead taking up investment in productive enterprises this is a move in the right direction which the government predictably knew would result from the policy package announced in may this year with this in mind mr chairman i would like now to address the question of interest rates interest rates do play a monetary role as they do regulate the cost and availability of credit and where it goes they can also help in mobilizing financial resources which can be used to achieve desired economic objectives in a situation of inflation however interest rates need to be substantially high in order to attract people to save high rates of interest however can have very damaging effects on an economy they could discourage borrowing and so curtail production given however the trends in the economy now namely falling rates of inflation and the turn towards investment in development projects i have decided to adjust interest rates downwards with immediate effect in order to encourage productive investment medium and long term loans with maturities exceeding one year will carry interest rates of between 22 and 25 percent the exact level will be determined by the risk factors attached to a particular project interest on short term lending of a commercial nature will be fixed at 30 percent the interest rate on shorter commercial borrowing will be reviewed in line with changes in the inflation rate naturally the expected increase in investment calls for higher savings accordingly the saving rates have been set at a range of between 18 and 22 percent depending on the deposit maturities government is taking further steps to mobilize funds for investment in productive enterprises recently we launched a rural credit scheme to be operated by the uganda commercial bank the uganda commercial bank is also quickly rehabilitating those of its branches that had been damaged during the years of insecurity this will enable the public to save some of their earnings and these will in turn be borrowed for investment in the medium to long term it is government policy to spread banking facilities all over the country successful efforts have been made to procure finance for the uganda development bank and the east african development bank these funds are being lent to the public for investment in productive enterprises i have therefore mr chairman not found it necessary to require the commercial banks to adjust their investment portfolios as a way of ensuring that pre termined proportions of their lending go to each sector of the economy the banks will however be expected to pay closer attention to investment projects presented to them by the public in the event that i find this does not work i will have to take the necessary steps to correct the situation trade and balance of payments uganda has been experiencing balance of payments difficulties for many years the country has experienced large balance of payments deficits since 1m2 in 1982 the overall balance of payments deficit was us 32 9 million then us 36 3 million in 1983 and us 58 5 million in 1984 after 1984 the situation deteriorated sharply mainly for two reasons the current account balance could not register any marked improvement due to economic conditions which discouraged the country s export trade and secondly the growing capital account deficit mainly steming from large debt service payment especially those relating to the international monetary fund repurchases over the years 1989 and 1986 the government imposed sharp cut backs on imports except those which were absolutely essential for the functioning of the economy but even then the balance of payment deficit remained extremely adverse the government has taken steps to restore the country s balance of payment position by raising substantial soft term resources from abroad and also negotiated re scheduling of the country s external debts as i have pointed out earlier on as a result of this the government hopes to restore a sustainable balance of payments position in chiding a strong reserve position by encouraging exports of traditional and non traditional goods as well as import substitution mr chairman the newly established barter trade in the country will go a long way in assisting this country to diversify its exports following your personal efforts mr chairman uganda has recently identified large markets for uganda s products like timber soya beans hides and skins beans and fresh fruits to mention a few examples two large projects are al ready being financed by use of the barter trade namely the bitumenization of the mityana mubende fort portal road and the rehabilitation of the kampala international hotel given however the demands for importation of equipment and spare parts for rehabilitating the industrial sector the need to import in puts in the agricultural sector and basic necessities for the population this year will require exceptional balance of payments support but as the economy recovers and the production of goods in the domestic economy improves favourable balance of payments should be restored by the end of the current investment programme produce prices on 15th may 1987 mr chairman you announced huge price increases in the producer prices of the controlled crops it is the policy of the nrm government to offer higher and higher prices for these commodities as a means of uplifting the well being of this country s producers of wealth the prices will be kept under constant review to ensure that the producer is adequately remunerated 1986 87 budgetary out turn mr chairman let me now turn to the budget out turn for the fiscal year ended the original estimates for recurrent expenditure for the financial year 1986 87 was shs 6 4 billion while development expenditure was estimated at sh4 8 billion in the course of the year these estimates were revised to shs 6 8billion and shs 3 2billion for recurrent and development shs 10 0 billion on the revenue side the original estimates for the expenditure giving a total expenditure of financial year 1986 87 were shs 5 0 billion for recurrent tax revenue and shs 3 2 for development revenue the revised tax revenue estimates for the year under review are shs 4 8 billion and shs 2 4 billion for recurrent and development respectively making a total of shs 7 2 billion as against the original estimates of shs 8 2 billion the out turn for 1986 87 therefore reflects an overall deficit of shs 2 8 billion on the whole the original voted estimates of expenditure under recurrent budget were overspent due to the following factors 1 the increased salaries and wages announced in the last budget speech were not included in amounts voted 2 the increased out of station subsistence allowances were similarly not catered for in the original estimates 3 the demands for relief and rehabilitation increased during the year beyond expectations the cost of maintaining security in the country was substantially higher than anticipated 4 the devaluation of the shilling announced in the economic package of may 15 1987 had direct bearing on expenditure for the remaining one and half months of the financial year both in terms of domestic prices and payments in foreign currency budget forecast for 1987 88 in the current financial year the government expects to spend a total of shs 53 2 billion of this recurrent expenditure including statutory expenditure is estimated to be shs 26 8 billion development expenditure including statutory development expenditure is expected to be shs 26 4 billion with regard to revenue during this financial year we expect to raise revenue amounting to shs 44 6 billion of this tax revenue alone will account for shs 27 2 billion the other main sources will be grants as well as external loans the country is receiving from abroad over the financial year as well as development revenue consisting mainly of appropriations in aid the government therefore expects to run a deficit of shs8 6 billion i intend to finance the deficit by borrowing from the public from abroad and the domestic banking sector to a limited extent defence takes the biggest share of the budget both in recurrent and development expenditure the reason for this is clear to everyone the national resistance army is still a new army which needs to be fully equipped in order to increase its operational capacity and also to ensure that it will promptly and effectively deal with any future threats to the security of the country it is therefore necessary to de vote relatively more resources in the security area since in any case no development can take place without secure and suitable conditions it has also been found necessary to devote urge resources in the field of education especially in recurrent costs everybody knows the cost of educating students has been a big burden to the parents over the past years the government is going to meet the biggest part of the cost of maintaining the students at school at primary level government will pay 50 percent of the total cost the corresponding rates at post primary level will be 75 percent and 65 percent for day and boarding schools respectively and 100 percent of the costs at the university level parents are therefore expected to pay school fees amounting to shs 95 and shs 115 per annum per pupil for rural and urban primary schools respectively and shs 1 580 and shs 4 387 per year per student for day and boarding secondary schools respectively the ministries of agriculture animal industry and works will also take comparatively large fractions of the budget reflecting the emphasis that the nrm government places on increased production as contained in the ten point programme and the policy package announced by you mr chairman on may 15 1987 the nrm recognises the plight in which the civil servant finds himself in the current difficult economic situation consequently mr chairman in may you announced a doubling of civil service salaries across the board this has produced some relief following the decline in prices of most consumer goods consequent on the economic measures announced in may the civil servants is now in a position to buy something with his salary on top of this because of the improved security situation in the country the civil servant can now enjoy whatever little he earns in a much better and relaxed atmosphere as we record further improvements in the economy the civil servant will also be a beneficiary accordingly the condition of the civil servant will be constantly reviewed as the economic situation improves the government will soon appoint a salary review commission to clearly define what would constitute a reasonable salary for the civil servants meantime the government has decided to take the following measures to ameliorate the conditions of the civil servant i the government will immediately assist the civil servant with transport to and from his place of work at the district level now or soon there will be a minimum of six vehicles for use by government official although these have been allocated to specific sectors they will be expected to assist in transporting civil servants from home to office before proceeding to the field in the case of kampala a pool of buses will be set up under the ministry of transport which will operate for defined distances on main roads leading into kampala to transport civil servants in the morning and at the end of the day ii the government will assist workers in the urban centres to collect foodstuffs from the rural areas by provision of lorries in this way the workers will buy food at much cheaper prices than in the open markets in the urban centres iii the salary and wages for the civil servants will be further adjusted upwards by a factor of 50 percent effective july 1 1987 iv the salaries of the professional workers will continue to reflect special allowances which have been paid to them at different scales 01 pay compared with other workers doctors and the teaching staff at the university will have their scales enhanced further considering the special nature of their jobs the details of this measure will be worked out immediately and also takes effect from july 1 1987 v government workers employed in sensitive sections like civil security departments and revenue collecting departments will be paid a responsibility allowance equivalent to 30 percent of their monthly salaries as long as they continue to be employed in these departments mr chairman these measures should go a long way in improving the conditions of the civil servant taxation mr chairman the taxation proposals for 1987 88 are aimed at consolidating the economic policy package announced on may 15 1987 for the package to succeed it will need a strong fiscal policy to increase the supply of financial resources mr chairman although as of today our tax base is narrow i find that the revenue potential of this country has not yet been fully tapped in the first place even those tax payers on the books have not been adequately taxed secondly some taxable wealth has not been touched leaving the burden on a few tax payers notably the coffee producers i will therefore be proposing movement into new areas to widen the tax base in preparation for this i have already taken measures to strengthen the tax administration system a the tax collectors are being provided with the required facilities and equipment b specific incentives will be provided to officials involved in revenue collection c the investigation function is being reestablished in both the income tax and inland revenue departments d improvement in the quality of staff manning the revenue collecting departments are being carried out e arrangements are currently under way to appoint a committee of experts to comprehensively review the taxation system in this country it is against this back ground mr chairman that i now wish to present the taxation proposals for 1987 88 income tax following the currency re form in may this year all the figures in the income tax decree 1974 and sub sequent amendments will be converted into new currency the new proposals area as follows a i propose to amend the decree in order to include cattle traders dairy farmers and commercial ranchers it will be necessary for these categories of tax payers to show that they are up to date with their tax affairs as indeed required by the law before they can get access to any government facilities and services for purposes of enforcement they will need to be properly registered with their respective district veterinary officers and district income tax offices i propose that cattle traders commercial ranchers and dairy farmers pay deposits at the rates of shs 50 000 shs 25 000 and shs 6 000 respectively every fiscal year b for purposes of equity and the need to promote compliance but at the same time giving realistic relief to tax payers i have decided that with effect from 1st july 1987 every person in uganda earning more than more than shs 50 000 a year will be liable to income tax at the rates in the proposed individual tax rates in the finance bill 1987 c mr chairman ours is a serious government and its leaders should conduct themselves in an exemplary manner and be ready always to lead in all respects we should therefore not only show good example but should also be able to contribute to the cost of financing services we all enjoy i have therefore decided that from 1 july 1987 all the honourable members of the national resistance council and ministers will pay income tax on their emoluments d mr chairman a number of corporations have for a long time been exempt from payment of income tax the rationale for this initially was that the organisations were to provide subsidised services but for many years now these corporations have been charging commercial rates the only setback they have had is failure to collect their dues for reasons of equity i have accordingly decided that with immediate effect the following corporation will be brought into the income tax bracket 1 uganda railways corporation 2 uganda airlines corporation 3 uganda posts and telecommunications corporation 4 uganda commercial bank e mr chairman and hon members of this august house the income tax department has been levying unrealistically low income tax deposits for example a fisherman has been paying old uganda shillings 20 000 for a whole year before the currency reform a small fish was costing shs 5 000 in effect this trader only caught four fish to cover tax for a whole year this is unacceptable and inequitable i have accordingly decided to raise deposit rates in line with current prices the new rates which take effect immediately are outlined in the finance bill f mr chairman the fiscal year is different from the income tax year in that the income tax year coincides with the calendar year while the fiscal year does not i find this irrational from the point of view of resource mobilization the effect this has been that revenue expected from income tax sources has not been received until six months after the coming into effect of a given fiscal year i have therefore decided that starting with 1987 88 the income tax year will coincide mr chairman i hope to raise an additional shs 0 5 billion customs duty the economic package announced on may 15 1987 has started producing positive results government recognises that in the present circumstances the demand for imports will continue to be high because of inadequate supply of goods and services in the economy in order to raise adequate revenue from this source while at the same time protecting the average ugandan from the effect of devaluation i have decided the following measures i have abolished duty payable on the following essential commodities soap sugar salt and kerosene this measure has been effective since june 25 1987 when the current prices for these commodities were announced with immediate effect the duty payable on lorries and buses is reduced to 5 percent from 15 percent the duty on pick ups that is motor vehicles for transport of goods or materials of a carrying capacity of less than 3 tonnes is reduced from 15 per cent to 10 per cent the duty on mini buses has been reduced from 20 per cent to 10 per cent the duty on motor vehicle tyres and tubes is reduced from 20 per cent to 10 per cent the duty on motor vehicle spares is reduced from 20 per cent to 10 per cent motor vehicles for the transport of liquids or petroleum products in bulk is reduced from 15 per cent to 10 per cent iii i have already indicated that the success of the current economic policy will depend on increased supply of goods and services in order to stimulate domestic production i have decided to suspend duty payable on all industrial raw materials in 1987 88 for effective implementation of this measure i wish urge all manufacturers in this country to submit lists their raw materials to the ministry immediately the objective of this measure is to speed up importation of raw materials and with the saving on duty to enable the industries to import more raw materials and ultimately increase production iv it is an agreed economic truism mr chairman that the rate of capital formation and therefore economic growth is a function of investment in order to attract more investment and therefore stimulate growth i propose to waive duty on new machinery plant and equipment imported by industries it should be noted mr chairman that already agricultural inputs pesticides and animal drugs agricultural tractors and hand tools are tax free this position will be maintained v mr chairman the construction and building industry is very instrumental in stimulating development government has for instance selected construction especially road construction as one of its top priorities in order to encourage potential indigenous contractors to actively participate in this sector i have decided to waive duty on the road construction equipment imported by indigenous contractors vi mr chairman i wish to report that i have found the current price formula in respect of the four controlled petroleum products super regular kerosene and diesel very deceptive presently duty on these products is as follows per cent super and regular 100 kerosene 50 diesel 20 but these ad valorem rates give the impression that government is realising a lot of revenue from these products when in fact most of it goes back to the oil industry in form of rebate i have therefore with immediate effect instituted a system of taxation which allows no rebate except in special circumstances the rates on petroleum products will now be specific as follows brand tax per litre pump price super 12 18 32 00 kerosene nil 12 00 diesel 2 74 22 00 in effect the price changes are a in case of kerosene there has been a reduction of shs 2 40 per litre b while in case of diesel and super there is an increase of shs 2 20 and shs 2 00 per litre respectively as in the case of income tax i propose to amend the east african customs and transfer tax management act and subsequent amendments in order to convert the amounts in old currency to new currency mr chairman since these amounts include fines and penalties which are in themselves deterrent to tax evasion i have made revisions considering their adequacy in that respect i wish to report mr chairman a new development in the customs and excise department the title of the commissioner of customs and excise has now been replaced by that of director general of customs and excise it will therefore be necessary to amend the east african customs and transfer tax management act to reflect this change in title mr chairman i hope to realise shs 1 0 billion in additional revenue from this source excise duty mr chairman i have already announced abolition of tax on basic essential commodities in order to compensate for this loss of revenue i have decided to make an increase of the excise duty on the two excisable commodities of beer and cigarettes this should cause no alarm already although the ex factory price for beer per bottle is approximately 32 shillings the public are comfortably drinking the same beer at the cost of shs 80 the increase in price of beer therefore will only affect the middle man and not the retail price in order to tap more revenue i have decided as follows beer the rate rises from 50 per cent to 70 per cent from midnight tonight cigarettes a where the cost of production per 1 000 cigarettes is less than shs 500 the rate will be 45 per cent from 40 per cent b where the cost of production per 1 000 cigarettes exceeds shs 500 the excise duty will be 75 per cent from 70 per cent the excise duty rates on cigarettes also take effect from midnight tonight as in the case of customs i am proposing two amendments to convert all the amounts in the east african excise management act to new currency and to replace the title of commissioner of customs and excise in the same act with that of director general mr chairman i hope to realise shs 0 2 billion as additional revenue from this source sales tax mr chairman although for practical reasons we distinguish between sales tax on imports and sales tax on local products technically sales tax applies equally on both imported and locally manufactured products the reason for this is that unlike customs duty sales tax is basically a revenue tax nevertheless i have taken decisions that i consider necessary either to give relief to the ordinary ugandan or to promote investment and therefore increase production in line with the decision in respect of customs duty i have abolished safes tax payable on basic essential consumer commodities i e salt sugar soap and kerosene with effect from 25th june 1987 i have also abolished sales tax payable on 1 industrial plant machinery and equipment 2 road construction equipment 3 steel bars in the area of sales tax i have also made the following adjustments in respect of a few selected commodities cement from 50 per cent to 25 per cent local textile fabrics from 40 per cent to 25 per cent lorries and buses from 30 per cent to 10 per cent mini buses from 40 per cent to 20 per cent pick ups from 30 per cent to 20 per cent motor vehicle tyres and tubes from 30 per cent to 20 per cent motor vehicle spares from 30 per cent to 20 per cent motor vehicles for the transport of liquids from 30 per cent to 20 per cent mr chairman the reduction in the tax rates on vehicles i have just announced will inevitably mean loss of revenue this will however be translated into decreased transport rates and fares and decreased prices of food stuffs mr chairman this measure is in line with the government policy to give relief to the ordinary citizen mr chairman the sales tax rates in respect of cement textiles fabrics lorries and buses come into effect from midnight tonight also taking effect from midnight tonight are the following increases in sales tax beer from 30 per cent to 50 per cent cigarettes where the cost of production per 1 000 cigarettes is less than 500 35 per cent from 30 per cent where the cost of production exceeds shs 500 per 1 000 cigarettes 50 per cent from 40 per cent spirits including uganda waragi from 20 per cent to 30 per cent soda from 70 per cent to 100 per cent i have in reference to customs duty described the current price formula for petroleum products as deceptive i have therefore decided on a specific rate of duty and also abolished sales tax on these products i hope to realise additional revenue to the tune of shs 2 4 billion from these measures road user tax mr chairman in the 1986 87 budget government announced plans to introduce a road user tax but because of logistic physical and technical bottlenecks it was not possible to realise this objective i am however glad to report that most of these bottlenecks have been overcome and that this tax will become a reality in 1987 88 vehicles crossing road toll points in soroti jinja masaka mityana and gulu roads will be required to pay shs 10 only each time of crossing the road toll the only exempted vehicles will be those with government and diplomatic numbers i expect to realise shs 23 0 million from this measure stamp duty mr chairman in an effort to encourage the flow of resources into meaningful investments we waived stamp duty pay able on mortgages from uganda development bank and the east african development bank the rationale was that loans from these two institutions are for development purposes and will therefore go to areas that will contribute to capital formation and thus in crease rate of growth this policy has been successful during 1986 87 a total number of 44 projects costing over 26 0 million equivalent of shs 1 56 billion were approved by these institutions i therefore intend to continue this policy during the year 1987 88 borrowers from commercial banks are equally encouraged but have to submit their projects so that the government can determine if they fall in the approved category in summary therefore mr chairman i hope to realise a total additional revenue of shs 4 123 billion from these new taxation measures conclusion in conclusion mr chairman uganda has great potential which can be taken advantage of in establishing a strong economic base and self sustaining in the medium and long term the ten point programme mr chairman is very eloquent on this point the conditions are now ripe for the people of uganda to take off on the road to recovery in your person mr chairman and in the organisation of the national resistance movement the ugandan people have for the first time a leadership that is analytical steadfast and clear headed this is the component that had been lacking for a long time given that this country is potentially rich the ugandan population mr chairman must be constantly reminded that the responsibility of correcting maladjustments in our economy rests on the people of uganda themselves in this respect the people should be prepared to work harder in order to accomplish the intended recovery the fact that the government has mobilized external resources to apply to the economic package should not give the wrong impression that the people can expect a soft life immediately on the contrary we should be prepared to tighten our belts and resolve to work every hour that passes this is the critical path to the realisation of our growth potential thank you mr chairman i beg to move
by two decades ago nato started it s 78 day bombing campaign against yugoslavia using the language of peace and humanitarianism nato dismembered yugoslavia killing more civilians than they did soldiers a non stop aerial assault on the federal republic of yugoslavia using more than a thousand nato warplanes delivering 2 000 air strikes in 40 000 sorties and with over 20 000 bombs dropped on the country the rabid imperialists shed crocodile tears of humanitarian concern for albanians in kosovo or so the press and it s organs told us in just a few months president clinton bombed four countries sudan afghanistan iraq and yugoslavia of the four yugoslavia was to take the most ferocious bombing the united states was also involved in proxy wars in angola mexico colombia and east timor this selective humanitarian concern did not extend to a number of european countries for its continued oppression of the roma britain remained exempt despite having had death squads in the no0rth of ireland secret death squads backed by thatcher gov t killed hundreds in n ireland sputnik 06 2015 the united states did not work itself into a panic over the hutu for their slaughter of half a million tutsi in rwanda the us did not drop bombs for 78 days and nights on the french who were complicit in that massacre neither did they bomb guatemala for the military s systematic slaughter of tens of thousands of mayan villagers they did not moralise to the indonesian people whose military generals were engaged in mass murder in the summer of 1999 the united states did not concern itself with the sri lankan civil war which took 100 000 lives over a 25 year period they did not screech to the skies about the human rights abuses the new scientist has described as the deadliest since world war 2 congo crisis is deadliest since second world war new scientist january 2006 now a possible reason for this selective humanitarian concern might be that the congo is fully integrated into the global capitalist market the children mining coltan that ends up used in mobile phones and other high technology is fully integrated into global supply chains the congo is a successful capitalist nation that is it is a good place for global capital to find profits no natos primary concern for human rights resided mostly in fictional genocides in the balkans the us state department first put out figures like 500 000 missing kosovans or albanians this number was revised a week later to 200 000 then to 100 000 then to 10 000 after the bombing campaign started the result was the fascistic murder and blitzkreig of thousands of civilians men women and children and more than a thousand yugoslav soldiers and police the bombing campaign did not have approval of united nations security council the bombing of yugoslavia was to usher in the new world order weapons deployed included cluster bombs and depleted uranium both considered illegal under international law with the overthrow of the soviet union and with yeltsin backed to the hilt by us financiers propagandists and goldman sachs provided economists nato turned its murderous eye on another independent sovereign nation in europe yugoslavia the propagandists for the west stated the intervention operation allied force was for humanitarian concerns yet are unable to explain how they killed more civilians than soldiers and destroyed civilian infrastructure up to 15 tons of depleted uranium were dropped on serbia up to 15 tons of depleted uranium used in 1999 serbia bombing lead lawyer in suit against nato rt 13 june 2017 not only has this vicious bombing against yugoslavia today resulted in serbia being the cancer capital of europe but prof velimir nedeljkovic an expert on environmental issues has said it was an attack against the planet kosovo being geographically located between 3 rivers the professor goes on to say this was a deliberate experiment to see how a vast region can be contaminated through a river system the bombings were carried out absolutely deliberately and pursued certain goals kosovo is a geographical phenomenon as rivers originating in this region flow into three seas the aegean the black and the adriatic seas therefore nato used depleted uranium to bomb a small region but managed to contaminate three seas those seas are connected to oceans so it is evident that the pollution was of a planetary scale the expert went on it was clear that the war is over that even one bomb is redundant let alone two however those bombs were dropped for the sake of an in vivo experiment it is clear why depleted uranium munitions were used in kosovo it was also an in vivo experiment to see how a vast region can be contaminated through a river system he said nato use of depleted uranium in bombing yugoslavia was ecocide on planetary scale expert tass october 05 2018 with that being said let s take a look at the reasons for the war what the bourgeois said they were doing at the time what their real reasons were and the ex yugoslav states today beneath the veiled concern for ethnic tensions instead a picture of the west exacerbating ethnic tensions and nationalism as a wedge to break up yugoslavia the wild numbers of mass graves quoted by nato and us officials of hitting up to 200 000 were never found or uncovered instead a few hundred were found mostly dug in individual graves the concern for ethnic minorities did not extend to the serbs who were forcibly removed from their homelands and expelled under the watchful eye of american troops the media played an absolutely complicit role in which reporters would drip feed some propagandistic message and the sheer repetition of that message became gospel truth peeling away these layers upon layers of propaganda instead we find a simple geopolitical war in which nato waged this war to establish an oil monopoly stretching from the middle east to the shores of the black and the caspian seas we see nato actively engaging in ethnic cleansing to create themselves a loyal little client state kosovo in the balkans furthermore this war was waged to further isolate russia and to end the very idea of sovereignty and independence for the peoples of yugoslav destroying the last remnants of socialism in europe and a complete recolonisation of the balkans yugoslavia as an independent power yugoslavia was built on an idea with their own federation it was hoped the southern slavs would not remain isolated and weak and prey for imperialism the idea then was to live together in harmony forming a substantial territory capable of independent economic development the achievements of yugoslav socialism were a life expectancy of 72 years almost full literacy and a rate of 7 percent annual growth in the 1960s along with free medical and education a guaranteed right to an income one month vacation with pay yugoslavia also offered it s citizens affordable public transportation housing and utilities the economy was mostly publicly owned in a market socialist economy this form of market socialism was to prove it s downfall market socialism the undermining of socialism the yugoslav soviet union split in 1948 led the yugoslav communists to believe in the need for market socialism the first step in this was decentralisation undertaken in may 1949 to cede autonomy to local communal governments this step by step process would inevitably lead back to capitalism slovene leader edvard kardelj explained that these reforms promoted the sense of greater inclusion in the work of the state machinery from the lowest organs to the highest the life and death of yugoslav socialism jacobin july 2017 in june 1950 the national assembly passed legislation introducing more democratic workplaces enterprises would now have councils consisting of 15 120 democratically elected representatives who were restricted to two one year terms at the sixth party congress in 1952 the yugoslav communists cut the party from the state now the party cadres would have to compete across the different organs of self management the reorganisation of enterprises in yugoslavia meant workers had a more invested interest in their company s success but the market nature meant they were still to participate in a competitive market which rewarded efficiency and productivity self management went hand in hand with integration into the world market and pitted workers against enterprises in both the federation and foreign markets ibid this created a short term success where the country thrived on exports but also opened the country to the contradictions of market efficiency this would inevitably put them at the mercy of the market regional variations in inequality and unemployment reflected the country s uneven economic development before world war 1 the northwest republics slovenia and croatia had belonged to the austro hungarian empire and benefited from economic modernisation the austro hungarian empire had experienced in the 19th century the southern republics had been dependant on the ottoman empire and had remained largely agrarian and undeveloped the southern republics party leaders feared the turn toward the market system the extractive industries and heavy manufacturers in the south required high levels of state investment and protectionist measures the southern republics also supported the federal tax system which aimed to fund southern industrial growth by redistributing profits from the wealthier northwest the leaders in the northwest wanted an export led growth model meaning greater economic liberalisation and integration into foreign markets they stood in opposition to the federal tax plan arguing instead that more profitable enterprises should thrive without state intervention by the 1960s the market reform side with its base in the northwest had won self management deepend the country further integrated into foreign domestic markets as external pressures intensified the republics closed off against each other more and more not only did they therefore develop different specialisations with different markets in the cold war but superpower contestation also made the republics a primary site of the superpower struggle for supremacy the end of the cold war presented yugoslavia with an existential challenge that its institutional design proved ill prepared to meet as its debt economy found it difficult to re finance with the threat of the ussr gone the economic struggle for power in tito s yugoslavia from world war ii to non alignment dr vladimir unkovski korica by 1991 with the overthrow of communism in eastern europe and the soviet union yugoslavia remained the only nation in the region that would not voluntarily discard what remained of its socialism and join the free market system with one of the largest standing armies in europe it had no interest in joining nato but with the overthrow of communism in eastern europe the imf and world bank no longer needed yugoslavia as a wedge against the soviet union nato no longer wanted a strong independent power in the balkans crippled by foreign debt and imf world bank structural adjustment programs in the late 1960s and early 1970s the yugoslav leaders decided to borrow heavily from the west this was to be catastrophic the aim had been to expand the country s industrial base its export production and its output of domestic consumer goods however with the western economies entering recession they blocked yugoslav exports which reduced its export earnings and created a huge black hole of debt for belgrade the interest on the massive debt started to snowball as the interest fed the momentum of the slide into ever more debt the creditors among them the imf and world bank demanded a restructuring restructuring consists of draconian austerity programs neoliberal reforms wage freezes the abolition of state subsidised prices increased unemployment the elimination of most worker managed enterprises and massive cuts in social spending and social programs the yugoslavs were to consume less but produce more directing their national wealth toward meeting debt repayments foreign debt exploded it was expected to be 6 billion but turned out to be 21 billion eastern europe in the twentieth century and after r j crampton p 386 a colossal amount for a country on the periphery of imperialism the break up of the soviet union was go time for the us with the collapse of the soviet union in the early 90s the imf and world bank no longer felt they had to placate yugoslavia which had always acted as a wedge against the soviet union in researching this article i read through numerous articles by the socialist party and the socialist workers party both trotskyist organisations just to see the orientation and political insight these parties had at the time don t laugh as usual their political insight seemed to involve using the word stalinism or stalinist as much as possible despite yugoslavia breaking with the soviet union and deciding to move in a direction of decentralisation rather than centralisation and collectivisation since the collapse of the totalitarian stalinist regimes in the balkans and the reintroduction of capitalism during the 1990s workers have endured mass impoverishment unemployment and wars stalinism denied workers democracy and self determination for nationalities yet despite the stalinist regimes the planned economy provided free health care jobs and cheap rent all this has been destroyed by the new war mongering mafia capitalists kosova one year after nato s war the socialist newspaper 3 march 2000 besides the fact that yugoslav socialism hadn t denied workers democracy but actually had decentralised their enterprises to facilitate workers democracy shows how lost the trotskyists are the question should be did entrenched interests see this characterisation the same way because capitalists and the bourgeois are notorious for not sharing the same analysis as trotskyites social democrats anarchists or other left hangers on in 1984 the reagan administration issued a classified document national security decision directive 133 explaining how yugoslavia serves western and us interests as pointed out in the inter agency report on united states policy toward yugoslavia an independent economically viable stable and militarily capable yugoslavia serves western and us interests yugoslavia is an important obstacle to soviet expansionism and hegemony in southern europe yugoslavia also serves as a useful reminder to countries in eastern europe of the advantages of independence from moscow and of the benefits of friendly relations with the west national security decision directive 133 entrenched interests ie those of the reagan administration did not characterise yugoslavia with childish insults like stalinism as the document continues a very different picture emerges the us will continue its close cooperation with other friendly countries to support yugoslavia s efforts to overcome its financial difficulties we will seek to expand us economic relations with yugoslavia in ways which benefit both countries and which strengthen yugoslavia s ties with the industrialised democracies us policy will be to promote the trend toward an effective market oriented yugoslav economic structure emphasis mine the us will pursue the well established dialogue with yugoslav leaders on issues of mutual interest and concern we will take the opportunity provided by high level offical visits to reiterate us support for yugoslav independence territorial integrity and national unity our policy will continue to be to encourage yugoslavia to play a moderating role within the nonaligned movement and to counter cuban and soviet influence in that organisation ibid the result is that we saw the nonaligned movement was not nonaligned the following year after the writing of the above document 1985 and the relaxation of tensions with the soviet union after gorbachev became leader meant that western nations were no longer willing to be generous with restructuring yugoslavia s debts to provide an example of a communist country outside of the soviet bloc in other words yugoslavia had fulfilled its foreign policy function as a way of destabilising the soviet bloc and was no longer needed what the political paradigm the communist party of yugoslavia had depended on began to disappear now they were no longer useful to the west as a foreign policy tool the west hungrily eyed their markets their natural resources and their people as objects of cheap labour as communism collapsed yugoslavia found itself in a precarious position within a year 1992 the united nations had expelled yugoslavia from the un general assembly under united nations general assembly resolution 47 1 yugoslavia as a pariah state and slobodan milosevic head of the serbian state as an outcast this was the first step toward nato military intervention in a manual released by wikileaks in army special operations forces unconventional warfare the manual states how the financial arms of the us can be used as unconventional warfare wikileaks themselves have called this a coup manual 2 45 like the economic activity which all nation states human groups and individuals respond to arsof can use financial power as a weapon in times of conflict up to and including large scale general war like the economic activity that it is related to most financial power is unmanaged routine and peaceful however manipulation of u s financial strength can leverage the policies and cooperation of state governments financial incentives and disincentives can build and sustain international coalitions waging or supporting u s uw campaigns as part of an interagency effort the u s treasury can recommend changes to u s policy that can provide such incentives to state governments and others at the national strategic policy level participation in international financial organizations such as the world bank wb international monetary fund imf organization for economic cooperation and development oecd and the bank for international settlements bis offers the u s diplomatic financial venues to accomplish such coalitions army special operations forces unconventional warfare p 24 wikileaks in 1990 the imf and the world bank delivered a new financial aid package that required new extensive expenditure cuts by the federal government belgrade suspended transfer payments to republics and provinces and real wages collapsed by 41 percent causing half a million workers to have their wages suspended inflation began to rise and industrial growth plummeted to 10 6 percent the entire yugoslavian banking system began to be dismantled under the supervision of the world bank a year later in 1991 croatia slovenia and macedonia declared independence from yugoslavia and civil war broke out in croatia banking on the balkans july 1999 michael chossudovsky the imf and world bank involvement led to the impoverishment of the population which in turn led to hatred confusion and divisiveness the united states and nato wanted to see yugoslavia become a market oriented economy but due to structural adjustment programs the country had experienced out of control inflation and enormous drops in real wages now that the economy is in shambles the u s and the european union have installed a full fledged colonial administration to replace the sovereign economic control of the country ibid the most profitable state assets were transferred into the hands of foreign capital under the world bank sponsored privatisation program strong economic medicine imposed by external creditors contributed to further boosting a criminal economy already firmly implanted in albania that fed on poverty and economic dislocation also kosovo was to reimburse this debt through the laundering of dirty money yugoslav banks in kosovo were to be closed down and the banking system deregulated under the supervision of western financial institutions narco dollars from the multi billion dollar balkans drug trade were recycled towards servicing the external debt as well as financing the costs of reconstruction the lucrative flow of narco dollars thus insures that foreign investors involved in the reconstruction program were able to reap substantial returns in turn the existence of a kosovar narco state insures the orderly reimbursement of international donors and creditors the latter turned a blind eye they had a tacit vested interest in installing a government that facilitates the laundering of drug money ibid washington threatened to cut off aid if yugoslavia did not hold elections in 1990 further stipulating that these elections were to be conducted only within the various republics and not at the federal level us leaders using the national endowment for democracy various cia fronts and other agencies funnelled campaign money and advice to conservative separatist political groups described in the us media as pro west and the democratic opposition greatly outspending their opponents these parties gained an electoral edge in every republic save serbia and montenegro as economic conditions in the fry went from bad to worse the government of the slovene republic opted for disassociation and a looser confederation in 1989 slovenia dosed its borders and prohibited demonstrations by any of its citizens who opposed the drift toward secession other us moves to fragment yugoslavia came when the bush administration pressured congress into passing the 1991 foreign operations appropriations act this law provided aid only to the separate republics not to the yugoslav government further weakening federal ties arms shipments and military advisers poured into the secessionist republics of slovenia and croatia particularly from germany and austria to kill a nation the attack on yugoslavia michael parenti p 26 the not so hidden hand of the cia the cias involvement was a matter of public record such headlines could be found in the manchester guardian november 17 1994 cia agents training bosnian army the london observer november 20 1994 america s secret bosnia agenda the european november 25 1994 the cia helps bosnia fight back charles boyd former deputy commander of the us european command commented the popular image of this war is one of unrelenting serb expansion much of what the croatians call the occupied territories is land that has been held by serbs for more than three centuries the same is true of most serb land in bosnia what the western media frequently refer to as the 70 percent of bosnia seized by rebel serbs in short the serbs were not trying to conquer new territory but merely to hold onto what was already theirs charles c boyd making peace with the guilty the truth about bosnia foreign affairs september october 1995 and with a wave of the wand the kla are no longer terrorists having already chosen the instrument of ground troops to split yugoslavia the kla in february 1998 the us state department removes kla from its list of foreign terrorist organisations near the end of that same month robert gelbard america s special encoy to bosnia says the kosovo liberation army kla is an islamic terrorist organisation i know a terrorist when i see one and these men are terrorists robert gelbard the kla terrorists or freedom fighters bbc june 1998 germany however was active in the kosovar community by 1996 in 1996 germany started building up offices in tirana and rome to select and train prospective kla cadres rise of the kosovar freedom fighters may 1999 le monde diplomatique most of the klas revenue came from drug trafficking and was connected to the mafia in switzerland and germany ibid the united states had no qualms about utilising a terrorist and drug pushing criminal outfit like the kla and waving their wand and making them respectable statesmen to fulfil their geopolitical lust for power the kla would be the ground troops and nato would provide the aerial bombardment a year later to slaughter the yugoslavs into submission media blitzkreig imperialists crowing about ethnic cleansing every empire has cloaked it s violent and bloody conquest as some act of humanitarian good the europeans of the conquest of the globe in the colonial era did so under the language of civilising savages or the white mans burden they did this all the while looting and submitting local populations in africa asia and india with the utmost brutal savagery the us has been no different and needs to cloak it s incredible violence it delivers to the world under the fake concern of human rights or democracy thus the us began it s moral crusade in yugoslavia to stop the genocidal serbs the yugoslav army was described in western media as serbian by 1992 it was predominantly serbian but contained numerous other nationalities including ethnic hungarians turks egyptians roma slovaks gorani jews and even draftees from croat and albanian populations to kill a nation the attack on yugoslavia michael parenti p 130 it was natos primary lie that the yuygoslav government was involved in ethnic cleansing of the yugoslav province of kosovo as the left labour party participated in the brutal bombing campaign with the same vigour they would show iraq it was left to another right winger conservative alan clark to arrive at the same conclusions of those utilising the marxist scientific method just three days after the attack on yugoslavia he addressed the left labourites in the scathing terms how have you swallowed the cia funded propaganda that demonises the serbs are you not familiar with the duplicity and intimidation of united states foreign policy that ambassador walker in charge of monitoring forces in bosnia was financing the contras have you no recall of that free world crap that embraced batista noriega syngman rhee bao dai lee van thieu and sukarno he followed this up with the united states air force is another case altogether over many years its record has been abominable whether we are talking about iranian air liners british soldiers in personnel carriers bridges trains factories or apparently refugee convoys in yugoslavia that air force is the worst instrument the house might think to let loose in a conflict where the distinction between combatant and non combatant is often variable and elusive it will not be lost on the house that it is an order from the pentagon that has prevented the somewhat muddled and inchoate nato press office from showing the video of the attack on the refugee convoy my heart sank when i heard that a contingent from the number 10 press office was being sent to brussels to help nato to put a spin on things one does not spin details of accident and bloodshed the kosovo liberation army contains a criminal element clark saysthe house should consider the interaction of national and military complexities and susceptibilities the honourable member for linlithgow was howled down for reminding the house of the criminal element terrorist conduct and many undesirable aspects of the kla but that has been confirmed by many including in a long article in the wall street journal mr jeremy bowen the bbc correspondent was stopped by members of the kla and all his money and equipment was stolen the kla are exactly the sort of people british service men should never fight alongside it has been suggested that we should undertake to arm the kla labour members may recall the contras the sandinistas and other groups who were armed by the cia that is the company that we will be in if we arm the kla alan clark a clumsy war may 13 1999 bbc from 500 000 buried in mass graves to 200 000 to 100 000 to 10 000 to a few hundred in march 18 1999 a week before the aerial attacks on yugoslavia began david scheffera state department ambassador at large for war crime issues announced that we have upwards of about 100 000 men that we cannot account for in kosovo a month later the state department announced that up to 500 000 kosovo albanians were missing and feared dead in mid may us secretary of defense william cohen a former republican senator serving in president clinton s democratic administration stated that 100 000 military aged men had vanished and might have been killed by the serbs not long after as public support for the war began to wane ambassador scheffer escalated the 100 000 figure to as many as 225 000 ethnic albanian men aged between fourteen and fifty nine who remained unaccounted to kill a nation the attack on yugoslavia p 147 michael parenti he considered this one of the very greatest genocidal crimes against a civilian population indeed it was if it happened as the war dragged on and nato officials saw press attention drifting toward the contrary story namely that the bombing was killing civilians nato stepped up its claims about serb killing fields notes the wall street journal widely varying but horrendous figures from official sources went largely unchallenged by the media support for the bombings remained firm among clinton supporters in congress including the one professed socialist bernie sanders and among self described humanitarian groups such as human rights watch doctors without borders and concern worldwide along with peace groups and various ngos many of whom seem to have convinced themselves that nato was defending kosovo from a holocaust toward the close of the air campaign british foreign office minister geoff hoon said that in more than 100 massacres some 10 000 ethnic albanians had been killed a figure substantially reduced from the 100 000 to 500 000 bandied about by us officials a day or two after the bombings stopped the associated press and other news agencies echoing hoon reported that the serbs had massacred 10 000 albanians no explanation was given as to how this figure was arrived at given that not a single war site had yet been investigated and nato forces were just beginning to roll into kosovo the kosovo based council for the defense of human rights and freedoms staffed in part by kla officials first promulgated the figure of 10 000 missing purportedly based on interviews with refugees the us state department and western media parroted the council s estimate but the number had to be taken on faith because the council refused to share its list of missing persons humanitarian organisations kla leaders nato and state department officials and the news media fed off each other s stories through a process of unconfirmed assertion and tireless repetition evidence became irrelevant unsubstantiated references to mass graves each purportedly filled with hundreds or even thousands of albanian victims were daily publicised as established facts from june through august 1999 the new york times alone ran eighty articles nearly one a day that made some reference to mass graves in kosovo yet when it came down to hard evidence the graves seemed to disappear as the fbi soon discovered in mid june the fbi sent a team to investigate two of the sites listed in the war crimes indictment against slobodan miosevic one said to contain six victims and the other twenty the team lugged 107 000 pounds of equipment into kosovo to handle what was called the largest crime scene in the fbi s forensic history but some weeks later the fbi team returned home maintaining an odd silence about its investigation months later it reported having found not thousands but two hundred bodies at thirty sites investigators from other nato countries had similar experiences french investigators were frustrated at izbica reported the new york times when a widely publicized mass grave in which they expected to find about 150 bodies turned out to be empty it must have been dug up with a backhoe and the bodies spirited off investigators said between the indictment and the arrival of nato troops a spanish forensic team was told to prepare for at least 2 000 autopsies but found only 187 bodies usually buried in individual graves and showing no signs of massacre or torture contrary to the stories circulated by humanitarian groups and local residents most seemed to have been killed by mortar shells and firearms one spanish forensic expert emilio perez puhola said that his team did not find any mass graves he dismissed the widely publicized references about mass sites as being part of the machinery of war propaganda ibid by november even the daily mail was forced to print the whole war seems to have been a big lie 5 november 1999 le monde diplomatique characterised the propaganda as in order to justify their own use of force western forces denounced serbian intransigence and exaggerated the gravity of the situation on the ground calling it a genocide and putting forward fake news that was taken up by a host of media outlets kosovo s open wounds twenty years on march 2019 le monde diplomatique lieutenant general satish nambiar former deputy chief of staff of the indian army and head of un forces deployed in yugoslavia 1992 93 offered this observation portraying the serbs as evil and everybody else as good was not only counter productive but also dishonest according to my experience all sides were guilty but only the serbs would admit that they were no angels while the others would insist that they were why were the serbs targeted they were the largest and most influential nationality in the former yugoslavia with a proportionally higher percentage of communist party membership than other nationalities they were the only ones to give up an independent state in order to enter a unified state whats more in the 1989 elections the serbians and montenegrins supported the former communists over the us backed democrats in their respective republics the serbs were soon to find that not supporting what the west wants you to support will paint a target on your back the propaganda against serbia started early on in the decade slovenia s independence was backed by a mass propaganda campaign of vivid reports of non existent batttles exaggerated casualty figures and alleged yugoslav serbian army atrocities to kill a nation michael parenti p 82 the nationalists in slovenia were helped by the imf and world bank who would only loan to independent states not yugoslavia as a whole the croats and muslims did the same by conjuring up images of a dehumanised communist serbian threat to europe all the while white washing the fascists who had worked hand in glove with nazi germany in croatia the propaganda became more and more deranged the bbc claimed to millions of listeners on a radio show that serb snipers were paid 2 700 ff for every child killed to kill a nation michael parenti p 85 the london daily mirror reported that a bosnian woman died after being forced to give birth to a dog ibid variations on this bizarre story were carried also in germanys bild am sonntag and italys la repubblica with lurid details of how fiendish serbian gynaecologists implanted canine fetuses in the woman s womb ibid along with references to rape camps and death camps ibid these stories were launched by roy gutman who invited comparisons to extermination camps run by the nazis he was awarded a pulitzer prize for his stories but after gaining access to all of bosnia herzegovina un forces failed to unearth any evidence to support the existence of these death camps the press just seemed to ignore what they had been screeching about for the last couple of years all save british journalist joan phillips who took the time to retrace gutman s steps she discovered that he had visited the serbian camps at omarska and tmopolje only after publishing the articles in which he had described them as death camps she also discovered that trnopolje was not a death camp and probably not entirely a detention camp many of its inmates entered of their own volition to escape the fighting in nearby villages and omarska was run by civil authorities as a kind of temporary holding center gutman s story about the omarska camp phillips reports rested on the testimony of one man who admitted that he had not witnessed any killings himself but once saw eight bodies covered with blankets to kill a nation michael parenti p 87 ethnic cleansing nato style with the help of the kla most of the ethnic cleansing throughout the former yugoslavia was not perpetrated by the serbs but against them more than one million serbs were driven from their ancestral homes in the breakaway republics some were triply displaced uprooted from croatia into bosnia then fleeing to kosovo and finally ending up in what remained of unoccupied serbia in the year 2000 the rump nation of yugoslavia hosted more displaced persons per capita than just about any other nation including some 300 000 who had always lived in serbia but were internally displaced by the nato bombing and related hardships to kill a nation p 155 michael parenti nato forces entered kosovo on 8 june 1999 within just three weeks of that entry 70 000 serbs had been forced to flee through murder beatings house burnings and the torching of entire villages in other words ethnic cleansing on a grand scale allegedly to stop which nato had launched and prosecuted its war of aggression against yugoslavia for 78 days and this ethnic cleansing took place right under the noses of the nato soldiery 35 000 strong who did nothing to stop it kosovo the narco state the independent and obedient statelet carved out by nato the us seemed to use it s formula familiar to latin america or afghanistan that is the use of the drug trade to finance right wing separatists against socialists and communists or even nationalists of some stripe that believed their people deserved at least more than a threadbare existence during world war 2 the albanian fascist militia in western kosovo expelled seventy thousand serbs and brought in about an equal number of albanians from albania in north eastern kosovo you could find the nazi 21st ss division manned by kosovo albanian volunteers massacred thousands of serbs they forced thousands more to flee the province to kill a nation michael parenti p 95 the division contributed to the holocaust by participating in the roundup and deportation of jews from kosovo and macedonia kosovo s next masters foreign affairs may june 1999 yugoslav communist leader josip broz tito made kosovo metohija an autonomous region in attempt to placate albanian nationalism tito did little to discourage the albanian campaign to ethnically cleanse kosovo of non albanians between 1945 and 1998 kosovo s population of serbs turks roma gorani montenegrins and several other ethnic groups shrank from some 60 percent to about 15 percent to kill a nation michael parenti p 96 meanwhile ethnic albanians grew from 40 to 85 percent ibid for once the new yorks time displayed a rare moment of truth in 1987 ethnic albanians in the government have manipulated public funds and regulations to take over land belonging to serbs slavic orthodox churches have been attacked and flags have been torn down wells have been poisoned and crops burned slavic boys have been knifed and some young ethnic albanians have been told by their elders to rape serbian girls as the slavs flee the protracted violence kosovo is becoming what ethnic albanian nationalists have been demanding for years an ethnically pure albanian region new york times november 1 1987 the besieged serbs were largely ignored until 1987 when the new president of the serbian communist party slobodan milosevic used the issue to strengthen the party faction that supported a firmer line against alabanian secessionists two years later at milosevic s initiative the federal government repealed the 1974 federal constitution that had allowed kosovo to exercise a de facto veto over federal policies large numbers of albanians who refused to accept belgrade s reassertion of authority were fired from state employment albanians began organising alternative institutions and boycotting federal ones including elections kosovo albanian separatists refused to pay their federal customs duties tensions ran high but remained well short of open warfare to kill a nation michael parenti p 98 political confrontation took on a violent and military conflict through the efforts of the kla kosovan liberation army the kla s origins remain murky most place it s beginnings in 1996 wikipedia states their active dates as 1992 1993 but relatively passive until 1996 as shown earlier in this article 1996 was the year the german secret service started training kla cadres their funding coming in from german and swiss and mafia with links to the drug trade at first the kla was an odd assortment of grouplets gangsters mercenaries brother owners and fascists and again as shown in this article the us state department considered them terrorists until 1998 the kla directed its campaign of terror against serbian targets in kososvo dozens of police stations police vehicles headquarters of the socialist party serbian villagers farmers officials and professionals in an effort to provoke reprisals and radicalise other kosovo albanians to kill a nation michael parenti p 99 the kla assasinated fry federal republic of yugoslavia public service workers from police inspectors to forest service workers postal employees and public utility workers ibid between 1996 1998 more than half the victims were ethnic alabanians labelled collaborators ibid any albanian villagers and burnt their homes if they did not join the organisation ibid the balkan route is a principal thoroughfare for an illicit drug traffic worth 400 billion annually according to interpol kla linked to enormous heroin trade police suspect drugs helped finance revolt san francisco chronicle wednesday may 5 1999 in the words of a november 1997 statement issued by interpol the international police agency kosovo albanians hold the largest share of the heroin market in switzerland in austria in belgium in germany in hungary in the czech republic in norway and in sweden ibid the kla was a huge drug trafficker and used it s finances it secured through this illicit trade to fund it s violent confrontation with the yugoslav state this is according to europol european police organisation germany s federal criminal agency france s geopolitical observatory of drugs and janes intelligence review even christopher hill us chief negotiator and architect of the rambouillet agreement felt compelled to criticise the kla for dealing drugs ibid the kla atacks continued before triggering a major response from yugoslav police and paramilitary free market murder the bombing of yugoslavia was consistently rational to get rid of your competition the republics that would go on to declare their independence in the early 90s then the culmination of the bombing of yugoslavia in 1999 was completely rational yugoslavia had a lot of its own industry particularly for export and the foreign policy objective was to utterly smash the country to divide the country fund opposition and pro democracy groups read pro west and pro capitalist restoration to break them up from one big nation with one of the largest standing militaries in europe to a bunch of right wing little statelets completely at the mercy of international capital so thoroughly picked apart and divided they would never rise again they would never be competitive on the world market again not even as a bourgeois capitalist nation yugoslavia had industries that were competitive on the world market from white goods to their automotive industries to pharmaceutical companies that produced medicines which undercut western corporations the yugo was the most popular car in yugoslavia and sold 180 000 of them in the us nato s attacks reveal a consistent pattern that underwrote it s political agenda the confederation of trade unions of serbia produced a list of 164 factories destroyed by the bombings all of them were state owned not a single foreign owned company was targeted provisional assessment of civilian casualties and destruction in the federal republic of yugoslavia from 24 march to 8 june 1999 people s weekly world june 13 1999 weapons of mass destruction used by nato yugoslavia was a testing ground for the use of depleted uranium vast quantities were dropped on kosovo and serbia depleted uranium is a highly radioactive tipped munitions being 68 percent denser than lead they re design was to penetrate armoured vehicles a lot of focus is on the radioactive nature of the chemical weapon but they also produce incredible amounts of highly damaging to human health chemicals which enter the air as fine dust particles or vapour as munitions break up if they become airborne again they can be inhaled or ingested days weeks even months or years later so you do not have to be inside or near a tank when it is hit to be at risk of absorbing these dangerous substances the chemical effects of du le monde diplomatique february 2001 the 9th edition 1976 of the merck index 1 one of the world s bibles of chemistry describes uranium and its salts as extremely toxic causing dermatitis renal lesions acute arterial necrosis possibly resulting in death the same book describes at length the lesions characteristic of chronic poisoning by the metal and its oxides pulmonary fibrosis and changes to the blood with a reduction in the number of red and white corpuscles lymphocytes the nervous system can also be affected and there is the possibility of nephritis chronic hepatitis gastritis and other symptoms ibid twenty years after the bombing of yugoslavia we are seeing an increase in oncological diseases primarily systemic ones such as lymphomas and leukaemia and then solid cancerous tumours and the most tragic thing is that compared with the european average we have 2 5 times more children with cancer side effects of nato s yugoslavia campaign cancer sterility mental disorders sputnik may 2019 the complete effects of the use of this chemical weapon still aren t completely known after the us conducted it s criminal and sadistic bombing of depleted uranium on fallujah iraq had more infant mortality cancer and leukaemia than nagasaki and hiroshima after the us dropped the nuclear bomb on them toxic legacy of us assault on fallujah worse than hiroshima july 2010 the independent expanding nato and kosovos failed economy 20 years onward and the former yugoslav provinces slovenia croatia montengro and kosovo are all nato members camp bondsteel one of the largest us bases in europe is located not far from kosovo s capital pristina camp bondsteel was a detention and torture site during the afghanistan and iraq wars now that kosovo has essentially been amalgamated into the american empire and acts as a giant us base to torture the people of the middle east it s economy is a cruel joke gdp per capita is amongst the lowest in the region and it s unemployment rate sits at a staggering 31 percent the country relies on money coming in from emigrants working in western europe kosovo s open wounds twenty years on march 2019 le monde diplomatique house always wins the same nato countries vying for contracts to rebuild ex yugoslavia were the same ones that bombed it to smithereens there were no winners in this war bar the imperial bandits even for the imperialist countries it cost the nato countries 20 billion to bomb yugoslavia this will inevitably be paid for by the proletariat the working class who will be asked to tighten their belts to consume less and produce more the war damage to yugoslavia was upwards of 100 billion in damage 14 percent of the 20 billion was to be paid by britain the british government began implementing spending cuts as a result cuts to lone parent benefits done away with free university tuition and abolished maintenance grants the incredible amount of money for adventures and imperialist banditry can always be found though to bomb countries into oblivion whether it s in yugoslavia afghanistan iraq libya or syria the financial times on 1st june 1999 was relatively candid about the immorality and imperial bandits making hand over fist whilst bombs dropped on civilians wars have always provided opportunities for the defence industry to make money for most people the conflict in kosovo conjures up images of refugees huddling in make shift camps or bombs exploding in the centre of belgrade for some fund managers though the conflict has also highlighted the attractions of shares in defence aerospace suppliers peter thal larsen financial times 1 june 1999 the financial times of 16 june reported that the british trade and industry secretary stephen byers has set up a kosovo regeneration taskforce composed of officials from government ministries as well as the cbi and construction companies in order to grab the lion s share of the 7 billion reconstruction contracts expected to be awarded for making good the destruction and devastation caused by nato bombardment in kosovo alone british hopes of participating in reconstruction says the financial times were given a head start yesterday as the government and private sector members of the taskforce shared intelligence on the situation in kosovo the us is to demand a role for american companies in the rebuilding of kosovo as european groups vie for contracts in the reconstruction of the balkans financial times 16 june 1999 such a display of bankrupt morality from monopoly capitalism and it s willing lackeys in government media and corporations making money hand over fist to wrought unbelievable destruction on a country then go back to pick up your second cheque for reconstruction such a frank display of madness but ladies and gentlemen these people are not mad they merely operate like the mafia one department flattens a store with dynamite and the second picks up the reconstruction contracts a tribute to the yugoslavia that fought back the united states started this war based on lies the united states did it s best to characterise milsovic as a new hitler even as nato rained bombs on libraries schools hospitals and even the chinese embassy as they were still reporting on the war against yugoslavia a few years after this war they would start another with afghanistan and then iraq based on more lies and war propaganda then libya then syria we salute the resistance led by the yugoslav army against the biggest empire the world has ever seen the bourgeois capitalists that make billions by engineering war are emperors with no clothes once we begin to tug at the threads of the bourgeois they will unravel and the world will see them for what they are paper tigers we will then consign capitalist imperialism to the dust bin of history
bloomberg it may be too early to buy the dips in emerging markets but investors are finding opportunities to stay engaged with the asset class amid the sell off shorting the most vulnerable currencies buying the less volatile markets or extending duration are among the strategies picked by strategists at big financial firms including bbva wells fargo and morgan stanley to get around the trade war as a deal between the u s and china before the g 20 summit in late june grows increasingly unlikely investors say it is time to get selective reasons for caution are everywhere developing nation stocks are headed toward their worst month since october while 19 out of 22 currencies tracked by bloomberg are down in may as investors scale back their exposure to risk investors have largely given up on the positive scenario but the worst case is also not priced citi strategists led by dirk willer wrote in a report it s prudent to keep risks low here are some of investors and analysts trade ideas long euro short czech koruna for morgan stanley the czech republic s economy is more exposed to a slowdown in global trade and growth which is likely to happen as a result of the trade spat between the world s two largest economies strategists led by james lord are recommending shorting the koruna funded with euros on a bet that the czech currency will continue to weaken toward the 26 1 per euro level we stay long eurczk as a trade for heightened trade tensions and global growth concerns strategists wrote in a friday note short asian currencies asian economies should be impacted by any slowdown in china s economic activity as a result of additional tariffs so shorting these currencies against the dollar can offer some gains according to citi and wells fargo in emfx we are long usd asia defensive elsewhere citi strategists led by willer wrote in a note friday they are recommending expressing this bet via a dollar versus indian rupee call spread and a bearish offshore yuan position by paying points brendan mckenna a strategist at wells fargo in new york says that investors should bet against any currencies with a high exposure to chinese risk in particular he s betting against the korean won the philippine peso and the taiwanese dollar outside of asia he says the usual suspects that are susceptible to trade risk will be hard hit and people should stay away from the brazilian real mexico s peso the chilean peso and the south african rand societe generale on the other hand is recommending investors short dollar versus offshore yuan in the two to four weeks leading up to the g 20 meeting in late june the asian currency could become meaningfully stronger in the short term if the pboc deploys more policy tools and if there s a positive development in china u s trade talks says jason daw head of emerging markets strategy at the bank he suggests a short dollar against the offshore yuan bet at 6 9045 with a target of 6 82 and a stop at 6 94 valuation not enough for satoru matsumoto a fund manager in tokyo at asset management one co with over 500 billion in assets under management attractive valuation isn t enough to start buying while emerging market asset prices have become relatively attractive growth concerns due to the lingering trade war could still put a downward pressure of both developed and developing markets from here he said like the south african rand which looks pretty attractive on the chart it is still not a good time to enter because it s vulnerable to the global and chinese economic slowdown and also as it is used as proxy to the em trade matsumoto said in a phone interview investors are looking for a good investment opportunity but it s actually quite difficult now extend duration as central banks around the world may adopt a more dovish stance in response to the impact of the trade war on global activity it makes sense to be long duration a position that profits from interest rates falling in the future some investors say citi strategists are long duration in brazil mexico china and thailand and bbva is extending duration on rates while limiting foreign exchange exposure alejandro cuadrado a senior strategist at bbva in new york says that while there is technical room for a rebound in currencies that looks unlikely as the external outlook remains clouded a full or immediate resolution to trade tensions seems unlikely cuadrado said the fact that em and particularly latam fx underperformed through 1q19 when the market was in full risk on and pricing u s chinese agreements growth rebounds a dovish fed and so forth makes a prolonged em latam fx rebound unlikely paul greer a london based money manager at fidelity international says he prefers rates over currencies because the latter is likely to be under pressure as trade tensions should remain elevated until the g 20 meeting in late june within em currencies remain the most sensitive part of our asset class to global growth global trade and the u s dollar said greer whose emerging market debt fund has outperformed 98 of peers this year after reducing risk in recent months within em local markets he prefer local rates over fx especially duration in some of the lower beta asian and latam countries domestically driven stocks in equities jpmorgan asset management says it makes sense to bet on companies that depend more on the domestic market and are therefore protected to some extent from a trade slowdown even technology shares can be a good play if they are less dependent on external revenues according to richard titherington the firm s chief investment officer for emerging markets and asia pacific equities

after securing a powerful electoral mandate last week for a second five year term india s prime minister narendra modi has a unique opportunity to embrace economic reforms without populist hues this is also an imperative because economic factors will decide india s power in its subcontinent and elsewhere according to experts at the university of pennsylvania and elsewhere the results of the latest election show that india s voters are willing to shrug off the lackluster economic performance of the modi government s first term that began in 2014 and give him a second chance the experts noted modi 2 0 has its task cut out unemployment is at a 45 year high acute agrarian distress has caused farmer suicides the banking system is weak and undercapitalized with poor credit disbursements and the economy continues to suffer painful effects of the november 2016 demonetization of high value currencies and the introduction of a unified indirect tax regime in mid 2017 the bjp led national democratic alliance nda stormed back to power in an unexpected show of strength in elections to the lok sabha the lower house of the indian parliament held in april and may as many have noted this represents the world s greatest exercise in democracy some 600 million of an eligible 900 million voters participated including an estimated 45 million young people who were voting for the first time the nda won 353 seats of the 542 seats that went to polls in the 543 seat lok sabha authorities canceled the election in one constituency after tax officials found a large stash of unaccounted cash in a politician s house the bjp won 303 seats 21 more than it did in 2014 the nda added 17 seats between the two elections these elections among the most divisive and fractious in recent times were a contest between modi and rahul gandhi president of the indian national congress the prime ministerial candidate proposed by a coalition of bjp s rivals the congress led united progressive alliance won just 90 seats though these were 30 more than in 2014 the congress party won 52 seats eight more than in 2014 gandhi himself lost his seat in amethi in uttar pradesh which had been a congress stronghold for three decades he however won an election in wayanad in kerala state another constituency from which he had contested so he will return to parliament three days after the elections gandhi accepted responsibility for the party s electoral rout and offered to step down and as was widely expected the congress leadership did not accept his resignation pivoting politically and economically the bjp s continuation in power marks a historic turning point for india politically and perhaps eventually economically notes marshall bouton acting director and visiting scholar at the center for the advanced study of india at the university of pennsylvania he spoke about the elections on may 24 on the knowledge at wharton radio show on siriusxm listen to the podcast at the top of this page the results also have the seeds of an economic turning point since most voters seemed to ignore the previous modi government s disappointing performance on the economy bouton recalled that when the modi government came to power in 2014 it had promised sabka vikas or economic growth for all those hopes were unfulfilled he pointed out younger india has aspirations for a stronger india and a stronger person representing india and they re willing to give a second chance marshall bouton the demonetization exercise in 2016 had overnight sucked out 86 of the cash in circulation and was debilitating for businesses of all sizes especially small and medium enterprises and the informal sector which could not easily switch to a cashless digital system it shaved off at least 2 percentage points from the country s gdp growth rate according to a study by the national bureau of economic research it also slowed credit disbursements from banks which were already hurting from an overhang of bad loans and a liquidity crunch moreover industrial capacity utilization dropped to a quarterly average of less than 75 last year from 83 in 2011 the unemployment rate reached a 45 year high of 6 1 in 2017 2018 according to an expose by the business standard newspaper based on data from the government run national statistical commission the government allegedly sought to suppress publication of the data leading to the resignation of two nsc members government programs launched with fanfare such as mudra yojana aimed to provide funding for small and micro level enterprises have struggled to meet their goals businesses also faced teething pains in switching over to the goods and services tax introduced in july 2017 the gst sought to replace an assortment of state and central indirect taxes on goods and services with a unified single tax structure but suffered from shoddy implementation against that backdrop of a very mixed record of the modi government s economic performance none of us thought this outcome was likely was on the spectrum of possibilities said bouton we all thought the bjp would take a big haircut in this election because modi had raised huge expectations in the 2014 campaign about job creation better governance and so forth most of which were disappointing bouton believes the election results show that younger india has aspirations for a stronger india and a stronger person representing india and they re willing to give a second chance a matter of identity according to bouton a defining aspect of the election was that indians were looking for a single national leader and a desire for a clearer representation of what it means to be indian those sentiments ran deep and were clearly widespread as evidenced by the record voter turnout of 67 those sentiments also made modi an obvious choice for many voters nobody could compare to modi in terms of his political domination of the landscape in india certainly no regional leader and of course not even rahul gandhi said bouton adding that gandhi consistently put it in a very lackluster performance as the leader of the congress party state level regional parties also did not have the organizational strength that could compare with that of the bjp he added there is a new political culture in which people in india are looking first and foremost for a leader with whom they can identify and who in their minds embodies their aspirations their political aspirations their social aspirations and their economic aspirations notes bouton that allowed modi to make the argument that he is that man one survey showed that 32 of bjp voters would not have voted for the nda if modi had not been the prime ministerial candidate according to milan vaishnav director and senior fellow in the south asia program at the carnegie endowment for international peace he was speaking at a panel discussion hosted by the brookings institution after the election results this idea that modi is a decisive leader who is incorruptible who operates with clean intent and with national interest at heart is something many voters latched onto he said there is a new political culture in which people in india are looking first and foremost for a leader with whom they can identify and who in their minds embodies their aspirations marshall bouton in the campaigning before the 2014 elections modi had promised achche din or good times good days and other promises such as weeding out corruption this time none of those promises were made vaishnav noted it was all about i am the best person to protect india i am the chowkidar or the watchman for india bouton points out that modi seized the opportunity after an attack by a pakistan based terrorist group on february 14 in jammu and kashmir s pulwama district claimed the lives of 40 police personnel in response on february 26 the indian air force deployed mirage 2000 jets to drop bombs on balakot pakistan india claimed it had destroyed a terrorist camp and killed several terrorists a view that pakistan disputes these events transformed the key issues on the minds of voters two months before the elections as modi and other bjp leaders unleashed waves of nationalist rhetoric positioning him as a strong leader whose presence was needed to protect india s security interests exit congress system enter hindutva the election outcome represents a turning point politically because of the apparent end of the era where the congress party was dominant either as the party in power or in the opposition the 133 year old congress party had embedded itself deep in the indian electoral psyche as it had constantly reminded voters that it had led india to independence from british rule in 1947 and that mohandas karamchand gandhi arguably the most visible leader of the independence struggle was a party member this is the first time that we can say for sure that the so called congress system based on the congress party s dominance in the 1950s 60s 70s and 80s with india s politics is over notes bouton it is emphatically over and has been replaced by the bjp system where the bjp and its aspirations and identity now shape the entire indian political environment citing a map showing the extent of the bjp s winnings across the country in the latest election he says practically the entire country is colored orange or saffron the bjp s party color except for the very farthest southern states and a little bit of the east coast southeastern belt of india the reasons for that shift are clear to see in retrospect over the past 30 years that the bjp began to get political traction in india the congress system partly died from old age says bouton it had just run out of ideas and compelling political messages for the people of india another factor that contributed to the congress party s decline is that the so called nehru gandhi dynasty had dominated it throughout leaving it with few other national level leaders the lineage began with freedom fighter and independent india s first prime minister jawaharlal nehru who passed the mantle to his daughter indira gandhi no relation to mohandas gandhi next came her sons sanjay and rajiv daughter in law sonia grandson rahul and most recently her granddaughter priyanka as the gandhi family s spell over indian politics weakened steadily over the last 20 or 30 years along came a new definition of what it means to be indian notes bouton the independence movement and the nehru gandhi dynasty sought to project india as a secular nation in which many religious linguistic and ethnic identities could co exist easily he notes that is now being questioned and indeed has been undercut by the argument that india is essentially a hindu nation the idea of a hindu nation is not as much rooted in religion as it is a question of national identity according to bouton that identity has manifested itself as hindutva a nationalistic term used to convey a sense of hindu identity as hindus represent 80 of india s population of about 1 32 billion the advance of hindutva also raises questions about the future of minorities in india he says muslims account for about 14 of india s population in a speech after the elections modi stressed that minorities in india should not have to live any longer in fear the next five years how will the new modi government channel the extraordinary mandate he has secured according to bouton notwithstanding the pains that followed demonetization and gst modi appears to have the business community on his side he notes the business community is thrilled because above all it values stability and certainty sectoral ministries such as the ministry of fertilizers mines heavy industries it textiles and steel are targets for regulatory capture by well organized industry interests ravi aron signs of business support for modi were evident long before the elections the bjp went into the contest with significantly deeper pockets than the congress or other rivals according to a report in the guardian the association for democratic reforms estimates that the bjp took in more than 73 of the donations declared by india s seven largest political parties in 2017 18 the ruling party spent more than 260 million rupees on advertisements on facebook youtube google and instagram compared with 35 million rupees by the congress bouton notes that while the business community was apprehensive about some actions of the previous modi government it also had a desire to avoid a messy outcome in this election that would have produced an equally messy coalition government with a lot of uncertainty the stock markets cheered the election results india s benchmark index the sensex gained nearly 450 points to levels of 39 530 in the subsequent eight trading sessions the rupee too gained in value however both the stock index and the rupee later declined since the markets recognize that the indian economy continues to face formidable challenges and uncertainty continues to hover over the world economy because of trade disputes now that modi has secured his political position he may devote more attention to economic affairs many expect or hope that modi in his second term will return to his economic reforms based governance that he started with right after 2014 and that he will renew some of those reform efforts such as in the land markets and labor markets says bouton he also expects measures to improve the status of agriculture and address agrarian distress ravi aron professor at the johns hopkins carey business school points to three key areas in which the new government could prioritize economic reforms labor reforms divestment and privatization of state owned enterprises and unwinding protectionist policies that restrict foreign direct investment labor reforms could address flaws in the industrial disputes act and the resulting inflexible labor laws have choked the growth of manufacturing labor in india for more than 40 years now aron says the extreme inflexibility has made employers very reluctant to hire workers and has created perverse incentives for substitution of labor by capital for example the industrial disputes act requires businesses that employ 100 or more workers to seek prior permission from the government before retrenching workers or closing down their establishments according to a report that argues for more flexibility in labor laws aron however does not expect the modi government to do anything beyond slightly cosmetic changes with labor reforms there is no political will to take on narrow special interests or labor unions that are highly organized and entrenched he notes aron points out that the government could also proceed with divestment and privatization of some two dozen public sector undertakings psus that already has cabinet approval privatizing psus will release capital for investment in areas like education and health care it could also help bring improved performance of psus he adds chronic production inefficiencies and poor returns on invested capital plague these psus as a result they increase the costs of inputs and lead to lower capacity utilization and a high cost low efficiency economy finally aron sees opportunities in select industries for greater private sector involvement and a reduced government role that is limited to monitoring sectoral ministries such as the ministry of fertilizers mines heavy industries it textiles and steel are targets for regulatory capture by well organized industry interests he notes attracting foreign investors india could attract more private capital from the u s and other countries if mr modi uses this opportunity to make india a more attractive place to invest according to bouton he credited modi with helping india improve its rank in the world bank s ease of doing business index over the last five years india s now ranks 77th among 190 countries compared with 134th in 2014 however india needs to do much more to become business friendly it s still one of the most complicated and difficult places to do business in says bouton there would have to be a very substantial further liberalizing of the investment environment specifically there is a compelling need to unwind protectionist policies that restrict fdi especially in retailing aron says indian policy makers have created a bewildering array of policy distinctions between single brand multi brand brick and mortar and online online marketplaces and wholesale cash and carry businesses he adds these are largely protectionist policies meant to help domestic businesses there is no political will to take on narrow special interests or labor unions that are highly organized and entrenched ravi aron regulatory easing would also help aron points to e commerce rules that impose limits on the types of businesses that online retailers could undertake this is an area where the government can move swiftly and without fear of political or populist backlash india has also failed to capitalize on the ongoing u s china trade war according to bouton the lost opportunity there is particularly painful when you consider that american companies that have invested heavily in china over the last 30 years are now looking for other places to put their investments and to put their supply chains he says india could benefit enormously from that new situation but it s going to need to move very aggressively to make that possible for global investors bouton believes the best way to tap into opportunities in india is to cater to its very aspirational near middle class or middle class population it also helps that the consumer sector is least affected by government regulation and intrusion he adds in the last two or three years the big u s investments in india have all been in the consumer sector that s the surest way to get a piece of the indian economy and of its growth trajectory without getting hobbled by regulation bouton says the modi government could boost such investments by pulling back from protectionist measures that hinder foreign investments commenting on modi s make in india campaign where global companies were invited to set up manufacturing facilities in india he notes if he wants to do that he s got to reverse course and again liberalize the investment environment in which case it becomes possible for american and other companies that are making in china and vietnam and elsewhere to come and make in india future challenges to be sure modi faces constraints in implementing economic reforms there are very few public resources available right now for the government to provide for instance a fiscal stimulus bouton says he notes that india s psus have limited resources and the government does not have the luxury of stretching its current account balance many in india are calling for a big fiscal stimulus at this point but that s going to be very difficult for to do without substantially increasing the current account deficit modi will be able to push through legislation with the nda s dominance in the lok sabha and potentially the rajya sabha the upper house of parliament as well however it will have to depend on individual states a lot of economic policy is implemented at the state level in india and that makes it much more complex to bring about real results says bouton the biggest challenge the new modi government faces is the slump or anemic growth in private investment a large part of that is because many indian companies are nursing high debt burdens and are in the process of deleveraging those high debt loads have saddled many banks especially public sector banks with nonperforming assets large enough to prevent substantial new lending the government would need to undertake a massive recapitalization of public sector banks in order to stimulate private investment but it faces an uphill task on that front bouton notes according to aron the modi government should try to tackle the toughest economic reforms in the first year of its new term the opposition is in disarray and the next election is at least four years away he says he notes that benefits from investments in education and healthcare could accrue to the government within its five year term relations with neighbors india s desire to strengthen its relationships with its neighbors in south asia especially pakistan also hinges on its economic might according to bouton the single most important thing prime minister modi can do to enable india s strong participation in the international system and in particular to gain leverage in his relationships with india s neighbors would be to improve the economy he says he believes that india should be able to achieve a gdp growth rate higher than the 7 7 5 bracket it has been at for the last few years it should be in the 8 or 9 or even 10 bracket however the degree of success india has in improving its relations with its neighbors depends also on the character of the regime in that country whether in bangladesh sri lanka the maldives or nepal he adds the single most important thing prime minister modi can do to enable india s strong participation in the international system would be to improve the economy marshall bouton among its neighbors india s biggest challenge is with pakistan bouton notes that while imran khan pakistan s prime minister publicly congratulated modi on his victory on may 23 the very same day pakistan launched a ballistic missile pakistan has not admitted to india s pre eminence in the subcontinent and one cannot foresee the day when they will bouton says the only way to change that over time is for india to have such a preponderance of power in the region secondly india ought to make it clear to pakistanis that they would benefit from greater integration with a dynamic indian economy he adds he expects modi to reach out to pakistan with an olive branch in the coming months economic success is the best lever modi could use also in trying to build a more balanced relationship with china the two countries had a tense face off in the summer of 2017 over china s military presence in the doklam plateau a border area between bhutan and china that india sees as a buffer zone the two countries nearly came to blows bouton says of that episode needs to keep things from getting too shaky i think he appreciates xi jinping has had the same objective but the rivalry is still very intense and it will continue india s ties with the u s are also critical and both modi and trump are convinced of that says bouton president trump has clearly put a lot of stock in the relationship and has moved on a number of directions to ensure it continues to develop although not so much on the economic front he adds there has been some nervousness on the indian side about whether president trump would be consistent in his hitherto positive approach to india hopefully they can now feel more confident about that the lure of populism while modi is the first prime minister in almost 50 years to lead his party to win a majority in successive elections he has done so by pushing forward a hindu nationalist agenda his re election also continues a global trend of populist candidates winning top seats including president trump in the u s jair bolsonaro in brazil and joko widodo in indonesia therein lies a danger populists are highly skilled at staying in power and pose an acute danger to democratic institutions according to a report in the atlantic based on a study of 46 populist leaders or parties worldwide between 1990 and the present modi should embrace hard nosed economic reforms and not succumb to politically expedient populism bouton notes in a recent op ed article in the new york times columnist ruchir sharma noted that although modi in 2014 led the bjp to power on a reaganesque promise of minimum government he has wielded the tools of state control at least as aggressively as his predecessors he noted that during the latest campaign modi went toe to toe with rivals vying to see who could offer the most generous welfare programs and it appears to have worked bouton notes that although many expected modi to be a consistent powerful reformer back in 2014 he turned in a more populist direction because in india if you want to get reelected that s the expectation voters have of you the government had its back to the wall facing criticism that it had failed to deliver on its promises of doubling farm incomes raising minimum support prices for crops and making procurement more efficient not surprisingly the government s interim budget unveiled weeks before the election included a rs 75 000 crore 10 6 billion package of cash handouts to small farmers where each would get rs 6 000 88 a year having criticized the previous congress led government for pushing money into airplanes and dropping it over the farm sector he s done exactly the same in the last year to try to quiet the agrarian distress before the election bouton says but now with the election behind him modi may not feel the need for populist policies if he wants to be truly transformative he must focus on reforms that will power the indian economy in the near term into a substantial middle income economy and eventually into a first world economy according to bouton at the same time for political reasons indians feel confident about what the government is doing for them it s a very delicate and difficult transition that must be made one can only hope that now so empowered modi will feel able to try that

as global companies analyze where to locate capital investment they are faced with a very complex and ever changing global business environment that is being disrupted by geopolitical considerations around trade tax and economic policy further companies are balancing these geopolitical considerations with speculation from economists that the global economy may fall into recession at some point in 2019 despite strong u s economic growth despite these potential challenges or perhaps because of them the u s is well positioned to attract foreign direct investment fdi due to myriad factors such as u s tax reform reconfiguration of global supply chains aggressive economic development policies and an overall stable business environment global economic and geopolitical uncertainty is affecting the day to day capital investment decisions of companies in virtually every industry and region of the world whether they are middle market german firms or global 100 south korean organizations an annual survey conducted in 2018 by the conference board a global business think tank revealed that ceos viewed a recession as the single largest concern for 2019 looking back at the same survey one year prior the fear of recession barely made the list of the ceos top 20 concerns ranking 19th these global economic vitality concerns also need to be balanced by geopolitical considerations such as the trump administration s america first policy brexit and european union negotiations and china u s trade relations over the last two years there has been an increase in protectionist trade measures and ensuing responses such as the u s section 301 tariffs on us 250 billion of chinese goods and china s tariffs on over 800 u s food and agricultural exports despite these complexities many global companies continue to analyze whether to expand existing u s operations acquire u s based companies or enter the u s market u s tax reform a significant consumer market reduced business regulations the relative ease of doing business and plentiful resources are some of the various factors that make the u s an attractive market in which to invest according to the united nations conference on trade and development s world investment report 2018 the u s was the largest beneficiary of fdi as compared with other countries it ranked first with approximately us 275 billion we would expect the u s to remain in the top ranking because of the country s tax reform and potential insulation from an impending recession in terms of a recession the u s seemingly is in a stronger position than most other developed or emerging economies national unemployment remains at historic lows approaching 3 8 percent in march 2019 the commerce department currently projects that the u s gross domestic product gdp grew at an annual rate of 3 2 percent in the first quarter of 2019 on a cumulative basis businesses that make up the s p 500 and nasdaq continue to regularly surpass all time stock price records on december 22 2018 president donald j trump signed into law the tax cuts and jobs act tcja significantly reducing the corporate and individual tax rates with a stroke of a pen the u s increased its competitiveness with other organization for economic cooperation and development countries by reducing the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent as well as permitting companies to immediately expense 100 percent of qualified property with a phase down not starting until 2023 global economic and geopolitical uncertainty is affecting the day to day capital investment decisions of companies in virtually every industry and region of the world this monumental corporate tax overhaul in addition to fostering a more favorable business regulatory environment has reduced the current and future economic burden of companies contemplating fdi into the u s as global companies contemplate potential u s investment they should have a comprehensive due diligence process in place to appropriately analyze operational tax financial and trade considerations while identifying opportunities to reduce costs through a proactive economic development strategy even though u s tax reform has been implemented the multilayer u s tax structure at the federal state and local levels is typically more complex than that of other foreign jurisdictions because of this complexity a company should create a thorough tax and financial model to take into consideration the various taxes that may affect their current and future investments in the u s taxes typically overlooked by foreign companies because of the differences between their home country and u s taxing regimes include local property taxes state and local sales taxes utility taxes local income and withholding taxes and various local fees associated with operating a business such as development connection impact or permitting fees further the creation of a tax and financial model allows a company to understand its potential cost outlays and determine where to prioritize potential economic development discussions with state and local jurisdictions to assist in mitigating the various taxes and costs of doing business additionally the subsidy and incentives opportunities in the u s are very different as compared with those in a significant number of other countries within the u s incentives can come in a variety of forms whether they be statutory i e as of right credits provided to companies if they meet various requirements or discretionary incentives that typically are negotiated with state and local economic development agencies companies should also review federal incentives opportunities such as the new markets tax credit work opportunity tax credit and research and development r d credit under the tcja congress created a new opportunity with the opportunity zone program which gives companies the ability to defer certain capital gains and potentially eliminate future capital gains it is important to note that state and local incentives usually provide the most lucrative assistance to companies but they may require a but for argument demonstrating that an alternative jurisdiction is being considered this but for concept and states proactive competition against one another are different than state aid restrictions in the european union for example once a company receives preliminary offers from the affected jurisdictions it can then build out its tax and financial model to take into consideration reductions to the overall costs of doing business in one jurisdiction versus another with a stroke of a pen the u s increased its competitiveness with other organization for economic cooperation and development countries by reducing the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent as well as permitting companies to immediately expense 100 percent of qualified property with a phase down not starting until 2023 upon reviewing the preliminary incentives offers the company should closely examine whether the proposed incentives package is realizable through the offsetting of a current or future tax above the line benefit e g indirect tax offset or refundable credit or operational offset e g infrastructure assistance for instance many states offer companies income tax credits that are limited in benefit to a company s state corporate income tax liability in many cases manufacturers have very little or no state corporate income tax due so this incentive would be of little to no value states that target manufacturers often have statutory sales tax exemptions that apply to a business s purchases of manufacturing machinery and equipment while it may seem as if an economic development agency is offering your company a great incentive deal by providing a big exemption your company may already be entitled to this benefit additionally to properly articulate the proposed project to relevant governmental agencies an economic impact report should be considered in addition to the direct jobs and investment the project would bring your investment will also have indirect and induced economic impacts on the community the hiring of construction workers the purchase of local services and products and the impact your business s suppliers will have at the state and local levels should all be considered for incentives purposes if the economic impact report sheds a positive light on the proposed project s impact to the community economic development and government officials can utilize the report to explain to their constituents why the level of incentives offered makes sense and benefits the community finally a company should also consider the constantly evolving trade agreements and policies that affect the business a sensitivity analysis whereby different tariff rates are applied to various inputs can help you understand the what ifs related to a trade war that is either escalated or resolved strategies focusing on duty deferral and elimination can also be modeled out as many planning opportunities are dependent on the geographic location of the site there is no end to what can be modeled and analyzed but the greatest amount of resources should be focused on the most significant variable costs in addition to incentives taxes and trade there are other financial and operational factors often deemed more important to the long term success of a project even though u s tax reform has been implemented the multilayer u s tax structure at the federal state and local levels is typically more complex than that of other foreign jurisdictions while u s unemployment remains below 4 percent at the national level every local labor market is unique certain regions of the country have higher unemployment accompanied with higher than ideal crime rates and varying minimum wage and labor laws in certain towns employees may be willing to drive up to one hour to their principal place of business while in other cities a commute longer than 20 minutes could be practically unheard of where labor availability of certain job positions is extremely tight or nonexistent without proper planning the cost of employing the needed workforce may make a project unsustainable transportation costs of moving in raw materials and shipping out finished products can vary tremendously depending on the chosen site proximity to infrastructure customers suppliers and ports of entry should all be taken into consideration and included in your cost model utility cost reliability and utility infrastructure make up some additional key considerations and the list goes on and on whatever factors are important to a company s u s investment decision through comprehensive due diligence and planning a business can make optimal investment decisions while achieving the highest return on investment
among some prominent policy wonks in america a profound rethink of fiscal policy has been underway for the last couple of years making the case for more expansionary or at least less contractionary fiscal policy japan already with a mountain of government debt and substantial budget deficits would seem to be an unlikely candidate for this revisionist thinking yet this is the message being promoted by one of america s leading policy economists not long ago olivier blanchard was chief economist at the bastion of fiscal probity the international monetary fund now at the peterson institute he has co authored a paper arguing that japan should abandon its plan to get the budget into balance by 2025 instead it should wait until the economy has clearly reached potential output with inflation rising from the current 1 to reach the target of 2 this is a radical message japan has run substantial budget deficits since the lost decades began in 1990 japan s gross public debt now equals 240 of gdp in a world where most advanced economies are concerned about their public debt levels japan has well over twice the norm of the countries in the organisation for economic cooperation and development moreover there don t seem to be powerful reasons for policy adjustment unemployment is a low 2 5 at first sight japan s recent growth rate might seem weak at around 1 but its working age population is falling by around half a million each year because of aging demographics growth in output per worker is among the highest in the oecd why then would blanchard favour delay in addressing japan s chronic budget deficit and huge public debt he sees the combination of low interest rates and low inflation as a sign of secular stagnation continuing deficits are needed to maintain demand running the economy hot keeping demand strong will encourage older workers to stay in the work force continue the process of encouraging more women to enter the labour force and might even give women higher skilled full time better paid more productive jobs japan s vigorous quantitative easing since 2012 has seen the bank of japan s bond holding equal to a year s gdp output photo narumi lock flickr perhaps just as important it would correct a notable imbalance between monetary and fiscal policy since shinzo abe came to power in 2012 the budget deficit has been reduced by 3 of gdp a strong contraction looking ahead to restore budget balance by 2025 implies continuing budgetary contraction at the same time monetary policy has been in energetic expansionary mode not only has the policy interest rate been essentially zero for a decade but policy has anchored long term bond yields at zero as a result of japan s vigorous quantitative easing qe since 2012 the bank of japan s bond holding is equal to a year s gdp output loose monetary policy creates distortions in financial markets boj s qe operations have purchased equities and other financial assets as well as nearly half the stock of government bonds it biases investment decisions and sets up longer term problems when interest rates return to normal if such expansionary policies are seen as necessary why is it sensible for fiscal policy to push hard in the opposite direction zero interest rates mean that monetary policy has done all it can do to promote growth but at the same time offer the opportunity for low cost fiscal expansion the received wisdom of conventional economics says that japan s austerity is necessary because public debt is too high the received wisdom of conventional economics says that japan s austerity is necessary because public debt is too high governments should observe the golden rule of balancing their budgets over the course of the cycle here blanchard s earlier analysis provides the counter argument when interest rates are low or for japan zero the economy can run a modest budget deficit without debt gdp rising in blanchard s example for japan with current interest rates and growth japan can continue to run budget deficits close to the current level without debt gdp rising the deficit is adding to debt the top of the ratio at the same pace as growth is adding to the denominator why risk growth by raising the value added tax blanchard s powerful caveat is that deficits are justified only if the expenditure is put to good use in particular to ensure stronger growth in potential output no more bridges to nowhere blanchard suggests that measures to increase labour force participation e g child care and make workers more productive are the justification for ignoring the golden rule at least until higher inflation signals that capacity has been reached blanchard has taken his us based arguments and applied them to another country japan is this part of a global wide rethink of fiscal policy that might apply say even to australia the policy interest rate here is low and many expect it to go lower the government can now borrow long term for well under 2 the critical relationship in the blanchard argument the difference between the nominal growth rate and the interest rate implies that a modest deficit is consistent with an unchanged public debt ratio and australia starts with a low public debt ratio by oecd comparisons at the same time both major political parties in the recent election firmly pledged to return the budget to surplus quickly with the inescapable implied commitment to undertake budgetary contraction japan s out of kilter monetary and fiscal policy mix is mirrored in australia stephen grenville

beijing president trump s trade war with china has prompted a broad rethinking of how the two economies have become so intertwined leading some manufacturers to trim supply chains in china and american authorities to start cutting off crucial technology for chinese companies now another important area is getting a close look financial markets some trade experts and others urging the trump administration to keep a hawkish stance are discussing whether the white house should curb china s access to wall street chinese companies have raised tens of billions of dollars through american financial markets in recent years stephen k bannon mr trump s former chief strategist said there were continuing efforts inside and outside the administration to rethink china s role in american stock markets in part because of a lack of transparency about the ultimate owners of chinese companies the new york stock exchange and nasdaq are breaching their fiduciary responsibility to institutional investors the pension funds of hardworking americans mr bannon said it s outrageous all of it should be shut down immediately
dashing hopes of a quick agreement on trade relations with china us president donald trump s administration has imposed punitive tariffs on another 200bn of chinese goods preview_thumbnail 10 cities for high salaries now that the chinese government has responded with new tariffs on 60bn of us products the united states is threatening tariffs targeting yet another 300bn of chinese imports both sides are now digging in for a long fight largely because americans have yet to feel the pain of trump s policies china has understood trump s transactional style for some time but it only recently began to appreciate fully the significance of trump s america first doctrine which according to us state department policy director kiron skinner rests on four pillars national sovereignty reciprocity burden sharing and regional partnerships national sovereignty and reciprocity are standard features of any country s foreign policy they form the foundations of the 1648 peace of westphalia which recognised after the thirty years war that sovereign states have their own interests to defend and must engage with other states on a reciprocal basis but the trump administration often takes reciprocity too far weakening america s capacity to build and maintain partnerships regional or otherwise indeed under trump the us has undercut the interests of its closest allies for its own narrow benefit even threatening to impose broad tariffs on automobile and auto part imports from the european union japan and south korea claiming that they pose a national security threat in any case the active ingredient of the trump doctrine is burden sharing skinner interprets this narrowly focusing on the need for america s nato allies to increase their defence spending what she does not acknowledge is that the us is also forcing the rest of the world to share the burden of its unsustainable structural savings deficit the us consistently runs both a fiscal deficit with total expenditure of which defence comprised 14 8 in 2017 significantly exceeding its income and a current account deficit if those twin deficits run at a trend rate of over 3 of gdp per annum net us debt to the rest of the world currently at 40 of gdp will double in less than 24 years the trump administration insists that the only deficit to worry about is the bilateral trade deficit with china but even if china bowed to us demands and eliminated the bilateral deficit america s imbalance of saving and investment would merely shift its external deficit like water in a squeezed balloon toward other surplus economies like the eu japan and south korea the targets of the threatened automotive tariffs for decades the us saving shortfall seemed like a problem to be managed not solved since the us started running structural deficits in the 1970s there has been a kind of global grand bargain on the topic the world willingly finances america s current account deficit in us dollars in exchange the us acts as a guarantor of free trade and global security the trump doctrine upends that bargain by weaponising america s economic leverage including the us dollar it aims to force the world to uphold its end with no guarantee that the us will respond in kind this approach will end up costing virtually everyone beginning with american consumers with its trade war the trump administration is engaging in tax subterfuge historically governments have addressed their excessive debts with tax increases spending cuts higher inflation with negative real interest rates or in the case of the roman empire conquest of creditors it seems to be politically impossible for the us government to raise taxes domestically so the trump administration has found a workaround tariff increases end up serving effectively as consumption taxes but because they can be blamed on foreigners they are more palatable to the american public from trump s perspective the costs of this approach appear low with the us economy still growing stock markets at record highs and unemployment at record lows jpmorgan has estimated that the trade war s direct costs will amount to just 0 2 of gdp for the us 0 4 of gdp for china and 0 22 of gdp for the rest of the world through 2020 but today s prosperity hinges mainly on the temporary effects of budget busting tax cuts and quantitative easing by the us federal reserve which expanded its balance sheet by 3 6tn from 2007 to 2017 it has since reduced that total by 391bn historically low interest rates and liquidity inflated asset bubbles financed the fiscal deficit and enabled the household sector to deleverage it was thanks largely to qe that us net wealth increased by 33 6tn from 2010 to 2018 that wealth was not however shared equally on the contrary the qe centred approach has deepened domestic inequality for example every time the s p 500 has dipped over the last decade corporate share buybacks amounting to 5 trillion from 2008 to 2018 provided a cushion this was technically good for growth the s p 500 index rose by a total of 319 from its 2009 trough to its march 2019 peak but trump s trade war is threatening even those narrowly shared and for the fed costly gains for the top 25 s p companies with a combined market capitalisation exceeding 20tn just under one third of revenues come from china and taiwan weighted average meaning that tariffs on chinese imports will hit profits tech giants that depend on chips components and software sales to china amounting to 20 65 of total revenue will face particularly high costs as will us shoe importers the trade war seems not to have caused much pain yet because financial markets assume perhaps wrongly that central banks will bail them out with more qe but after 117 consecutive months of economic expansion compared to an historical average of 48 months the us could soon find itself in a painful recession owing to disruptions caused by trump s trade war perhaps then it will be ready for a truce by andrew sheng and xiao geng

by some events give extraordinary insights into the biases of the economics profession the trade war with china clearly fit the bill the origins of the trade war can be traced to campaign promises trump made to go after china over its large trade surplus with the united states which he attributed to currency manipulation the argument was that by intervening in currency markets buying up u s dollars china was propping up the value of the dollar against its own currency this makes chinese goods and services relatively cheaper to u s consumers and makes u s goods more expensive to chinese purchasers the net effect is to increase u s imports of chinese goods and reduce u s exports to china thereby leading to a large trade deficit while most economists now acknowledge that china was intervening in currency markets in the last decade they did not acknowledge the currency intervention at the time they insist that this is no longer an issue china is no longer a large net buyer of dollar denominated assets so the argument goes therefore it is not currently keeping down the value of its currency against the dollar as i have argued elsewhere this argument ignores the effect of china holding well in excess of 3 trillion worth of dollar denominated assets its decision to hold a massive stock of dollar assets depresses the value of the chinese yuan against the dollar thereby maintaining the competitive advantage from a lower valued currency this is the same logic that applies with the fed s decision to hold trillions of dollars worth of assets that it acquired as part of its quantitative easing program even though the fed is not currently buying assets most economists argue that its holding of assets still works to keep down interest rates perhaps in the next decade they will acknowledge that the same relationship holds with china s massive stock of dollars and the relative value of the dollar and the yuan but for now they insist that currency intervention was only an issue in the past this is important background because currency values will directly affect our trade balance with china and thereby impact the number of manufacturing jobs in the united states while reducing the trade deficit will not get back most of the relatively high paying manufacturing jobs that were lost in the last decade it would likely still be a plus for relatively less educated workers who still rely on manufacturing as a source of higher paying jobs although currency is mostly off the table in trump s trade war intellectual property is very much on the table and here trump has the support of economists across the political spectrum who argue that he has a legitimate complaint even if they don t endorse his go it alone cowboy tactics the compliant is the china is not respecting our intellectual property this lack of respect takes two main forms one is simply not honoring the patents copyrights and trademarks of u s corporations the other is requiring technology transfers by u s corporations that locate operations in china this usually means taking on a domestic chinese company as a partner which will then gain expertise in the use of the u s company s technology it is very impressive how the bulk of the economics profession has been willing to legitimate the switch in focus of trump s trade war he had run around the country in his campaign denouncing china as a world class currency manipulator he pledged to take punitive actions against china for its currency practices on day one of his administration getting china to raise the value of its currency against the dollar actually would have provided some benefit to u s workers but now currency is off the table and we are fighting a trade war to protect our intellectual property if it s not obvious already it is not our intellectual property that trump and his bipartisan crew of economist cheerleaders are interested in protecting it is the intellectual property of large corporations like boeing ge pfizer and microsoft very few people in the united states are in a position where they have to worry about china using their patents or copyrights without compensation this is a real concern to many large u s corporations the question is whether it should be a concern to the rest of us most immediately the concerns of ordinary workers are likely to go in the opposite direction if companies like boeing and general electric don t have to worry about being forced to transfer technology to chinese companies when they outsource to china they will have more incentive to outsource to china that s about as straightforward as it gets instead of reducing our trade deficit in manufacturing goods this change is likely to increase it but this goes to an even deeper issue we have seen a massive increase in wage inequality over the last four decades most economists probably believe some version of the skills biased technical change story that new technologies have placed a greater premium on skills like math science and engineering while reducing the value of less educated workers trump s trade war gives us an insight into the real story it was not technology that led him to focus his efforts on protecting intellectual property to the neglect of currency issues it was a political decision made in response to the political power of the most affected groups and boeing ge and the rest have far more political power than the workers who labor in their factories or indeed less educated workers as a class trump and the political elites more generally are prepared to have a trade war to protect the intellectual property of large u s corporations and indirectly to benefit the more highly paid segment of the labor force they would not do the same to increase the employment and wage prospects for less educated workers the two thirds of the labor force without a college degree to be clear there is an issue that we should not be allowing china to take at no cost the technology that we spent hundreds of billions of dollars to develop that is a reasonable argument but that hardly implies that we need to force them to respect patent and copyright protection we need to ensure that china and other countries share in the cost of developing new technologies there are far more modern and efficient mechanisms than patent monopolies which are a relic of the medieval guild system while negotiating sharing mechanisms may be a difficult process it is not obviously more difficult than preserving the patent system president obama likely would have had the trans pacific partnership completed and approved by congress before he left office if it had not been for haggling over terms of drug patent related protections it is also important to recognize that we will likely have far more to gain from having access to china s technology than the other way around china is already far and away the global leader in clean technologies with as much installed solar and wind energy as the rest of the world combined and an electric car industry that now produces as many cars as all other countries put together china currently spends roughly the same share of its gdp on research and development as the united states its economy is already 25 percent larger than the us economy and will be more than twice as large in less than a decade rather than focusing on bottling up us technology a forward thinking trade agenda would be focused on ensuring our access to chinese technology unfortunately trade policy is not crafted in the national interest it is crafted with the goal of making the rich richer this is what donald trump s trade war is all about and as is the case with so many other wars it is about working class people being forced to sacrifice by paying high tariffs to advance the goals of the rich this column originally appeared on dean baker s patreon page
the results from the european parliamentary elections confirmed a strong showing for nigel farage s brexit party which topped the vote share with 32 per cent the conservative party was the big loser coming fifth and with just 9 per cent of the votes conservative leadership hopefuls have pounced on the election result suggesting that the electorate wants brexit to be delivered it seems that conservative candidates will campaign to take the uk out of the eu without a deal unless the eu makes substantial concessions in order to appeal to the mainly eurosceptic party membership which will decide the next leader mr catril said this makes new elections a growing risk if the new conservative leader makes it clear they are willing to leave without a deal there are likely to be sufficient

bank should be tougher and keep rates where they are and tell us to do our jobs writes elmer funke kupper advertisement nab outlook on rates rba governor lowe has signalled lower interest rates will be considered at the june board meeting also suggesting the bank might cut rates twice given its forecasts are based a 1 per cent cash rate this supports our view that the rba will cut in june and august with the risk of additional stimulus by early 2020 research suggests that two rate cuts will boost growth by about 0 25 0 4pp over 1 2 years although lower inflation expectations make this task more difficult for the rba the rba will be helped by looming personal income tax cuts and a relaxation of prudential regulations on mortgages the tax cuts could boost growth by up to 0 3 per cent of gdp allowing for some leakage to imports although some households may use the funds to pay down debt the planned abolition of the 7 per cent floor in calculating the serviceability of mortgages enhances the effectiveness of rate cuts and allows some borrowers to take out larger loans but the governor downplayed its significance given most borrowers do not take the maximum mortgage offered by lenders along with two rate cuts this additional support has already been factored into the rba s forecasts with the rba concluding that it will still take until mid 2020 for inflation to finally return to the bottom of the 2 3 per cent target band this suggests to us that the reserve bank may still deliver additional stimulus particularly when we think the economy will continue to

overview the euro initially reacted positively to the eu parliament elections the populists did not do quite as well as many expected the two main groupings failed to secure a majority but with the help of the liberals and possibly the greens that did well throughout europe a new european commission will be forged the heads of state meet later today but no real decisions are likely the horse trading will likely take most of the next few months with the pp securing the most seats in the new eu parliament its candidate weber is the odds on favorite to succeed juncker but macron is pushing barnier s candidacy still the likelihood of a germany ec president means that weidmann who with a fortnight of the next ecb meeting where details of the next tltro is expected said there was no need for additional measures is unlikely to replace draghi in october france is pushing for one of their own either the current governor of the french central bank villeroy de galhau or ecb board member coeure two other developments saw the dollar strengthen president trump indicating he was not ready to make a deal with china and news that the ec may take action against italy as early as next week for its excessive debt the dollar is narrowly mixed against the major currencies sterling has been the worst performer shedding about 0 4 between yesterday and today amid fears of a no deal brexit the msci asia pacific index edged higher for the third consecutive session the longest advance in five weeks europe s dow jones stoxx 600 gained both last friday and yasia pacificesterday but in the early going forward is struggling to extend the advance us shares are trading with a heavier bias in europe meanwhile the bond market rally continues the us 10 year yield is pushing below 2 30 the 10 year german bund yield is minus 15 bp while japan s benchmark is near minus nine bp italian bonds are the notable exception the 10 year yields are a couple basis points higher to bring the two day rise to 15 bp the prospect of syriza being turned out of office and a return of the conservative new democracy lifted greek bonds yesterday with yields tumbling over 20 bp yesterday the greek bonds a bit heavier today asia pacific somewhat belatedly the us recognized that japan s prime minister abe is in no position to make trade concessions ahead of the july upper house election us officials had sought a quick agreement to extend the agriculture deal that had been negotiated with the tpp and eu to us farmers who are being hurt by the retaliatory tariffs however with steel and aluminum tariffs still levied on japanese producers and threats of auto tariffs unless japan violates the wto and agrees to voluntary export restrictions there is a limit on abe s ability to satisfy trump separately and more stridently the eu also rejected quotas voluntary or otherwise on auto exports to the us there are three chinese developments to note first contrary to speculation that china would devalue the yuan to ostensibly offset the us tariffs and provide economic stimulus officials continue to resist pressure on the yuan in both word and deed the head of regulation of banking and insurance in china warned that if speculators are shorting the yuan they will inevitably suffer huge losses the warning comes amid interest in options that would benefit if the dollar rose through cny7 0 the yuan edged higher second for the first time chinese officials included economic issues as a core interest these are red lines for china so to speak that in the past included strategic issues like taiwan and tibet this represents an escalation and hardening of china s position third as the consequences of the us action against huawei ripple through supply and distribution channels china is drafting legislation that blocks doing business with foreign us tech companies on national security grounds for a third session the dollar remains on jpy109 handle a break of jpy109 would signal a move toward jpy108 50 jpy108 60 resistance is now seen in the jpy109 65 jpy109 75 area there is no significant option expiry today but there are options for around 2 2 bln that will be cut tomorrow which are struck between jpy109 75 and jpy110 00 the australian dollar seemed to carve out a floor near 0 6865 last week and reached 0 6930 today before meeting sellers it returned to its session lows near 0 6915 in the european morning nearby resistance is seen near the 20 day moving average 0 6945 it has not traded above the 20 day moving average in a little more than a month the chinese yuan firmed against the dollar before the weekend and yesterday but surrendered these gains today the dollar finished the onshore session at a seven day high near cny6 9125 europe may led the tories into a third electoral defeat each more stunning than the previous one she first lost the conservative majority in the house of commons most recently the tories took a drubbing in the local elections in the eu parliament elections the tories came in fifth place the lesson many if not all the tories are drawing is the uk should leave the eu with or without a deal by the end of october the inability of labour to capitalize on the tories woes and its dismal showing in the eu parliament election is unlikely to topple corbyn but it may push him further toward a second referendum however northern ireland voted for parties that want to remain in the eu making it difficult for the dup to support tory pm that would leave without an agreement without the dup s support national elections seem more likely than the tories finding another coalition partner if national elections are necessary the end of october deadline puts the new government in a bind even if the ec was willing to negotiate while speculation of draghi s successor is in full bloom may s resignation may change who replaces carney at the end of january 2020 the nominations close at the end of next week the populists in europe did not show the surge that many had expected overall they got a fraction less of the larger turnout than in 2014 from a political vantage point europe is in tatters the austrian government racked by corruption in its anti immigration coalition partners collapsed over the weekend belgium who held national elections on may 26 will take some time to form the next government spain where the socialists did well are struggling to form a government and is finland the greek government has been widely trounced in local and eu parliament elections is bringing forward its national election the likely return of the new democracy was cheered by investors on monday the yellow vest demonstrations continue in france and le pen edged ahead of macron s en marche italy s populists as represented by the five star movement have been outflanked by the anti immigration nationalists in the league salvini led the league to more than 30 plurality their share of the vote nearly doubled from 2014 the further right brothers of italy took 6 of the vote this may embolden salvini to precipitate a political crisis he no longer needs the m5s and indeed it is preventing him from being prime minister at the same time salvini is feeling his oats the eu is contemplating fining italy for the lack of progress on its debt which it had agreed after an impressive recovery from almost 1 11 to 1 1215 before the weekend the euro has drifted lower it reached almost 1 1175 in the european morning there is a 540 mln euro option at 1 12 that will be cut today and may be deterring the upside last week s short covering rally appeared to have been led by us accounts and their leadership is awaited now in that short covering squeeze sterling recovered about a cent and a half from testing 1 26 between yesterday and today sterling has shed two thirds of its gain to return to the 1 2650 area resistance is now seen near 1 2680 before last weekend the euro s streak against sterling was stopped at 14 sessions during which time it rose from gbp0 8500 to gbp0 8850 it rose yesterday and more today to return to the highs the gbp0 9000 beckons america the recent string of us data has been particularly dour one us bank cut its growth

after 117 consecutive months of economic expansion the us could soon find itself in a painful recession owing to disruptions caused by trump s trade war hong kong dashing hopes of a quick agreement on trade relations with china us president donald trump s administration has imposed punitive tariffs on another 200 billion of chinese goods now that the chinese government has responded with new tariffs on 60 billion of us products the united states is threatening tariffs targeting yet another 300 billion of chinese imports both sides are now digging in for a long fight largely because americans have yet to feel the pain of trump s policies china has understood trump s transactional style for some time but it only recently began to appreciate fully the significance of trump s america first doctrine which according to us state department policy director kiron skinner rests on four pillars national sovereignty reciprocity burden sharing and regional partnerships national sovereignty and reciprocity are standard features of any country s foreign policy they form the foundations of the 1648 peace of westphalia which recognized after the thirty years war that sovereign states have their own interests to defend and must engage with other states on a reciprocal basis taking reciprocity too far but the trump administration often takes reciprocity too far weakening america s capacity to build and maintain partnerships regional or otherwise indeed under trump the us has undercut the interests of its closest allies for its own narrow benefit even threatening to impose broad tariffs on automobile and auto part imports from the european union japan and south korea claiming that they pose a national security threat in any case the active ingredient of the trump doctrine is burden sharing skinner interprets this narrowly focusing on the need for america s nato allies to increase their defense spending what she does not acknowledge is that the us is also forcing the rest of the world to share the burden of its unsustainable structural savings deficit the us consistently runs both a fiscal deficit with total expenditure of which defense comprised 14 8 percent in 2017 significantly exceeding its income and a current account deficit if those twin deficits run at a trend rate of over 3 percent of gdp per annum net us debt to the rest of the world currently at 40 percent of gdp will double in less than 24 years the trump administration insists that the only deficit to worry about is the bilateral trade deficit with china but even if china bowed to us demands and eliminated the bilateral deficit america s imbalance of saving and investment would merely shift its external deficit like water in a squeezed balloon toward other surplus economies like the eu japan and south korea the targets of the threatened automotive tariffs for decades the us saving shortfall seemed like a problem to be managed not solved since the us started running structural deficits in the 1970s there has been a kind of global grand bargain on the topic the world willingly finances america s current account deficit in us dollars in exchange the us acts as a guarantor of free trade and global security the trump doctrine upends that bargain by weaponizing america s economic leverage including the us dollar it aims to force the world to uphold its end with no guarantee that the us will respond in kind this approach will end up costing virtually everyone beginning with american consumers with its trade war the trump administration is engaging in tax subterfuge historically governments have addressed their excessive debts with tax increases spending cuts higher inflation with negative real interest rates or in the case of the roman empire conquest of creditors it seems to be politically impossible for the us government to raise taxes domestically so the trump administration has found a workaround tariff increases end up serving effectively as consumption taxes but because they can be blamed on foreigners they are more palatable to the american public from trump s perspective the costs of this approach appear low with the us economy still growing stock markets at record highs and unemployment at record lows jpmorgan has estimated that the trade war s direct costs will amount to just 0 2 percent of gdp for the us 0 4 percent of gdp for china and 0 22 percent of gdp for the rest of the world through 2020 where will it go but today s prosperity hinges mainly on the temporary effects of budget busting tax cuts and quantitative easing by the us federal reserve which expanded its balance sheet by 3 6 trillion from 2007 to 2017 it has since reduced that total by 391 billion historically low interest rates and liquidity inflated asset bubbles financed the fiscal deficit and enabled the household sector to deleverage it was thanks largely to qe that us net wealth increased by 33 6 trillion from 2010 to 2018 that wealth was not however shared equally on the contrary the qe centered approach has deepened domestic inequality for example every time the s p 500 has dipped over the last decade corporate share buybacks amounting to 5 trillion from 2008 to 2018 provided a cushion this was technically good for growth the s p 500 index rose by a total of 319 percent from its 2009 trough to its march 2019 peak but trump s trade war is threatening even those narrowly shared and for the fed costly gains for the top 25 s p companies with a combined market capitalization exceeding 20 trillion just under one third of revenues come from china and taiwan weighted average meaning that tariffs on chinese imports will hit profits tech giants that depend on chips components and software sales to china amounting to 20 65 percent of total revenue will face particularly high costs as will us shoe importers the trade war seems not to have caused much pain yet because financial markets assume perhaps wrongly that central banks will bail them out with more qe but after 117 consecutive months of economic expansion compared to an historical average of 48 months the us could soon find itself in a painful recession owing to disruptions caused by trump s trade war perhaps then it will be ready for a truce andrew sheng is distinguished fellow of the asia global institute at the university of hong kong and a member of the

something anybody ever said about biden biden d 2 joe biden is the front runner by every measure except big crowds crowd size after all is an imperfect metric to measure a campaign s vitality while it can be a revealing indicator it still lacks the scientific underpinning of polling or the fixed dollar figures associated with fundraising nor does it account for the judgment of elected and influential democrats across the country just as critics doubted biden s popularity before he got in the race his campaign is confident he ll have the crowds when he needs them it s not just the size of biden s events that are modest he s also holding far fewer of them than his primary competitors since his launch he s visited iowa only once and while democrats crisscrossed early presidential primary states during the long memorial day weekend biden took it off kurt von hammerstein equord i divide my officers into four groups there are clever diligent stupid and lazy officers usually two characteristics are combined some are clever and diligent their place is the general staff the next lot are stupid and lazy they make up 90 percent of every army and are suited to routine duties anyone who is both clever and lazy is qualified for the highest leadership duties because he possesses the intellectual clarity and the composure necessary for difficult decisions one must beware of anyone who is stupid and diligent he must not be entrusted with any responsibility because he will always cause only mischief so biden is suited for routine duties one could argue of course that that s an improvement buttigieg d 1 buttigieg campaign pushing wealthy supporters to keep up fundraising momentum report democratic presidential hopeful pete buttigieg s campaign has reportedly rolled out a program to court wealthy supporters with participants eligible to receive benefits including meetings with the south bend ind mayor the program reported by politico on monday would encourage

five months as a presidential candidate ms warren is showing signs of success at distinguishing herself in a packed field she has inched higher in national polls and at events within the last month consistently overshot the campaign s expected amount of attendees she has been propelled in part by a number of disruptive choices most notably the breakneck pace at which she introduces policy proposals that has helped keep her in the news put pressure on rivals and provided more opportunities to shore up her campaign s once lackluster fund raising still interviews with more than two dozen attendees at ms warren s campaign events in iowa over memorial day weekend suggested that her steady stream of policy proposals was getting voters attention her i have a plan for that campaign slogan has become a rallying cry for supporters a few responses on i have a plan for that first no plan survives contact with the enemy sanders knows who his enemies are the billionaire class does warren second for the warren plans i have looked at there has been an impressively concise and pointed problem statement followed by a plan that s disproportionately cautious and weak finally my favorite warren plan is the post office bank an idea that sanders and aoc cheekily stole why isn t she pushing it 2020 s calm before the storm he broad contours of the primary campaign toward the end of may are remarkably close to what they were when the year began joe biden is not only the undisputed front runner he s acting like one a month into his third quest for the presidency the former vice president spent the week holding a trio of closed fundraisers in tennessee and florida without a single public event even as requests for his presence pile up it s a defiantly traditional way to run and one that exudes his team s confidence in his initial standing idealism is giving way to we ve got to get trump out if they don t have five horns growing out of their head it s i think we can work with them says minyon moore a former top adviser to hillary clinton people say about joe biden it s all about name id it s a little bit more than that he s got texture he s got value he s got grit he

may not play as well politically nationwide democrats have spent a year and a half eviscerating the republican tax law as a giveaway to the wealthy and corporations that blows a hole in the federal budget deficit not only do analyses show high earners would see the most benefits from raising the deduction cap but doing so is expected to further reduce federal revenues even if the bills stall in congress the state and local deduction issue is unlikely to go away soon blue state governors such as new york s andrew cuomo have repeatedly criticized the state and local deduction caps and some set

demand the biosphere big oil pushes corporate friendly carbon tax in attempt to stem green new deal wave with intensifying demands for bold climate action the fossil fuel industry and its top allies are lining up behind a corporate funded market centered carbon tax proposal in an effort to stem the rising momentum around ideas like the green new deal and growing shareholder and investor concerns about the climate crisis oil and gas powerhouses bp and shell recently announced that they were each contributing 1 million over the next two years to lobbying efforts for the baker schultz plan which proposes an initial tax of 40 per ton on carbon emissions backed by top global corporate powerhouses the plan is driven by an industry friendly logic firmly within the bounds of the neoliberal imagination for example under the plan revenue generated from the carbon tax would be returned back to taxpayers rather than used by the government to oversee an accelerated transition to a system of renewable energy americans for carbon dividends afcd is the u s lobbying arm for the baker schultz plan afcd appears to be entirely run by the lobbying firm squire patton bogg and several of its top revolving door lobbyists in addition to the fossil fuel industry ramping up its efforts to promote the baker schultz plan over a dozen major corporations and corporate aligned environmental groups

database driven than dots are usually connected fishing fleets have doubled since 1950 but they re having a harder time catching fish the number of ships more than doubled to 3 7 million between 1950 and 2015 the team reports this week in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences in asia the number quadrupled another important trend is the spread of motors in the 1950s only about 20 of fishing vessels around the world had motors by 2015 68 did most with power under 50 kilowatts a small engine or outboard motor for example tabulating all these figures and his co authors found that the combined engine power of small vessels equals that of the industrial fleet it was a very counterintuitive result rousseau says given the public and political attention attracted by large fishing vessels but compared with ships in the 1950s today s global fleet catches only 20 as much fish for the same amount of effort this metric called catch per unit effort sometimes measured by days at sea is a key indicator of fish population size and responsible management which limits the number of fishing vessels or stops them from overfishing these actions have stabilized fish stocks in the past 2 decades in north america western europe and australia where government regulators have tightened the rules and subsidies have made it more attractive to retire ships not so in southeast asia the mediterranean and latin america to fight climate change convert one greenhouse gas into another most climate efforts focus on carbon dioxide but methane is in some ways a worse offender while it does not last as long as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere it traps 84 times as much heat in the first two decades agriculture and livestock are the biggest source of methane emissions followed by oil and gas production and use removing methane would kickstart the reduction of global warming say the researchers and that would buy us considerable time to address the problem of carbon dioxide emissions rob jackson a professor of earth system science at stanford university told technology review jackson and his colleagues propose removing methane from the atmosphere and oxidizing it to produce carbon dioxide this would turn 3 2 billion metric tons of methane into 8 2 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide which is just a few months worth of the 40 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions the world produces each year the challenge of capturing methane from air is that its concentration is very low but the researchers recommend using zeolite a highly porous material made mainly of aluminum silicon and oxygen to soak up methane they envision giant renewable powered arrays of electric fans that push air into chambers full of the zeolite heating the catalyst in the presence of oxygen would then create carbon dioxide that can be released into the air are you a giants fan no i m a large air conditioner poor tree photos tree catches fire after lightning strike in millbury appears to burn

build that case she first focuses on the fundamental bond between mothers and children this relationship she argues was eventually extended across evolutionary time to mates more distant kin and friends conscience is essential to our ability to sustain and benefit from such attachments as churchland writes attachment begets caring caring begets conscience the capacity to formulate and act on moral norms therefore arises from the need to develop practical solutions to social problems our conscience is reinforced by social stimuli for instance we face disapproval for lying and approval for courteous behaviour thus conscience as churchland sees it involves the internalization of community standards for most people as she argues love for one s family members is a colossal neurobiological and psychological fact that mere ideology cannot wish away she concludes that utilitarianism is irresolvably at odds with how our brains function given that we evolved to care more deeply about people we know than about those whom we do not the limitations in churchland s account are mostly limitations in the state of the field as she repeatedly notes many aspects of how conscience comes to be embodied in the brain and shaped by natural selection are simply not yet known but she nevertheless makes a mighty effort i think it s a good thing that we don t know how conscience is embodied in the

increasingly scarce on the shortage plagued island after cuba started limiting sales this month partly blaming tightened u s economic sanctions on the communist run island the couple wanted to buy as much as possible and lined up for three hours under the caribbean sun to get tickets guaranteeing them their rations inside they lined up again to collect two bags of chicken thighs each as fellow shoppers elbowed one another in pursuit of their own rations and headed for the checkout feeling like they had won the lottery we were born in this revolution and are used to rough times said hidalgo a 61 year old blacksmith we are bracing ourselves for it to get worse long lines outside shops with mostly bare shelves are increasingly common in cuba and the government has indeed signaled that things are going from bad to worse cuban president miguel diaz canel in a speech last month accused the trump administration of engaging in an asphyxiating financial persecution that makes the import of goods and resources of primary necessity particularly difficult the degree to which new u s sanctions due in part to cuba s support for venezuelan president nicolas maduro have compounded its economic woes is open to debate the economy had already stagnated in recent years in tandem with the implosion of strategic ally venezuela resulting in cuts in fuel and energy use by state entities and this year shortages of basic goods such as bread chicken and eggs but the increase in sanctions which have hit the key tourism sector and added to investor and bank jitters about dealing with cuba

to 7 rate economists say is needed to recover fully from the depression caused by the fall of its former benefactor the soviet union in 1991 while the crisis will not be as bad as in the 1990s it will

javeriana cali bracing for harder economic times the government has resorted to what it knows best to manage the crisis and prevent social unrest more control interior commerce minister betsy diaz said two weeks ago the government would temporarily ration sales of a handful of basic products like eggs on a monthly basis using ration books distributed after the 1959 revolution and limit the sale of others like chicken to ensure everyone gets their fair share a critical moment some cuban economists say the developing crisis stems fundamentally from an inefficient centrally planned economy that imports more than two thirds of its food needs calling rationing little more than a short term solution they say the government must open up to a series of market oriented economic reforms before the crisis deepens this could be a critical moment that generates the consensus necessary to apply changes said vidal the government needs to give more space to the private sector and investment cuba has enacted some economic reforms in recent years including expanding the private sector from 2010 onward and introducing a new foreign investment law that cut taxes by around 50 in 2014 but local economists like omar everleny say the reforms undertaken have been too cautious so far the government has backtracked on overhauls of areas like agriculture and the dominant public sector remains deeply inefficient cuba was already behind on an estimated 1 5 billion 1 1 billion in short term commercial debt and warning of austerity before u s president donald trump started the latest round of tightening of the decades old u s trade embargo aid from venezuela in the form of subsidized oil had long masked the true extent of cuba s economic problems but it started to fall from 2015 when a drop in oil prices roiled that opec nation s economy venezuela s crude shipments to cuba are now about half what they were four years ago and they could soon fall further last month the united states also began targeting vessels and companies that ship oil to the island from venezuela for sanctions threatening the energy grid and transportation u s sanctions against its old cold war foe are also hitting the two bright spots in the otherwise glum economy tourism and foreign investment both had boomed briefly after the announcement of a cuba u s detente in 2014 tourism revenues dropped by 4 6 in 2018 according to official data released last month the announcement in 2017 of tighter travel restrictions on u s citizens played a role at one point u s visits dropped more than 40 percent cuban tourism minister manuel marrero told reuters adding he still hoped tourism would grow this year meanwhile the trump administration has activated a long dormant law under which cuban americans can sue foreign companies that profit from their properties nationalized during the first years of the 1959 revolution western diplomats and businessmen have called the threat of potentially costly u s court battles another clear disincentive for banks and outside investors to do business with cuba the united states has also threatened to further tighten restrictions on travel and to impose a cap on cash remittances to cuba measures that could hit the economy hard siege mentality cuba s government has said it will continue moving down the path toward reform but it has failed to respond so far to calls from the island s entrepreneurs for basic changes such as the creation of wholesale markets for the private sector and the right to import and export instead of opening the economy further some western diplomats and analysts say there is risk cuba s leadership will adopt a siege mentality in the face of increased u s hostility that could mean turning to allies like russia vietnam and china for help to muddle through while keeping its stranglehold on economic life the u s sanctions could be counterproductive said one diplomat who asked not to be identified cuba has historically closed up at times like these cubans are not going hungry like they did during the so called special period after the collapse of the soviet union but they are increasingly connected to the rest of the world via the internet and foreign travel and many have grown weary of government attempts to blame the u s embargo for the bulk of their country s woes we are in total freefall said hidalgo s wife carmen lozano 55 clinging to her two bags of rationed chicken they should have allowed free production and sales from the beginning of the revolution inequality has risen in recent years in cuba and many believe the economic crisis could have a more disproportionate impact now than it might have in the past in a country where the government s claim to legitimacy rests to a large extent on ensuring a certain level of equality the authorities seem well aware that most people lack the cash to stock up on whatever basics they need on the black market the government s new rationing program is trying to address that simmering discontent by making the small quantities of goods that are in stock more widely available said william leogrande a professor of government at american university the government understands that discontent over the economy is their biggest political vulnerability so they will do everything they can to maintain supplies of basic goods reporting by sarah marsh

argentina s failed peg in the 1990s the argentine peso was pegged to the u s dollar this meant that the argentine government guaranteed that anyone could exchange one argentine peso for one u s dollar if you had 1 000 argentine pesos in your bank account you could walk into the bank and ask for us 1 000 and the teller would hand it over by 2001 the peg had become unsustainable and the government of argentina abandoned it as a result the exchange rate went into freefall imagine if you looked at your bank account and the value of your assets had gone down by 75 percent over the course of a year without you spending a dime that s effectively what happened to the citizens of argentina in 2001 in less than a year the exchange rate went from 1 1 to 4 1 if you had 10 000 worth of pesos in your bank account in 2001 a year later you would have had only 2 500 attempts to withdraw u s dollars as the exchange rate plummeted were thwarted for most citizens because the run on the bank meant there were no u s dollars left to hand out i spent a year living with a retired woman in córdoba in the 2000s who recounted to me the feeling of watching her retirement savings slashed by 75 percent as she slept on the street outside the bank hoping to be able to withdraw it though few of us who grew up in the developed world can relate this story is not unique to argentina in 2001 the debut of paper money as jack weatherford details in his book the history of money the story of fiat began in the 17th century which marked the debut of paper money on the modern world scene as long as this paper money was supported by some form of commodity money like gold or silver all seemed well carrying and holding paper seemed just as reliable and far more convenient than holding the actual precious metals that backed them invariably however the government or bank in charge of printing the money issued more paper than it had metal to back it whether or not this was the right thing to do is a matter of debate but once the devaluation process began it inevitably spiraled with more and more bills being issued at less and less value an analysis of fiat currencies in the 20th century found that there were 56 episodes of hyperinflation another study found that the average life expectancy for a fiat currency is 27 years 20 percent failed through hyperinflation 37 currencies experience hyperinflation in the 20th century 21 percent were destroyed by war 12 percent were destroyed by independence 24 percent were monetarily reformed and only 23 percent are still in circulation of those that remain in circulation all have lost huge amounts of their original value as measured in commodity money like gold or silver founded in 1694 the british pound sterling is the oldest fiat currency in existence at the ripe old age of 325 years it must be considered a highly successful fiat currency yet the british pound was originally defined as 12 ounces of silver so its worth today is about half of 1 percent of its original value the u s dollar was taken off of the gold standard in 1971 when it was 1 35th an ounce of gold by 2011 it had already lost 97 percent of its value in his book the ascent of money historian niall ferguson relates that one of the main ways this seems to have happened is that rulers were forced to print money to finance wars once one ruler started doing this it became a classic prisoner s dilemma and others had to follow suit it would be better for everyone if no one fired up the presses but as soon as one ruler or government warmed them up then everyone else had to keep up or they risked being conquered part of the reason germany lost world war i and suffered worse inflation of their currency than the allies was because the german and austrian bond market was much less developed than the french english and american markets which had access to far more capital unable to raise money through bond issuances germany was forced to print money faster than other powers to finance their war effort it s also worth noting that in a democratic society politicians are often unwilling to raise taxes or balance the budget because of the expected voter anger for them inflation and the devaluation of the currency are preferable because they constitute a hidden tax the consequences of poor decisions about monetary policy can take decades to show up but politicians terms only last a few years kicking the can down the road to finance their constituents and donors favorite projects is a time tested way to get elected when you make choices about your personal spending you inevitably run into difficult decisions you could take out a bigger mortgage and buy a bigger house but that would mean working an extra five years before you could retire is that worth it the ability to print money meant that politicians could in effect buy the bigger house for themselves or their constituents today and make someone else work an extra five years in the future to pay for it bitcoin s case against fiat ultimately all the reasons for devaluation boil down to mismatched incentives between the politicians or others in control of the monetary policy and the individuals holding the currency any time a system lets somebody change history with a keystroke you have no choice but to trust that everyone who can make that keystroke will be both perfectly honest and perfectly competent alas humanity much less politicians don t have the best track record on either of those fronts when the bitcoin network went live in january 2009 satoshi embedded the headline of a story running that day in the london times the times 03 jan 2009 chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks though we can t know for sure what was going through satoshi s mind s at the time the most likely explanation is that satoshi was commenting on the decisions being made in response to the 2008 global financial crisis by the small group in charge of global monetary policy though many people around the world were affected by these decisions very few had any say in the matter instead of impactful decisions about the monetary system like a bailout or quantitative easing depending on the perfect honesty and competency of a single individual or small group satoshi envisioned bitcoin as a more robust monetary system with a more distributed power structure that would make it impossible for a single individual or small group of individuals to act unilaterally instead of impactful decisions about the monetary system like a bailout being reliant upon a single individual or small cabal like the chancellor of the exchequer and chairman of the federal reserve satoshi and the bitcoin proponents that followed him envision bitcoin as having a more distributed power structure beyond the control of a single individual viewed as money bitcoin has many gold like properties we know exactly how many bitcoins will be created 21 million and the rate at which they will be created just as gold mining is limited by gold s geological properties the ability to change these variables in bitcoin is outside of the control of any one person or small group of individuals this gives bitcoin a predictable stock to flow ratio no single individual can decide to create twice as much bitcoin tomorrow even if it is politically expedient however bitcoin also as a few properties gold lacks for one it is easily divisible and transportable someone in singapore can send 1 100th of a bitcoin to someone in canada in less than an hour it is also extremely difficult to censor bitcoin transactions if i have an internet connection and agree to pay the network s fee effectively nothing can stop me from sending bitcoin to anyone i want this doesn t mean of course that bitcoin is not primarily a highly volatile tool of speculation today it is but it points to why many of those speculators are in the market if central banks in any country fail to unwind their balance sheets gracefully and inflation sets in savers will go looking for a safe place to store their wealth in this scenario bitcoin an easily divisible and transferable digital gold may shine

president donald trump s trade war with china has prompted a broad rethinking of how the american and chinese economies have become so intertwined leading some manufacturers to trim supply chains in china and the american authorities to start cutting off access to crucial technology for chinese companies like huawei now another important area is getting a close look financial markets some trade experts and others urging the trump administration to keep a hawkish stance are discussing whether the white house should curb china s access to wall street chinese companies have raised tens of billions of dollars through american financial markets in recent years the so called decoupling is part of a broader effort by trade hawks to weaken the economic relationship between the two countries which they argue has grown too close steve bannon trump s former chief strategist said there were ongoing efforts inside and outside the administration to rethink china s role in u s stock markets in part because of a lack of transparency about the ultimate owners of chinese companies the new york stock exchange and nasdaq are breaching their fiduciary responsibility to institutional investors the pension funds of hardworking americans bannon said it s outrageous all of it should be shut down immediately bannon pointed to the surge of reverse mergers in the early 2000s in which chinese companies with often inaccurate financial disclosures were able to gain listings on stock exchanges in the united states by acquiring very small publicly traded american companies through these transactions these companies gained access to significant capital in the united states but proved to be empty shells adding fuel to the discussion alibaba the chinese e commerce giant that held a hugely successful initial public offering in new york five years ago is now considering also listing its shares in the semiautonomous chinese city of hong kong according to a person familiar with the matter the person who asked for anonymity because the discussions were not public said the move was not under consideration because of geopolitical worries the outlook for the financial sector on both sides of the pacific is starting to change there are growing calls on the u s side for complete decoupling which is causing chinese enterprises to re evaluate their reliance not just on u s technology but also on other u s resources including financial markets said andy mok a senior fellow at the center for china and globalization a leading research group in beijing china has long considered wall street an ally in the late 1990s beijing appealed to senior financial executives to lobby the clinton administration to allow it to join the world trade organization the club of nations that sets global trade rules senior executives of major firms like goldman sachs and blackstone group often meet with top chinese leaders big banks see the fast growing country as an important source of business even if they have largely been blocked from competing in china s tightly controlled financial system chinese companies have raised tens of billions of dollars through american financial markets in recent years wall street banks have earned big fees from advising chinese businesses on ipos and on acquisitions of american businesses and real estate china is full of amazing entrepreneurs whom we look forward to welcoming said robert h mccooey jr a senior vice president of listing services at nasdaq the trump administration hasn t announced any moves to cut off china and chinese companies continue to enjoy access to american markets just two weeks ago luckin coffee a chinese competitor to starbucks surged in its trading debut in new york though its shares have since traded lower but both sides have offensive plays if the trade war intensifies limiting access to the american financial markets would leave chinese companies without a ready source of capital for their expansion plans chinese entities mainly the country s central bank and sovereign wealth fund own at least 200 billion in shares in the united states by one estimate giving beijing a possible additional weapon should chinese leaders decide to sell china s economic policymakers are aware of that extreme option people familiar with the policymaking said they insisted on anonymity because of the political and diplomatic sensitivity of the issue such a move could shake the american stock market which trump considers a barometer of his success for many years policymakers economists and bankers have asked what might happen to the u s economy should china suddenly dump much of the 1 3 trillion it holds in u s debt selling stocks could be more potent than paring back bonds stock markets tend to respond to smaller sums of money than u s government bonds do because the market for treasury bills is simply so big there is no sign so far of a chinese desire to escalate the trade war that way china is unlikely to dump shares quickly said mark sobel a former longtime treasury official who is now the united states chairman of the london based official monetary and financial institutions forum doing so would not only upset the united states but could also mean selling shares at a loss during a temporary dip in prices which would hurt the investment return on china s assets in my experience china s reserve managers have always acted in a professional manner and sought to promote financial stability sobel wrote in an email in the past chinese government agencies have quietly and gradually sold part of their american stock holdings when they have needed extra dollars to help manage the value of the currency said brad setser an economist at the council on foreign relations in new york chinese firms that start changing their relationship with american financial markets now face questions over whether their moves are trade related shanghai based semiconductor manufacturing international corp a chinese computer chip maker traded mostly in hong kong is shifting the trading of its american depositary shares from the new york stock exchange to the far less visible over the counter market smic as it is known attributed the decision to low trading volume in its shares in new york smic has been considering this migration for a long time and it has nothing to do with the trade war or with the trans pacific dispute over huawei a chinese tech company smic said in a statement in response to questions the migration requires a long preparation and timing has coincided with the current trade rhetoric which may lead to misconceptions for alibaba a hong kong share sale could allow more chinese investors to put their money in a company that many of them use in their daily lives china heavily restricts how much money its people can move overseas but has allowed them greater access to markets in hong kong a territory governed by a different set of laws alibaba s stepped up discussions over listing in hong kong were reported earlier by bloomberg alibaba has long discussed selling its shares in china or hong kong so it is not clear what role if any the trade war had in its considerations jack ma the co founder of alibaba had said at a conference in january 2018 that he would consider whether to do another stock listing in hong kong mok at the beijing research group said that chinese companies are now more likely to think twice about depending on american financial markets there is no desire on the chinese side for decoupling he said but it is maybe a prudent management decision to reduce risk exposure

interest rates and monetary policy from 2006 these days there are two sets of statistics to monitor if you are trying to avoid losing money let alone trying to make money the first set is the monetary statistics the adjusted monetary base m 2 and mzm money of zero maturity m 3 is no longer published the second statistic is the inverted yield curve which is the most effective herald of a recession how inverted is it what is the spread between the 90 day t bill rate and the 30 year t note rate the larger the spread the more likely the recession the average american has never heard of any of this most people go through life in a kind of fog confident that the experts back in washington d c know what they re doing even among those more sophisticated groups of investors who have heard of the federal reserve system and who know that it is a central bank few people actually monitor these statistics on a regular basis they too are confident that experts at the fed know what they re doing but what if this confidence is misplaced these days there is also considerable confusion about the direction of interest rates these days rates are falling long term rates have fallen more than short term rates have which is a rare occurrence money is tight the monetary base is actually shrinking slightly yet short term t bill rates and long term t bond rates have fallen in 2006 if we look at monetary policy from early 2001 until mid 2003 monetary inflation expanded yet both short term rates and long term treasury rates fell what is going on if today s tight monetary policy produces falling rates but loose monetary policy produced falling rates what produces rising rates what constitutes cause and effect in interest rates the three components a free market rate of interest is a composite of three factors the originary rate of interest the risk premium and the price inflation or deflation rare since 1933 premium the originary rate of interest is most important most of the time it is the discount that all people apply to the future the future is less relevant than the present in our plans we value present goods more highly than these same physical goods in the future if someone wants to borrow our money or an asset for some venture we demand to be repaid more than we are asked to lend the benefits which the money or asset would produce over the lending period will not be ours so we want compensation there are no free lunches in this life benefits must be paid for then there is the risk premium the borrower may default disappear or break the item we may not be fully repaid at the end of the loan period we want compensation for the additional risk of loss the more likely the default the higher the market rate of interest bad risks must pay more in order to secure a loan finally there is the price inflation or price deflation premium ever since the creation of the federal reserve system in december 1913 it has been mostly an inflation premium for money loans the monetary unit will depreciate in purchasing power over the period of the loan the lender is not in the business of giving away wealth so the lender asks for compensation sufficient to offset the expected loss of purchasing power including any income tax on the increase of money repaid in very rare cases historically such as 1930 36 price deflation threatens the borrower he must repay in money that may be worth more so he refuses to pay a market rate of interest as high as the combined originary rate and risk premium would otherwise mandate this is why interest rates on u s government riskless t bill rates fell to barely above zero from 1933 through 1936 world war ii was highly inflationary prices were fixed by law but the money supply shot up shortages were universal yet interest rates remained at less than half of a percent until 1946 deflation caused low rates during the depression inflation caused low rates during the war how can this be the economy s boom phase when the central bank expands reserves for the commercial banking system by purchasing debt the newly created money winds up as deposits in fractional reserve banks the banks then lend out money the new money appears to be the result of greater thrift by lenders it isn t it is the result of greater inflation prices do not immediately rise the recession mentality is pervasive employers remain cautious they are in shell shock so demand for business loans is slow to respond to new money the rising supply of loanable funds is met by weak demand so interest rates fall or remain low as new projects are launched employment rises the recession mentality fades people start spending money and borrowing money to buy things slowly the rate of price inflation begins to approach the rate of monetary inflation at this point the price inflation premium reappears lenders demand a higher rate for long term loans if the central bank s policy of monetary inflation continues long term loans bonds mortgages also rise so do short term rates but long term rates remain higher the yield curve is positive rising rates as the maturity date extends the risk of loss through rising prices increases as the maturity date recedes eventually in order to keep prices and long term rates from rising the central bank must cease inflating so rapidly it must cease buying government debt if policy is not reversed the currency s value will collapse the bust phase before the bust there is a transition period borrowers are still borrowing they do not perceive the threat a falling economy rising bankruptcies and unemployment like frantic buyers in an auction for new homes in the final days of a housing bubble so are borrowers at the end of a boom interest rates shoot upward for one last move then reality sinks in debtors find themselves facing an economic slowdown high rates are strangling economic growth fear takes over we can see this in the rate decline from 1929 to 1936 prime bankers acceptances 90 days reached 5 in 1929 a year later the rate was half that in 1931 it was 1 57 in 1932 it was 0 62 it kept falling it hit 0 15 in 1936 what had happened price deflation and the fear of stock market losses combined to reduce the demand for loans lenders wanted safety so they were willing to lend short term they saw this market as less risky than anything else out there same result different causes falling rates occur during recessions they begin to fall before the recession appears long term rates fall more than short term rates lenders want to lock in high returns they think that short term rates will fall which is common in recessions when it comes time to roll over the loan lenders will receive lower interest on short term loans so they buy bonds long rates fall faster in the preliminary phase of the boom the fear of falling short term rates recedes the boom will raise short term rates so lenders stop buying bonds and start buying short term debt they expect to be able to roll over the loans at a higher rate in 90 days at this point the inverted yield curve disappears long rates rise above short rates the boom will raise long rates faster than short rates because lenders fear currency depreciation they ask for a higher rate borrowers are willing to agree to this this is why it is not sufficient to look at the direction of interest rates as a way to forecast the economy you must look at the money supply too when long rates are falling faster than short rates and where the money supply is increasing at a lower rate than a year ago you can safely conclude that the next phase of the economy will be recessionary interest rates are falling because lenders are seeking safe returns in the transition phase from boom to bust which does not last long prices are rising faster than the money supply is the stock market is still climbing in anticipation of rising consumer demand and rising corporate profits this is the last hurrah of the boom phase bond market investors see what is coming before stock market investors do they grow pessimistic before stock market investors do the inverted yield curve appears in the midst of rising prices including stock prices the economic boom looks solid so does the stock market boom but the bond market s investors think otherwise they lock in high long term rates conclusion so it is not enough to look at the direction of interest rates and conclude that the federal reserve is pursuing hard money or soft money the tendency is to interpret a falling federal funds rate as a sign of monetary loosening to see which cause is dominant inflation or deflation you must look at the money supply figures they are important for revealing which phase of the economy we are in falling short term rates do not tell us falling rates in general do whisper recession ahead and long term t bond rates that are below short term t bill rates are not whispering they are raising their collective voices you would be wise to listen having listened you would be wise to ask yourself what will my situation be a year from now _______________________ published on november24 2006 the original is here a year

cctv footage played the key role in identifying the suicide bombers of the easter sunday attack however the ways and means of breeding such terrorism on sri lanka s soil is still under investigation in the aftermath of the easter attack there is heighted attention on countering financing of terrorism informal illegal remittance schemes can be seen as one of the main mechanismsused for fund transfers by terrorists international soft law making bodies such as the financial action task force fatf and domestic law enforcement authorities make efforts to put frameworks in place to curb informal and illegal remittance schemes however reports of investigations into terrorist activities reveal that such systems are in operation parallel to formal financial systems this article intends to highlight some salient aspects of illegal remittance schemes which pose severe threats to national security integrity of financial systems and promotion of economic growth informal value transfer systems according to the financial crimes enforcement network fincen any system mechanism or network of people that receives money for the purpose of making funds or an equivalent value payable to a third party in another geographical location whether or not in the same form is considered as an informal value transfer system ivts a system called hawala in middle east and asia fei chin in china huikuan in hong kong pei kwan in thailand hundi in pakistan and india and undiyal among sri lankan tamils black market peso exchange in colombia and padala in philippines are examples of ivts this article will focus on the hawala scheme which is considered a widely used form of ivts it has originated in the middle east and south asia although at its origins the hawala system facilitated trade and helped to mitigate therisk and inconvenience of physical transportation of money it is reported that after 9 11 attack hawalabecame associated with terrorism financing however in areas where there is lack of access to conventional banking hawala functions as an alternative remittance system what is hawala in the arabic language hawala means transfer trust between the involved parties is the main attraction of the hawala system moreover the low or no cost for the remitters speed of the transfer anonymity convenience for the recipients and the lack of rigid formalities suitability for cultural aspects are considered as other attractive elements of the hawala system it is also observed that the hawala is used to evade currency controls international sanctions and taxes as well as to transfer criminal proceeds modus operandi moving money without money moving at all the multifaceted description of hawala indicates that it is a mechanism of transferring money without physically moving it the diagram elaborates a simple hawala transaction customer usually a migrant worker but it could be any other person approaches a hawala broker hawaladar and gives him a sum of money to be sent to a recipient in another country contacts their hawala partner in the recipient country via phone or fax or email gives the information on the beneficiary amount name address telephone number of the recipient to however doesn t remit money to agrees to settle it later and pays to the recipient d therecipient will have a password or code number to get money from no written contract for the transaction is available and the deal is secured by the trust between parties two hawaladars i e and settle their dues at a later stage through under invoicing transferring money through banks or cash carriers researches reveal that hawala brokers mostly involved in import export activities they charge a modest commission and use a more favourable exchange rate than the mainstream banks the hawala broker in the recipient country does the delivery of money free of charge since the hawala does not create a paper trail it gains traction for illicit transactions such as terrorist financing tax evasion exchange control violations and import export frauds therefore the debt settlement can be done by manipulating invoices i e under invoicing or over invoicing shipments of goods smuggling gold and precious items is another way of settling dues between hawala brokers in an article titled a banking system built for terrorism published in time magazine 2001 the following description had been given for illegal remittance systems in the labyrinthine depths of old delhi nobody seems to be doing any work until the phone rings then numbers are furiously scribbled followed by some busy dialling and whispered instruction although it s far from obvious in the innocuous setting these men are moving money to exporters drug traffickers tax evaders corrupt politicians and terrorists the regulatory empowerment in sri lanka should also be widened to detect such money movers in the country who are engaged in criminal activities susceptibility ofhawala for money laundering and terrorism financing it is observed that criminals take advantage of the anonymity of the hawala system to move the proceeds of illegal activities since the documentation involved in the hawala deals is minimal it makes the system vulnerable to be abused for money laundering and terrorism financing according to timothy o brien al qaeda has used the hawala system to fund the american embassy bombings in kenya and tanzania in 1998 columbian drug traffickers have also used hawala as their main remittance system the irish times reported 2016 that hawala was used to fund the paris attack in 2015 as per the international business times 2015 the boko haram organization in nigeriais known to receive money through hawala in 2005 fatf also acknowledged the potential misuse of hawala by criminals the fatf states that hawala controlled by criminals functions as networks for other offences including tax fraud currency offences and corruption according to the interpol reports the hawala system facilitates money laundering by placing illegal proceeds in formal financial institutions pretending they are earnings of a legitimate business front companies operated by hawala dealers assist these placements they complete the layering of criminal proceeds distributing transfers over a period of time at the integration stage of the money laundering process illicit money is invested in legitimate businesses purchase of property or import export invoices netherlands authorities have found out that laundromats grocery stores and phone shops have been used as illegal money remittance businesses during 2010 2012 eight million euros have been seized by the public prosecutor s office in amsterdam in 2011 manhattan federal court arrested a person operated an unlicensed money transfer business between the usa and pakistan one of its transactions was used to fund the attempted car bombing in new york city s times square in 2010 the owner of an ice cream shop named carnival ice cream was arrested in brooklyn in 2003 he maintained an account in j p morgan chase bank to collect the funds to be transferred to al qaeda the uae in collaboration with the united states department of treasury blocked albakarat s a somali based hawala operation assets in dubai discouraging the existence of informal remittance systems opportunities available for ivts operators such as hawala should be restricted through effective compliance with laws applicable to money transfers in terms of the regulations issued under the foreign exchange act no 12 of 2017 a person arriving in sri lanka may carry any amount of foreign currency in the form of foreign currency notes bank drafts cheques travel cards etc if that amount exceeds 15 000 or its equivalent in any other foreign currency or such a person intends to take back foreign currency notes exceeding 10 000 a declaration shall be made to sri lanka customs according to available reports cash carriers facilitate hawala operations hawala brokers can settle each other through cash carriers as well therefore the vigilance of sri lanka customs over currency imports needs to be strengthened analysing such cash declaration reports would also facilitate conducting investigations into terrorism financing and money laundering regulations issued under the financial transaction reporting act ftra no 6 of 2006 are applicable when funds arechannelled through banks there is a possibility of detecting bulk remittances by hawala brokers if such funds come through banks both the remitting and recipient banks are required to exercise enhanced due diligence over the source of funds purpose of the remittance and ultimate beneficiary of a fund transfer according to section 7 of ftra irrespective of the amount involved all suspicious transactions strs are required to be reported to the financial intelligence unit fiu of the central bank of sri lanka cbsl any cash transaction or electronic fund transfer that exceeds rs 1 million or its equivalent in foreign currency is reported under cash transaction reports ctrs to the fiu as per the section 6 of the ftra compliance of financial institutions with the said reporting requirements and thorough analysis of the patters of transactions local credits to accounts inward and outward remittances based on above said ctr and str is of paramount importance in identifying local cash pools of hawalabrokers money launderers and terrorist financiers frankfurter allgemeinezeitung 2000 reports that it would be difficult to recognise concealed use of conventional banking by hawala operators as their accounts are registered in the name of individuals small businesses or the like whose background the bank is unlikely to examine thoroughly among the red flags of transaction patterns that are often associated with hawala systemscredits to the accounts ofbusinesses that do not have an apparent link with other businesses activities significant deposit activity in cash cheques different book keeping methods for customers and transactions that have no commercial or economic sense for a personal account can be highlighted officers of banks and financial institutions have therefore a critical role to play in reporting such suspicious transactions this responsibility to exercise enhanced due diligence over the customers extends to the designated non finance businesses stipulated under ftra as well these include real estate agents dealers in precious and semi precious metals lawyers notaries accountants etc strengthening the legal framework to combathawala in terms of the foreign exchange act foreign currency can be purchased for permitted transactions only from authorised and restricted dealers in sri lanka licensed banks and authorised money changers function as such dealers in foreign exchange authorised money changers have been appointed to enhance the flow of foreign currency into banking channels if they do not deposit the foreign currency purchased by them as per the conditions stipulated in the permit issued by the director foreign exchange of the cbsl there may be possibilities of selling such funds to black market operators including hawalabrokers the fatf has also revealed that in many countries regulated money transfer agents are reportedly used to conduct illegal hawala transactions separately and covertly in addition to their regulated activities such market structure makes it more difficult for the regulators to implement the law against offenders although the transfer of funds overseas by persons in or resident in sri lanka using hawala system is prohibited under section 4 3 of the foreign exchange act there is no prohibition for persons in or resident in sri lanka to receive funds through hawala system from a foreign entity person in terms of the provisions of section 3 of the foreign exchange management act of india receiving funds by a resident via reverse hawala operations is an offence assistance of all stakeholders to expedite the amendments suggested by the department of foreign exchange of cbsl would be important in combating hawala in all its different forms effectively fatf is of the view that completely unregulated remittance operators are particularly vulnerable to money laundering and terrorist financing risks as they permit funds to be sent with no customer due diligence requirements funds remitted through hawala cannot be monitored as there is no paper trail such systems can be discouraged by promoting formal remittance channels particularly through reducing transaction costs promoting formal remittance schemes enhancing the competitiveness in the remittance industry in accordance with special recommendation vi of the fatf would also be helpful in curtailing the use of hawala operations for money laundering and financing of terrorism it will also be advantageous to attract worker remittances to legal channels such competition should however be supported by proper governance and risk management practices in developed countries hawala and other informal remittance schemesare allowed to be licensed or registered thisenablesmaking unlicensed unregistered entities illegal and taking actions against them according to fatf recommendation vi each country should ensure that persons or legal entities that carry out the money transfer service illegally are subject to administrative civil or criminal sanctions however such a comprehensive framework to distinguish black and white hawala requires providing adequate resources and securing the assistance of law enforcement agencies for the regulators the uae issued abu dabi declaration imposing a licensing requirement while recognising the need for hawala operation for legitimate purposes of unbanked communities the imf says that informal fund transfer systems declined in the countries where financial systems are liberalised the provisions of the payments and settlements act no 28 of 2005 of sri lanka provide for licensing money transfer service businesses however identifying the dynamics of hawala and other similar remittance services in the broader context ofthe financial system is important prior to designing anall inclusive regulatory regime for the remittance market adverse economic impact scholars point out that continued existence of hawala threatens the country s economy as it is beyond all the standard instruments of macro economic policy informal remittances are not recorded in official statistics or the foreign assets of a recipient country they are not reflected as liabilities of the remitting countries since the informal remittances increase the circulation of cash in the recipient country and affect the composition of broad money there may be an adverse impact on monetary policy there may also be a negative fiscal implication as the funds routed through informal channels are not subject to taxes according to the imf accurate compilation of informal fund transfer systems such as hawala in balance of payments accounts is difficult studies carried out by the united nations and interpol state that the volume of financial transactions in the hawala network at times substantially exceeds that in the formal banking sector it is estimated that more than 7 billion enters into pakistan every year through hawala interpol estimates the size of hawala at possibly 40 of the india s gdp it is also estimated that every year approximately 200 billion moves around the world through hawala system without being detected by regulators when informal fund transfer systems operate efficiently without any disturbance tendency to channel legitimate transfers also through those systems maybe created in 2018 workers remittances to sri lanka has declined by 2 1 to 7 015million as depicted in the table it would be interesting to know whether the decline of the use of banking channels by migrant workers have also contributed tothe reduction of remittances according to ratha 2006 the funds remitted to sri lanka annually through informal channels could be as much as half of formal remittances received by the country attracting worker remittance through formal channels would be important in discouraging informal remittance schemes in sri lanka particularly in the context of the current elevated threat levels which demand increased vigilance against terrorist financing it can be suggested that the sri lanka foreign employment bureau can implement a strategic plan in collaboration with banks and the foreign missions abroad to attract remittances by undocumented workers workers with expired visa and first time migrant worker to formal channels it can also be suggested to make the requirement to open a personal foreign currency account by expatriate workers as a condition at the time of giving approvals for foreign employments engaging with the formal sector however will be discouraged if the recipients are supposed to travel long distances to collect their money and required to fulfil rigid formalities in order to expand the access to formal remittance channels by migrant workers and their recipients the competition in the market needs to be enhanced new entrants coupled with technological advancements such as digital payments mobile payments should also be promoted financial sector stakeholders will have a role to play in balancing technological development and financial inclusion while preserving the integrity of the system conclusion smooth coordination and timely sharing of relevant and reliable information among law enforcement regulatory authorities and financial institutions as well as the other public agencies are of paramount importance in effective combating of the hawala system it reduces the delays in investigation processes and facilitates bringing perpetratorsto book while preserving the public confidence in the legal system hawala has proved to be an effective mechanism to hide the illicit origin of money and its destination and break the audit trail of money therefore awareness of all the above mentioned stakeholders and the general public regarding the informal remittance systems should be enhanced political commitment is also essential to tackle all sources techniques and channels of terrorist financing as long as there are safe spaces for money launders terrorist financiers and other criminals they continue to pose threats to the national security integrity of financial system and accuracy of economic fundamentals we need new partnerships in fighting terrorism and building peace anna lindh the writer is deputy director at cbsl the views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position

there s no question that many farmers are struggling this year with incomes down and bankruptcies up though some of the more dire reports on the farm sector recorded in the media are exaggerated what is indisputable is that prices for major commodities such as corn are on a downward trend and are significantly lower than they were less than a decade ago when prices were at or near record highs advertisement it s natural to blame any declines in the farm economy on the tariff war with china the trade dispute has certainly hurt the farm sector as the higher chinese tariffs on american agriculture has reduced demand for their crops especially the farm belt states of the midwest even president donald trump himself has admitted that the trade war has hurt farmers which is why he wants to send some of the money raised by his tariffs to the farmers directly but something else is going on here that is negatively impacting the farm states that existed before any trade war the daily headlines of a tariff war have overshadowed what might be an even bigger and longer term problem for farmers tight monetary policy at the federal reserve which has squeezed commodity prices across the board over the past year an index of all commodity prices including everything from oil to copper to timber to soybeans has recorded a price reduction of roughly 10 eight of the 10 major agriculture commodities have been falling in price why is that happening it isn t good weather or bumper crops because the losses are being felt across regions and hitting almost all the major crops one explanation for the farmers woes is tight money we know from historical experience that when money is loose and the printing presses shower the economy with cheap dollars commodity prices soar as in the 1970s when grocery bills soared when money is excessively tight as it is now commodity prices fall when almost all of the commodities from corn to copper to timber start to fall in price at the same time it is a pretty good signal that our monetary system is out of whack farmers are often the frontline victims of commodity deflation the extreme example of course was the great depression when farm bankruptcies skyrocketed with thin profit margins to begin with in a highly competitive global food market many farmers are being unnecessarily hurt by having to swallow an 8 reduction in prices following a similar decline last year of course free markets not government subsidies or fed monetary policy should determine which farmers should stay in business and which will fail the way to reduce artificial price fluctuations in the agricultural sector of our economy and get quick relief for our farmers is for the fed to increase dollar liquidity into our high flying american economy this would be an effective and overdue way for our nation s farmers to experience greater profits advertisement this reflation policy makes sense now given that the threat of economy wide inflation at this stage is minimal to nonexistent the dollar is strong thanks to world demand for dollars and the growth in output due to tax cuts and deregulation is pushing out the supply of goods and services which is deflationary not inflationary there isn t a whiff of inflation in consumer prices except for education and health care the wall street journal reports that the fed has undershot its inflation target 2 growth in the consumer price index for four months running the fed is hesitant to cut interest rates because it believes wrongly that a booming economy causes inflation which is a long ago dead keynesian idea a modest reflation would put some extra juice into the farm sector this would put added pressure on the chinese to make a deal with the trump administration that deal would press for the elimination of china s punitive tariffs on our farm products and open up markets to other made in america products this would also counter the brazen chinese strategy of meddling in american elections by intentionally targeting tariffs on farm products produced by rural voters in key battle ground states in the 2020 elections advertisement america has the most productive farmers in the world so a trade agreement that ratchets down tariffs on both sides of the pacific would greatly benefit the farm belt combining that with a monetary policy by the fed that allows the economy to continue to grow without inflation would help our farmers and workers across all industries and without one dime of taxpayer assistance stephen moore is a senior fellow at the heritage foundation and an economic consultant with freedomworks he is the co author of trumponomics inside the america first plan to revive the american economy to find out more about stephen moore and read features by other creators syndicate writers and cartoonists visit the creators syndicate webpage at www creators com
consumer confidence index rises 4 9 pts to 134 1 in may house prices increase 2 7 in march from year ago by lucia mutikani washington may 28 reuters consumer confidence jumped in may as households grew more upbeat about the labor market suggesting the economy remained on solid ground despite signs that activity was slowing after being temporarily boosted by exports and a build up of inventories the surge in confidence reported by the conference board on tuesday came despite an escalation in tensions in the 10 month trade war between the united states and china which sparked a sharp sell off on wall street it mirrors strength exhibited by another sentiment surveys in the middle of this month economists said the strong readings likely did not fully capture the impact of the trade standoff between washington and beijing the cut off date for the conference board survey was on may 16 the u s raised existing tariffs on 200 billion in chinese goods to 25 from 10 on may 10 prompting beijing to retaliate with its own levies on american imports so there was at least some time for the recent escalation in the trade spat with china to factor in said tim quinlan a senior economist at wells fargo securities in charlotte north carolina but at this stage consumers are nonplussed the conference board said its index of consumer attitudes increased 4 9 points to a reading of 134 1 this month climbing up to levels seen last november when the index was hovering near 18 year highs economists polled by reuters had forecast the index rising to 130 0 this month the survey s expectations index based on consumers short term outlook for income business and labor market conditions increased to a reading of 106 6 this month from 102 7 in april the conference board survey s so called labor market differential derived from data on respondents views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get increased to 36 3 from 33 2 in april that measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the labor department s employment report the labor market is tight with the unemployment rate at 3 6 percent a level last seen almost 50 years ago while the sentiment surveys have been upbeat the so called hard economic data have weakened in recent months industrial production durable goods orders retail and home sales fell in april suggesting the economy lost considerable momentum early in the second quarter after getting a lift from exports and an accumulation of unsold goods in warehouses in the first quarter the atlanta federal reserve is forecasting gross domestic product increasing at a 1 3 annualized rate in the second quarter the economy grew at a 3 2 pace in the january march quarter growth is mostly slowing as last year s massive stimulus from the trump administration s tax cuts and spending increases fades the dollar was trading higher on tuesday u s treasury prices rose with the yield on the benchmark 10 year note dropping to its lowest level since october 2017 stocks on wall street eked out modest gains house prices slowing as long as job growth is strong that is the green light we need to keep consumers moving along said jennifer lee a senior economist at bmo capital markets in toronto consumers anticipated inflation would remain muted over the next 12 months the survey s one year inflation expectations fell to 4 4 in may from 4 6 in april inflation has been benign despite the tight labor market prompting calls from president donald trump for the federal reserve to cut interest rates the u s central bank recently suspended its three year interest rate hiking campaign and last month showed little desire to alter its monetary policy stance other data on tuesday showed a further moderation in house price inflation which could help support the struggling housing market but a chronic shortage of lower priced homes remains an obstacle amid strong demand that has been stoked by declining mortgage rates the s p corelogic case shiller composite index of home prices in 20 metropolitan areas increased 2 7 in the 12 months to march after rising 3 0 the prior month in another report the federal housing finance agency fhfa said its house price index rose a seasonally adjusted 4 9 in march from a year ago that followed a 5 1 gain in february the fhfa s index is calculated by using purchase prices of houses financed with mortgages sold to or guaranteed by mortgage finance companies fannie mae and freddie mac a variety of different measures of housing activity have been soft in recent months despite the recent decline in mortgage rates and if affordability issues are weighing on the housing market house prices could continue to soften moving forward said daniel silver an economist at jpmorgan in new york reporting by lucia mutikani editing by andrea ricci

rationing long queues and empty shelves in cuba as the economy heads to recession 28th tuesday may 2019 09 47 utc full article the economy has averaged 1 annual growth over the last three years compared with the 5 to 7 rate economists say is needed to recover fully president miguel diaz canel accused the trump administration of engaging in an asphyxiating financial persecution to which new u s sanctions due in part to cuba s support for venezuela s maduro have compounded its economic woes is open to debate as long lines outside shops with mostly bare shelves are increasingly common in cuba and the government has indeed signaled that things are going from bad to worse havana is blasting president donald trump s administration for the hardship and misery cuban president miguel diaz canel in a speech last month accused the trump administration of engaging in an asphyxiating financial persecution that makes the import of goods and resources of primary necessity particularly difficult the degree to which new u s sanctions due in part to cuba s support for venezuelan president nicolas maduro have compounded its economic woes is open to debate the economy had already stagnated in recent years in tandem with the implosion of strategic ally venezuela resulting in cuts in fuel and energy use by state entities and this year shortages of basic goods such as bread chicken and eggs but the increase in sanctions which have hit the key tourism sector and added to investor and bank jitters about dealing with cuba has some economists predicting the economy will slip from stagnation into a full blown recession later this year the economy has averaged 1 annual growth over the last three years compared with the 5 to 7 rate economists say is needed to recover fully from the depression caused by the fall of its former benefactor the soviet union in 1991 while the crisis will not be as bad as in the 1990s it will have a worrying social impact on the most vulnerable households which are already on subsistence salaries said pavel vidal a former cuban central bank economist who teaches at colombia s universidad javeriana cali bracing for harder economic times the government has resorted to what it knows best to manage the crisis and prevent social unrest more control interior commerce minister betsy diaz said two weeks ago the government would temporarily ration sales of a handful of basic products like eggs on a monthly basis using ration books distributed after the 1959 revolution and limit the sale of others like chicken to ensure everyone gets their fair share some cuban economists say the developing crisis stems fundamentally from an inefficient centrally planned economy that imports more than two thirds of its food needs calling rationing little more than a short term solution they say the government must open up to a series of market oriented economic reforms before the crisis deepens this could be a critical moment that generates the consensus necessary to apply changes said vidal the government needs to give more space to the private sector and investment cuba has enacted some economic reforms in recent years including expanding the private sector from 2010 onward and introducing a new foreign investment law that cut taxes by around 50 in 2014 but local economists like omar everleny say the reforms undertaken have been too cautious so far the government has backtracked on overhauls of areas like agriculture and the dominant public sector remains deeply inefficient cuba was already behind on an estimated us 1 5 billion in short term commercial debt and warning of austerity before u s president donald trump started the latest round of tightening of the decades old u s trade embargo aid from venezuela in the form of subsidized oil had long masked the true extent of cuba s economic problems but it started to fall from 2015 when a drop in oil prices roiled that opec nation s economy venezuela s crude shipments to cuba are now about half what they were four years ago and they could soon fall further last month the united states also began targeting vessels and companies that ship oil to the island from venezuela for sanctions threatening the energy grid and transportation u s sanctions against its old cold war foe are also hitting the two bright spots in the otherwise glum economy tourism and foreign investment both had boomed briefly after the announcement of a cuba u s detente in 2014 tourism revenues dropped by 4 6 in 2018 according to official data released last month the announcement in 2017 of tighter travel restrictions on u s citizens played a role at one point u s visits dropped more than 40 percent cuban tourism minister manuel marrero revealed adding he still hoped tourism would grow this year meanwhile the trump administration has activated a long dormant law under which cuban americans can sue foreign companies that profit from their properties nationalized during the first years of the 1959 revolution western diplomats and businessmen have called the threat of potentially costly u s court battles another clear disincentive for banks and outside investors to do business with cuba the united states has also threatened to further tighten restrictions on travel and to impose a cap on cash remittances to cuba measures that could hit the economy hard cuba s government has said it will continue moving down the path toward reform but it has failed to respond so far to calls from the island s entrepreneurs for basic changes such as the creation of wholesale markets for the private sector and the right to import and export instead of opening the economy further some western diplomats and analysts say there is risk cuba s leadership will adopt a siege mentality in the face of increased u s hostility that could mean turning to allies like russia vietnam and china for help to muddle through while keeping its stranglehold on economic life
staff writer the tuscaloosa news washington at last count china held slightly more than 1 trillion in u s treasury securities one fear has been that should china and the united states engage in an economic war as they clearly are now those dollars could become a weapon against us the chinese would sell dollars in foreign exchange markets raising u s interest rates and perhaps triggering a serious american recession that might spread elsewhere is this possible well yes but it s a long shot let s see how a dollar dump might work china would sell a huge portion of its treasury stake this in turn would reduce the price of treasuries which like stocks are traded on the open market and raise their interest rates consider a simplified example to see how this works assume a 1 000 bond with a 5 interest rate it guarantees a payment of 50 a year but if the bond s price has fallen to 800 that same promised 50 produces an interest rate of 6 25 higher interest rates would then percolate through the u s economy affecting consumer and business spending if the reaction were powerful a recession might result spending would weaken unemployment would rise confidence would fall china s dumping of treasuries would escalate the economic conflict between the two countries it would signal a second fundamental break with the post world war ii global economic system the first being trump s aggressive use of tariffs but two practical caveats arise first the chinese might be victims of their own policies a global recession would reduce exports compounding the effect of the 25 u s tariffs on 200 billion of chinese exports the dollar s exchange rate might fall while china s renminbi might rise the shift in exchange rates would weaken china s competitive position china s sale of some u s treasuries would also reduce the value of the treasuries that aren t sold why would the chinese inflict these costs on themselves good question selling treasuries is perhaps the least potent weapon in its arsenal of potential retaliatory strikes against u s trade sanctions says economist eswar prasad of cornell university he doubts that china will do it the second caveat is the opposite of the first it is that china might sell lots of treasuries and very little would happen interest rates would hardly budge already china s current account surplus a broad measure of trade has been shrinking and this implies that china is accumulating fewer dollars than before but that hasn t sent interest rates soaring they remain historically low the rate on 10 year treasuries is less than 2 5 one explanation is that the world seems to have a huge appetite for u s treasury securities which are called safe assets by financial experts this means that despite all of america s economic and political problems investors don t believe the united states would default on its government debt treasuries are a good place to leave idle funds the various possible consequences have led many observers to doubt that china would deliberately try to undermine the u s treasury market this is how capital economics a forecasting firm judged the prospects wouldn t be sensible if such a fire sale drove up their yields china would lose money on its remaining holdings it might also lead to greater instability in emerging financial markets this includes china which the authorities there want to avoid david smick editor of the international economy magazine echoes this appraisal dumping treasuries poses too many risks including a global recession it s a declaration of war not just against the united states but the world he says i don t think the chinese are going to do that whatever happens the china story is undergoing significant revision not so long ago its economy was growing at a rate of 10 a year now that s slipped to about 6 and many economists expect it to decline further derek scissors of the american enterprise institute thinks it could drop to 4 5 this year and as low as 1 to 2 within a decade there are many obstacles to faster growth debt is one although it spurred growth in the past borrowing in china has now reached levels that look increasingly unsustainable from 2005 to 2018 loans to chinese nonfinancial corporations went from 112 of gdp to 152 of gdp reports the institute of international finance an industry research and advocacy group the resolution of this struggle is unclear but if nothing else the collision between the trump administration and beijing heralds a new era in u s china relations both countries are caught in contradiction being in conflict and dependent on each other at the same time robert samuelson is a columnist for the washington post

while celebrating memorial day yesterday at the family homestead discussions of the economy and markets accompanied our consumption of beer and barbecue u s unemployment is at a 50 year low the country s gross domestic product gdp growth was robust in the first quarter and the stock market year to date is up by double digits so why between mouthfuls was everyone grumbling about their investment prospects this gloominess is mirrored on wall street where bearish sentiment is rising the u s china trade war isn t helping president trump said yesterday that the u s was not ready to make a trade deal what s more the decade long recovery has peaked the economy has nowhere to go but down don t get me wrong you can still find growth opportunities in this market but the easy money is behind us you need to calibrate your portfolio toward the challenges ahead one smart move now is to increase your exposure to small cap stocks which are generally defined as having market valuations of between 300 million and 2 billion below i highlight the virtues of small caps and why they can help you mitigate risk and maximize growth but first let s look at the unmistakable red flags that you should heed and why they underscore the virtues of the small fry the red flags consumer spending accounts for nearly three fourths of the u s economy when this indicator weakens it s an ominous portent in the first quarter consumer spending slowed to a growth rate of only 1 2 down sharply from 2 5 in the previous quarter political uncertainty the threat of higher interest rates trade war tensions and a general sense of unease have prompted consumers to pull back especially on vehicle purchases not surprisingly several major retail outlets in the first quarter earnings season reported slow to flat sales growth business investment spending on equipment capital goods and factories rose only 3 from a year earlier whereas spending rose about 20 in the first quarter of 2018 in the wake of the massive u s corporate tax cut managers cited the trade war with china as the main culprit but lower business spending also is a function of slowing domestic demand even the unexpectedly high year over year growth of 3 2 in first quarter gdp is misleading as always you need to disregard the self serving government hype and look behind the numbers the jump in large part stems from the way corporations are responding to the trade war as tariffs take effect companies are excessively building up inventories to obtain materials and semi finished goods before their costs go up this frenzied stockpiling won t last many analysts already are predicting substantially lower growth for the next quarter morgan stanley revised its second quarter gdp growth estimate to 1 1 macroeconomic advisers expects a growth rate of 1 8 in both cases economists blamed the trade war and the artificial buildup in inventories for big growth think small in previous issues of mind over markets i ve outlined tactics to take amid today s dicey investment conditions read this story quarterly earnings don t expect the cavalry i ll now elaborate on why you should increase your exposure to small caps trump s america first policies pose a threat to export dependent giants but they d actually benefit small caps the majority of u s small caps derive the bulk of their sales domestically which means that trade wars and a strong u s dollar tend to hurt them less historically small caps outperform during inflationary and rising interest rate environments because they typically have low debt making the risk of refinancing debt expense at higher rates immaterial furthermore many small companies are disrupters that operate in new markets where competition is initially low they consequently enjoy the ability to raise prices easier than large caps which paves the way for high profit margins america s growth engine over the long term small caps tend to outperform the broader market the chart shows the 20 year price appreciation of the small cap benchmark russell 2000 index versus the s p 500 index every portfolio should have exposure to small caps now s a good time to start small businesses represent 99 7 of all u s employers they employ half of all private sector workers they account for up to 80 of the new jobs created annually in the country it s a truism that small companies form the heart of the country s job creation they also generate breakthrough technologies in this decade long bull market mega cap market leaders are poised to become laggards inflated expectations will catch up with them conversely several tailwinds position small stocks as safer havens for investors for one thing the tax bill signed by president trump in december 2017 confers many benefits on smaller companies profitable firms in the russell 2000 tend to pay higher taxes than global behemoths the big boys are adept at lowering their rates through expensive lobbyists and accountants they also avoid taxes by squirreling their profits overseas the tax bill slashed the top corporate rate to a flat 21 from the highest 35 rate the benefits of the tax bill are fading for large companies but they re more lasting for the smaller fry the tax overhaul included numerous changes to the taxation of income from pass through entities such as s corporations limited liability corporations and partnerships in general the new law allows businesses to exclude 20 of their net income from taxation subject to certain limitations the deduction also can be limited or disallowed for specified service trades such as lawyers doctors and accountants based on an income threshold overall the changes to the taxation of pass through entities already are beneficial to many small business owners that s a big and long lasting shot in the arm for the country s innovators another advantage for small companies is how trump s laissez faire cabinet members and agency heads are lessening regulations against the financial services sector that in turn is making it easier for regional banks to give loans to small companies to be sure small caps entail greater risk but they also confer greater upside potential america s small companies are positioned to outperform their larger brethren and provide much needed adrenaline to an economy that s probably on course for a downturn in a year abounding with investment peril the entrepreneurial little guy just might save the day questions about small cap stocks drop me a line mailbag investingdaily com john persinos is the managing editor of investing daily
part 2 importing mexico s worsening racial inequality part 3 america s imported caste system part 1 of a series on the mexican racial hierarchy and its implications for america the u s government has chosen to increasingly intertwine america s fate with that of mexico and thus with mexico s corrupt white power elite the u s treasury bails them out whenever their economic bubbles burst 1982 1994 by providing a safety valve that drains off mexico s most desperate young brown men our lax borders allow mexico s most avaricious old white men to loot their nation with impunity in the u s this mestizo influx generates ever greater quotas and set asides designed to propel their climb in american society in contrast in mexico all the best jobs in government industry and academia are becoming ever more segregated see mexican political scientist jorge g castaneda s february 1997 atlantic article ferocious differences today mexico s economy is finally climbing off the canvas where it landed with a thud when mexico unexpectedly devalued the peso on december 20 1994 america s high tech boom is pulling in mexican imports their economy is also bolstered by high oil prices in the words of pat buchanan s latest speech on immigration and u s mexican relations mexico has colluded with opec to keep oil off the world market to gouge the americans who bailed out mexico five years ago so much for gratitude thus the ancient hope is starting to spread again this time mexico has truly turned the corner into modernity syndicated columnist raoul lowery contreras writes based on a pollyannaish article by joel millman in the 4 14 2000 wall street journal that in another decade or so the american economy will face shortages of illegal immigrants from mexico then we ll presumably endure the horrible fate of needing to pay california stoop laborers enough so that they can stop living in caves one can always hope of course this isn t the first time the mexican economy boomed in one of their presidential election years their last three economic expansions also culminated during the campaigns of 1976 1982 and 1994 only to be followed immediately by shocking collapses in this series of columns i ll attempt to explain why sophisticated american institutions like the wall street journal are forever having their fond hopes dashed by mexico we gringos constantly misunderstand mexico in large part because we are clueless about mexico s subtle but oppressive racial hierarchy of whites on top mixed race mestizos in the middle and pure indians way way down at the bottom mexico has no overt color line and the government promotes a mestizo identity for all mexicans yet the elites have been getting whiter mexico s last election year 1994 was particularly memorable no one doubts that the previous presidential election in 1988 had actually been won by the leftist candidate cuauthemoc cardenas son of the mestizo president who seized the oil industry from foreign owners in 1938 however the institutional revolutionary party pri which has ruled mexico since 1929 stole enough ballots to put harvard educated carlos salinas in power despite this embarrassing entry into power salinas who enjoyed a close relationship with the bush family quickly became the darling of the wall street journal for his free market reforms to demonstrate its newfound commitment to democracy the pri announced that in 1994 it would no longer pay for its political campaigns out of the government treasury so salinas simply invited to dinner the thirty moguls to whom he had sold off government run monopolies he extracted from these close personal friends pledges to pitch in to the pri s kitty 25 000 000 american dollars apiece at this single billionaire s banquet the pri netted promises totaling three quarters of a billion u s dollars eat your heart out bill clinton after president clinton pushed the north american free trade agreement nafta through congress in 1993 washington and wall street assumed that the trade pact s first day of operation january 1 1994 would mark the beginning of the end for mexico s poverty feudalism and violence instead early that morning a revolution broke out impoverished mayan indians driven to despair by cuts in price supports for their corn crops which the u s demanded so that midwestern agribusinesses could price the peasants out of the corn market seized control of much of the deep southern state of chiapas of course as everywhere else in mexico the indians marxist leaders were white today subcommandante marcos still clings to power in the jungles later that eventful year luis donald colosio the presidential candidate of the ruling institutional revolutionary party pri the equivalent of al gore was gunned down during a campaign rally in tijuana salinas government responded by advancing numerous conflicting theories about who dun it leaving the citizenry too confused and cynical to focus their outrage on any particular caudillo colosio s killing remains unsolved that fall another hired gunman assassinated the chairman of the pri now the next few paragraphs might seem confusing if you don t recall the case this is because your mind will refuse to believe that what you re reading is something that could happen outside of say shakespeare at his most titus andronicus style lurid but the following is all true so far as we can know anything for sure about what really happens within mexico s incestuous elite the dead pri chairman pepe ruiz massieu had married president salinas sister but the marriage ended it is said when that lady discovered her husband in bed with a man after his murder president salinas appointed as special prosecutor the victim s own brother mario ruiz massieu this investigator soon went on tv to dramatically accuse old guard pri politicians opposed to salinas modernizing of the murder meanwhile having secured the election of the pri s replacement presidential candidate ernesto zedillo ex president salinas was looking forward to an active retirement as the human emblem of the new world order clinton was backing salinas for the presidency of the world trade organization dow jones the owner of the wall street journal elected him to its board of directors then as so often happens to mexico s ex presidents as soon as power slips from their fingers the ex president s shiny reputation collapsed three weeks after salinas left power his economic house of cards fell and mexico plunged into a depression special prosecutor mario ruiz massieu fled to new jersey seven millions dollars were found in mario s texas bank account the zedillo administration announced that mario had been covering up the true murderer of his own brother so who was this real culprit according to president zedillo the mastermind behind the murder was former president salinas own brother raul whether or not the former first brother acted without the ex president s consent he took the fall after a four year long trial raul was sentenced to 27 years in prison meanwhile raul s wife was arrested in geneva for attempting to remove from their swiss safety deposit box about 100 000 000 which raul probably obtained from drug smugglers carlos salinas fearing that if he appeared on the street in mexico his former subjects might lynch him fled to ireland he lives there in exile today oh by the way dow jones didn t renominate salinas for their board of directors readers can find additional garish details about mexico s ruling class in mexico on the brink by pulitzer prize winning miami herald reporter andres oppenheimer the website of a pbs frontline documentary on the salinas brothers is also quite juicy what kind of social system produces such people and what does it portend for the u s as our culture becomes more influenced by mexican norms in subsequent columns i ll explore the insidious effects of mexico s little discussed racial system is founder of the human biodiversity

time to participate joining me today is cary dunston chairman and ceo cary will begin with a review of the quarter and i ll add additional details regarding our financial performance after our comments we ll be happy to answer your questions cary s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer thank you scott and good morning to you all on prior earnings calls i ve regularly referenced the uncertainty in the market and the resulting volatility we experienced this volatility in our fourth quarter particularly by channel net sales were up 0 4 for the business as a whole looking at our net sales by channel within new construction we grew our business 5 over prior year within this our timberlake direct business comped very favorably while our frameless pcs business in southern california saw a year over year decline within our timberlake single family direct business we once again over indexed the market as we continue to leverage our direct to builder business it is important to note that the timberlake direct growth includes our low cost origins product that we established shortly after the acquisition although the number of opening price point single family starts continues to lag long term averages our team has been successfully bidding business with our origins product and winning share across the country the vast majority of the nation s top builders are all moving to increased investments and lower priced homes however this will take time as they have to develop and launch strategic business models at the more challenging lower price point we continue to firmly believe that opening price point homes will begin to over index as starts climb toward more historical levels providing affordable homes for the millennials that have recently entered the prime buying age is critical to industry growth as i ve stated on this call in the past i believe that real demand is strong the industry simply needs to find affordable solutions strategically we re very well positioned to continue to serve the nation s top builders with origins through our direct network as the market grows with regards to our new construction pcs business it is heavily concentrated in southern california where the market has seen a notable reduction in housing starts driven by a very significant home price inflation and the resulting affordability issue outside of southern california in our timberlake direct business we seeing mixed results by region despite the continued decline in southern california northern california is on a more positive trajectory following a slowdown over the winter months it too has been impacted by rapid home inflation however we expect it to return to positive comps this quarter our strongest growth was in texas atlanta was also very strong after recovering from record rainfall however the rest of the southeast was relatively flat year over year the northeast and southwest had strong comps as did florida however we are currently seeing some volatility within the florida market nothing that we are overly concerned with yet however we are keeping a close eye on it despite indications that point to a bumpy year we do remain optimistic within single family new construction we certainly recognize the macroeconomic factors that work both globally and within the us that can impact our economy and our industry specifically the tariffs remain unpredictable global companies are being impacted and the stock prices are showing it tariffs can also drive inflation in the us consumer confidence can then come into question impacting the entire economy however although many variables are at play we absolutely continue to believe in the long term growth of this industry housing supply is far too low to support underlying demand when you include historical low existing home inventory levels particularly opening price point homes the supply is even more constrained entry level consumers are more price elastic than the more affluent consumer base that has supported our industry post recession we simply need to generate affordable supply american woodmark has the best low cost supply chain and can absolutely support demand for affordable housing while leveraging the most reliable service platform in the business it is only a matter of time looking at the remodel business which includes our dealer distributor and home center businesses revenue was down 2 to prior year our dealer distributor business grew 4 for the quarter despite a slowing by the more affluent consumer our dealer business is positioned as a value based product particularly when considering the industry leading service we provide to our sales team and customer care organization as a result compared to industry data we continue to believe we are gaining share our home center business proved to be challenging with a negative 4 comp for the quarter we saw low single digit decline within made to order and mid single digit within our finished stock kitchen businesses within made to order we do not believe we have lost any share as is tied to overall kitchen department sales however within stock kitchens we believe we are being impacted due to fairly aggressive promotional activity within the home center that carries competitive product consumers are fairly elastic on stock product and will oftentimes shop both home centers for the best price although we offer a superior program with greater skews and a quick ship program it is difficult to overcome notable price separation we continue to monitor the situation and are working closely with our partner to restore our share within bath and vanity we re down low single digits for the quarter however we faced a challenging comp associated with a large new product load in at one of our key partners in our fourth fiscal quarter of prior year looking forward we do expect that to comp positively lastly our designer series product which is our frameless offering within one of our home center partners continues to comp very positively with high double digit growth overall looking forward within remodel the story remains similar to new construction accurate forecasting is a challenge i believe future remodel growth is heavily dependent upon existing home sales given the average age of homes and the average age of the kitchen cabinetry within these homes kitchen remodeling will heavily correlate to existing home sales i have consistently stated that kitchen remodeling has never recovered coming out of the great recession existing home buying cycle has yet to normalize with baby boomers aging in place and millennials being challenged with affordability the cycle is having a significant impact on our industry however we continue to see what i believe to be an extraordinary level of pent up demand the cycle will speed up and when it does the impact will be very significant on kitchen remodeling affordable solutions will be the key and we are well poised to serve despite the shorter term uncertainty that existed in the economy and our industry we absolutely believe that future is worth investing in those that get it right will win american woodmark will absolutely win moving on to our gross margin we continued to see improvement trend over the past three quarters coming in at 21 4 our operational performance was strong in our fourth quarter our teams have truly done an exceptional job on integration and we are performing better than expected on cost synergies with opportunity remaining material inflation and logistics costs continue to be our two greatest challenges although low grade lumber pricing in the housing industry has come down the high grade maple we purchase continues to inflate we have also had inflation across a number of other raw materials likewise logistics cost is and will remain a major headwind into the future our nationwide assembly coverage absolutely helps us compared to our competitors however logistics cost is impacting us all regarding the 10 tariff and what may soon be a 25 tariff our purchasing team has been hard at work mitigating as much of the costs as we can we remain committed to minimize the overall net cost impact through our combined resourcing and leveraging our low cost system and as a reminder we have not taken any pricing action related to the tariffs as of yet if the 25 indeed comes into play we will be required to take some future pricing action however as i stated on prior calls given our ability to mitigate much of the impact we will be more competitively positioned against both domestic manufacturers and importers of chinese product if the administration were to expand the scope of the impacted product within the 301 tariff we would have immediate cost implications until we were able to complete a restructuring strategy on these specific products the larger unknown is related to the anti dumping countervailing duty lawsuit that is under way this lawsuit is targeting the evident dumping of subsidized chinese cabinetry into america if this lawsuit is successful we will have some additional short term incremental impact however given the mitigation work already under way on the impacted product the net incremental cost will not be significant however we do believe it would have a positive impact on our competitive positioning in the market our team is evaluating this opportunity and we will be prepared to work with our partners to supply any shift in demand we have a competitive low cost product and the ability to deliver it moving on to our adjusted ebitda margin we finished the quarter at 15 7 despite the headwinds and the fact that we have not taken any pricing action associated with the tariffs we are very pleased with this performance our cost synergy work and our ability to leverage our all of our channels with all of our expanded product offering is proving to be a winning strategy on adjusted net income we generated 31 5 million in the quarter up from 29 million in the prior year and our adjusted earnings per diluted share was about 1 87 versus 1 64 prior year lastly we generated 151 5 million of free cash flow for the fiscal quarter in our fourth quarter we completed the 50 million stock repurchase authorization as well as continued to pay down our debt we ended the year with a net leverage of 2 59 in summary in the second half of our fiscal year we faced greater uncertainty in our market the industry continues to be impacted by macro and micro economic factors that are influencing consumer behavior although single family housing starts have declined year over year they have shown a more favorable trend in the past two months we continue to well over index market within our direct to builder network particularly when considering the 60 to 90 day lag between starts and cabinet installation having said this new construction growth is becoming more volatile by region our direct to builder network and frontline positioning allows us to keep a strong pulse on current reality within the industry looking forward we believe single family starts will continue to recover growing low single digits in our fiscal year 20 we expect to continue to over index and gain market share during this period developing affordable housing is a critical link to restoring higher growth rates this will come once again in the questions timing we are well positioned and we ll continue to gain share with our origins product within repair and remodel we are once again forecasting low to mid single digit growth looking forward however the demand is going to be very lumpy quarter to quarter particularly within home center focused sales events promotional activity and strategic initiatives with our retail partners will impact quarterly sales not to mention the impact of economic factors the key driver to greater r r comps in our industry is growth in existing home sales this is particularly true with first time home buyers the pent up demand is significant we simply need the housing cycle to support it having said this we do have a number of incremental growth opportunities that we are developing not only those related to our synergy work but new channels of opportunities with new customers in addition we remain fully committed to restoring our stock kitchen business in the two markets lost before the acquisition we absolutely have the best low cost product offering as well as the best solution with our express options and quick ship programs our team is working aggressively with our business partner on restoring these markets on the margin side we will face some key headwinds in next year that will be difficult to fully overcome in the short term not only through inflation and tariffs but due to the incremental cost passed down from the home center partner to vendors associated with adding dedicated merchandising teams we are also having to relocate our pcs manufacturing facility in southern california unfortunately we were notified that the owner has sold the building and that the new owner will terminate agreement at the end of the contract as a result we have secured another facility and we ll be incurring the cost associated with relocating our operations over the next year we will absolutely protect our customer base and we ll be taking the opportunity to invest in some new more efficient manufacturing equipment and processes during this move in wrapping up our fiscal year 20 will be an extremely important year for our company we are launching a new six year vision for 2025 that will elevate us to new levels never before imagined our customers and our employees are at the heart of this vision we will be driving our thinking to a very innovative and systems based approach throughout our entire value stream we will be the innovative leader in the market and we ll continue to win in all channels we recognize that the coming months in this fiscal year will be fraught with challenging headwinds yet we will not allow ourselves to be distracted from our vision and the strategy that we are developing that will ensure our continued success with that i thank you and i ll now turn it over to scott for the detailed financials m scott culbreth senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks cary the financial headlines for the quarter net sales were 407 million representing an increase of 0 4 over the same period last year adjusted net income was 31 5 million or 1 87 per diluted share in the current fiscal year versus 29 million or 1 64 per diluted share last year adjusted net income was positively impacted by additional sales volumes lower interest expense and lower taxes which was partially offset by 1 2 million or 0 05 impact for fixed asset write offs adjusted ebitda was 63 8 million or 15 7 of sales compared to 65 3 million or 16 1 of net sales for the same quarter in the prior fiscal year the decrease during the fourth fiscal quarter was primarily due to tariffs and transportation rate increases for the fiscal year ended april year to date net sales were 1 645 billion representing an increase of 32 over the same period last year adjusted net income was 119 7 million or 6 91 per diluted share in the current fiscal year versus 87 7 million or 5 24 per diluted share last year adjusted ebitda was 244 9 million or 14 9 of net sales compared to 175 8 million or 14 1 of net sales for the same period in the prior fiscal year the new construction market remained challenging during the quarter recognizing a 60 to 90 day lag between start and cabinet installation the overall market activity in single family homes was down 2 7 for the financial fourth quarter single family starts during december january and february averaged 857 000 units starts over that same time period from the prior year averaged 881 000 units our builder channel net sales increased 5 for the quarter despite a significant slowdown in the southern california market remodel business continues to be challenging on the positive side unemployment remains low therefore u3 unemployment rate was 3 6 and u6 was 7 3 both measures were lower than the april 2018 reported figures interest rates decreased in the quarter with a 30 year fixed rate mortgage at 4 14 in april a decrease of approximately 33 basis points versus last year this year first time buyers increased the march reported rate was 33 versus 30 reported last march keep in mind the share remains well below the historical norm of 40 on the negative side consumer sentiment decreased to 97 2 in april versus the 98 8 recorded in april 2018 existing home sales decreased during the first calendar quarter of 2019 during january and march of 2019 existing home sales averaged 5 2 million units at same period for 2018 averaged 5 47 million units a decrease of 4 9 the median existing home price rose 3 8 to 159 400 from march impacting our consumers affordability index all cash purchases in march were 21 up from 20 last year residential investment as a percent of gdp for the first calendar quarter 2019 decreased to 3 2 versus 3 4 in the prior year home ownership rates remained low versus historical averages the percent of americans entering their home in the first calendar quarter was 64 2 which was flat to last year s rate our combined home center and independent dealer and distributor channel net sales were down 2 for the quarter with home centers decreasing 4 and dealer distributor growing 4 the company s gross profit margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 was 21 4 of net sales versus 22 reported in the same quarter last year gross margin in the fourth quarter was unfavorably impacted by higher transportation cost tariffs and raw material inflation these impacts were partially offset by higher sales volumes price and overhead cost leverage due to higher volumes with respect to the 301 tariffs assuming the tariffs are maintained at the 25 levels we could be exposed to approximately 5 6 million of potential annual direct cost increases in addition to the original 10 tariffs our teams are working to mitigate the impact through supplier negotiations supply chain repositioning internal productivity measures and pricing action if required should the 301 tariffs expand to additional categories we would have an additional exposure of approximately 4 million year to date gross profit margin was 21 1 compared to 20 4 for the same period of prior year gross margin for the current fiscal year was favorably impacted by higher sales volumes price mix and overhead costs leveraged due to higher volumes these favorable impacts were partially offset by higher transportation costs tariffs and raw material inflation total operating expenses were 11 9 of net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with 12 6 of net sales for the same period in fiscal 2018 through 12 months operating expenses increased from 11 8 of net sales to 12 4 selling and marketing expenses were 5 3 of net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with 5 6 of net sales for the same period in fiscal 2018 the decrease in the ratio is a result of lower display and personnel costs general and administrative expenses were 6 6 of net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with 7 of net sales for the same period of fiscal 2018 the decrease in the ratio was driven by reduction in acquisition related expenses of 2 6 million which was partially offset by higher incentive costs free cash flow totaled 151 5 million for the current fiscal year compared to 36 9 million in the prior year net leverage was 2 59 times adjusted ebitda at the end of the fourth fiscal quarter the company paid down 120 million of its term loan facility during the fiscal year and repurchased 745 000 shares of common stock at a cost of 50 million in closing despite the slowdown in the new construction market and volatility within the remodel market we were pleased with our adjusted ebitda performance for the fourth fiscal quarter regarding our fiscal year 20 outlook for the market we expect the following single family housing starts to grow approximately 3 to 5 interest rates decline along with continued increases in the average price of new homes those factors will negatively impact affordability particularly for the important first time and first upgrade buyers unemployment should remain steady tariff impacts will remain uncertain cabinet remodeling sales will continue to be challenged until economic trends remain consistently favorable growth is expected at roughly a low to mid single digit rate during the company s fiscal 2020 in this environment our expectations for the company performance are as follows company s home center market share will remain at normalized levels for fiscal 2020 however this is heavily dependent upon competitive promotional activity the company will continue to gain market share and is growing independent dealer and distributor channel company s builder business will increase at faster rate in the market rate for single family housing starts due to continued share gains in total the company expects that we ll grow sales at a mid single digit rate in fiscal 2020 margins will be challenged with increases in labor costs raw materials tariffs and transportation rates the company will also be negatively impacted by the move of one of our california facilities that cary indicated earlier and incremental merchandising expenses as a result the company expects adjusted ebitda margin to decrease slightly for fiscal 2020 this concludes our prepared remarks we ll be happy to answer any questions you have at this time questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions we ll take our first question from truman patterson with wells fargo truman patterson wells fargo analyst hey good morning guys and thanks for taking my questions first just wanted to dig into your margin guidance a little bit more you guys said that there were some cost inflation some tariffs home centers are passing on some costs to you all could you guys just elaborate a little bit more and maybe when you think that you might be able to inflect positive and cover all of those costs or do you think that they could actually remain a headwind and margins could decline throughout the full year fiscal 2020 s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer good morning truman this is cary i m going to provide a little higher level overview and then scott can jump in and provide some details if desired but so as we mentioned we do have inflation on several fronts some of those were unknown we have in our current forecasting we have baked in the 10 tariff tariffs beyond that obviously are still questionable so we have not baked anything in so there would be some financial impacts obviously our response on that two fold number one is we do have additional sourcing options we can take there is some timing related to that but we do have the option obviously given our low cost platform mexico has other resourcing options and then also we do have the pricing trigger that we have not pulled as of yet so i personally do believe that the market is becoming more elastic so that s why we ve been heavily focused on resourcing and trying to mitigate the cost of really all the inflation including logistics material and the potential tariff through our own internal resourcing options so but we do have that potential out there so as far as timing it s hard to really say just because there s so much questions around the tariffs themselves the anti dumping countervailing duty is really late summer on into early fall and then the 25 301 tariff obviously is really anybody s guess obviously we have a short term impact potentially but i think most of us believe that if it does hit the likelihood of that lasting very long is not high but once again it s just getting harder and harder to predict so we are proceeding with the actions around sourcing so there is that most of that cost is really already identified with the exception that they do expand the scope of the 301 we have not taken any action on that yet so the timing wise it s just as i said forecasting is getting very hard to predict and the tariffs and everything are certainly contributing to that but scott mentioned that we do expect some pressure on ebitda but obviously a lot is in the year right now m scott culbreth senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah the only thing i would add there is sorry truman all i would add there is certainly the tariff situation is uncertain is the best way to describe it and just from a short term perspective certainly there could be pressure on our performance if it s expanded if anti dumping comes through et cetera but our perspective is that long term we offset that and we re going to offset either through sourcing changes or pricing action but quarter to quarter it could be noisy based on actions that are taken s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer and then obviously with the tariffs as i ve said before i still believe the tariffs are a net positive for american woodmark just given our positioning we stand to gain a fairly notable competitive advantage in the market so obviously what s not baked into our budget as well or on to our plan for next year is any upside potential related to the 301 tariff or the anti dumping tariff that would improve our competitive positioning truman patterson wells fargo analyst yeah and possibly some share gains heard you clear on the 301 tariff the 25 that s been implemented i guess since it s not included in guidance thinking more near term just over the next two to three quarters how long will that take to flow through your supply chain and actually hit your p l s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer the good thing is that s unlike the initial 10 it did not include everything that was already under water so there was a delay there so it should be a month and a half i would guess m scott culbreth senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah we ll still we ll have impacts inside the definitely in q1 if they stay that s a big question right if it stays so he gave himself a little buffer there to for to stop it but right now we as you stated we are all planning on hitting truman patterson wells fargo analyst okay ok and then just jumping over to the home center channel you guys made a few comments that it was challenging there were some promotional activities some product loading comp and everything reading through the home centers conference calls it seems like they had low single digit growth you guys revenues declined could you guys just elaborate a little bit more on this dichotomy if you will and maybe what your strategy is for maintaining that market share m scott culbreth senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah if you looked at the home center comps that was holistically not really they didn t call out the kitchen and bath department at a 3 comp so our database shows we were in line with overall home center comps particularly on the major order side now on the in stock side basically the cash and carry stock product category what i was referencing you mentioned a couple of things there the load in a year ago was on the bath side so that created basically when you do a low one we the vendor orders are quite a bit of inventory that results in a net positive increase in our revenue we reported that in our fourth quarter fiscal year last year so we had a hard comp coming into this prior quarter but going forward we expect back to positive comps within bath so bath right now is not really as big of a challenge when you look at the kitchen cabinet side of it on the stock side is as i think most know we provide stock cabinetry on the kitchen side to one key home center and our competitor provides to another key home center one of the based on our competitive on that front the home center themselves really have been doing quite a bit of a promotional activity in the stock space not just in cabinet here really across the board but also in cabinetry and we definitely saw a noticeable shift in i think some of that demand from our partner over to the other home center which is impacting our stock sales so timing wise i mean that home center is continuing with that promotional activity we are working with our partner on we re not we re going to have any type of response obviously there is other strategic options we have as well but we ve been fairly reluctant particularly given our low price point when you re getting the promotional activity we ve all seen what has happened over the past four years on the made to order side so we are very reluctant to jump into any type of promotional gain down at that low price level that s just it s it really does promote the margin and obviously we have a better product offering and we re right now we re sticking with our position but once again we will continue to play it by ear and see how the market goes truman patterson wells fargo analyst okay thank you guys s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator we ll take our next question from garik shmois with longbow research garik shmois longbow research analyst thank you i m just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on the cost impact of the frameless pcs move in southern california and also wondering is the new facility that you re moving to in southern california are there opportunities to look at some maybe lower cost markets s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer yeah good morning this is cary so we re not we don t provide specific details on the cost other than that it is broken down into our what scott alluded to some of the challenges for our forward looking ebitda so it is built into that number the challenge we really had was timing so you asked a very good question is there lower cost options longer term potentially we re going to do that analysis one of the challenges we have is that that pcs business is i d say heavily dominated in southern california it s 90 plus probably 95 in southern california it s one of the challenges that most companies have of serving that market as you know if you ve been to southern california the logistics side of it is very very challenging so to move a plant outside of that area has a lot of cost to it so right now we are sticking with another location it s in southern california one of the challenges we had through the acquisition is most of the sites that we acquired were leased versus owned longer term my strategy would be to move away from leased and get into owned facilities just to avoid this type of unannounced type of challenge but this current one is another lease facility and it is located in southern california so we did the analysis and we did complete cost analysis we looked at bordering states and so forth and this was the best cost option despite some of the challenges of obviously relocating garik shmois longbow research analyst okay thanks and you ve been taking share with homes with the home builders and looking at your outlook for fiscal 2020 you re looking at home construction of 3 to 5 just wondering if you can maybe frame how much in excess of the market you would continue to expect to grow s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer yeah that s how we always are we always typically just say we over index i think you can go back just look at historical numbers and where we can t compare to the industry and obviously we have fairly regularly over indexed the market obviously it does vary it s getting really harder like i said by region because of the volatility but we are the number obviously provider in that market in fact our timberlake brand is we believe the largest brand in the country period now so we have a lot of success with that product with the brand and we will continue to over index the market garik shmois longbow research analyst okay thank you operator operator instructions we ll take our next question from justin speer with zelman associates justin speer zelman associates analyst all right good morning thanks guys i just wanted to a few questions one wanted to get a sense for the free cash flow for next year it was very good this year but for your guidance if you could maybe give us a little hand holding there that would be helpful m scott culbreth senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah so i don t want to give a specific value justin but i will tell you as a reminder when you look back at the first quarter results for the prior fiscal year there was the one time benefit associated with that tax receivable carryover so there was about a 30 million swing associated with that but i would back off before you do any modeling moving into fiscal year 20 the one thing i will give you some direction on would be around capex in displays and we do think it will be slightly higher than what we spent in fiscal year 19 as we do have some higher display cost coming our way justin speer zelman associates analyst okay thank you and then with regards to the merchandising change just maybe give us a little bit more hand holding there with regards to what kind of personnel you re looking to potentially put into these stores and maybe how that compares to what you had last year s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer justin this was related to it s been fairly public knowledge that obviously one of the home centers basically has modified their merchandising process so they ve actually created full time teams now that are responsible for merchandising within the stores themselves and they basically travel to stores and responsible for making sure the inventory is obviously in stock and basically everything is in alignment with their plan so they basically reached out to the vendors and asked us all to help fund what they call the merchandising support teams and that s something that most vendors have openly communicated on their calls because it is a noticeable impact justin speer zelman associates analyst okay so you re not changing your headcount it s just supporting s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer no we have no headcount involved whatsoever so it s basically our sales force that s in place we work directly with the merchandising teams but no we have no additional incremental headcount it s all up to the home center themselves justin speer zelman associates analyst okay ok that s helpful and i know you re not going to give us any details but in terms of the costs is it more than 50 basis points less than 50 basis points in terms of the incremental drag there s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer sorry we re giggling so i ll get back to your m scott culbreth senior vice president and chief financial officer i m giggling a lot we re not going to give any specifics around exactly what that cost but it was meaningful for most vendors it s hard to give a detail obviously because all we do is cabinetry as you know and for us to give a certain percentage would give our competitors an exact number so basically it was a negotiated number that we had specifically with our merchant team as every supplier had as well so justin speer zelman associates analyst okay and in terms of the growth contribution from the origins product in the quarter or maybe even for the full year and thinking about what you ve accomplished this year and then potentially what you re thinking for next year is there any context that you can give us there s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer it s difficult once again because it s built into our timberlake growth number so we really don t want to get into calling on a very specific number for a specific product but we will say if you go back to what we committed from go back to the acquisition and our plans with regards to revenue growth specifically in this space of single family new construction the net number would be less than we hoped it would be right now however our market share gain i would say is on plan as you said the total pie is not as large as what we hoped it would be right now so we feel it s coming we are gaining share it s an exceptional product obviously it s in history of the company we have never been able to go down to that lower price point opening price point position and make a strong margin like we have now so our teams have been very successful at that we absolutely are gaining share so when we talk about those comps within timberlake on the direct side it is inclusive of origins and obviously as you can kind of put one to one together as the market starts to move more toward opening price point and it begins to over index i think that will be a good test to our ability to gain share with this product because it will be required for us to continue to grow in that space justin speer zelman associates analyst and thinking about just couching this in the context of potential anti dumping duties tariff potentially stepping up to 25 and thinking about this origins strategy do you think that may give you that catalyst to jump start that growth and maybe accelerate it to the point that you may be originally thought s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer yeah absolutely it s a very good question and a very good point we have two platforms number one the origins which is our it s a frame product offering which is more standard in america and yes we have that at a very affordable price point that we can go out and successfully bid on business that assuming the anti dumping kind of duty comes into play it will be very well positioned to do that in addition what i talked about with our pcs we do produce our frameless product now in southern california but we also produce it in texas and we ve been seeing very solid very aggressive growth on that within one home center that is the frameless platform that tends to be more relevant for the younger generation millennials and so forth because it s more of a european look and likewise we will be able to also hit the market very hard with that just once again because of the price point and the look of it so we feel we are well positioned given our product offering assuming the anti dumping countervailing duty comes into play justin speer zelman associates analyst excellent and last question from me just some assets coming to market that are outside of your traditional price point any potential interest or the economics such that you may we shouldn t be surprised if you participate with your leverage profile coming in a little bit here to 2 6 times s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer as you know we will obviously do our proper due diligence of that if any opportunity comes along and at this point we re just in the process of analyzing the situation you re referencing justin speer zelman associates analyst thank you guys appreciate it s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator we ll take our next question from tim wojs with rw baird tim wojs robert w baird analyst hey guys good morning s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer good morning tim wojs robert w baird analyst just i guess maybe thinking about pricing i know you haven t put through pricing for tariffs but is there any way you could just kind of elaborate or give some color on what type of pricing you ve put through for inflation and logistics inflation m scott culbreth senior vice president and chief financial officer you mean in this past year tim wojs robert w baird analyst yeah m scott culbreth senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah so we don t give the specifics there tim but go back to our q3 time period we talked about that pricing action taking place in november and that was on the made to order frame platform really at the home center and dealer distributor so these pricing actions went in and those actions were really to mitigate and offset prior period increases from an inflationary perspective on both the laws as well as the transportation side because of the timing that did not include anything specifically related to the 10 tariffs because those came about as we were doing the negotiation on pricing so looking forward the pricing action will be to again come back and have a tariff conversation tim wojs robert w baird analyst okay okay and then as you think of just the uses of free cash flow any should we just expect i think you ve exhausted the buybacks any kind of opportunity there for another one and then i guess should we just assume that you re going to use free cash flow in 2020 to continue to delever m scott culbreth senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah tim so from an assumption standpoint just assume we will continue to pay down the debt the one thing i will note for you is when we did the credit agreement modification earlier this calendar year we did get some favorable terms with respect to the interest rates as well as some of the covenants around that and if we get below particular thresholds it does open the door for us to perhaps look at repurchases again so that s something that may come up down the road but for the time being we will be focused on debt payment tim wojs robert w baird analyst okay okay great and then a couple of other small ones just the tax rate for the year is 26 still a good tax rate m scott culbreth senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah i would still use approximately 26 tim wojs robert w baird analyst okay great appreciate the time s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer okay tim m scott culbreth senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks operator operator instructions we ll take our next question from steven ramsey with thompson research group steven ramsey thompson research group analyst good morning guys wanted to get more on the gross margin decline how much of it was general cost headwinds how much of it was sales mix trend given i guess i would just assume less home center sales as a tailwind to some extent and then how much any sort of quantification on the synergy benefits m scott culbreth senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah so you said gross margin so i ll focus on that one no specifics i m going to offer dollarization around each of the categories just again the main players for us from a year over year standpoint in the fourth fiscal quarter would have been transportation costs of course the tariffs which we ve talked a lot about here today and then some raw material inflation impacts steven ramsey thompson research group analyst excellent and then on the dealer distributor channel can you discuss with the positive outlook for 2020 how much of that how much of the impact is price and mix s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer yeah so we said remodel as a whole we do expect to grow low to mid single digits within the dealer side i mentioned they are seeing a decline with regards to the more affluent consumer we tend to be comping a little more favorably just given our value position one of the unknowns out there is related to the anti dumping countervailing duty because what folks don t realize is kind of a lot of that chinese dumping product that s mentioned in the lawsuit a good percentage of that has fed into the dealer channel and really impacted more of the semi custom side but certainly creates an opportunity for us as well if that were to come through so growth is i would say it s unpredictable at this point a lot of variables lot of macro and micro factors in there net net pricing for us wasn t a significant impact so when we talk about growth of low to mid that s really not including much pricing impact in there it s going to be pure growth but a lot of unknowns in there though steven ramsey thompson research group analyst great and then my last question centers more on the capex side of things for 2020 i guess there was about 7 million of capex for the new headquarters last year is that investment finished and then thinking about the new facility will we see that impact in 2020 with even including the manufacturing improved manufacturing capabilities within that facility m scott culbreth senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah so the guidance i provided on the prior question with respect to free cash flow and i mentioned capex in displays being slightly higher than prior year that s mostly due to additional display spend and inside that number is incremental capital cost associated with the transition and move to the new facility and some of that is for productivity improvement but some of it s just basic infrastructure work that we ve got to do as well steven ramsey thompson research group analyst excellent thank you operator operator instructions we ll take our next question from julio romero with sidoti company julio romero sidoti company analyst hey good morning s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer good morning julio julio romero sidoti company analyst can you talk about the in stock kitchen segment has that promotional activity you saw in the quarter carried into may in the first quarter here at all s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer yeah we are seeing once again it s the competitive product that s in the other home center it s a home center themselves that is promoting that stock cabinetry and yes that is proceeding so we are obviously in conversations with our partner and we ll be developing the strategy going forward but yes it s going into q1 julio romero sidoti company analyst okay and you mentioned in your prepared remarks some opportunities for some incremental top line growth i think you mentioned some new customers could you elaborate on that at all s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer other than that no not no detail obviously by customer but kind of two fronts number one obviously is with our expanded product offering through the acquisition and obviously low cost platform as we ve been out actively pursuing new channels and new customers so we are in conversation with potential customers and so forth as always but i think we just have a very viable and strategic footprint now that helps when we approach customers just because of the expanded portfolio in addition obviously is there are some i ll say retailers customers out there in various channels that have gotten wind of the anti dumping countervailing duty lawsuit and are starting to put contingency plans in place and therefore we are taking calls and working on potential options to service an expanded customer base if they were to hit so yes there is some potential opportunities julio romero sidoti company analyst understood and on the rsi integration i think you re about year and a half into your integration plan i think you had initially called out 30 million to 40 million of annual run rate synergies where would you say you are in terms of that annual run rate target m scott culbreth senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah i d say we re the biggest that we committed to in the first year first 12 months out was in single family so as i mentioned before the net is lower than we anticipated just because we have not seen the growth in the opening price point home nothing changed strategically other than just getting the industry to cooperate on that multifamily we are aggressively bidding i d say we re slightly behind but i mentioned i think on the last call that we are working on a very strategic plan for the multifamily that leverages our direct to builder network so we still remain very committed to that 30 million to 40 million lots of different variables out there right now but net net i think particularly with the anti dumping countervailing duty and the potential we have to leverage our low cost platform i think we certainly will plan to meet that julio romero sidoti company analyst got it that s helpful thanks for taking the questions s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer thanks operator and i do not see that there is anyone else waiting to ask a question i would like to turn the line over to mr culbreth for any closing comments m scott culbreth

monrovia former governor of the liberia national bank now the central bank of liberia professor ralaigh f seekie says the economic downward trend of the liberian economy can be restored if there are thorough review and scrutiny of the monetary and fiscal policies professor seekie a professional banker economist auditor accountant is very concern about the staggering economic situation in his country especially with the constant decline of the liberian banknotes against the united states dollars he said it is compelling upon him to intervene and provide workable recommendations for the forward match of the country the cuttington graduate school professor said in order for liberia to compete with the economies of other developing countries in the region its monetary policy must be critically analyzed to effectively utilize the monetary tools professor seekie has recommended several economic measures and says when fully implemented by policymakers it will ease the current economic situation the ordinary liberians are faced with on a daily basis the experienced liberian banker wants the cbl to regulate the interest rates of all commercial banks to enable poor liberians businesses to participate in the economy he added that an irrevocable letter of credit should be opened by the customers of all commercial banks for the importation of all essential commodities such as rice and flour building materials pharmaceutical products petroleum products educational materials amongst others he said an honest utilization of irrevocable letter of credit by commercial banks must be properly monitored to ensure that foreign exchange is used for the importation of essential goods not to be credited to individual off sure accounts that a special window should be opened in all of the commercial banks for the sole purpose of buying and selling foreign exchange which he believes will enable the central bank of liberia to monitor the exchange rates he said he said the arbitrary increase of foreign exchange rate without justifications besides the old saying that liberia imports more goods than what it exports might be true but proper mechanism can be put in place to tackle the foreign exchange problem professor seekie who is also owns a private accounting firm in monrovia also wants the ministry of commerce to monitor the issuance of import permit declaration ipd and should be thoroughly verified and ensure that importers open an irrevocable letter of credit through their respective commercial banks and be monitored by the regulation and supervision department of the cbl he said as an austerity measure it should be a policy of the ministry of finance and development planning in collaboration with the cbl and that all exporters should surrender between 25 to 35 percent of their proceeds from the sales of the products to the cbl and its equivalent in liberian dollars should be credited to the exporters account maintained in their respective banks depending on the existing rate at the time professor seekie is confident that if all these recommendations are considered or implemented the depreciation of the liberian dollar will be at an affordable level for the common people

peter schiff ceo and chief global strategist of euro pacific capital and euro pacific precious metals speaks to the demonstrators at the occupy wall street encampment in zuccotti park thursday oct 20 2011 in new york ap photo mary altaffer the russians have sold off nearly all of their u s treasury holdings and they re adding to their growing gold reserves peter schiff a manhattan investor and precious metals dealer who is known for being bearish on the u s economy and the dollar said he thinks the russians are preparing for an impending dollar crisis schiffgold specializes in gold and silver schiff founded the company in 2010 to deal gold for his brokerage clients he advises long term investment in gold as an inflation proof store of value dollar crisis in his 2007 book crash proof schiff wrote about how to profit from the economic collapse he has been bullish on long term investments in foreign stocks and currencies in countries with sound fiscal and monetary policies as well as global commodities including precious metals a dollar bear is a trader with a pessimistic strategy when trading the u s dollar against other currencies this strategy expects the u s dollar to decline against major currencies and considers this factor when positioning investment portfolios listen to ghogh with jamarlin martin episode 10 karen fleshman jamarlin talks with karen fleshman founder of racy conversations the lawyer and activist talks about women of privilege exploiting civil rights and diversity movements and whether kamala harris can be trusted on criminal justice reform russia expanded its gold holdings by 71 53 tons through the first four months of 2019 and now owns 2 183 46 tons of gold schiff reported meanwhile u s dollars in russian reserves fell from 46 percent to 22 percent in 2018 according to bank of america analysts the world has been on a dollar standard ever since the u s led the world off the gold standard schiff said this wasn t a problem when people perceived value in the dollar but schiff said he thinks that s going to change in the next recession when the fed goes back to zero and when we launch qe4 the fourth round of quantitative easing i think the dollar s role as a reserve currency is going to be questioned he said a stockbroker financial commentator and radio personality schiff hosts the peter schiff show podcast he s the former host of the podcast wall street unspun schiff said he thinks the u s uses the dollar as a weapon other countries don t like this and to the extent that they can move away from the dollar well then they kill two birds with one stone he said and one way of doing that is to increase their gold reserves now while gold is still cheap because when the dollar really starts to tank the price of gold is going to soar russia right now obviously wants to buy as much gold as it can while the price is still relatively cheap that allows it to build up a bigger hoard of gold to replace the diminished value that the dollar is going to play as a reserve currency schiff ran in the 2010 republican primary for a u s senate seat in connecticut losing to linda mcmahon china has also been buying gold he said one way to gain leverage in the trade war they can strengthen the yuan by selling dollars and buying gold it s not just possible for other countries to ditch the us dollar it s inevitable schiff said ultimately the u s won t have any leverage at all this the dollar as the reserve currency was an exorbitant privilege that the u s has enjoyed for decades but it has abused that privilege dramatically even more so recently with the sanctions so i think that privilege is going to be lost and with it will go the artificially high standard of living that came along with it in the united states the spot gold price today is 1 279 25 per ounce according tomoneymetals com
the three m s of hyperinflation milosevic mugabe and maduro what do slobodan milosevic robert mugabe and nicolás maduro have in common other than being leaders who kept the communist manifesto at their bedside all three ushered in devastating hyperinflations hyperinflations are rare they have only occurred when the supply of money has been governed by discretionary paper money standards no hyperinflation has ever been recorded when money has been commodity based or when paper money has been convertible into a commodity the first hyperinflation occurred during the french revolution 1789 96 when the mandat collapsed and the monthly inflation rate peaked at 143 in december of 1795 more than a century elapsed before another episode of hyperinflation occurred not coincidentally this period of currency tranquility occurred during the heyday of the gold standard with the emergence and adoption of fiat currencies the 20th century ushered in currency instability and inflation indeed since 1900 there have been 57 episodes of hyperinflation and five of those episodes can be claimed by yugoslavia zimbabwe and venezuela all are featured in the hanke krus world hyperinflation table below which first appeared in the routledge handbook of major events in economic history 2013 the hanke krus world hyperinflation table abbreviated milosevic and yugoslavia slobodan milosevic was in the saddle when inflation last gutted the rump yugoslavia the first of his many monetary shenanigans was uncovered on january 7 1991 when i served as an adviser in the ante marković reform government it was then that we discovered on december 28 1990 the milosevic controlled serbian parliament had secretly ordered the serbian national bank a regional central bank to issue some 1 4 billion in credits to friends of milosevic that illegal plunder equaled more than half of all the new money the national bank of yugoslavia had planned to emit in 1991 the heist sabotaged the markovic government s teetering plans for economic reform and hardened the resolve of leaders in croatia and slovenia to break away from belgrade without the croats and slovenes to fleece milosevic turned on his own people with a vengeance starting in january 1992 what was left of yugoslavia endured what was at the time the second highest hyperinflation in world history it peaked in january 1994 when i measured the monthly inflation rate at 313 000 000 the yugoslav hyperinflation episode lasted 24 long months nonetheless milosevic retained his grip on what was left of yugoslavia for another six years during the 24 month episode per capita income plunged by more than 50 ordinary people were forced to deplete their hard currency savings people couldn t afford to buy food in the free market they kept from starving by either waiting in long lines at state stores for irregularly supplied rations of low quality staples or by relying on relatives who lived in the countryside for long periods all of belgrade s gas stations were closed with the exception of one that catered to foreigners and embassy personnel people also spent an inordinate amount of time at the foreign exchange black markets where they exchanged huge piles of near worthless dinars into a single german mark or u s dollar note milosevic s monetary madness had destroyed the economy mugabe and zimbabwe fast forward to march of 2007 when robert mugabe was in his 19th year as president of zimbabwe the african country was experiencing an episode of hyperinflation that was destroying the economy pushing more of its inhabitants into poverty and forcing millions of zimbabweans to emigrate in the 1997 2007 period living standards as measured by real gross domestic product per capita fell by a stunning 38 the episode which peaked at an annual inflation rate of 89 7 sextillion percent that is 89 7 followed by 20 zeros in november of 2008 had robbed people of their savings and financial institutions of their capital through real inflation adjusted interest rates that were actually negative this form of theft occurred in large part due to laws and regulations governing financial institutions pensions funds insurance companies building societies and banks that forced them to either purchase government treasury bills that yielded only a small fraction of the current inflation rate or make deposits at the reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz that paid no interest so what was the cause of this economic meltdown the blame lay at the doorstep of the zimbabwean government whose policies forced the rbz to print money from january 2005 to may 2007 the rbz issued currency at a rate that exceeded that of germany s central bank from january 1921 to may 1923 the ramp up phase of the great german hyperinflation currency in circulation during this period the rbz more than doubled its staff from 618 to 1 360 employees despite this 120 increase in staff the rbz staff was incapable of producing accurate and timely data even the most standard economic and financial statistics arrived months late if at all with the help of alex kwok and my research assistants at the johns hopkins cato institute trouble currencies project i was able to fill the gap left by the rbz and accurately measure zimbabwe s first hyperinflation episode by my measurement the monthly inflation rate peaked at 79 6 billion percent in november of 2008 taking over the rank of second and pushing the yugoslavia episode to the third most severe episode of hyperinflation despite this astronomical figure mugabe was able to remain in office for another 9 years this was due in part to the fact that in early 2009 zimbabwe dumped the zimbabwe dollar and officially dollarized but mugabe never learned the lessons of 2008 when his party zanu pf regained full control of zimbabwe in 2013 government spending and public debt surged to finance its ballooning deficits the government abandoned full dollarization and started to issue its own currency in enormous amounts the new zim dollar was issued at par to the u s dollar but traded at a significant discount the money supply as a result of the new zim dollar issuance exploded and so did inflation as night follows day zimbabwe experienced its second episode of hyperinflation in less than ten years starting in september of 2017 and peaking at a monthly inflation rate of 185 mugabe had been in the saddle just shy of 30 years but this was the straw that broke the camel s back zimbabwe s second episode of hyperinflation opened the door to mugabe s ouster in a november 2017 coup d etat by the zimbabwe defense forces maduro and venezuela at present there is the only one country that is suffering from the ravages of hyperinflation venezuela but venezuela s ongoing episode of hyperinflation did not occur overnight i observed some of venezuela s economic dysfunction first hand during the 1995 96 period when i acted as president rafael caldera s adviser but it wasn t until 1999 when hugo chavez was installed as president that the socialist seeds of venezuela s current meltdown started to be planted with chavez s ascendancy fiscal and monetary discipline deteriorated and inflation ratcheted up by the time president nicolas maduro arrived in early 2013 annual inflation was rising into the triple digits and venezuela was entering an economic death spiral venezuela s annual inflation rate was the highest in the world in 2018 reaching 80 0000 at year end and climbing to 165 382 at the end of february 2019 and although by hyperinflation standards venezuela s rate of inflation has been modest the longevity of venezuela s episode has been quite extended to date venezuela s episode has lasted 30 months and counting ranking it the fifth longest episode of hyperinflation in history durations of hyperinflation episodes while hyperinflation is not a recipe for building a politician s popular support it is not a certain death knell either the three ms

a strong operating performance across all three business lines we achieved strong earnings growth in international banking delivered improved results in global banking and markets demonstrated prudent expense management across the bank and made progress on our comprehensive strategy to de risk and simplify the bank global wealth management which will report as a stand alone division of the bank beginning in fiscal 2020 also experienced strong earnings growth aum growth and canadian banking delivered positive operating leverage in the quarter the quarter demonstrated our ability to manage expenses prudently by prioritizing investments both business and regulatory this resulted in an improvement in our adjusted productivity ratio to 52 3 for the quarter we remain focused on improving our productivity target to achieve positive operating leverage this year our strategy to reposition the bank s geographic footprint achieves several key milestones in the quarter in the dominican republic we completed the acquisition of banco dominicano del progreso as well as a sale of our pension and related insurance businesses in el salvador we announced a sale of our banking and insurance operations in asia we announced a non binding mou to reduce our ownership stake in the combined thanachart thai military bank the net gain on the divestures announced and closed this quarter contributed 0 11 to reported diluted earnings per share in the quarter and added approximately 8 basis points to our common equity tier 1 ratio our focus on our six key markets in the americas which account for roughly 80 of our operating earnings will continue to drive market share and earnings growth turning to our financial performance for the quarter the bank delivered adjusted earnings of 2 3 billion and diluted earnings per share of 1 70 we saw strong growth in our personal and commercial businesses with earnings up 8 year over year led by international banking with earnings up 14 year over year on an adjusted basis international banking results were led by our pacific alliance countries where we are increasing our market share and making very good progress in our integration efforts raj will speak more on that in just a moment canadian banking delivered 4 adjusted earnings growth driven largely by good growth in commercial lending and wealth management and better expanse management on the digital front we also made progress enhancing our customer experience and increasing digital adoption rates with the launch of our fully digital end to end ehome mortgage lending platform and our new mobile banking app nova global banking and markets results rebounded from q1 with earnings up 25 we also demonstrated strong expense management and an improved productivity ratio from last quarter the other segment which includes the banks funding center experienced a slightly elevated loss due to a flattening yield curve and some prefunding activity turning to risk credit quality remains high and the outlook is stable growth in pcls was substantially driven by acquisitions and volume growth our pcl ratio is in line with our long term average daniel moore will have more to say on that in a moment strong internal capital generation in the quarter allowed us to be more active in our share buyback program we ended the quarter with a common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 11 1 or 11 3 on a pro forma basis considering the impact of announced divestitures expected to close in fiscal 2019 the potential monetization of our interest in thanachart bank would add another 25 basis points and provide even further capacity for shared buybacks in summary the bank continues to make progress toward meeting it s medium to long term objectives and we are focused on driving stronger momentum in our results i wanted to briefly discuss our recently announced plan to break up global wealth management in a fourth business line effective november 1 2019 establishing global wealth management as a stand alone division reflects the importance of this business to our bank our growth aspirations and provides increased transparency to our external stakeholders this new division will be led by gwen gowland who will report directly to me the decision to create a fourth business line also fundamentally changes the scope of our canadian banking business resulting in a change of role for james o sullivan i along with the board and the management team want to personally thank james for his leadership of canadian banking and i look forward to his role as a strategic advisor to the bank dan rees who currently runs our global operations group which closely supports canadian banking will lead our canadian p c and insurance businesses dan joined the bank nearly 20 years ago and has six years experience within the canadian bank he ll be sharing the division s priorities for the business in the near future i will now turn the call over to raj thank you raj raj viswanathan chief financial officer thank you brian and good morning everyone before reviewing our financial results i d like to start on slide 6 and provide an update on the material acquisitions bbva chile md financial and jarislowsky fraser these integrations are proceeding very well as reflected in improved market share very high customer retention rates and strong performance against integration metrics such as synergies which are on track to meet our targets in international banking our operations in chile have seen an increase in the combined market share a significantly lower productivity ratio and strong growth and earnings following the acquisition of bbva chile in wealth management both md financial and jarislowsky fraser have experienced positive asset growth since they were acquired md surpassed 50 million in assets during the quarter for the first time in its history customer retention rates are higher quarter over quarter and above pre acquisition levels and we have co located scotia private banking in all major md offices in canada this quarter the acquisitions contributed approximately 60 million to the bank s earnings we are well on our way to exceed our goal of 0 15 of adjusted diluted eps accretion in 2020 turning to the financial results i d like to draw your attention to our new disclosure on slide 20 titled other items impacting financial results which list the items we have discussed in prior quarters in our md a and investor presentation but did not adjust reported earnings turning now to the q2 2019 performance on slide 7 all my comments that follow including the discussion of business line results will be on an adjusted basis that excludes acquisition and divestiture related amounts the bank did over 2 3 billion in earnings and diluted eps of 1 70 for the quarter down slightly compared to last quarter last year revenue increased 8 from last year primarily driven by the impact of acquisitions net interest income was up 6 driven mostly from the impact of acquisitions also contributing to the increase was growth in commercial and retail landing and international banking solid loan and deposit growth in canadian banking as well as higher carpet loans in global banking and markets these increases were partly offset by lower contributions from asset liability management activities the core banking margin declined 2 basis points versus last year primarily driven by the impact of a flattening yield curve on our asset liability management activities the bank earning higher margin from international banking from change in business mix driven by the acquisitions and then canadian banking primarily from deposits that were partly offset by lower margins in global banking and markets non interest income grew 11 compared to last year also contributing to the growth was higher banking revenues wealth management and underwriting fees higher income from associated corporations partly offset by the impact of the adoption of ifrs15 expenses were up 8 year over year the increase was largely driven by the impact of acquisitions partly offset by the adoption of ifrs15 on the expense line excluding the impact of these items expense were only up 1 year over year reflecting the bank s efforts to prudently manage its expense growth by prioritizing its regulatory and business growth related investments consequently the bank s productivity ratio declined to 52 3 an improvement of 20 basis points year over year our pcl ratio on impaired loans was 49 basis points up 3 basis points from last year there were net provisions on performing loans of 22 million and when combined with provisions on impaired loans resulted in a total pcl ratio of 51 basis points our tax rate was in line with last year and in line with our outlook of 21 to 25 through 2019 on slide 8 we provide an evolution of our cet 1 capital ratio over the last quarter the bank reported a common equity tier 1 ratio of 11 1 in line with the last quarter the bank s strong internal capital generation of 21 basis points was deployed in organic assets growth across the businesses absolved by the net impact from the bank s acquisitions which closed during the year and offset by shared buyback activities and increased employee pension and post retirement benefits liability that was impacted by the discount rate changes in the quarter liquidated assets increased by 1 6 during the quarter we repurchased 4 million common shares or 7 25 million shares on a year to date basis at an average price of 17 19 per share in the last 12 months the bank has repurchased and cancelled 13 25 million shares the pro forma impact of announced non divestitures that are yet to close will increase the cet1 ratio to be approximately 11 3 the monetization of our significant investment in thanachart bank would further increase our pro forma cet1 ratio by approximately 25 basis points we are pleased with the pace of capital rebuild driven by strong internal capital generation foreign management of risk weighted asset growth and the divestitures that will continue to improve the bank s cet1 ratio in addition the bank of xi an in china in which we have an 18 ownership position recently completed its initial public offering at current market valuations our equity stake stands at over 1 2 billion and provides additional flexibility for capital over the medium term turning now to the business line results beginning on slide 9 canadian banking reported adjusted net income of 1 1 billion up 4 year over year the q2 2018 benefits from aligning the reporting of our canadian insurance business and higher level of real estate gains and reduce the division s earnings throughout by approximately 4 as you can see on slide 20 the earnings growth rate in the second half of 2019 will benefit from lower real estate gains in the same periods last year in retail lending residential mortgages grew 2 personal loan 3 and credit card 6 meanwhile business lending grew 9 given a slower start to the housing market in 2019 we would expect low single digit volume growth for the year in mortgages deposits grew a strong 11 and for the third straight quarter outpaced asset growth the net interest margin was up 3 basis points year over year and 2 basis points quarter over quarter driven by higher deposit spreads we expect margins to be stable to modestly higher for the balance of the year non interest income was up 5 due to higher fee income from banking wealth management business and higher credit fees the lower level of real estate gains and the alignment of the reporting of our canadian insurance business last year reduces growth by 4 wealth management adjusted earnings increased a strong 26 year over year driven by contributions from recent acquisitions as well as the core businesses aum growth was strong at 6 3 quarter over quarter reflecting positive net sales and market appreciation we delegate past operating leverage of 1 1 this quarter through prudent expense management consequently the productivity ratio improved 60 basis points to 50 turning to the next slide on international banking my comments are based on results on a constant dollar basis adjusted earnings of 787 million were up 14 year over year driven by strong contributions from organic and acquisition related asset growth well above our medium term adjusted net income growth target of 9 plus q2 results reflected strong asset growth in the pacific alliance positive operating leverage good credit quality and growing digital sales the pacific alliance had very strong net income growth of 11 driven by a strong performance in chile double digit growth in peru and improve portfolio quality in columbia our gbm operations in latin america were also very strong up more than 25 year over year driven by both our capital markets and corporate banking businesses revenue grew 22 with net interest income up 20 and non interest income growing at 26 net interest income growth was driven by loan growth in the pacific alliance region which increased 42 year over year including our acquisitions in chile and columbia non interest income growth was driven by higher banking and credit card fees and increased contributions from associated corporations more than three quarters of the expense growth was from acquisitions with the remaining growth in line with business while in growth and the impact of inflation current expense management contributed to the productivity ratio improving by 210 basis points year over year operating leverage was strong at 5 for the quarter marking the 18 straight quarters of positive operating leverage moving to slide 11 global banking and markets net income of 420 million was up a strong 25 from q1 due primarily to better market conditions net income was down 6 year over year while revenues were in line with last year higher non interest expenses and lower credit loss and recoveries impacted the net earnings corporate loan growth was strong up 16 year over year reflecting strong growth in the us and canada overall the m a and corporate lending pipelines remain strong lending margins remain stable while deposit margins were lower compared to last year non interest income grew mainly due to higher trading revenues and fixed income and improved underwriting and credit fees expenses were down 8 quarter over quarter and up a modest 5 year over year the year over year increase was driven by a higher regulatory and technology investments partly offset by lower performance related compensation the productivity ratio improved by 840 basis points versus last quarter to 51 6 i ll turn now to the other segment on slide 12 which incorporates the results of group treasury smaller operating units and certain corporate adjustments but it also includes the net gain on divestitures and the net impact of asset and liability management activities the other segment reported lower revenues from asset liability management activities and lower returns from our holdings of high quality liquid assets that were negatively impacted by the flattening yield curve some prefunding done late last quarter of tlac eligible instruments to meet the 2021 tlac requirements also impacted the results this quarter given the current shape of the yield curve we expect continued margin compression on our high quality liquid asset portfolio this completed my review of our financial results i ll now turn it over to daniel who will discuss risk management daniel moore chief risk officer thank you raj i will turn to slide 14 our credit quality is high and our underlying credit performance remains stable this is evidenced by our stable delinquency rate in canadian retail and our improving rates in international retail as evidenced by our stable gil ratios in canadian banking and our improving ratios in international banking and global banking and markets moreover our loan off provision covers 9 quarters of write offs and our impaired pcl ratio of 49 basis points is in line with our 30 year historical average of 46 basis points our pcls were impacted by day 1 adjustments of 151 million relating to our acquisitions in latin america as required by ifrs 9 my comments that follow will exclude this amount on an all bank basis total pcls of 722 million were up 5 from last quarter and up 35 year over year roughly 1 3 of the year over year increase was due to acquisitions another 1 3 was due to volume growth and the balance was due to changes in forward looking indicators and other items more importantly however the pcl ratio on impaired loans was generally stable quarter over quarter and year over year in our retail portfolio we remain focused on a and b customers in using proactive analytics and collection efforts our nonretail portfolio continues to perform very well with modest levels of pcls in stable to declining formations given our portfolio quality our diversification and our continuous oversight we are well positioned for economic growth while remaining downturn ready our risk management philosophy is to provision conservatively and we certainly believe we are ahead of the curve in this regard turning now to slide 15 you can see the recent trend and loss ratios from each of our businesses on an impaired loan basis pcl loss rates are generally in line with last quarter across all three business lines increase in our total pcl ratio was largely driven by canadian banking led by less favorable forward looking macroeconomic inputs as well as by volume growth but partially offset by the impact of our continued improving credit quality looking now at other credit metrics on slide 16 gross impaired loans increasing modestly to 5 4 billion from 5 3 billion last quarter with the growth primarily due to acquisitions and underlying organic portfolio growth therefore the gross impaired loan ratio remained flat versus last quarter and down compared to a year ago net formations of 861 million were down 9 quarter over quarter but up 24 year over year lower net formations versus last quarter were driven primarily by lower net formations in global banking and markets in the canadian pnc business partly offset by a lower reversal international commercial the increase compared to prior year relates mostly to increases in our international retail portfolio largely due to acquisitions turning to our net write off ratio it remains stable with a small impact in international banking from recent acquisitions in summary then we continue to see the benefits of our diversified business model and the benefits of investments in digital and in analytics that support our adjudication models and our collections processes as evidenced by our generally stable credit metrics and we remain confident in the underlying credit quality of our portfolio and now i ll turn the call back over to brian for some closing remarks brian porter president and chief executive officer thank you daniel as we look to the second half of 2019 we expect our financial performance to be better than the first half of this year for a number of reasons further contributions from recent acquisitions along with the positive benefits from our integration efforts secondly continued strong growth in international banking thirdly stronger second half performance in canadian banking and global banking and markets fourthly our continued focus on prioritization and expense management and productivity improvements and lastly strong capital ratios which provide the bank optionality that concludes my comments on the quarter and i ll turn the call back to raj questions and answers raj viswanathan chief financial officer thanks brian we ll now be pleased to take your questions please limit yourself to one question and then rejoin the queue to allow everyone the opportunity to participate in the call operator can we have the first question on the phone please operator our first question comes from robert sedran of cibc capital markets please go ahead robert sedran cibc capital markets analyst just wanted to come back to the loan losses and that slide that shows the long term average on there i mean daniel if i take out argentina and the global financial crisis which arguably are very unusual events i guess we re comfortably above that longer term average and do you feel like given the evolution of loan and geographic mix does it suggest that the 49 basis points this quarter on impaired is going to continue to migrate higher just given where the growth is coming from daniel moore chief risk officer no i think rob thanks for the question the bank is a very different bank than it was over the long term averages we ve increased international banking credit exposure and we re getting paid for that risk but to our discipline at the bank we are very focused on originating the right sorts of customers originating ab in retail and we re very focused on making sure that impaired loans maintains our conservative underwriting discipline so we would have a cautiously optimistic outlook from here regarding forward looking empiric pcls robert sedran cibc capital markets analyst well i didn t mean to suggest that there wasn t revenue attached to that shifting loan and geographic mix it just seems like the loss rate should be rising commensurate with that higher revenue that you re getting in some of the different the shifting mix the structurally higher loan losses should come with the structurally higher revenue is that the right way to think about it daniel moore chief risk officer right i think that s the right way to think about it but it is offset significantly by the improving credit quality in the book robert sedran cibc capital markets analyst okay thank you operator our next question comes from meny grauman of cormark meny grauman cormark securities analyst hi good morning question about the broker channel we re hearing that competition in the broker channel is increasing quite significantly and i noticed that if you look at published market share data that your market share fell i think it s about 640 basis points in q1 the latest data that we have so i m just wondering what the outlook is from your perspective in the broker channel and what where do you see your share going going forward daniel moore chief risk officer yeah well thanks meny i think in the broker channel we are consistently 1 or 2 and my observation on that channel as compared to some others would be that there continues to be a strong consumer preference for that channel particularly among millennials so that remains a channel that we are very very committed to bearing in mind that we also have a direct salesforce we also have the branch channel and most recently we have both scotia ehome as well as tangerine so lots of channels but that s one we re committed to because canadians love it meny grauman cormark securities analyst and just to follow up is competition getting tougher there and what s driving that competition from some of the non bank peers from your perspective daniel moore chief risk officer yeah i don t know that it s i d say tougher yes but i d say it s been getting tougher over four or six quarters frankly maybe since b20 but it s always been i mean there s a lot of participants in that market so it is a competitive channel but nothing meny nothing markedly different this quarter than say last quarter meny grauman cormark securities analyst okay thank you operator our next question comes from steve theriault of eight capital please go ahead steve theriault eight capital analyst thanks very much question on capital markets we saw the revenue line get back to q2 levels of last year but expenses still elevated and operating leverage negative so i guess in terms of a question as capital markets it sounds like you think it ll continue to get back on track here how much of that is about higher revenues and how much of it is about getting the expense base back to sort of the 550 560 range versus the closer to 600 range this quarter i know you cited higher regulatory costs and technology costs maybe also some comments around do you expect those to alleviate or is it contributing to a higher run rate on expenses raj viswanathan chief financial officer steve it s raj i ll start with expenses and then maybe jake can talk about the revenue side of it gbm expresses growth is a modified percent as you know this quarter compared to the double digit we had in q1 looking forward it s going to have elevated expenses because of all the regulatory investments we have made so the run rate of the 550 million that he quotes is probably going to be higher than that you know if i were to guess it won t be the 645 that we had in q1 because you also had some seasonality relating to our performance based compensation which always happens in q1 and it shows up more significantly in gbm being a lower cost space without giving a specific number i think it would be anywhere between 550 and 600 million probably closer to 600 million as the quarterly run rate on the expenses as we look forward for the next two to three quarters but i think more importantly if you look at the bank as a whole i think we are very pleased with our productivity ratio implements that s happened and you know gbm is also a big part of it as it contributed to the banks productivity ratio you know we ll continue to manage expense growth by prioritizing our spending across the bank and gbm is also part of it and we ll be informed by revenue growth that happens across our businesses so that we can generate while creating leverage for the bank as a whole jake you want to talk about the revenue jake lawrence head global banking and markets yeah just one other point on the expense in addition to the regulatory cost we also are investing in our business and our people we think that s going to be important to help drive the revenue growth going forward and when james and i look at some of the underlying fundamentals in the business this quarter loan growth up 16 deposit growth also up double digits we re encouraged that we re going to see some more stability in that revenue line moving forward assuming we get reasonable market conditions to operate in so we re comfortable with the revenue outlook and we re getting our hands on the expenses as raj noted steve theriault eight capital analyst thank you operator our next question comes from mario mendonca of td securities please go ahead mario mendonca td securities analyst good morning daniel can i just take you to page 25 of your presentation there are a few numbers that had stood out for me and it d be helpful to get an understanding what i m getting at here is the sequential increase in the pcls ratio impaired loans and personal loans specifically now i imagine that s mostly auto we re looking at and would you point us to something like seasonality or anything in particular that would drive that increase the sequential increase daniel moore chief risk officer yeah you see a bit of seasonality in those numbers in the impaired loan line in particular as well as some particular one off risk strategies that we had to learn around that we wouldn t see reoccurring in the future mario mendonca td securities analyst can you elaborate on that you said one offs what do you mean by that daniel moore chief risk officer so as we continuously improve through our risk strategies we are looking at various different ways of originating and improving that risk return curve by and large as you see through our numbers if you look through our unsecured line across all segments we have an improving delinquency rate we have improving gil rate we have improving formation rate but in this one quarter we have a nonrecurring personal loan adjustment largely driven through that line that we talked about that we don t see going forward mario mendonca td securities analyst is that the same thing we re seeing in credit cards because over 400 basis points in canadian credit cards again not a huge number for cards but it s unusual in canada is the same thing happening there daniel moore chief risk officer yeah yeah so the interesting thing about cards is that as we work through the complexities of the ifrs 9 mario these forward looking indicators come into our unsecured lines disproportionately so as we look to conservatively reserve against our future loan losses and we look to the point in time where the canadian economy was at the end of the quarter those forward looking indicators flow disproportionately through to the card lines but if i take that number out mario and i look at the core underlying impaired pcl metric for cards that is declining has been declining for a number of quarters and we anticipate it will continue to decline as we exercise more advanced analytics de risking strategies origination strategies and collection strategies across the bank so that has been declining for six quarters now across the bank mario mendonca td securities analyst so just to put a final point on this this sequential change we re seeing now on this page doesn t affect your strategy in domestic retail lending maybe james maybe you want to comment on that james o sullivan group head canadian banking yeah no not at all i mean we spent a lot of time on this and the bulk of this was driven by fli so in cards mario you know as you know we ve identified that as one of two areas where we are not solidly a top three bank in this country and over time we re determined to be so cards continues to be a growth focus with an emphasis on a b customers given where we are in the cycle daniel moore chief risk officer and james if i could just lean on that one more time i think you ll see that feed mario through to the top line pcl ratio of banking as we have grown 10 almost 10 year over year in our card portfolio but as i said that pcl ratio in that line item is declining and as we look through all our line items pcl ratios are flat to declining through in banking so our delinquency trends continue to perform very well on cards down 15 year over year mario mendonca td securities analyst okay quick question for nacho then is there anything going on in mexico from a regulatory perspective that you want to highlight either as it relates to restrictions on fees or rates or anything has there been any change or anything you anticipate nacho deschamps group head international banking no mario there have been no changes the fee proposal by congress was negotiated with the banks and it s a reasonable proposal it has no material impact for the financial system or for us we continue to see mexico performing very well on the top line q over q and wholesale loans grew 4 and retail loans grew 2 5 revenues grew 9 so mexico we have to remember is 120 million population and even with a lower gdp forecast we see banking and lending penetration relatively low at 40 levels so we expect mexico to continue growing both in the business and retail market mario mendonca td securities analyst thank you operator our next question comes from doug young of desjardins capital markets please go ahead doug young desjardins capital markets analyst yeah just on expenses i mean the expense trend looked favorable in the quarter i guess the question is you know is this sustainable and i gather from your comments that you do believe that this is and we should be expecting next growth to be more in line with revenue growth going forward so just wanted to get a little more detail on that and then the sct program i think your plan was to remove 750 million in fiscal 19 just wondering where you are with that and then just kind of maybe tagged on you know brian i guess the 52 next target is what you put in for fiscal 19 i assume that you still think that s more than achievable thanks raj viswanathan chief financial officer okay thanks doug i ll start on the expenses and see if i can cover the sct as well as your last question on the next rate i ll start with sct as you know the sct program has been around since 2016 it was a concerted effort to help the bank take out structural costs over a billion dollars and has been very successful if i can add the effort is mostly complete on the structural cost side about 80 of the savings has been redeployed back into the bank in all of the initiatives we have talked about in the past digital banking data analytics as well as strengthening the control functions of the bank including the risk management the amo et cetera the teams that were part of the successful effort are now focused on improving the enterprise productivity as we call which is primarily looking at revenue initiatives across all the business lines to see how we can assist the business lines in enhancing the revenue growth pace that this bank has had across the business the bulk of the redeployment has happened in the technology space we see a city program and you can see it in the productivity ratio improvements across the years we re getting close to our 52 target for 2019 you know based on our expectation for the balance of the year we should be pretty close to that if not at that rate to answer your third question but in general on expense and on rate i would say that we expect to have it on rate which would be the low single digit growth completely guided by our revenue growth so that we expect to generate positive operating leverage for the bank you know both international banking has had strong past of operating leverage as you have probably seen the 5 year over year canadian banking is now generating positive operating leverage for this quarter and we expect it to finish with positive operating leverage for the year the gbm business once the revenue gets to more normalized levels we expect that they would contribute to the operating leverage as well but the bank as a whole we expect at the end of the agreed we would be delivering part of new operating leverage doug young desjardins capital markets analyst and that s for the full year positive operating leverage raj viswanathan chief financial officer that s correct doug doug young desjardins capital markets analyst okay thank you operator our next question comes from gabriel dechaine of national bank financial please go ahead gabriel dechaine national bank financial analyst hi good morning just a couple quick questions one on the international business the you know trying to peel away into the organic growth here it looks like asia had a big quarter and i m wondering what is underlying that and then the other one is on the corporate side you were helpful in your comment there on what s behind the negative carry item and you said it could persist i m just trying to figure out which sections of the yield curve i should be looking at and what your outlook for that dragged to persist is and if there is anything you can do about it in the interim raj viswanathan chief financial officer okay gabe i ll start on asia relating to international banking and i ll address the carpet segment negative numbers as well as far as asia goes you know the biggest contribution to us is the thanachart bank equity pickup that we have the 49 that we hold it tends to be lumpy and it tends to move around quarter over quarter because it s an equity account investment you know we don t get too far down to figuring out is it a higher pcl is it expenses we have some visibility this quarter you notice we picked up 130 million it s kind of consistent if you go back q4 was a high number too before that it tends to be 80 90 million the point i m trying to make is you will see a level of volatility in those numbers that is driven by the equity pickup base on the operations that happen in thailand a couple of years back if you remember they had a lot of provisions relating to floods that they had in thailand it could be impacted by that and this quarter certainly was a pickup which was greater than our normal run rate attached to the thai investment gabriel dechaine national bank financial analyst okay and then while i have you on the international sorry the mexico if i look at one of your disclosures it shows mexico was down year over year i know stage two additions were part of that is that the main issue raj viswanathan chief financial officer i think it was stage two but it was also the tax benefits that we ve had in prior years that mexico gabe which has gone away and that contributes to the negative road but like nacho mentioned mexico has grown 9 year over year if i exclude the tax benefits gabriel dechaine national bank financial analyst okay raj viswanathan chief financial officer as far as the carpet segment goes which was the other half of your question the carpet segment did indicate in the past we tend to have between 50 and 100 million of losses in the carpet segment you know it depends a bit on how our investment securities moves as well on the realized gains this quarter was slightly elevated at 121 million primarily driven by the yield curve as you mentioned we expect that q3 might not be too dissimilar to q2 but we expect it to gradually improve as the yield curve gets you a more normalized level if i can use the term a better slope but these are hqla assets which are high quality liquid assets we maintain for liquidity purposes and the ltl ratio purposes they tend to be us cables government of canada bonds as you know is low yielding and that will have an impact to the other segment gabriel dechaine national bank financial analyst if the yield curve doesn t normalize is there anything you can do could you just reduce liquidity is there an impact that that causes anywhere else raj viswanathan chief financial officer no i wouldn t say that just liquidity would as some of these securities mature and some tend to be fixed rate securities that we hold in the portfolio they will reset at higher rates which will improve the spread gabriel dechaine national bank financial analyst okay thank you operator our next question comes darko mihelic of rbc capital markets please go ahead darko mihelic rbc capital markets analyst hi thank you good morning i just wanted to go back a little bit to the discussion around the provisioning for credit losses i just want to make sure that i understand this the commentary is that in auto loans there was a little bit of seasonality and i just want to make sure that i understand that comment because you re the only bank actually to highlight auto as an area that s sort of impacted was there also an element on the auto portfolio of forward looking information or was it purely just actual delinquency daniel moore chief risk officer so darko we addressed the response in the context of the question but we don t see a material change in the auto portfolio there s been a small uptick but the auto portfolio continues to perform generally very very well there is of course in retail some element of forward looking indicators built into all the retail lines particularly what we think of as the untiered lines which include autos and credit card so there s some element to that but if you look through to the core underlying delinquency there s not been a material change there darko mihelic rbc capital markets analyst okay and then with respect to your discussion on what you re going through on the risk side you mentioned analytics improved recoveries and so on is this just an ongoing or is this a new sort of initiative or is this just ongoing improvements to the way you manage your credit risk daniel moore chief risk officer so this has been something we ve been undertaking with velocity now for about six to eight quarters darko and as we get improved access to data improved analytics practices we re seeing this really start to create some traction we re doing this in partnership with the business line across all elements of the primarily retail lifecycle through strategies around ab origination and focus through de risking strategies through credit line management through the lifecycle of credit and better segmentation strategies on the collections portfolio and we re seeing that really start to impact the overall numbers of the bank and those issues will continue in flight as we continue to stand up and improve the overall banks capabilities and you ll see more from us on that darko mihelic rbc capital markets analyst okay and if i can just sneak one last question in i apologize but on the international side the discussion was that 75 of the expense growth was due to acquisitions for my modeling purposes do you have a similar number for the revenue impact of the acquisitions raj viswanathan chief financial officer yeah i ll try to give you some perspective on that darko it s raj i think from the revenue side we see almost a billion dollars growth across the acquisitions which includes our wealth acquisitions and i would say of that growth about 60 comes from our international banking business so it gives you a good understanding of how much was contributed from the international business primarily in net interest income darko mihelic rbc capital markets analyst okay that s very helpful thank you operator our next question comes from scott chan of canaccord genuity please go ahead scott chan canaccord genuity analyst good morning just sticking international maybe going about it the other way you know total loan growth was up 29 pacific alliance was 42 and that was similar to last quarter if you kind of strip out or exclude acquisitions can you provide like an organic growth rate perhaps this quarter or year to date nacho deschamps group head international banking sure if you exclude acquisition impact in the pacific alliance or long growth it s 12 and this is double the growth both in retail and commercial and we are seeing these as a very positive trend even in chile where it s the most material impact excluding acquisition we have double digit growth in retail and commercial and this is driving revenue growth and 500 basis points positive operating leverage in the quarter scott chan canaccord genuity analyst that s helpful and maybe sneak in one more nacho just on the international margin side it was up 8 beeps quarter for quarter and kind of in line with your prior guidance of 4 5 plus minus 10 beeps is there anything to change within that guidance you provided last quarter nacho deschamps group head international banking none we see our margins stable and you basically to business mix these plus minus 10 beeps and we will remain around that level for 150 basis points and plus minus 10 beeps scott chan canaccord genuity analyst okay thank you very much operator our next question comes from sohrab movahedi of bmo capital markets please go ahead sir sohrab movahedi bmo capital markets analyst yeah thanks just wanted to stay with international again with nacho nacho the international expense to revenue ratio has improved steadily and now you re just around 50 or maybe a trifle below that is this the byproduct of building scale and how sustainable is it as you kind of think through over the next 12 to 18 months nacho deschamps group head international banking i would say sohrab this is the opportunity that we have especially driven by pacific alliance country so solid loan deposit and revenue growth and the very focused plan in international banking and the bank to capture cost savings as part of our performance and this is driving not only the operating leverage that it has been for the last 18 quarters positive but also consistently proven in the productivity index which has improved in international 200 basis points year over year and this is our business to be very focused both on our revenue growth and on our efficiency improvements sohrab movahedi bmo capital markets analyst and i guess maybe a question for brian just when you stand back and you think about it brian i mean obviously the acquisitions have helped in international but the growth the earnings contribution growth in international even on based on the targets is larger greater than domestic banking operations i guess domestic is slowing is there any limitations as to how much of the overall bank can come from international banking over the medium term brian porter president and chief executive officer look it s a good question sohrab and thank you it s that we are very proud of what the international bank has delivered for our shareholders we see a very positive outlook for the balance of this year and into 2020 and you can see as nacho just answered the benefits of scale in these markets is critically important the other point i d make is that i was in mexico the week after last and there s been lots of news about mexico but you know sometimes you have to pull yourself away from a bloomberg screen and when it comes to some of these countries and as nacho said mexico is a country of 120 million people the biggest driver for the economy is how the us is doing point one there s a huge growing middle class and they re consuming so you can t mix that up with gdp forecast or outlook from time to time and you re seeing that in our mexican numbers which are up 9 year over year despite all the noise and rhetoric of what s going on on a political level so you know we see stronger performance out of peru this year great performance out of chile our integration both on a financial and an operational basis is ahead of schedule columbia is performing much better as a country and our integration there is going exceedingly well so the pacific alliance countries are performing very well and we ll continue to deliver for our shareholders sohrab movahedi bmo capital markets analyst thank you raj viswanathan chief financial officer thank you everyone for participating in our call today we dealt with solid second quarter results and on behalf of the management team i want to thank all of our employees for their hard work the bank has made good progress to strengthening our businesses and offering a superior customer experience looking ahead to the second half of 2019 we expect to deliver a stronger performance we remain focused on delivering gains to our differentiated strategy and achieving consistent long term growth i also want to remind investors that we ll be hosting an international banking investor day on october 24th and 25th in santiago chile we hope you can join us to learn more about our bank in closing we look forward to speaking with everyone in late august and have a great summer duration 54 minutes call participants operator philip smith senior vice president of investor relations brian porter president and chief

currency manipulation is back baby during his campaign and the early days of his administration president trump routinely threatened to label other countries currency manipulators particularly china but once trump s trade war got underway currency manipulation fell off the radar replaced by concerns over intellectual property and technology transfer which was a shame since the question of currencies actually gets much closer to the root causes of america and china s toxic trade relationship now that the latest trade negotiations are falling apart trump s white house is back to talking about new rules for currency manipulation unfortunately they still want to use trump s favorite tool for punishing misbehavior tariffs there are much better options out there subscribe to the week

news newsletter get the best of the week delivered directly to your inbox from our morning news briefing to a weekly good news newsletter get the best of the week delivered directly to your inbox sign up but first let s give the white house credit for their refocus america s trade deficit with china a whopping 419 billion last year really is a significant problem it means way more american demand is going overseas to fuel chinese jobs than chinese demand is coming back to fuel american jobs all else being equal that makes it harder to create jobs and raise wages here in the u s particularly for blue collar and manufacturing workers trump has certainly railed against the trade deficit in the past but the substance of his administration s trade war with china misses this dynamic forcing the chinese to respect the intellectual property of u s companies and pay more fees to use u s technology will not re balance those international demand flows it will simply make already rich americans even richer now the trump administration is putting currency manipulation back on the agenda on thursday last week the commerce department released a new proposal that would allow american companies to ask the u s government to impose penalties on other countries when they deliberately drive down the value of their currency the proposal also lowers the bar for defining violations to include undervaluation of currencies how far the trump administration will go in using this new toolkit remains to be seen the treasury department has never actually labeled a country a currency manipulator and even though the new proposal expands the practices that would fall afoul of the rule the commerce department would still ultimately defer to treasury but tonally at least it s a significant shift and an important one china has been in the habit of buying up vast amounts of financial assets denominated in u s dollars that added demand raises the value of the dollar relative to the yuan now china actually stopped adding to its dollar reserves several years ago and has sold off a little of them since but the reserves remain massive and their sheer scale is enough to seriously alter the values in the international currency market since engaging in international trade requires goods to transition from one currency to another this effectively makes american exports more expensive in china while making chinese exports cheaper for american buyers rebalancing the value of the two currencies would go a long way towards rebalancing those international demand flows as well the trick is how to go about rebalancing the currencies right now the trump administration is looking at slapping additional tariffs on china or anyone else who violates the new rule but tariffs are a clunky and roundabout fix they don t actually address the currency mismatch they just try to tack on extra costs at the end of the supply chain tariffs also only make chinese exports more expensive they do nothing to lower the price of american exports and as critics of the trade war point out it s often u s companies and consumers who actually eat the final cost of the tariffs a more elegant fix is to just do the mirror inverse of what china s doing if they re holding onto tons of assets denominated in u s dollars america should buy up tons of assets denominated in chinese yuan until the reserves balance each other out it s called countervailing currency intervention and while it remains a theoretical option no one s actually tried it yet the treasury department and the federal reserve already have the necessary legal authority the strength of this approach is that it goes right at the core problem the mismatch in currency values simultaneously making chinese exports more expensive for american buyers and american exports cheaper for chinese buyers since it doesn t involve tariffs it s less likely to spark off a trade war or violate world trade organization rules it s also something the u s can do unilaterally tariffs are a punitive measure aimed at changing another country s behavior and as the trump administration is currently learning if the country you re punishing just ignores you you re stuck with countervailing currency intervention it would still be preferable if china or whomever the target is responded by winding down their dollar reserves but it wouldn t strictly necessary if they didn t the u s could just keep holding onto its symmetrical currency reserves and international commerce can continue now mainstream policymakers have traditionally hesitated to tackle currency manipulation for two reasons it can be hard to distinguish currency manipulation from old fashioned monetary policy which every country should have the sovereign right to

beyond trade war risks and an uncertain monetary policy outlook looming large for the global economy is the threat that china s slowdown could be worse than currently seen said harvard university economist carmen reinhart if you were to ask me what would be really bad global news it s that the slowdown in china is deeper and longer lasting because that carries over to so many things reinhart who specializes in international finance said on the sidelines of an asia investment conference hosted by nomura holdings inc in singapore on tuesday the u s china trade war shows no signs of letting up with the global economy in for a 600 billion hit if the conflict worsens even before the latest escalation china s economy was losing momentum as reflected by weaker than expected data in april reinhart who s particularly well known for her work with harvard colleague kenneth rogoff on the last financial crisis said central banks like the federal reserve and european central bank are likely to be patient as signs point to a possible u s slowdown in the second half yet still robust labor markets she said it s premature to say that central banks attitudes toward inflation have shifted in any dramatic way while much of the trade war focus has been on supply chain shifts how uncertainty will impact investment and the modest price effects of the tariffs the trade shock is like an adverse supply shock and it could mean there s more upside risk on the inflation side that s been really dismissed here are more excerpts from the interview macro prudential tools i have been a huge advocate macro prudential tools i don t view as a substitute i view as a complement to the toolkit open economies are subject to the vagaries of international capital flows macro pru in the last decade has been on the rise not just in asia but in latin america you ve seen a lot more emphasis on macro pru measures to limit foreign exchange risk to limit undue exposure to short maturities to try to skew the maturity of capital flows and therefore the stability of what s coming into the banks macro pru has been used by ems more widely and more intensively in the past and i think one can say that so far it s served them well reversals in capital flows haven t prompted a full blown credit crisis in emerging markets to date she qualifies and part of the credit goes to more aggressive use of macro pru central banks central banks have to worry about what kind of ammunition they have for the next downturn i m not saying the next downturn and the next recession are imminent certainly i think the signs are there that in the context of the u s there s a slowdown unfolding or very likely in the second half of the year though the u s retains more ammunition than the ecb or bank of japan whose interest rates are lower that has to loom very large a big question for major central banks and one the ecb has been mulling is how do you fine tune policy so the negative rates don t hurt the banks another big question for policy makers what can central banks really do to guide inflation expectations what critical things can a central bank do to help shape help guide markets to the sweet point that they want perhaps not be so subtle what are perhaps blunter instruments of course there s a big question of whether those instruments end up being central bank instruments or fiscal instruments policy independence the fact that monetary policy has played a critical role during the past decade and in effect will also make up for the shortcomings in fiscal policy i don t think has escaped anyone does that mean that central banks are less independent there i would say one has to distinguish between independence in the political sense are they doing what the government wants to do or are they doing this because they re sort of the only game in town my interpretation so far is the latter but it can always change certainly president trump s continued advice to the fed is new and it is unwelcome it is inappropriate but that doesn t say anything about whether at this stage there s any reason to believe the rules of the game changed

finding a job in the us is pretty easy these days finding a good one isn t and the gig economy is partly to blame the gig economy that is workers who get paid per task sale or project is creating extreme financial hardship for millions of american workers even as the overall economy continues to expand that s according to the federal reserve s latest report on economic wellbeing in the us the report which was released last week found that in 2018 workers who supported themselves through the gig economy struggled financially far more than the average person here is one of the most shocking statistics 58 percent of full time gig workers said they would have a hard time coming up with 400 to cover an emergency bill compared to 38 percent of people who don t work in the gig economy both numbers are alarming but the gap suggests that this informal economy is far more destabilizing than silicon valley investors care to admit not much is known about the gig workforce economists have a tough time measuring it because it can cover many different alternative work arrangements the fed survey defines it as people working as independent contractors or on temporary contracts with or without a mobile app involved that includes well known gigs like driving for uber and running errands through taskrabbit but also less obvious ones such as housecleaning child care and selling unwanted items for money the annual survey which polled 11 000 people in fall 2018 found that the vast majority of gig workers don t make a living from it they just do it to make some extra money but a surprising 5 percent of those surveyed said gig work is their main source of income that group was the most likely to report financial distress and the least likely to have health insurance paid time off unemployment benefits and basic labor protections their financial hardship helps explain the anger that prompted thousands of uber and lyft drivers to go on strike in recent months earlier this month as uber prepared to make its debut as a publicly traded company its drivers launched dozens of protests in the us and around the world demanding higher pay and recognition as employees not independent contractors that didn t happen but their collective outrage was likely a factor that sent company stock prices plunging and renewed scrutiny of the industry s role in fostering economic inequality the gig economy is largely based on exploitation when tech startups in silicon valley began promoting their new app based personal services they often talked about how it would revolutionize work and empower people with the flexibility to set their own schedule for example the ride hailing service lyft entices potential drivers with the question do you want to be your own boss taskrabbit which allows people to hire a handyman or woman for individual tasks makes a similar pitch to workers find jobs you love at rates you choose make a schedule that fits your life the reality is far less rosy as gig economy startups struggled to turn a profit year after year it became clear that the profit model of these app based services was dependent on all the money they saved from skirting us labor laws uber is the perfect example by classifying drivers as independent contractors instead of employees uber doesn t need to pay certain taxes benefits overtime or minimum wages to tens of thousands of drivers as self employed contractors drivers don t have a legal right to form labor unions and negotiate contracts either uber drivers have spent more than six years fighting the company in court saying they ve been intentionally misclassified they argue that drivers should be considered employees because the company has so much control over their workday including strict rules on their vehicle conditions what rides they can take and which routes to take uber has fought back maintaining that drivers are not employees because they set their own schedules and provide their own cars in march uber settled the main court case with 13 600 uber drivers agreeing to pay them 20 million but without changing their status as independent contractors the other 350 000 drivers who were part of the initial class action lawsuit had signed mandatory arbitration agreements so a federal judge is requiring them to pursue their cases in a private forum where they are less likely to win their case in the meantime uber has been cutting driver pay rates in major cities to boost its bottom line to attract stockbrokers that infuriated drivers who were already struggling to make ends meet which the fed survey confirms they were particularly incensed by the fact that uber investors reaped millions even billions of dollars from the ipo because of their labor so on may 8 a loose network of ride hail drivers went on strike from san diego all the way to são paulo and sydney they urged drivers to boycott ride hailing applications for 24 hours and to instead spend the day picketing to demand more money they also called on cities to regulate ride hailing platforms the way new york city does new york city drivers forced uber and lyft to pay them a living wage new york city has set the standard for regulating ride hailing services the unrestricted growth of app based ride hailing companies put serious financial strain on new york city s taxi drivers making it harder for all drivers to compete and earn a decent living researchers say ride hail drivers in the us earn about 12 an hour after deducting car expenses and gasoline but pay rates vary wildly each day with uber sometimes taking more than 50 percent of drivers earnings economists at the new school and the university of california berkeley published a report in july with some limited pay data and discovered something alarming driving for ride hailing apps in new york city is not really a part time gig for people who want to earn extra cash more than half of their drivers are ferrying around passengers on a full time basis and about half of them are supporting families with children on that income their earnings were so low that 40 percent of drivers qualified for medicaid and about 18 percent qualified for food stamps the new school report showed that the average hourly wage for app based drivers in new york was about 12 the app companies could easily absorb an increase in driver pay with a minimal fare adjustment and little inconvenience to passengers they wrote the report helped drivers persuade city officials in december to pass the nation s first minimum pay rate for drivers working with the four largest app based firms uber lyft juno and via starting in january ride hailing companies were required to start paying drivers around 17 22 per hour after expenses about 5 more per hour than the previous average of 11 90 per hour according to the independent drivers guild which represents about 70 000 uber lyft juno and via drivers in the city the new pay rate is calculated per ride but the guild expects it to give full time drivers an extra 9 600 a year lyft and juno are now suing the city arguing that the calculated rate favors uber but said they are using a different formula to meet the minimum hourly pay rate because uber and lyft drivers are considered independent contractors and not employees they are not subject to the city s minimum hourly wage which is now 15 per hour but the new rules essentially get around that loophole and ensure that drivers are earning at least the minimum wage with a few dollars extra to cover payroll taxes and some paid time off uber and lyft have pushed back against the pay increase saying it would hurt competition and discourage drivers from taking riders out of manhattan the current lawsuits suggest that lyft and juno are not done fighting it uber is not part of the lawsuits it s still too early to study the impact of the new laws but it gives other cities and states a blueprint for doing the same in california lawmakers have tried to pass laws giving independent contractor union rights they ve all failed in april the california supreme court delivered a win for gig workers making it harder for companies to classify them as independent contractors instead of employees as employees uber drivers would have the right to form a union and earn the minimum wage and maybe just maybe they could save up 400 to put aside in case of emergency
after a long holiday weekend watching auto racing hosting and attending barbecues and enjoying the late spring weather investors regroup today to a stock market that s played defense for weeks and feels exhausted as summer begins the dow jones industrial average dji fell last week for the fifth week in a row its longest losing streak since 2011 though the s p 500 index spx did bounce off of recent lows it remains down around 4 from all time highs posted in late april a mixed tone prevails in the early going tuesday with direction a little hard to find as news looks thin a full data calendar this short week could help lend some direction as the days pass overseas events mainly china and brexit arguably represent a stiff headwind for wall street with british prime minister theresa may s resignation announcement only the most recent gust as a pro brexit party made election gains in britain may s departure could raise chances of a no deal brexit some media outlets report and no one is really sure what that might look like if there s one thing the markets don t relish it s uncertainty which could help explain the cautious trading that s taken hold on the china front president trump wrapped up a visit to japan tuesday saying he s not ready to make a deal with beijing but thinks one eventually will come together until there s more signs of progress there it s hard to imagine a major recovery for stocks with european elections and trade talks with japan also in the mix many investors seem to have a risk off mentality at the moment one sign of possible caution is strength in the treasury market u s 10 year treasury yields fell below 2 3 to one and a half year lows early tuesday treasuries have really caught a bid here this morning rising rapidly and pushing yields back toward last week s low mark yields move the opposite of the underlying product so the recent yield collapse likely signals more investors pumping money into where they apparently see safety the u s treasury the dollar often seen as another defensive asset has also been strong lately though it fell friday risk off trading might reflect investor concerns as u s business investment slows see more below and some retailers warn of supply chain issues related to the trade battle with china story continues shoes for christmas speaking of supply chains and china things you might not have even thought of start to factor into this like christmas lights almost 95 of them are manufactured in china the conference board president and ceo noted late last week it s a small thing but it adds up to a lot of dollars when you consider how many christmas trees go up every december and the chance of consumers having to dip deeper into their pockets or go without then we have companies like shoe seller foot locker inc nyse fl whose shares fell nearly 16 friday and lost all of their 2019 gains after fl missed wall street s earnings expectations the company cut its full year guidance amid worries about how tariffs could affect its sales fl was one of the companies signing a letter to the trump administration last week warning how tariffs could hurt their businesses maybe an interesting homework project for investors would be to start researching which companies have done a better job inoculating themselves against potential tariff impacts while no company is necessarily a perfect example adidas ag whose stock trades in europe switched its suppliers to indonesia and vietnam a while back making a concerted effort to get out of china some economists say other companies that may be somewhat less exposed to the tariff war include amazon com inc nasdaq amzn target corporation nyse tgt and macy s inc nyse m one way to research the company impact is to go back to q1 earnings call transcripts or listen to earnings calls coming up next quarter to get a sense of the exposure various companies face if you have the time consider reading about the risks companies face in their recent reports to the securities and exchange commission sec which companies have to include in regular filings the other question to think about researching besides sourcing is whether companies that do source from china have the brand power to raise prices and pass some of the added costs on to the consumer without losing business those that can t could start to see their margins pressed price check it s harder to determine whether china woes might have be priced into some companies shares after weeks of turmoil one example could be ralph lauren corp nyse rl which has had a rough go of it lately in the stock market due in part to its china exposure however one analyst argued last week that the bad news is priced into the stock it s an individual story with each stock so investors should consider doing the footwork if they own shares of specific companies and trying to get a sense of where things might stand from a technical standpoint the old week ended with the spx in relatively decent shape that s because it didn t fall below what some analysts see as technical support near the 2800 level the spx tested that area twice this month and bounced off each time possibly a sign of resilience that doesn t mean however that we can necessarily expect a quick re test of the highs that seems unlikely unless the trade picture suddenly improves but both sides seem to be digging in their heels there s a lot of data packed into this short week see more below but arguably nothing stands out more than the government s second estimate of q1 gross domestic product gdp due early thursday last time out we got a bullish surprise growth number of 3 2 and analysts look for 3 1 in the second estimate according to a briefing com consensus this comes as estimates for q2 gdp continue to sink with jp morgan making headlines friday with its forecast for just 1 gdp growth in q2 the atlanta fed s forecast isn t much higher at 1 3 earnings season has faded to a whimper but there s a scattering of reports arguably worth a look this week including costco wholesale corporation nasdaq cost gap inc nyse gps and uber technologies inc nyse uber for uber it s the first earnings report since going public and the company has already forecast a big quarterly loss the stock is trading a little below its initial public offering ipo level crude is another important factor to consider watching this week after u s prices fell to two month lows below 60 a barrel over the last two trading sessions early tuesday crude rallied again and now is flirting with the 60 level u s crude stockpiles have been on the rise but gasoline stocks remain below their historic averages that might be one reason why gas prices are up more than 60 cents a gallon since the start of the year and reached a new peak recently even with crude prices down about 10 from their spring highs it wouldn t be too surprising to see gas start to drop from this point as stockpiles have grown recently and the big holiday driving weekend is now in the rear view mirror on the other hand some analysts think gas prices could rise even more as refiners switch to more expensive summer blends 2019 05 28 chart jpg figure 1 something to chew on corn futures candlestick head into the summer growing season on a real tear up sharply over the last two weeks as many farmers eye their flooded fields and switch to soybeans purple line instead the anticipated additional soybean acres along with lack of demand from china have soybean futures looking flat over the same time period data source cme chart source the thinkorswim platform from td ameritrade for illustrative purposes only past performance does not guarantee future results consumers start your engines a lot of data are packed in a small package this shortened week starting with consumer confidence for may later this morning that could be an interesting one to watch because it captures sentiment from after the china trade talks went south and stocks started to flag last time out for april confidence surged along with the market as stocks neared record highs the 129 2 headline reading in april was up several points from march with consumers especially optimistic about the near term outlook we ll see if that sagged at all in may as the consensus view reported by briefing com stands at 130 the other consumer metrics to potentially keep an eye on this week are personal spending and income on friday along with university of michigan consumer sentiment the same day basically investors are likely to exit the week and the month with a much better idea of how consumers feel about the economy especially after a mixed outcome from the recent retail earnings season businesses downshift spending looking back at data from the end of last week it was a bit concerning to see capital investment from businesses continue to look soft in core capital goods orders for april that reading which doesn t include defense or aircraft spending was down 0 9 from the previous month and capital goods spending growth just had its worst 12 month period of the trump administration with a rise of just a little over 1 that compares to double digit yearly growth readings a couple of years ago total durable orders fell 2 1 in april but that partly reflected boeing co s nyse ba issues with its 737 max many economists have already noted softness in business spending this year which could indicate lack of economic confidence among decision makers at some of the country s biggest companies recent pullbacks in guidance for the remainder of the year which we saw during the earnings season add to a sense that businesses aren t going into the second half of 2019 feeling all that optimistic about where growth might go from here this also could end up weighing on merger and acquisition m a activity if it continues because arguably businesses won t necessarily want to expand in an uncertain environment with brexit and china trade issues still dominating discussion we ll have to wait and see soggy silos and inflation corn prices exploded recently due in part to flooding in the midwest and that could play into inflation readings in coming months remember corn isn t just about the corn on the cob you and your family might have munched over the holiday weekend it s mainly used as an animal feed and when it gets more expensive it sometimes leads to higher meat prices that could be something to track besides the flooding which according to some reports left many silos of stored grain unusable due to wetness at the bottom of the silos where the grain was housed the china trade situation also plays into the corn market as it seems to with just about everything there s talk that farmers might plant more soybeans this year not just due to flooding but also because the government is reimbursing soybean farmers for lost exports of the commodity to china soybean exports are down dramatically the last year or two when more soybeans get planted that typically eats into corn acreage anyway the place to look for any possible food price impact will be in coming inflation data the fed s favored

on the morning of april 30 in a reportedly planned but accelerated move the self declared interim president of venezuela juan guaidó announced via twitter that a military coup had begun in the video guaidó appeared with a small handful of uniformed military personnel as well as his mentor leopoldo lópez who military officials had reportedly released from house arrest hours earlier guaidó declared the insurrection the final phase of operación libertad and claimed his military supporters had already seized the not insignificant eastern caracas military airbase known as la carlota except they hadn t by the evening of april 30 it was clear the attempted putsch had failed the military did not heed guaidó s call to arms civilians did not flood the streets and lópez had taken refuge as a guest first in the chilean and then in the spanish embassies twenty five defected soldiers sought asylum in the brazilian embassy days later up to 120 deserters that earlier pledged allegiance to the self declared interim president were evicted from a hotel in cúcuta colombia where they were awaiting orders after 19 nights without paying the bill foiled and fractured from the outset operación libertad immediately moved to another front u s national security advisor john bolton took to the airwaves to claim key figures of president nicolás maduro s inner circle defense minister vladimir padrino lópez supreme court justice maikel moreno and presidential guard commander iván rafael hernández dala had promised to join the uprising only to get cold feet when guaidó initiated the plan early whether or not the named individuals were in fact in cahoots with the opposition and the trump administration is unclear what is certain however is that bolton s public naming of names was intended to unsettle maduro bolton also later floated the theory quickly taken up by many commentators sympathetic to the opposition that cuban counterintelligence operations were behind the botched coup and that padrino and company only entered the negotiations to expose weak links in the embattled maduro government in a similarly conspiratorial move secretary of state mike pompeo suggested that maduro had a plane on the tarmac at maiquetía international airport ready to flee to havana but was forced to remain in venezuela at the orders of his russian handlers as guaidó and the united states continue to threaten military intervention either of the conventional variety or as an intensification of non kinetic tactics ones that don t involve physical military deployment ostensibly middle powers have stepped up their efforts to oust maduro through more peaceful means canada has approached cuba to discuss ways they could work together to support a peaceful resolution in venezuela and the lima group has asked cuban president miguel díaz canel to join its efforts to negotiate a dialogue the international contact group convened a summit to step up pressure for fresh elections while not discounting the government s role in the political and economic crisis economists mark weisbrot and jeffrey sachs estimate that u s sanctions could be responsible for the deaths of 40 000 venezuelans between 2017 and 2018 like so much of the battle between the opposition and government in bolivarian venezuela the april 30 military uprising was more spectacle than substance this of course is not to suggest the crisis threat of regime change and the violence it would likely entail are not or have not been real while the opposition s coup attempt may indeed be a simulacrum of an actual civic military alliance it should also be recognized as an improvisation on an established script that continues to deepen the crisis in venezuela the internationalization of venezuela s opposition the opposition in venezuela has counted on international support in its efforts at regime change since the early chávez years allied governments and businesses have provided public and private assistance ranging from political capital and sanctions to funding and training since the 2002 2003 opposition backed oil lockout whose explicit goal was to starve the chávez government of funds by cutting off its most significant revenue stream and thereby hasten regime change the following year nato governments supported the efforts ofu s backed ngo súmate to recall chávez the default position of pundits and policymakers since these early efforts to end the bolivarian revolution has followed a script that either dismissed politics in venezuela as petro populism or a dangerous threat to the liberal order the most recent expression of this international support has been on display since guaidó named himself president in january foreign governments including the united states canada the eu and more recently the right of center governments in latin america not only publicly backed the interim president but also froze maduro s access to public assets including gold reserves and holdings of the state oil industry internationalization has also taken the form of opposition coordination with foreign governments to isolate and pressure maduro this has gained momentum publicly since 2017 when maduro convoked a national constituent assembly anc in order to circumvent the opposition controlled national assembly since the election of the anc which the opposition boycotted the lima group has worked to isolate and remove maduro from power via diplomatic means with a stated goal to restor democracyin through peaceful and negotiated means while cloaked in the language of human rights and democracy the lima declaration and the lima group have been clear that restoration of democracy entails the end of what they have concluded is an illegitimate government the lima group is an international and diplomatic extension of the lawfare the opposition has waged since taking control of the national assembly in 2015 while in control of the legislative branch of government the opposition worked all but exclusively to undermine the rest of the government rather than trying to pass laws that could actually respond to the crisis for example opposition lawmakers passed a blanket amnesty for participants in previous and future coup attempts they also attempted to curtail the president s fiscal and political powers these actions led the government to clamp down on power including its convening of the anc which contributed to a series of escalating conflicts and intensified paramilitarization of opposition protests and increasingly violent crackdowns that left over 160 dead in 2017 alone by convoking the anc maduro broke with the spirit and practice of constituent power the grassroots generative inclusive creative and egalitarian people power than has arguably been the most admirable aspect of the bolivarian revolution far from an expression of protagonistic democracy the sort of open ended transformative inclusive participatory and emancipatory process that defined the 1999 anc this was plainly a move designed to remove a legislative obstacle to power the lima group however did not call itself to arms in defense of constituent power the group s statements and alliances have instead been partisan picking a side in a battle within the venezuelan state rather than trying to mitigate polarization the lima group has opposed direct military intervention in venezuela always cloaking its positions behind the niceties of dialogue and negotiation however with the victories of álvaro uribe s puppet iván duque in colombia and the ultra right jair bolsonaro in brazil a more potentially violent south american front has opened in the opposition s international strategy far from cowing maduro however the potential involvement of the continent s largest and most counter insurgency ready militaries combined with the increased role of u s advisors and supportive words from the u s southern command have instead pushed venezuela to seek deeper military ties with russia there are certainly parallels with the civil war in syria in which an internal conflict ratcheted up to a proxy battle between washington and moscow thus far military coordination and support has played a less prominent directrole than civil society work and polyarchy promotion in venezuela support for dictators and death squads of the cold war has by and large been replaced with sponsoring economic and political reforms that benefit the same elites and limit popular participation in politics but do so with less immediately violent consequences the opposition party primero justicia for example was founded in the late 1990s as a u s sponsored ngo maría corina machado the head of súmate the ngo behind the 2004 presidential recall was welcomed to george w bush s oval office before any official of the chávez government less formal elite networks have also been key leopoldo lópez north american publics are often reminded is a graduate of harvard s kennedy school of government the reality of the class dynamics at play in contemporary venezuela is that many opposition figures share lópez s pedigree speak unaccented english and french and share social ties and cosmopolitan experiences with many world leaders such organic links facilitate the spread of and support for opposition messaging they also grant a degree of sympathy and credibility to opposition leaders among a general public in the north atlantic in which the exclusionary institutions of higher education convey a high degree of social capital major media outlets in the north atlantic have also been key allies opinion making organs like the new york times concluded 15 years ago that chávez s 21stcentury socialism was either a populist aberration riding an oil boom or a dangerous anachronism more recently fox news has barely been able to contain its glee as it beats socialists like alexandria ocasio cortéz with the cudgel of venezuela s ostensibly socialist catastrophe even msnbc ostensibly the bastion of the anti trump resistance has failed to criticize the bellicose noises coming from administration officials occasionally the casual lie reinforces the narrative of a righteous opposition facing off with a totalitarian strongman as in the case of a cnn report on a helicopter crash in caracas that referred in passing to elections in january in which voters chose opposition leader juan guaidó over him for president there were no elections in january maduro was sworn in for his second term and guaidó declared himself president but there were no elections that this made it past a series of editors and fact checkers should alarm us all the elephant in the room despite the unbridgeable chasm separating the government of nicolás maduro and the opposition currently headed by juan guaidó both sides share two common positions the first is that their conflict is fundamentally a contest for state power the second is that this state is and will continue to be one based in oil extraction thus far guaidó has extended a personalistic approach to politics long practiced by venezuela s opposition it is a politics summed up by opposition pollster josé gil yepes as a visionless program that says vote for me when i get to power i ll give you solutions rather than offering specifics about meaningful participation this is a politics that begins and ends with the state and the strongman president nothing guaidó or lópez have indicated thus far suggests any intention of breaking toward more democratic or participatory horizons if anything what plans and interim appointments guaidó has announced suggest a return to the policies of the 1990s with a technocratic mix of piecemeal neoliberalization and elite driven democracy both of which require a strong state to enforce order stability and the absolute sanctity of private property at the same time maduro s actions since becoming president have intensified aspects of centralization and overdependence on the military that worried many during the later chávez years in spite of this focus on the state comuneros and colectivos local grassroots projects in mutual aid and direct democracy have made important strides in developing new forms of public life that are autonomous more inclusive and pushing toward sustainability as one comunero recently related to a foreign observer if was to fall that organization will still be here this huge spirit of participation will still exist and it will be a problem for any government that tries to dismantle it if the demonization of colectivos common among opposition supporters and amplified by media outlets in the north as racialized hordes of criminals is any indication such an attempted dismantling has little prospect of unfolding peacefully in other words the conflict between maduro and guaidó is a competition between forms of state constituted power in the heat of this confrontation over the commanding heights of the state questions about substantive democracy modes of civic and public engagement and more equitable practices of quotidian governance that is popular power have been systematically relegated to the slogans and staged spectacles of both the government and opposition given the depth of the economic crisis facing venezuela and the very real human costs it entails talk of phasing out fossil fuels seems detached and misguided however the prolonged collapse of oil prices offers a preview of what decarbonization could likely mean for venezuelans and other hydrocarbon exporting nations if the country does not formulate a more aggressive and proactive energy transition at this point neither the maduro nor guaidó camp has taken this challenge seriously the government has by and large repeated recent and longer term established discourses maduro has echoed chávez s calls for the construction of sustainable eco socialism however like his predecessor in the same breath he has also intensified hydrocarbon and other extractive enterprises notably in the orinoco mining belt while increasing the internationalization of natural resources through mixed enterprises and deepening venezuela s oil debt to china as the scramble for new extractive revenue streams intensifies in the context of the current crisis so too has the militarization of venezuela s resource frontiers while the world watches guaidó s made in the usa show of aid convoys and fake coups the multi sided conflict over land and the environment in venezuela s interior has become increasingly bloody guaidó s policy agenda proposes a return of the neoliberalization of the 1990s the international monetary fund and inter american development bank reportedly have plans ready should guaidó take power to invest tens of billions of dollars into venezuela s various resource sectors prioritizing revitalizing and accelerating oil extraction while the realities of the global political economy reinforce the inevitable conclusion that oil and other extractives offer venezuela s most readily available resources for reconstruction medium and long term outlooks point toward the need for the structural overhaul of venezuela s petroleum based economy the need to transition away from dependence on the extraction and export of petroleum is by no means a new realization i have argued elsewhere that oil occupies an ambivalent position in venezuela s popular imaginary after all every government since 1936 has cited the need to sembrar el petróleo to sow the oil into a more productive industrial and agricultural base dictators and democrats have been enchanted by the magical abilities oil rents have promised in the pursuit of development and modernization however oil is also the devil s excrement as venezuela s former ambassador to opec juan pablo pérez alfonzo put it in the 1970s which venezuela has been drowning in for a century drowning and stuck the prospects for a post extractivist transition out of venezuela s current political economic and social crises may seem dim especially when the threat of military intervention by some of the least stable individuals in the hemisphere present such a clear and present danger it is increasingly certain however that the question of transition is not one of if but rather of what kind it is a question that venezuelans and their leaders have wrestled with for nearly 100 years and it is a question obscured by the spectacle of international confrontation for state power currently unfolding donald kingsbury lectures in political science and latin american studies at the university of toronto he is the author of only the people can save the people constituent power revolution and counterrevolution in venezuela suny press 2018 and is currently at work on a manuscript examining the politics of extractive states in post pink tide latin america
our transportation system has been underfunded for far too long and it s time for illinois to transition to a more sustainable funding method to fix our crumbling roads and the more than 2 300 bridges in our state that are rated as structurally deficient said state senator martin a sandoval d chicago on may 8 house bill 3233 provides a historic sustainable revenue source for making illinois transportation needs a priority for the future the measure would update illinois motor fuel tax to reflect current market prices and keep up with inflation adding a quarter to the 19 cents per gallon excise tax last increased in 1990 and then indexing the gas tax would help provide for sustainable transportation funding as sandoval asserts with those who drive more miles paying more fuel tax but going from an annual registration fee of 17 50 to 1 000 for vehicles that don t emit tailpipe emissions in fact that don t have tailpipes regardless of how many miles driven would not appear to meet the definition of sustainability certainly not from an environmental perspective in fact a recent uc davis study argues that it is neither sustainable nor effective in addition to hiking fuel taxes and ev registration fee sandoval s bill would double the driver s license fee to 60 and raise the vehicle registration fee to 148 reports dan petrella for the chicago tribune source article on may 8 the driver s license fee is now 30 the vehicle registration fee is 98 indiana sandoval said his plan would raise an estimated 2 4 billion in annual transportation funding for illinois a variety of ideas to fund repairs to the state s aging infrastructure have been proposed over the years from previous attempts to raise the gas tax to proposals to tax vehicles based on the number of miles driven but none has gained traction in springfield since 2013 30 other states including neighboring indiana have enacted legislation to increase gas taxes according to the national conference of state legislatures ncsl the indiana legislature which increased the state 18 cents per gallon gasoline excise tax by a dime two years ago also added new ev and hybrid vehicle fees but in comparison to sandoval s proposal the 150 and 50 fees respectively appear very modest the fees are adjusted every 5 years for inflation as of october 2018 21 states have enacted legislation requiring a special registration fee for select hybrid and plug in electric vehicles although oklahoma s legislation was subsequently struck down by the state supreme court bringing the total number of states implementing fees to 20 write kristy hartman and kevin pula for ncsl on march 21 unlike the current illinois ev fee they are in addition to standard motor vehicle registration fees a map shows the range of ev and hybrid fees with the maximum fee being 200 so why would sandoval chairman of the senate transportation committee propose 1 000 sandoval did not respond to a request for comment on the proposed ev registration fee hike reported robert channick for the chicago tribune on may 10 ev sales in the prairie state are projected to increase he adds illinois ranked seventh in ev sales last year at 6 400 vehicles there were about 15 000 electric vehicles registered in the state as of last month but analysts project that number could increase dramatically in the coming years as manufacturers ramp up production customers warm to adoption and more and better charging stations come online a recent study by the citizens utility board projected the number of electric vehicles registered in illinois to hit at least 690 000 by 2030 but could reach as high as 2 2 million if the state embarks on an aggressive effort to reduce carbon emissions in addition to opposition from the nation s largest ev manufacturer tesla channick adds that lectric truck startup rivian which is slated to begin production at its factory in downstate normal next year was more outspoken imposing fees on evs that are over 400 percent more than their gasoline powered counterparts is not only unfair it discourages promising new technology that will reduce our dependence on petroleum reduce emissions and promote the illinois economy rivian spokesman michael mchale said governor s proposal chicago tribune letter writer marc martinez suggested on may 14 that state sen martin sandoval may correctly assume that the electric fee will be negotiated and is using the proposed 1 000 fee to get past the shock factor of electric vehicle drivers having to pay comparable taxes as if on cue four days later the tribune reports that gov j b pritzker is set to unveil 41 5 billion rebuild illinois capital plan that includes 1 8 billion in new and increased taxes any guesses as to the size of the ev fee pritzker s outline includes doubling the state gas tax to 38 cents per gallon from 19 cents tiered increases in vehicle registration fees based on the vehicle s age a 250 annual registration fee for electric vehicles a 1 per ride tax on ride sharing and a 7 state tax on cable satellite and streaming service about that 19 cents per gallon gasoline excise tax the prairie state is one of just seven states where drivers pay general state and local sales taxes on gas purchases observed adam schuster of the illinois policy institute a libertarian and conservative nonprofit think tank in a may 24 piece that focused on the governor s 19 tax and fee proposals would take 6 9 billion out of illinoisans pockets according to api other state taxes fees amount to 17 87 cents per gallon as of april 1 bringing the state gas tax to 36 87 cpg making illinois the 10th highest in the nation as of last july according to the tax foundation indiana with its 42 9 cpg tax was 8 the illinois chamber of commerce said in a statement that sandoval s measure needs more work but the group already has made clear it supports a gas tax increase if coupled with a repeal on the state s 6 25 percent sales tax on gas at the pump reported petrella of the tribune in the source article he also noted bipartisan support for the gas tax increase which will prove helpful even though the state became a democratic trifecta this year alternative methods to ensure evs pay for roads charging a flat annual registration fee in illinois be it the current 17 50 gov pritzker s proposed 250 or sen sandoval s proposed 1 000 is inequitable in the sense that it doesn t act as a true user fee i e the charge is not proportionate to use like a gas tax california alan jenn a uc davis research scientist with the plug in hybrid electric vehicle research center commenting on california s 100 new annual zero emission vehicle registration fee for model years 2020 and later concluded via planetizen the california zero emissions vehicle registration fee doesn t support the long run funding of transportation infrastructure nor is it equitable for drivers of electric and hydrogen vehicles said jenn california now has the opportunity to support alternative funding mechanisms jenn said our study finds that a per mile road charge designed specifically for zero emission vehicles is a relatively low cost and sustainable solution to funding our roads metropolitan planning council audrey wennink transportation director for the chicago region s metropolitan planning council a nonprofit research group agrees with the vehicle miles traveled vmt fee alternative reports mary wisniewski for the tribune on march 11 even if we have a gas tax increase that s a short term solution said wennink who favors a pilot program for a miles traveled tax along with a gas tax hike so the state can learn about it gov j b pritzker proposed a pilot during his gubernatorial campaign but isn t currently pursuing the idea said spokeswoman jordan abudayyeh rep marcus evans jr a democrat representing chicago and some south suburbs introduced a bill for a miles traveled tax pilot last month but tabled it a week later he said the time was not ripe and more education needs to be done environmentalists perspectives on road funding as previously noted the gas tax is paid proportionate to fuel consumption making for a better user fee than a flat registration fee wisniewski the tribune s transportation reporter adds the gas tax is effectively a carbon tax and fairly accounts for the pollution impacts of fuel inefficent trucks and cars said howard learner executive director of the environmental law and policy center which opposes a vehicle miles traveled tax the tax does not differentiate between gas guzzlers and fuel efficient vehicles that undermines sound climate change solutions policy wennink agreed that efficient vehicles are good for the environment but they are bad for road revenue in 1991 illinois residents paid 166 per capita in motor fuel taxes it s now down to about 100 a year a 40 percent drop she said furthermore missing in learner s analysis is the inherent social inequity of relying on the fuel tax as the auto market undergoes a technology transition research shows that low income and rural households tend to drive older and heavier duty vehicles respectively notes a 2014 center for american progress report entitled switching from a gas tax to a mileage based user fee moreover as fuel economy standards increase in the coming years and more advanced technology vehicles enter the market the disparity between high and low income drivers will only grow a mileage fee would reverse this trend ohio mark nabong who specializes in transportation and energy policy with a particular interest in electric vehicle policy in the midwest for the environmental group natural resources defense council suggests a variable annual ev registration fee in his march 11 post in opposition to ohio s new annual ev and hybrid vehicle registration fees of 200 and 100 respectively included in legislation that hiked gas and diesel taxes by 10 5 and 19 cents per gallon respectively effective july 1 at that dollar amount the fee is unfair to ohio drivers and sends the wrong message about the engagement of ohio with technology and economic innovation a better solution to any such static registration fee would be to index the gas tax to both inflation and total fuel consumption and then apply the resulting tax to evs as annual fees based on their mpg the institute on taxation and economic policy recommends sustainable variable rate taxes in which the tax rate rises alongside gas prices the general inflation rate in the economy vehicle fuel efficiency or other relevant factors as the national average vehicle fuel efficiency rates increase so would the gas tax lawmakers rejected a request by gov mike dewine to index the gas tax to inflation allowing it to climb each year without legislative approval according to the dayton daily news bottom line while this post centers on sen sandoval s audacious 1 000 annual ev registration fee the real issue when it comes to state transportation funding is whether the illinois legislature can agree to hike the gasoline excise tax which would be historic considering it s been 30 years since it was last done related in

includes an expansion of the mine s processing plant and tailings capacity with an estimated initial capital investment of more than a billion dollars 100 basis and the potential to extend the life of the mine into the 2030s and beyond2 barrick expects to complete a feasibility study for the expansion project during 2020 the proposed capital investment would more than double the contribution the mine has already made to the dominican republic barrick gold corporation s president and chief executive officer mark bristow speaking at a local media briefing here today said the proposed investment was further evidence of the joint venture partners long term commitment to the social and economic development of the dominican republic we look forward to continue making a significant and growing contribution to our communities and other stakeholders and to unlocking the enormous value of its mineral potential while addressing the historical third party environmental issues he said barrick manages the mine which is a joint venture with newmont goldcorp bristow noted that the joint venture partners had already invested 5 2 billion in pueblo viejo which represents almost 20 of the total foreign direct investment in the dominican republic over the past 10 years direct cash taxes paid by the mine amounted to 1 6 billion which represents 57 of the cash distributions compared to 43

be identical to the manner in which barrick calculates comparable measures total cash cost per ounce is a non gaap financial performance measure with no standardized meaning under ifrs and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers total cash cost per ounce should not be considered by investors as an alternative to operating profit net profit attributable to shareholders or to other ifrs measures barrick believes that total cash cost per ounce is a useful indicator for investors and management of a mining company s performance as it provides an indication of a company s profitability and efficiency the trends in cash costs as the company s operations mature and a benchmark of performance to allow for comparison against other companies wood mackenzie is

published tuesday 28 may 2019 print disqus by plunger in this report we will look at the state of the stock market and update the condition of a potential bottom in the gold space sell in may and go away you have all heard this wall street ditty before and it is now upon us at this moment despite this old market rule being an established truism few actually use it to make money instead the daily market action draws investors back into the market typically in search of that illusory summer rally instead they typically find themselves in the stock market s summer doldrums i can t quote the exact statistics however if one was to simply sell in may and stay out of the market until the typical october weakness then go back in whole hog his returns would greatly outpace the returns of the market itself so the sell in may phenomenon is real let s try to use it to our advantage time to start sharpening our knives this means it s time to begin shorting the market selectively that is i have shown in the past that shorting is most profitable if one holds off until the second half of a bear market that s because the market starts providing decent follow through on the downside we are not there yet since it s still early on in phase i of the bear market however selective shorts can be taken when a set up presents itself later on in this report i will present a few short sale set ups bear market analysis big picture i have now moved the rolling top scenario up into the most likely outcome for the stock market there is always a possibility that the blow off top scenario could reemerge however with each passing day it appears less likely instead we have been witnessing an ongoing stream of data points which point towards a lower market and a downside break in the market looming ahead the bear market began on october 4th as defined by dow theory it is forming a massive rollover top at record historical valuations once a dow theory sell signal is triggered it is normal for it to continue until the bear market purges the excesses which exist in the economy how severe of a bear market can we expect according to john hussman s analysis for the market to reach normal bear market valuations at its lows it would require the s p 500 to drop 60 from its current levels keep in mind that would just be a normal bear market valuation historically if a bull market becomes grossly over extended as is today s market the next bear market can be expected to overshoot to the downside one can only imagine what downside levels could be reached let s review the chart above the rally since december 24th 2018 can now be seen as simply a bear market rally it was a bmr of the caliber witnessed from november 1929 to april 1930 once if the dow and transports violate the red dashed line extending from the late march lows it will re confirm the bear market is intact mind you the dt bear market sell signal of december 14th has never been annulled so this will be a re confirmation of that signal a powerful omen post 1929 crash bmr the post 1929 crash bmr served to reignite bullish psychology back in 1930 similar to what the rally since december 24th 2018 has done today both within the confines of a bear market retail market investors still think we are in an ongoing bull market that s typical bear market phase i market psychology the market will transition into bear market phase ii sometime after the december lows have been violated about one third into phase ii we will witness a point of recognition por of the bear market by the investing public frankly i don t see this occurring until likely 2020 as once the december lows get violated there will be a lot of organized support for the market in an attempt to hold it up however time will eventually erode this support and open the flood gates with a crack to the downside which will be recognized as the por in the below chart we see the interplay between the dow and transports for the bmr which began december 24th we have seen in previous breakdowns the transports leading the move down just like we see in the current action moving average momentum can be seen waning setting itself up for a possible fall sell in may below we see the small stocks in the russell 2000 rolling over first yield curve exit indicator still holding off and hanging on by its fingernails doomsday lines below we see two doomsday lines when if both violated on a closing basis will re confirm the dow theory bear market sell signal also note by observing the vertical lines how the transports fell off and failed to reconfirm the dow on the last two highs the rounding rollover top the lead scenario the blow off top scenario now seems to have been put on the shelf conditions and seasonals appear to be pointing towards a decline now sell in may and go away the bond market is telling us a recession is encroaching the tariffs put upon chinese goods now equate to a loss of purchasing power of 350 month for the average american family considering the median household income in the us is 61 000 year the loss of 4 200 year of purchasing power due to the tariffs is huge make no mistake about it that s a 6 8 new tax on the average american family the bond market sees this amongst other factors pointing towards a recession below we see rates in free fall reflecting a weakening economy 10 yr ust long duration 30 yr usb the 30 yr bond now breaking out bottom line bonds recession is looming and bonds are still in a bull market after 36 long years world stock markets rejoining the downside commodities downturn resuming we start with what i refer to as the scariest chart on the planet it s my version of rambus long term crb index in a post bubble contraction the real price of commodities decline while the real price of gold rises for some time now i have recognized the possible message of the below chart being that once the back test of the 40 year support line is over there is a possibility that commodities could crash down to the level of the early 1970 s the rise of commodities over the past 3 years has been perceived as a new bull market however this chart shows that it may only be a back test of the violated 40 year support line in the chart below we can see an expanded view of that back test instead of looking like a new bull market it actually looks like a lame attempt to back test the s r line and that attempt is now complete aussie dollar resuming its decline the aussie dollar is the commodity currency of the world that s because a large part of the aussie economy and currency flows are tied up in commodities the aud leads commodity prices and the chart below shows it s headed down oil resuming its third cyclical bear market within its long term secular bear market below we see the long term trends in oil after the break above its 31 year horizontal trend channel it embarked on a classic 10 year bull market this bull market had 3 clearly defined phases not depicted and ended in a parabolic blow off parabolic blow offs typically are followed by secular bear markets and oil was no exception it is my analysis that oil has now resumed its third cyclical bear market within the secular bear market which began 11 years ago towards the end of this cyclical bear market i believe life time opportunities will present themselves to investors in the oil patch keep one eye on this bear market looking for future opportunities below we see the 2 5 year bull market in oil with its september 2018 top followed by a new cyclical bear market in oil it started with a hard drop off the top followed by a 4 month bearish rising wedge with a throwover top the bear market decline appears to have now resumed five short sale candidates for the next leg down in the early stages of a bear market it is typical for declining stocks not to have much follow through we saw this over the past week as stocks that suddenly drop quickly recover much of their lost ground the next day i experienced this with the shorts i have out so often the best course of action is to take profits immediately rather than wait for follow through my preferred method to short in this stage of the bear is to put on a bear call spread slightly in the money i buy a call well above the market to cap any potential loss and sell an in the money call close to strike to capture maximum premium this way even if the stock just goes sideways the trade should make money as the time value of the premium decays over time boeing if it s not boeing i m not going unless its a max boeing is in big big trouble in my view it s a company that got lazy and lost its way the boeing design philosophy has always been the pilot can turn off all automation and simply fly the airplane this allows the pilot ultimate rule over the aircraft not so with airbus airbus pilots like to joke that they simply are a voting member where the computer retains the right to nullify their vote when boeing designed the 737 max they departed from their time tested operational philosophy of the pilot being in control and they didn t tell the pilots seriously how crazy is that well it resulted in 2 back to back crashes of fully loaded aircraft now they have hundreds of 737 max s sitting in the desert awaiting a fix and recertification sure they can always buy off congress and the faa i suppose but good luck trying to do that with the civil aviation authorities in europe and china especially in the middle of a trade war bottom line on boeing is the stock got way over priced and hyped then disaster struct there is no quick fix meanwhile the lawsuits stack up and hundreds of a c sit in the desert the chart is a clean picture of a measured move down to the 305 level note how springy the backtest has been that s due to the early stage of a bear market little immediate follow through credit suisse cs everyone knows that deutsche bank db is full of insolvent credits and is on deaths door think of db as lehman on the rhine well db is not the only one chock full of insolvency credit suisse is db s kid brother let s just call cs db in drag cs had a nasty breakdown on thursday with a bt on friday setting it up to be shorted again bank of nova scotia this is a play against the canadian housing market one could also look at ry bmo td or others however bns is a bit more advanced in the process of breaking down we always prefer a short to have come off of its top then rally back up and finally drop down below its 30 w ema once it s unable to rally back above its 30 w ema it s then ready to short bns fits the bill medifast med medifast is a jim chanos short that s about all one needs to know outside of chart analysis we see a nice island reversal top followed by a failing retracement of its breakdown 30 w ema now starting to roll over it just now needs to drop below its horizontal triangle that is depicted a short seller could take half a position here then the second half after it backtests a break below the triangle a longer duration chart gives more perspective of just how much could come unglued once the price gets turned down below the 30 w ema russell 2000 etf iwm as seen earlier the iwm is the lagging index for the general stock market the chart below looks like it is finally setting up to unload to the downside note its drop on thursday with bt on friday i would expect this to float around for a few days before resuming downward action it finally is unable to remain above the 30 w ema below is a longer perspective note weekly stochastics and ppo in a downward configuration these are just five stocks which appear ready to short in the next leg down there are plenty others on the dishonorable list such as iyt fdx ups nvda cop gm bac plus many others update on the pm stocks it is important to understand that the pm sector is the opposite side of the coin of the general stock market this is because of the time tested principle that gold s real price declines in a financial bubble and rises as the bubble deflates we can see from the above analysis that the bubble is beginning to degrade we see this in the stock market the commodities and the general economic data gold is on the opposite side of this equation and has been establishing a base for the upcoming bull market associated with a post bubble contraction presently the stocks are still struggling to put in a bottom and have not yet made the turn newmont however appears to have done so the main risk to the pm shares is that they have a certain vulnerability of declining initially with a sell off of the general stock market this is why i have concentrated my positions amongst quality shares and royalties as they should be less vulnerable geopolitical factors also appear to be lining up to assist the turn in gold us china trade relations have broken down i presently am writing this report from shanghai china from this vantage point it appears that the trade struggle is not about trump s the art of the deal but instead sun tzu s the art of war where the chinese don t meet force head on but instead respond in other forms these forms could include selling us treasury debt and using these funds to acquire gold putin s russia has already completed this operation of selling all of their us treasury bonds and using it to buy gold the usd seems to have picked up on this threat putting in a bearish shooting star candle top followed by a hard down day perhaps the end of an extended upward move the spec gold bears are getting excited about a potential downside move in gold however strategic serious money is moving into gold gold is the long play permanent money recognizes this and is positioning itself one should ask oneself which group should you

deficits to a shopper going to a store and complaining they lost money with what they bought most trade experts see trade deficits or surpluses between two specific countries as economically meaningless china s deficit with the united states is large in part because many goods particularly electronics that used to be made in different countries typically in asia are now sent to china for final assembly even though many key parts are still manufactured in countries such as japan south korea and taiwan that has lowered the u s trade deficit with those countries over the years while

not remotely new either they are simply higher in some cases than they were before tariffs are a decidedly modest portion of revenue in modern times and trump has not changed that with the escalation of his trade fight with china customs and duties generated 41 3 billion in revenues last year up from 34 6 billion in 2017 far more than 10 cents that 6 7 billion increase occurred in part because of

greater access to china s financial sector will encourage global investors and dispel the gloom clouding the global economy amid beijing s trade tensions with washington according to senior officials and economists chinese financial regulators are preparing a comprehensive opening up with more new measures in the pipeline foreign institutions with advanced performance in risk management credit rating consumer finance endowments and health insurance are especially welcome senior officials stressed over the weekend the opening measures will offset part of the negative impacts of trade friction on economic recovery and enable china to reach its gdp growth target of above 6 percent this year they said under the trade pressure the world s second largest economy is accelerating restructuring reform and shifting from an export dominated growth model to a more services driven model they added the united states escalated trade tensions but it cannot solve any problem this causes volatility and sluggishness in global financial markets and hurts the global economy said guo shuqing the people s bank of china s party secretary and also head of the china banking and insurance regulatory commission his keynote speech was delivered by a commission spokesman at a forum on may 25 impact on the chinese economy will be very limited said guo chinese financial markets although they were excessively affected by trade tensions last year are unlikely to be hit more dramatically going forward as financial resilience is strengthening the huge domestic consumer market in china will digest most of the unsalable exports and many of china s exports will also shift to other foreign markets the us will continue to purchase china made goods if there are no substitutes but us consumers will need to pay more guo said research released by the international monetary fund on may 24 showed that some of these tariffs have been passed on to us consumers while others have been absorbed by importers leading to lower profit margins us restrictions on high tech exports to china will push up washington s trade deficit with china and rising prices could also reverse the low inflation in the us meanwhile any speculative trading on the chinese currency amid its depreciation pressure will inevitably suffer from a huge loss guo said in his speech to eliminate bad outcomes from trade tensions further opening up in china s services sector together with high tech development supported by artificial intelligence will help lift chinese economic growth from 6 3 percent to around 7 percent by 2035 said zhu min a former deputy managing director at the imf market oriented reform and opening up will improve productivity in the service sector which is an important thing that china is focusing on to stabilize economic growth zhu said chen yulu a vice governor of the pboc also supported a full scale opening of the financial sector in the future foreign investors are welcome to conduct all forms of financial business in china excepting those being named on a negative list and authorities are researching a new regulatory system chen said at the forum on may 25 li daokui director of the academic center for chinese economic practice and thinking at tsinghua university said china should be more confident in accelerating opening up of its financial sector which will help global investors seize numerous opportunities in the chinese market domestic financial institutions are now capable of engaging in fiercer competition with global peers as their service abilities in many aspects such as banking and insurance have improved a lot over the past years li said despite headwinds from the trade tensions global investors are still optimistic about china s economic prospects said zhang zhiwei deutsche bank s chief china economist and head of china equity strategy foreign investors believe that china has enough policy tools to offset short term downside pressure while the financial risks are under control as the country s debt level has shown signs of stabilizing zhang said china s overall debt to gdp ratio had dropped to 249 4 percent by the end of 2018 1 5 percentage points lower than a year earlier according to the pboc if trade tensions escalate further more opening up policies in the sectors of medical care and education will help boost global investors confidence in the chinese economy zhang added source the central people s government of the people s republic of china
sign up for daily news updates from cleantechnica on email or follow us on google news originally published at ilsr org as clean energy advocates urge retirement of fossil fuel power plants securitization has become a billion dollar word with huge implications for who will pay for and who will own the clean energy future already securitization has shown up in several state clean energy laws colorado legislators have been refining a power plant securitization bill hb 1037 several times this session in new mexico the energy transition act signed in april 2019 includes securitization of retiring public service company power plants in florida duke energy has cut the costs of paying off retired power plants with securitization powers enacted over a decade ago the colorado bill sponsor is actively talking to colleagues in minnesota utah and montana about the proposal so what is securitization and how does it play a role in a clean energy transition update 5 21 19 an expert reader got in touch to suggest my estimated utility cost of capital 5 to 6 was too low because i underestimated the utility s borrowing rate and ignored how tax liability increases costs the text has been corrected to 8 to 9 for more on this calculation see page 55 of rap s electricity regulation in the us a guide second edition refinancing to lower costs securitization is a fancy term for loan refinancing it works much like mortgage or student loan refinancing does addressing both the outstanding principal owed and the interest rate if done right it can lower costs for utility customers and encourage early retirement of coal or other fossil fuel power plants securitization works because utilities tend to have a high costs an investor owned utility in good financial health can raise money from shareholders and banks for a combined interest rate of about 8 to 9 although securitization methods differ they often involve substituting customer backed or government backed dollars for utility equity and debt with interest rates closer to 3 or 4 percent the following graphic from the sierra club annotated by ilsr shows potentially significant savings by using securitization to retire costly fossil fuel power plants and finance new renewable energy resources the savings are more than theoretical an analysis by varadarajan of possible minnesota coal plant closures found that using the standard accounting tools of accelerated depreciation over five years and a regulatory asset would cost 29 a megawatt hour mwh while securitized 20 year bonds would cost 5 a mwh a savings of 45 million in some cases like the colorado bill mentioned earlier savings aren t just passed through to customers colorado s law would set aside funds to smooth the transition for power plant communities that lose a major employer writing for greentech media justin gerdes explains that under the bill 15 percent of the net present value of savings generated by the closure of a power plant such as fuel not burned as well as avoided maintenance and operating costs would be directed to a new seven member governor appointed body the colorado energy impact assistance authority to be used for transition assistance for workers and communities how much to pay utilities for past investment while few disagree with the notion of lowering interest payments with customer or government backed bonds a major concern is how much principal how much of the remaining value of a power plant to refinance in other words how much are aging coal power plants worth the size and timing of power plant improvements complicates this calculation unlike a house where adding a deck might change the value but the mortgage stays the same utilities effectively take out a new mortgage on every improvement they make since a plant opened utilities likely have replaced turbines installed pollution controls or made efficiency upgrades each time as shown in the following chart it sets a new schedule for retiring debt that may extend for years or decades beyond the present day the key question is in utility regulator speak prudency should customers have to pay for ill advised or imprudent investments the law obligates customers to pay the cost of grid infrastructure built by monopoly utilities only if it can be shown to be a wise investment for example was it a wise investment for xcel energy to pour nearly 1 2 billion into pollution controls and a new generating unit at its comanche coal fired power plant in 2010 with the energy market evolving rapidly at the time how much of the 200 million that xcel utility executives chose to spend on the aging units should be paid for by customers and how much should be chalked up to a poor investment decision securitization may allow for socialized risk whereas most entrepreneurs or companies making a business decision take on the risk that their investment will fail most utilities being considered for securitization refinancing are government regulated monopolies if regulators allow utility shareholders can push the cost of poor utility investment decisions onto utility customers by asking for customers to pay for the full value of bad investments critics of the new mexico energy transition act have highlighted this very issue new energy economy called the securitization deal that the state passed into law in march 2019 a blank check noting that it provided the utility 100 recovery of the remaining value of all their assets including profits for shareholders securitization laws in other states allow state regulators to review the amount of reimbursement utilities receive the new mexico law strips regulators of that oversight role do utilities deserve a profit guarantee in securitization discussions lobbyists for investor owned utilities frequently request special treatment namely they want guaranteed utility ownership of any power plant built to replace the refinanced and retiring power plants remember the third note from the chart illustrating how securitization works retirement of costly power plants saves customers money but it means the utility no longer has an asset on which to earn profits an ownership guarantee means profits for utility shareholders but it can come at a hefty price premium for electricity customers mariel nanasi of new energy economy shared analysis with new mexico legislators suggesting that utility owned replacement renewable energy will cost customers 50 more than competitively bid power despite this warning legislators allowed the company to own all of the necessary replacement power for retiring coal power plants listen to john farrell s interview with mariel nanasi of new energy economy about the new mexico energy transition act in colorado legislators have drawn up a compromise in his coverage for greentech media gerdes writes as a sweetener for the utility to give up the equity in a rate based power plant hb 1037 permits utilities to own at least some of the replacement generating capacity specifically it sets a range of permissible amounts at a maximum the utility can own energy generation equal to the size of the retiring power plant sometimes called its nameplate capacity if a 700 megawatt power plant was retired the utility can at most own up to 700 megawatts the minimum ownership amount is then based on the capacity of the refinanced part of the power plant so if the principal owned on a 700 megawatt power plant was equal to 1 7th of its original cost the utility would be allowed to own 100 megawatts of replacement power the following chart illustrates unless securitization legislation also changes the utility business model shareholders of any utility covered under this statute or in the similar 30 states with regulated monopolies will likely earn a 9 to 10 rate of return on any of its capital spent on that replacement power under this model shareholder owned utilities stand to make a lot of money even if there are less expensive options to expand clean energy where securitization is up with a dubious securitization bill passed in new mexico and a more nuanced one in colorado where else is this policy on the table twenty states already have laws on the books euci reports that power plant securitization laws have been used in several ways in recent years entergy louisiana and entergy gulf states for example sold 1 65 billion in bonds to cover storm costs in the last few years duke energy used 1 3 billion in utility cost recovery bonds to retire its crystal river unit 3 nuclear plant in florida michigan consumers energy used 390 million in securitized bonds to retire a 950 megawatt coal fired plant analysis is underway of how securitization might work for a power plant owned by minnesota power in minnesota bills are pending in kansas and missouri but not expected to pass but with millions of dollars in stranded costs at soon to retire fossil fuel plants and millions more to be made in developing their renewable energy replacements expect securitization to be heard at a state capitol near you further reading ron lehr and mike o boyle have two excellent policy briefs on depreciation

in the last 25 years turkey has carried out and participated in various multibillion dollar energy projects with the goal of diversifying its suppliers and reinforcing its energy infrastructure with regasification facilities as the country s infrastructure developed boosting the storage capacity it has begun to capitalize on the advantage of multiple suppliers be it pipeline producers or liquefied natural gas lng exporters a significant gas importer with 50 billion cubic meters per year turkey therefore has evolved into an attractive gas market for big producers including the u s russia and qatar in an environment where the global gas market is witnessing a glut from the biggest producers turkey is aspiring to benefit from this buyers market where price arbitrage between different markets promises new opportunities for importers in almost all of the recent discussions on turkey s energy security and policies experts cannot help but highlight the fact that the country s gas market is allowing more competition among main exporters since the infrastructure developments including a vast network of pipelines and significant lng facilities grant turkey the benefit of choice a recent meeting jointly organized by the atlantic council turkey turkish policy quarterly tpq and the turkish industry and business association tüsi̇ad last thursday elaborated on the turkish energy market witnessing the turkey launch of the tpq issue on turkey s energy nexus discoveries and development while a significant part of the discussions commended turkey s diversification and liberalization efforts with the trans anatolian natural gas pipeline tanap the biggest part of the southern gas corridor sgc and turkstream pipeline with russia in addition to storage and regasification facilities floating storage and regasification units fsrus its capacity to create a competitive market as an importer was also emphasized turkey s former ambassador to the organization for economic co operation and development oecd mithat rende in his expansive elaboration on the turkish energy developments remarked it is important for turkey to expand its storage capacity and to have more lng because it will improve competitiveness considering the recent rise in turkey s lng imports from the u s rende emphatically stated that turkey will have more lng coming from the north american country which has been enjoying an output spike thanks to the unconventional shale gas rende s statement came as a striking response to the claim of erica olson economic counselor at the u s embassy to turkey that when u s lng imports are concerned market forces and geopolitical forces are coming together pricing will still be very relevant especially for a country like turkey when asian markets remain at a higher level olson said recently though price dynamics have begun to change as asian prices slumped last week and the price spreads between europe and asia shrank to below 50 cents from over 1 earlier in may reducing opportunities for spot trade between the pacific and atlantic basins at the end of april an energy consultancy company stratas advisors reported that for the first time in more than three years the northeast asian spot price has dipped below the dutch ttf marker presenting a new dynamic with changing price dynamics and the increasing availability of more affordable lng in global markets the competition between the dominant producers has grown more fierce the price competition between the u s and russia had already begun when the latter s energy giant gazprom responded to the opening of the lithuania regasification terminal by discounting its gas price by 23 in 2015 although gazprom is still the dominant gas supplier for the european market u s lng exports to the continent surged 272 in the period of july 2018 and march 2019 the european commission said in a press release in early may while the u s became the third largest supplier of lng to the continent europe has emerged as the primary destination of the u s lng in the first quarter of this year a significant detail to emphasize is the fact that turkey became the top importer of u s lng in europe in the first quarter and ranked the eighth largest destination for the cargo carrying the american lng in the said period according to the data of the u s department of energy office of fossil energy u s embassy economic counselor olson later in her discussion emphasized that turkey is already the number one importer of the u s lng in europe and acknowledged we continue to look for ways on how we can do more to increase cooperation between the u s and turkey on lng trends in gas imports data from the energy regulatory market authority emra demonstrated turkey s increasing lng imports accounted for 22 5 of the total 50 3 billion cubic meters of gas the country purchased around 11 32 billion cubic meters of gas in the form of lng last year the data showed furthermore the figure meant that its dependency on oil indexed pipeline gas which is purchased on a long term take or pay basis fell to 77 5 in 2018 from the previous level of 88 in 2017 last year lng imports reached 11 3 billion cubic meters while total gas imports were recorded at 50 3 billion cubic meters 8 8 down from 55 25 billion cubic meters in 2017 the data obtained from the energy watchdog showed as far as lng imports are concerned turkey s two main suppliers are algeria and nigeria which have long term contracts with the state ownedpetroleum pipeline corporation botaş the gas purchases from the spot market have demonstrated a more fluctuating course over the last decade reaching the highest level in 2017 with 4 8 billion cubic meters while qatar ranked first in spot purchases with 1 5 billion cubic meters the u s ranked third having exported 767 5 million cubic meters of gas to turkey turkey recorded the first lng import from the u s in january 2016 with 83 04 million cubic meters of gas making up the 1 54 of the total 5 4 billion cubic meters of gas imports in that period the emra data said aggregate lng imports from the u s in 2016 were calculated at 242 9 million cubic meters and spiked to 767 6 million cubic meters in 2017 in line with the decline in the gas imports lng purchases from the u s fell to 414 2 million cubic meters the compiled data from the emra demonstrated in the first month of this year turkey s gas purchases from the u s saw a sudden spike reaching 460 18 million cubic meters accounting for nearly 8 of the total imports the data of the energy watchdog showed lng imports in january decreased by 6 5 to 5 8 billion cubic meters in february the u s exported 168 million cubic meters of lng to turkey and made up of nearly 4 of the total gas purchases in the month turkey purchased 1 7 billion cubic meters of lng from its suppliers in the second month of the year as turkey expands the share of lng in its gas portfolio the imports of pipeline gas tough still very dominant have been gradually decreasing turkey has started to see declines in the gas imports from russia the main pipeline supplier with a market share of over 50 on average while russia sold approximately 23 6 billion cubic meters of gas to turkey last year its share in the total gas imports declined to 47 according to calculations from the emra data the decline certainly was not irrelevant to the falling gas imports last year in january turkey s gas imports from russia were down 35 compared to the same period of last year falling to 1 8 billion cubic meters russia s share in monthly gas purchases from abroad was 31 6 while monthly gas imports in february were down 20 compared to the same period of last year russia s gas exports to turkey declined by 51 8 to 1 2 billion cubic meters the country s share in the monthly gas imports in february was 28 4 as purchases from the spot lng market increased the installation of two floating storage regasification units fsru one in i̇zmir s aliağa district and the other in hatay s dörtyol district as well as the capacity expansion of the existing terminals allowed turkey to have more lng in its system as a result the lng facilities are capable of regasifying 117 million cubic meters of gas per day the reinforcement of the infrastructure has enabled turkey to multiply its gas suppliers in addition to those who sell gas to the country on long term take or pay contracts with strict destination clauses ambitions for a gas trading hub some of turkey s long term gas contracts will expire in 2021 and the number of gas imports stipulated in those contracts total 15 6 billion cubic meters corresponding to nearly 30 of the annual gas consumption as the country is negotiating the renewal of these gas contracts it looks for more the removal of some strictly binding terms the private sector importers also expect that botaş may transfer some of its import licenses as the market needs for the liberalization moves in order to support the ambition to reinforce the gas trading hub launched by the energy stock exchange epi̇aş in september 2018 with a view to ensuring a daily price mechanism although some scholars and experts claim that turkey does not need to be a gas hub since it is already an important transit route with mega pipelines like tanap and turkstream because they maintain becoming a gas hub does not necessarily bring financial power however melanie kenderdine a nonresident fellow at the atlantic council s global energy center emphasized the benefits of a competitive turkish pricing point in her article entitled the importance of natural gas to turkey s energy and economic future published in the tpq issue on turkey s energy nexus speaking of the advantages of a competitive turkish pricing point and liquid supply source kenderdine emphasized that it could certainly contribute to the national economy and enhance energy security while giving turkey a larger stake in improving regional stability increasing production and promoting low cost infrastructures while turkey has achieved a great deal on the infrastructure side progress toward a turkish natural gas trading hub requires some regulatory and market changes in addition to the continued implementation of market reforms the unbundling of long term contracts held by botaş is also another factor to move toward a gas hub she argued since turkey s pipeline imports are priced on oil the rolling average of pipeline contracts also increased last year a market setting comprised of rising oil prices and the depreciating turkish lira also put an extra burden on the cost of subsidies the creation of a natural gas hub would effectively de link natural gas prices from oil prices removing a significant source of gas price volatility that has little to do with the fundamentals of natural gas market kenderdine wrote turkey s position as an important gas route to europe has been established and will become more prominent with the launch of tanap in this context a natural gas hub kenderdine suggested would also allow turkey to respond to demand from connected european purchasers and to add to the overall global supply
