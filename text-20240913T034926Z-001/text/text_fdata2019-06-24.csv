article 3 months old international jun 24 2019 richard rick mills ahead of the herd as a general rule the most successful man in life is the man who has the best information dancing closer to the exits when americans elect or re elect a president in the fall of 2020 there is a very good chance the closest thing to their hearts their wallets will be top of mind that s because many are predicting the longest running economic expansion in us history is about to slam on the brakes it s been over a decade since the great recession of 2007 09 plunged the world into monetary despair that downturn was particularly bad because it combined an economic slowdown with problems in the financial system rudely exposed by the sub prime mortgage crisis in this article we are asking what is the best indicator for predicting the next recession what does the current data say about a recession economic headwinds we ve become so used to the stock market being in the green we barely notice when the dow nasdaq or s p 500 have a bad day stocks have become like real estate keep buying them because over time they will always go up but key economic indicators are blinking caution for investors us unemployment is at record lows but the job numbers are indicating a shift the country created 75 000 jobs in may well off the expected 185 000 president trump likes to take credit for near full employment but in fact the jobless rate has been falling for several years shown in the fred chart below it reached 10 during the great recession second only to nearly 11 in 1980 and has fallen steadily under the watch of president obama who was first elected in 2008 president for life xi jinping will meet with president trump at the upcoming g 20 to try and make progress on the trade war which is far more serious than a year ago when the first tariffs on aluminum and steel were enacted tariffs now encompass over half of the roughly 500 billion in goods that china exports to the us and almost all american goods imported by china the us has banned large tech companies like intel from doing any more business with huawei one of the world s largest smartphone makers and builder of 5g networks the federal government is pursuing almost two dozen criminal charges against huawei and its chief financial officer over its dealings with us sanctioned iran in retaliation china fined ford 23 6 million for anti trust violations and is investigating fedex for wrongful deliveries automotive news said the country is also threatening to blacklist foreign firms that damage the interests of chinese companies and has warned its citizens against traveling to the us uncertainty over the trade war is having an effect on business leaders who are deferring strategic decisions and in some cases rejigging their supply chains google has already shifted production of its motherboards to taiwan to avoid a 25 tariff and is looking at adding nest thermostats and server hardware taiwan based foxconn which assembles iphone and ipads for apple said it s prepared to move production out of china if necessary on friday prior week morgan stanley reported a rapid deterioration in us business confidence the investment bank s gauge of business conditions fell 32 points last month the biggest drop since the financial crisis orders for durable goods are down and the purchasing managers index pmi of the countries that count are sucking wind wolf street called the us pmi figure of 50 2 the cleanest of the dirty shirts germany japan and china were all lower china s national bureau of statistics published signs of a sluggish economy on friday notably lower industrial output and investment the pmis for us services and manufacturing in may were the worst since recessionary 2009 adding to the sentiment that us economic growth is slowing as for the us federal reserve its board of governors is hinting that a rate cut is being considered as a way to bolster the flagging economy a complete 180 from six months ago when the us central bank was looking at raising interest rates why because the fed is concerned about low global growth especially the chinese economy and disturbing signals that we are heading into a recession 50 years of recessions what is this thing we are calling a recession in a nutshell a recession is what results when an economy stops growing the national bureau of economic research nber is the group entrusted to call the beginning and end dates of a recession nber defines it as a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy lasting more than a few months normally visible in real gdp real income employment industrial production and wholesale retail sales economists agree that a recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of decline in gdp which is the total value of all goods and services a country produces results from a recent poll showed nearly half of cfos surveyed expect to see negative growth by the second quarter of 2020 two thirds of economists predict a recession by the end of 2020 citing trade policy as the greatest risk while another 10 believe the contraction will start this year jeffrey gundlach the so called bond king is equally bearish on the economy he puts the odds of a us recession within the next six months at 40 50 and 65 over the next year marketwatch reports marko kolanovic jp morgan s chief quant strategist saying that president donald trump s trade battles have cost u s companies trillions and could trigger a downturn that would end up being known as the trump recession if the above mentioned analysts and surveys are right and a recession is around the corner it would be extremely helpful to know what are the signs also one shouldn t get lulled into thinking that because we ve enjoyed a decade of strong growth that the next slowdown will be gradual or soft history proves otherwise expansions don t die they re killed there s an old saying in economics that expansions don t die of old age meaning there is always an event or sometimes more than one that causes a long period of economic growth to end investopedia does a nice job of naming the causes all the us recessions going back to the roosevelt recession of 1937 38 unfortunately it skips the great recession widely known to be caused by a housing crisis in the us due to sub prime mortgages which resulted in a credit squeeze bank failures and subsequent government bailouts we learn the main triggers for the last three recessions before 2007 09 were in reverse chronological order the pop of the dot com bubble and 9 11 attacks 9 11 recession iraq s invasion of kuwait causing the oil price to spike gulf war recession 1990 91 and the regime change in iran which also caused an energy crisis iran energy crisis recession 1981 82 forcing the us to invoke drastic fiscal tightening culminating in an interest rate spike to 21 5 in fact investopedia reveals the common factor throughout nearly all us recessions is oil market turbulence a sudden increase in the price of crude oil has preceded nine out of 10 post wwii recessions energy prices let s get back to basics most recessions nine of the last 10 are caused by energy crises not surprising considering our dependence on fossil fuels while the amount of renewable energy capacity is increasing every year global consumption of energy is still dominated by fossil fuels and hydro electric power the latter require the construction and upgrading of dams itself a fossil fuel intensive endeavor oil price shocks send ripples through the canadian and american economies since both are significant oil producers for example at the end of 1998 crude oil was priced at just 11 a barrel by late 2000 it had tripled to 34 bbl high oil prices combined with the dot com crash and enron resulted in the 2000 2001 recession an oil price shock puts pressure on other prices to increase like transportation costs which hikes inflation businesses put expansions and hiring on hold or lay people off gradually gdp growth slows unemployment rises as does the cost of living costs are rising but the dollar is worth less people have less to invest or invest more conservatively moving their money out of stocks and into safe havens like bonds foreign currencies and precious metals sustained selling crushes the stock market a recession ensues oil prices shaded areas are recessions yield curve in a typical healthy market the yield curve shows lower returns on short term investments and higher yields on long term investments more importantly yield curve inversion has come before every recession since world war ii the yield curve between long term and short term treasury note yields has been inverted since may 23 in other words short term yields like the three month one year and three year treasury notes turned higher than long term yields that s unusual because it means bond investors prefer to park their money in bonds that will pay them back their money plus interest in one month to three years versus investing in a bond with a term of 10 to 30 years in which case they would demand a higher yield for tying up their money so long a yield curve inversion shows low confidence in the long term performance of the us economy among bond investors however on monday last yields jumped the 10 year treasury is at 2 101 and the three year yield at 1 815 as i write the market is focused on the federal reserve s meeting on wednesday when it will announce its interest rate policy investors are anticipating the fed to hold its overnight lending rate the interest rate at which banks loan money to one another unchanged at this meeting and possibly signal a cut to the federal funds rate later in the summer remember up until monday the yield curve was inverted showing a negative spread between long term and short term t bill yields meaning investors had more confidence in short term than long term bonds yield curve inversion oil prices so far we know that yield curve inversions are a very strong indicator of a coming recession all of the post wwii recessions except two were preceded by an inversion we also know that nine out of the last 10 recessions saw oil prices spike immediately or very close before the recession at ahead of the herd we decided to compare two charts the historical price of oil and historical yield curve inversions to see if there is any correlation in fact the two charts match very closely the first chart below shows all the yield curve inversions from the last 50 years along with the recessions that followed the gray bars the second chart is the historical price of west texas intermediate wti the north american crude oil benchmark the u s yield curve steepness chart below courtesy of jp morgan asset management is very interesting it shows when the yield curve inverts a recession is very likely to follow on average 14 months after the point when the curve inverts ie the curve goes under the horizontal line demarcating 0 this has been the case for the last 50 years oil prices as an article in advisor perspective reports this yield curve recession indicator is so reliable it cannot be argued author erik conley writes i don t know of any economists who dispute this assertion history is history and not theory taking a look at the chart there was a recession every time after the yield curve inverted for the last 56 years except for two times when there was an inversion without a recession how s that for odds now take a look at the oil price chart reproduced here for easy comparison in all of the recessions there was a preceding oil price spike for example before the oil crisis recession of 1973 75 the inversion occurred in 1973 and continued to fall to 2 as the fed tightened short term rates to try and tame inflation caused by spending on the vietnam war during this period oil prices tripled beginning with the opec oil embargo in 1973 interest rates or the 1990 91 gulf war recession the yield curve inverted in 1989 about a year before the recession caused by iraq invading kuwait whose actions threatened more oil price shocks began oil was gradually rising from 1985 to 1990 when it makes a rapier like slash up to nearly 80 a barrel from around 25 bbl the financial crisis of 2007 09 is even more demonstrative of the connection here we had the inversion occurring in 2006 which few people recognized as a daunting signal to sell their stocks the recession began in the fall of 2007 and by 2010 the spread between short and long term t bill yields had grown to about 2 5 meanwhile wti made an incredible run in a very short time from under 20 bbl in 1998 to an all time high of 163 80 in 2008 finally consider that the two times the yield curve didn t go into recession it was when the oil price was dropping comparing the two charts for the last time look at the red dots in 1966 and 1998 these inversion point anomalies ie happening without a recession coming an average 14 months later occur when the price of oil is falling no recession to us being the keep it simple kind of folks we are this proves 1 that yield curve inversions are excellent recession indicators basically acting as energy price spike warnings and 2 that energy prices can both start recessions and prevent them housing market a lot of forecasters consider the housing market to be a reliable indicator of a coming recession economist edward e leamer declared in 2007 that housing is the business cycle recessions are considered part of the business cycle along with expansions and contractions a statement he was proven right on when the housing crisis that presaged the great recession began that same year according to the st louis fed housing downturns have preceded every post war recession warning signals include rising mortgage rates a dip in home sales and lower house prices we would expect housing starts to be a good predictor of a recession since they signal the confidence of home builders in financing projects and being willing to sell them to eager home buyers if developers and builders think a recession is coming they are unlikely to take on new work the st louis fed research found a strong recession indicator in lower housing starts for the last four months before each downturn began it refers to this scenario as a housing starts inversion if a housing starts inversion occurs there is around a 50 likelihood that a recession will start in the next three months not bad odds u s homebuilding starts fell in may dropping 0 9 to 1 269 million units but data for the prior two months was revised higher high household debt we re going to go a little out on a limb here in presenting our next recession predictor unsustainable household debt in 2015 the federal reserve started raising interest rates thinking the economy was making a full recovery following the great recession but as we ve pointed out it was a false recovery based on a very shaky foundation still in 2018 it was hard to argue with 4 1 growth in gdp during the second quarter the fed continued their raises predicting four more in 2019 now they ve changed their tune with gdp growth falling and all the other aforementioned economic storm clouds blowing in rate increases are off the table and we are now looking at another rate cut maybe even reprising the infamous quantitative easing qe it would be the first rise since 2015 and the stock market businesses and consumers would all love it if the economy is faltering and with the fed having raised interest rates from close to 0 in 2015 to the current 2 5 we should expect consumer spending to tank in fact this is not what we are seeing it s true people are buying less houses but they are lining up to spend on just about everything else how do we explain this rash of spending people are making purchases on credit consumer spending makes up 68 of the us economy if most businesses are doing well and they appear to be from the statistics employees should theoretically have more to spend on goods and services people are keeping their jobs and their wages are going up this in fact is what we find the balance reports that consumer spending increased by 1 2 in the first quarter of this year and notes that strong consumer spending is the main reason the gdp growth rate has been within the 2 3 healthy range since the great recession consumer spending has gone up steadily since the first quarter of 2018 when it was 12 7 trillion to 13 trillion in q1 2019 us car sales have leapt from 16 4 million in april to 17 3 million in may consumer spending that got me curious as to where people are finding the money to spend 13 trillion in the first quarter the answer appears to be uncle visa a bloomberg article reports that us credit card debt skyrocketed to 870 billion in 2018 a new record revolving credit americans have more money in their bank accounts but what they make they re spending maxing out their credit cards and dumping balances on lines of credit the us savings rate skidded from 7 5 last december to 6 2 in april it s a far cry from the parsimonious americans of 1975 who put away a record 17 3 of their income freedom 55 forget about it most workers in the us will be toiling away at their work stations into their golden years marketwatch reported on friday that the gap between what people should have socked away for retirement and what they actually have was 28 trillion in 2015 it only gets worse by 2050 that number is expected to swell to 137 trillion according to the world economic forum or a 3 trillion increase in the gap every year canadians like to think of themselves as less materialistic than americans but in fact what we see is canucks heading to the malls and giving their credit card numbers to e commerce platforms with reckless abandon wolfstreet com reports that despite rock bottom interest rates and the highest ever disposable income the percentage that canadian households spend paying principal and interest on mortgages and other debts reached 14 9 in the first quarter matching the record reached in 2017 in canada debt to disposable income was a whopping 175 in 2018 one of the highest rates in the world and rising versus 103 in the us and falling why are us debt levels coming down wolfstreet notes that a lot of home owners defaulted on their mortgages and credit cards after the financial crisis which skewed the numbers another issue is the fear factor of getting too far into debt a lot of americans are gun shy of holding uncomfortably high mortgages knowing that is what caused the great recession they have watched interest rates climb and they don t want to be saddled with higher payments wolfstreet adds that continued low interest rates have created two of the world s biggest housing bubbles in vancouver and toronto many torontonians and vancouverites have such large mortgages that even a small rate increase would make monthly payments a hardship they are truly debt slaves to the banks like household debt government debt is getting more and more unsustainable the problem for the central bank as it considers how it will handle interest rates at its next federal open market committee meeting is how to stimulate the economy and trigger real economic growth rather than just creating asset bubbles in corporate debt and financial markets in february the us national debt hit a record 22 trillion according to npr that means over the next 10 years annual federal deficits are expected to average 1 2 trillion which is 4 4 of gdp much higher than the 2 9 average over the past 50 years snatching defeat from the jaws of victory donald trump rolled into the white house on a promise to drain the swamp in washington of corruption and to put the pedal to the metal on america s economy by bringing back jobs lost to out sourcing and tearing up horrible trade deals not only with the us s strongest competitor china but its so called friends as well like canada and the eu it came apparent a few weeks into his term that trump would be a do er not a thinker in december 2017 his administration passed new legislation implementing 1 5 trillion of corporate and individual tax cuts by the following summer the effects of those cuts started to be felt in the economy although they mostly benefited corporations due to billions of profits that were repatriated from overseas and plowed into stock buybacks nonetheless the 4 2 quarterly growth in gdp was real and something trump could crow about since becoming president in 2017 trump has consistently bragged about the stock market bull that despite pulling back last fall continues to run he s even said that if he loses the 2020 election the stock market will crash same with impeachment the trump economy is setting records and has a long way up to go however if anyone but me takes over in 2020 i know the competition very well there will be a market crash the likes of which has not been seen before keep america great trump tweeted saturday the truth is that trump has very little to do with the strength in the us economy in fact one could argue the economy has done well despite his economic leadership as the chart below shows gross domestic product was growing when obama was elected for a second term in 2016 however even obama s charm couldn t stop the economy from sliding to just 1 9 growth in 2016 when trump was inaugurated in january 2017 it was at 1 8 then jumped to 3 by july between july 2017 and january 2018 it was all downhill the spike to 4 2 the following july was short lived six months later growth had slumped to 2 2 and it now sits at 3 1 us gdp all trump had to do was sit back and do nothing maybe get into a regular golf routine with his buddies at mar a logo and the economy would have hummed along just fine instead we have the tweeter in chief picking fights with all his trading partners passing a massive tax cut that benefited the wealthy and corporations thus exacerbating the divide between rich and poor putting america s exorbitant privilege in jeopardy by snubbing its allies and forcing them into the arms of the enemy as mexico has indicated by holding high level talks with china the dollar is under threat as the reserve currency italy has joined china s belt and road initiative trump refused to shake hands with angela merkel and is now threatening to slap tariffs on auto imports from the eu but the scariest part in all of this is what could happen in iran after two oil tankers were recently attacked in the strait of hormuz trump and his secretary of state mike pompeo were quick to blame iran as the culprit whether or not that s true america going to war with iran right now would be very bad news for the economy let s consider the likely fallout of an attack on ships in the extremely narrow and shallow strait of hormuz over a third of the world s oil flows through the strait if there s war iran will close this vital choke point now the sudden tightening of oil supplies similar to what happened in the 1970s would immediately push up the price of crude interest rates would rise further damaging business confidence and putting the squeeze on corporate and consumer borrowing the dollar would plummet making imported goods more expensive americans standard of living would fall as costs stay the same or become inflated along with energy prices but the dollar is worth less the us dollar s already questionable exorbitant privilege of being the world s reserve currency would come into sharper focus trade in gold and other safe havens besides us treasuries would increase the guardian reminds us of the fragile state the world economy is in having not fully recovered from the financial crisis of 2008 and getting slammed by tariffs thereby slowing down growth imagine what 80 100 or 140 barrel oil could do the global economy is struggling to regain momentum after the tit for tat trade tariff battles initiated by the trump administration a slowdown in trade over the past 18 months and a collapse in investment spending will push down gdp growth to 2 6 this year after several years above 3 the world bank said in its most recent forecast fears of a slowdown in the demand for oil are one of the main factors keeping a lid on prices at the moment if a deal was struck between the us and china when the two countries presidents meet in june one that prevents an escalation of the trade war economic prospects would receive a boost higher global demand and further tanker bombings in the gulf would probably push oil prices back up towards 80 as we have proven oil price spikes are nearly 100 correlated to recessions right now we also have the other recession indicators we ve outlined yield curve inversion real 10 year yields high levels of indebtedness low housing sales etc it wouldn t take much like a war with iran to tip the boat over in fact the only thing that appears to be keeping the current economy from falling into recession is low oil prices and that is precisely what trump s threats on iran are putting at risk ever the bully trump is literally snatching defeat from the jaws of victory concerning the us economy real yield correlation the federal reserve bank of st louis looked at all the post war recessions that the yield curve had predicted then they compared the 10 year treasury yield at the precise beginning of inversion to the length of the subsequent recession taking into account two variables the duration of the recession and the unemployment rate the results were astonishing lower real rates 10 year yields minus inflation at the onset of a recession correlated with worse downturns what s the connection according to the researchers there is a clear correlation between real interest rates and the severity of a recession the lower the real interest rate the longer a recession that follows a yield curve inversion the real 10 year rate also tracks unemployment suggesting there may be causation between real rates and economic output low levels of real interest rates capture early warnings of future slowdown in economic growth the report said in other words the lower the real 10 year bond yield the more likely it is that the economy will go into recession lower real rates at the point of yield curve inversion also correspond to longer recessions extrapolating that idea to the current data points to an ominous result from the graph below the current real 10 year yield nominal rate minus 1 8 inflation is 0 35 which would plot the vertical line far to the left of where it was in september 1978 during the worst post war recession that means the next recession if the correlation holds true and the real 10 year rate doesn t change much is likely to last longer than 32 months and be characterized by more than 4 5 unemployment in an article on project syndicate nouriel roubini says a severe enough shock could usher in a global recession even if central banks respond rapidly after all in 2007 2009 the fed and other central banks reacted aggressively to the shocks that triggered the global financial crisis but they did not avert the great recession today the fed is starting with a benchmark policy rate of 2 25 2 5 compared to 5 25 in september 2007 in europe and japan central banks are already in negative rate territory and will face limits on how much further below the zero bound they can go and with bloated balance sheets from successive rounds of quantitative easing qe central banks would face similar constraints if they were to return to large scale asset purchases on the fiscal side most advanced economies have even higher deficits and more public debt today than before the global financial crisis leaving little room for stimulus spending and financial sector bailouts will be intolerable in countries with resurgent populist movements and near insolvent governments conclusion what pushes the us into recession war with iran or anything else that causes an oil price spike this article started with the question which is the best indicator for predicting a recession we presented five it should be clear by now that while the other four indicators have some bearing on whether we enter a recessionary downturn it is energy prices that are the underpinning of our entire global economic system mess around too much with oil prices and the fallout will be immediate and likely severe that goes for both dramatic oil price jumps and death defying falls the health of the world economy is predicated on oil prices somewhere north of 50 a barrel and south of 100 bbl the yield curve is the most reliable recession indicator it has shown remarkable ability to predict energy caused recessions we ve proved this graphically and it makes sense the global economy still runs on fossil fuels only 9 3 of global electricity generation excluding hydro in 2018 was from renewables we normally think of the price of energy that keeps an economy in check when oil and natural gas prices are too high businesses that depend on those fuels get hit passing their higher costs onto consumers and in 2014 when the oil price crashed consumer and businesses were happy but it was governments that suffered in terms of depreciated currencies and a big hit to resource revenues but what if we thought about it a different way right now energy prices are low so the economy should be humming along but it s not we ve outlined all the negative indicators showing signs of a sick patient of an economy lower energy costs are like the iv hooked up to that patient they are keeping it alive raise oil prices now and the economy will be in for a shock interest rates will go up employment will crash housing starts will crash and the level of consumer debt will take on a whole new meaning consumer spending is 70 of the us economy the economic patient may even stop breathing the equivalent of gdp growth stopping and go into a recessionary coma predicting a recession is hard if anyone is able to do it they would surely deserve a pulitzer prize in economics as retail investors we obviously don t know if it s to be war with iran or not but we know what happens if it occurs having this knowledge can help

overview the trump xi meeting at the g20 this coming weekend and heightened tensions in the gulf with the us set to impose new sanctions on iran s crippled economy are keeping investors on edge news the opposition won the re do of the istanbul mayoral election has lifted the turkish lira most of the major asia pacific equity markets including the nikkei shanghai composite the kospi and australia s asx were modestly higher while europe s dow jones stoxx 600 was a little heavier but looking for direction us shares are trading with a firmer bias in europe asia pacific benchmark 10 year yields pushed higher but european bonds have continued their bull run led by italy s four basis points decline to 2 10 a new low and 15 bp drop in greece to 2 35 the us 10 year yield that dipped below 2 0 in the middle of last week before closing the week at 2 05 is a touch lower at 2 04 the us dollar is sporting a softer profile against most of the major currencies but the japanese yen which is little changed most emerging market currencies led by the 1 3 rally in the turkish lira are mostly firmer the chinese yuan is an exception it is fractionally lower with the dollar a little below cny6 88 before the weekend it briefly traded near cny6 8350 its lowest level in over a month oil and gold are extending pre weekend gains asia pacific the focus is on trump s meeting with xi at the g20 meeting later this week and if trade talks between the two largest economies can resume we suspect the most that can be reasonably hoped for is another tariff truce and a new attempt to work out an agreement however the us is going forward adding more companies involved with china s supercomputer work to the blacklist preventing us companies from selling or buying from them at the same time trump s trade adviser navarro reiterated the president s claim that china is paying for the tariffs by which it seems he means through lower demand for their products weaker exports and encouraging businesses to relocate out of china navarro also claimed that china is weakening the yuan to offset the tariffs which most observers including ourselves dispute the us is also in trade negotiations with japan reports suggest japan is pressing the us to eliminate its agriculture barriers including rice and beef this is a twist in the plot as the us has been pressing japan to grant the us the same terms on agriculture trade that were granted japan s partners in the tpp and with europe the market appears to have discounted around an 80 chance that the reserve bank of australia cuts its cash rate target to a record low of 1 0 next week this has not stopped the australian dollar from extending its rally for the fifth consecutive session today which appears to be the longest rally since the end of 2017 today s spark may have been comments from the central bank governor lowe who recognized the limitations of monetary policy that said the market is pricing in another cut after next week s anticipated move in q4 the aussie and kiwi are the strongest of the majors through the european morning gaining about a third of a cent against the us dollar after stalling near 0 6935 in the last two sessions the australian dollar has been bid to 0 6960 before steadying initial support is seen near last week s highs which also corresponds to the 20 day moving average the bottoming pattern that has been carved provides an initial target near 0 7000 0 7030 the dollar is trapped in a 20 range against the yen jpy107 30 jpy107 50 expiring options 370 mln at jpy107 and 1 3 bln at jpy107 50 may help continue to curtail the price action that said the intraday technicals favor the greenback s upside and the jpy108 area offers more formidable resistance europe a disappointing german ifo survey did not prevent the euro from extending its recent gains to approached 1 14 for the first time in three months the ifo survey showed that the current assessment edged slightly higher 100 8 from a revised 100 7 initially 100 6 a two year low but the expectations component continued to deteriorate 94 2 from a revised 95 2 initially 95 3 in february the ifo expectations reached a seven year low of 94 0 the overall assessment of the business climate fell to a new five year low of 97 4 in june the head of the ifo himself was pessimistic warning that there were no green shoots in manufacturing and the economy was headed for the doldrums personal problems of johnson is threatening to undermine his bid to become the new tory party leader in one survey the daily mail showed johnson slipping behind hunt while another sunday telegraph showed johnson holding on to a lead it will take a better part of the next month for the tory rank and file to vote both johnson and hunt brexit strategies are predicated on re negotiating the withdrawal agreement with the eu even in the ec was willing to do this which it is not it gives the next leader assuming he can survive a vote of confidence three months best ahead of the october 31 deadline the opposition candidate imamoglu won for the second time to become mayor of istanbul president erdogan who was born in istanbul resisted the results of the march election and won the re do but his candidate lost the election again many see this as a decline of erdogan s broader support turkey s stocks advanced by about 2 its 10 year bond yield is off around 55 bp to almost 15 25 and the lira has gained 1 against the dollar try5 7560 after seeing try5 7130 earlier the risk is that the market may be getting ahead of itself erdogan will not be deterred by the results and the confrontation with the us over the planned deployment of a russian anti aircraft system is not over the euro is flirting with the upper bollinger band two standard

indicated it will support iran and help it overcome us sanctions china is thought to be circumventing the us embargo against iran for gas and possibly oil as well meanwhile many are concerned that the us public admission will spur an escalation of cyberwarfare and are concerned in particular that iran will strike back in some fashion the us sees the dallas fed manufacturing survey the empire state and philly fed surveys for june disappointed suggesting the us economy lost some momentum as q2 winds down the chicago fed s national activity survey may is likely to remain in negative territory where it has been in three of the first four months of the year through april it averaged 0 295 in the same period last year it averaged 0 285 tomorrow fed chairman powell speaks as do four other fed officials the market has a 25 bp cut fully discounted but the pricing of the fed funds futures contracts suggest that nearly a 30 chance of a 50 bp cut is priced in and that is where we suspect powell s comments will impact he is unlikely to show the kind of urgency that is consistent with a 50 bp move the canadian and mexican economic calendars are sparse the us dollar is trading inside the pre weekend range against the canadian dollar which was inside the previous session s range illustrating the consolidative tone initial resistance is seen around cad1 3230 support is pegged near cad1 3150 but cad1 3100 is likely stronger the mexican peso is little changed and also is in a consolidative mode the dollar spiked to almost mxn18 89 last week the day after the fed s statement and reached mxn19 16 ahead of the weekend the mxn19 20 area may be sticky without a recovery today it will be the second consecutive close of the dollar index below its 200 day moving average 96 65 since april

with the eurozone economy stuck in a low growth low inflation and low rates environment it s really hard not to make japanification comparisons if we re honest the eurozone is probably already in the thick of it which means rates are likely to remain lower for longer and every new crisis or recession will bring the bloc closer to more japanification a brief history of japan s lost decades japan s first crisis the roots of japan s subdued economic performance can be traced back as far as the late 1980s in september 1985 following the plaza accord an agreement by japan the united states france west germany and the uk to depreciate the us dollar against the japanese yen and the german deutsche mark the japanese yen appreciated sharply being highly export oriented japan s exports and gdp growth dropped considerably in 1986 because of the deteriorating economy to stop speculative capital inflows and limit the yen s appreciation the bank of japan lowered interest rates from 5 to 2 5 between january 1986 and february 1987 furthermore fiscal packages were compiled in september 1985 and may 1987 to support the economy although the economy rebounded significantly in the second quarter of 1987 the central bank kept its policy rate at 2 5 until may 1989 fuelled by a mixture of declining lending standards financial regulation in the years before low interest rates cheap money and the belief that the only way was up japanese stock and real estate prices grew at a staggering speed towards the end of 1986 and until 1990 pushing the nikkei index from 13 000 points to an all time high of 39 000 points in december 1989 the lending standards of banks became more cautious in may 1989 the central bank raised interest rates from 2 5 to 6 in just 16 months as it became concerned about asset price increases banks lending behaviour and upward pressure on prices at the beginning of 1990 stock prices started to decline with the yen depreciating and long term yields increasing however the boj kept raising rates until august 1990 also in the wake of the gulf war leading to an increase in oil prices subsequently the lending standards of banks became more cautious money supply growth decelerated sharply and the pace of economic growth started to slow when the stock market and real estate bubble started to burst in 1990 and 1991 the japanese banking sector faced a pile of non performing loans with japan s corporate sector being characterised by excess debt according to the imf s systemic banking crises database japan s non performing loans npls peaked at 35 of total loans during the banking crisis a level which neither greece nor italy reached during the european sovereign debt crisis however the magnitude was not immediately recognised and authorities were slow in reacting only in the second half of the 1990s when large institutions started to fail the full extent became visible meanwhile the bank of japan was quite brave with introducing new monetary policy measures beyond textbook knowledge in october 1999 the interest rate was lowered to zero and zirp zero interest rate policy was born japan s central bank started to use quantitative easing policies back in 2001 setting the outstanding balance of current accounts at the bank as the operating target but the monetary stimulus didn t result in higher inflation as the authorities had waited too long before taking decisive action initially the boj had raised rates during the burst instead of lowering them and it was only in 1999 a comprehensive disclosure requirement for bad loans was put in place japan s low inflation seems to be more structural japan s low inflation seems to be more structural causing low interest rates for which numerous factors can be cited research has identified factors like the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates public attitudes toward the price level central bank communication weaker growth expectations coupled with declining potential growth or the lower natural rate of interest risk averse banking behaviours deregulation in the distribution chain and the rise of emerging economies as possible factors depressing inflation the federal reserve bank of st louis 2018 adds to that technological progress globalisation and demographic transitions another factor weighing on inflation might actually be deleveraging after the bursting of the bubble the private sector deleveraged cutting borrowing and spending japan s main policy rate and inflation eurozone s lessons from japan the same causes or only similarities by now an environment of low inflation has also reached the eurozone it probably is structurally low inflation driven by globalisation and digitalisation however the question is whether japan specific factors can help to explain the current low growth and low inflation situation or whether the eurozone and japan are only experiencing similar external factors savings glut central bank credibility globalisation the 1990s and 2000s saw a general decline in inflation and interest rate levels which go beyond japanification but right now the eurozone is showing similarities with japan of the early 1990s a financial crisis turns into an economic crisis which then turns into a banking crisis and finally into an existential crisis leveraging and deleveraging in fact the eurozone s development between 2009 and 2018 has a high degree of japanification government debt increased by more than 25 gdp in japan during the bust period of the 1990s while in the eurozone on average it increased by some 20 of gdp credit to households on the back of loose monetary policies increased by 7 gdp in the eurozone and by around 9 in japan at the same time however credit to the corporate sector increased more significantly in the eurozone 20 gdp than in japan 6 gdp in fact the eurozone s development between 2009 and 2018 has a high degree of japanification government debt increased by more than 25 gdp

and the european central bank behaved similarly during the crisis years the boj didn t only cut rates to the zero bound in 1999 it cut interest rates by 600bp in the 1990s while the ecb cut rates by 425 bp however the ecb started to use its balance sheet extensively as a policy instrument earlier than the boj the bank of japan and the european central bank behaved similarly during the crisis

as a policy instrument earlier than the boj financial sector both japanese and eurozone banks accumulated a huge pile of non performing loans during the crisis years with japan s npl ratio at 8 4 in 2001 and the eurozone s npl ratio at 8 1 during the height of the sovereign debt crisis in 2012 in both countries the financial sector had to be supported by large capital injections both japanese and eurozone banks accumulated a huge pile of non performing loans during the crisis years with japan s npl ratio at 8 4 in 2001 and the eurozone s npl ratio at 8 1 during the height of the sovereign debt crisis in 2012 in both countries the financial sector had to be supported by large capital injections demographic change an often mentioned structural factor for the slowdown of japan is ageing in fact japan s working age population aged 15 64 has been on a declining trend since the mid 1990s while the population as a whole started to decline from 2011 onwards although the eurozone still has some breathing room the working age population is also on a declining trend since 2009 so why should we care because of the next downturn while japan s experiences in the 1990s were engraving they are not enough to explain japan s prolonged subdued economic growth environment up until today timing was not on its side the recovery of the japanese economy was thrown back by three major events the asian crisis in 1997 1998 the dot com bubble burst in 2000 2001 and finally and most importantly the global financial crisis of 2008 2009 whenever it looked as if the japanese economy had finally bottomed out the next external shock came along with the economy growing by 1 8 on average between 2003 and 2005 the japanese central bank cautiously raised its main interest rate in july 2006 by 25 basis points to 50 basis points in september 2008 but then the financial crisis hit and the hiking cycle was over before it really began gdp growth in japan and inflation this is an important lesson for the eurozone the next crisis can always be just around the corner without a strong recovery it is difficult to escape the low growth low inflation and subsequently low rates environment an economic upturn could quickly be over and monetary policy might not have enough ammunition up its sleeve with interest rates remaining stuck at the zero lower bound for years to come japan s central bank hasn t raised main interest rate more than 50 basis points for over 24 years now and still has the largest central bank balance sheet measured as a percentage of gdp compared to the us and the eurozone so for the eurozone the most important lesson is probably not so much the root cause of japanification but the desperate attempts to get out it what are the developments the eurozone could be facing soon deleveraging of the private sector over the last ten years the balance sheet problems of financial institutions and non financial corporations have been one of the most important factors keeping the economy subdued for a long period of time prolonging the subdued inflation environment both credit to corporates and households have actually shrunk over the last ten years the balance sheet problems of financial institutions and non financial corporations have been one of the most important factors keeping the economy subdued for a long period of time prolonging the subdued inflation environment both credit to corporates and households have actually shrunk ballooning of central bank balance sheet over the last ten years the balance sheet of the boj has increased by more than 75 of gdp in the eurozone the ecb s balance sheet is currently some 18 of gdp bigger than in 2009 over the last ten years the balance sheet of the boj has increased by more than 75 of gdp in the eurozone the ecb s balance sheet is currently some 18 of gdp bigger than in 2009 fiscal policy to the rescue over the last ten years japanese government debt increased from 183 gdp in 2008 to 236 in 2018 the fiscal budget has been running deficits for 26 years implementing countless fiscal packages to stimulate the economy over the last ten years japanese government debt increased from 183 gdp in 2008 to 236 in 2018 the fiscal budget has been running deficits for 26 years implementing countless fiscal packages to stimulate the economy higher retirement ages while there has been a drop in the working age population of people aged 15 to 64 older employees and women have remained in or joined the workforce in japan employment in japan has actually been growing for seven years as the effective retirement age has moved up to close 70 also robotics and automation is well advanced in japan keeping gdp per capita at high levels all of this means that the expected wage price spiral as a result of a shrinking labour force has never happened important lesson for the eurozone without these developments or measures stagnation could easily turn into stagflation economic developments in japan and the eurozone mean values over respective periods why japanification might be worse for the eurozone than for japan having said all of this japanification doesn t have to be a bad thing instead it is rather a description of the state of an economy despite japan s prolonged period of subdued economic performance the economy is still the third largest in terms of nominal gdp and is one of the most innovative and digitally conscious economies in the world and thanks to the government s fiscal packages japan continues to enjoy a modern and well maintained infrastructure at the same time however japan is also a relatively homogenous society on the contrary in the heterogeneous eurozone political tensions within and between countries might rise given differing interests economic developments and the controversial use of fiscal policies among members making forward looking reforms more important than ever particularly the discussion about the role of fiscal policy in attempts to stabilise or kick start the economy clearly have the potential for greater conflicts in the eurozone than in japan for the eurozone the lessons from the future from japanification are more important than the lessons from the past the japanese experiences show that it will be very hard to actually escape a low growth and low inflation environment without reverting to loose fiscal policies and policies aimed at increasing productivity growth for the ecb this means that even looking beyond the short term horizon with economic and trade uncertainties the possibility of fed rate cuts and the ecb s easing bias there will not be much room for rate hikes in the coming years main interest rates eurozone japan read the original analysis the eurozone s japanification more to come

last week marked a significant turning point for the for the first time since jerome powell became chair of the federal reserve the central bank is thinking about easing the us dollar was decimated as the market turned to discounting a rate cut in july the trade weighted dollar index dropped to its lowest level in three months and hit levels last seen in january the currencies that benefited the most were the and dollars however interestingly the trailed behind as the prospect of additional easing reduces the currency s appeal in many ways the fed has doomed the greenback but how much it rises or falls will depend on many factor we got a taste of that in this week s trade where the dovish monetary policies of the reserve bank of australia and european central bank caused the aussie and to trail behind in the week ahead there are very few market moving economic reports in the us calendar but there are many major political stories that could ignite big moves in currencies most of them center on the end of week g20 summit but investors should also keep an eye on iran us president donald trump called off a strike 10 minutes before it was set to happen but they could come up with another strategy to retaliate to iran s shooting of an unmanned drone in international waters as for the g20 if trade talks between the us and china are rekindled it ll lead to a relief rally for usd

resistance 108 50 us dollar traders brace for 2019 easing thanks to the fed the short term pullback in the us dollar has now turned into a long term top there s widespread support inside the central bank for not one but possibly two interest rate cuts this year considering that the fed still maintained a hawkish bias in march and a large subset of traders were skeptical of even one 25bp rate cut this year the possibility of 50bp of easing sent the dollar crashing through support levels traders were caught completely off guard as they never expected the fed to be as dovish as other central banks unemployment is low and stocks at record highs but the fed could no longer ignore the slowdown in global growth and inflation at first they felt that the impact would be temporary but they re now worried about the broader effect on the economy so much so that eight members see the need for a rate cut this year with seven forecasting two cuts back in march no one saw the need for easing these changes alone justify a prolonged sell off in the greenback but traders need to be selective about the currencies they choose to buy versus the dollar usd jpy is the most sensitive to headline risk if us president donald trump and chinese president xi jinping reach a trade deal we ll see usd jpy trade back up to 109 but if the talks fail to take a positive turn the combination of continued trade tensions and a dovish fed will allow usd jpy to slip down to 105 while euro sterling and aussie are benefiting from us dollar weakness they re the least attractive currencies to buy because their central banks are also actively thinking about easing sterling on the other hand will be hampered by ongoing brexit uncertainty the canadian dollar and swiss franc are the most appealing but the new zealand dollar could also be attractive if the reserve bank suggests that they have no immediate plans for a follow up move to their rate cut in may at the same time we feel that the market is overly dovish in their expectations for a july rate cut fed chair powell still had good things to say about the economy including the labour market which he described as strong he downplayed the urgency to ease and made it clear that they re in wait and see mode he said that they expect to learn a lot more about the risks in the near term and if data or the risk picture worsens they have enough support within the central bank to ease quickly while it won t take much to push them to action they ll still wait for one or two months of disappointing cpi or nfp numbers the record breaking moves in stocks buy them time but not for long all of this means we could see a near term dollar bounce particularly given the lack of market moving us data in this week s calendar but the broader trend for the dollar will be lower if you missed the fed meeting here re the six main things you need to know about this month s fed gathering fed leaves interest rates unchanged and drops the word patient from policy statement for the first time dot plot signals interest rate cut eight out of 17 members see rate cut this year seven of those favor two rate cuts fed is worried that inflation

three of the commodity currencies are benefiting from the sell off in the us dollar and we could see a stronger recovery in the aussie in the coming days recent comments by the trump administration boosted optimism for cooler trade tensions which should benefit the aussie and kiwi we won t know until the weekend if the talks between presidents trump and xi went well but in the lead up we expect to see further profit taking on short aud usd positions there are no major australian or chinese economic reports to threaten the rally so there s plenty of upside potential for the currency the new zealand dollar on the other hand will take its cue from the reserve bank s meeting last time they cut interest rates by 25bp the decision took nzd usd to a six month low but the drop didn t last because the central bank suggested that they were one and done since then we haven t seen a clear trend in new zealand s economy the latest gdp numbers were strong and service sector activity is up manufacturing activity inflation and spending are lower but that may not be enough to convince the rbnz that another rate cut is needed there s no doubt that the global economy is weakening and it d be remiss for the rbnz to not express concerns but how the new zealand dollar responds will depend on how aggressive the rbnz thinks they need to be about easing if they feel that another preventive rate cut is needed nzd usd will reverse its gains quickly but if they leave most of their policy statement unchanged nzd usd could hit 67 cents easily in the coming days the canadian dollar should start to underperform canada has been one of the strongest economies and in many ways still is but after last week s disappointing retail sales report the cracks are beginning to show and the currency is due for a correction retail sales rose only 0 1 in april which is a dramatic slowdown from the 1 3 increase in the previous month we ve also been skeptical of how much longer we ll see cad data

the ecb could delay easing in the forex market currencies are driven by the latest turn of events while the ecb talked rate cuts for the first time earlier this month the most recent shift came from the fed and the market was positioned the wrong way the euro was deeply oversold and while some investors expected the fed to be dovish no one expected eight members to flip their views and start favouring a rate cut this year as a result eur usd shot higher breaking above all major moving averages opening the door to a stronger move up to 1 1500 we don t expect this week s economic reports to

that if their forecasts are correct tighter monetary policy will be needed this explains why after falling initially sterling recovered quickly until britain decides how they want to finalise brexit the boe will refrain from raising interest rates but if global trade tensions continue to sour and world growth slows further they may need to flip the switch and start talking about easing the economy isn t doing great according to the latest economic reports retail sales fell for the second month in a row by 0 5 which took the year over year rate down to 2 3 from 5 1 there was no post meeting press conference and during his annual mansion speech boe governor mark carney didn t comment on monetary policy while the tory leadership contest holds the currency back the boe s less dovish outlook could drive the pair well above 1 28
with the world facing crises in global security and international trade a g20 summit this week under japan s presidency will host key meetings among u s president donald trump russian federation president vladimir putin and china s president xi jinping these key actors will try to cool down the boiling trade disputes between china and the u s and seek a solution to the security crisis in the middle east negotiations will be intense at the lower diplomatic and political levels as well at the osaka based summit set for june 28 29 officials from 37 countries are gathering in osaka including turkish president recep tayyip erdogan who is due to meet separately with both trump and putin and over 2 000 journalists from around the world will follow the deliberations in a recent online guest column japanese prime minister shinzo abe laid out an ambitious agenda for the meeting focusing on three issues the first agenda item concerns what i believe is the most important challenge of our times working to maintain and ultimately strengthen the international order for free and fair trade he wrote for the project syndicate the second item on the agenda concerns the digital economy digitalization of the economy has enabled unique and unprecedented business models but it has also brought new challenges such as double non taxation for multinational companies we can resolve such issues only through international cooperation he continued the third issue for the osaka summit is the importance of innovation in tackling global environmental challenges he wrote the goals outlined in the intergovernmental panel on climate change s 1 5 c report are not achievable through regulation alone disruptive innovation that flips something negative into something positive will be the key to realizing the world s climate goals but much of the agenda may well be overshadowed as trump and putin discuss mideast politics and xi and trump try to find a way to stop the escalating trade war between the u s and china a conflict which is destabilizing international trade integration under japan s presidency the g20 has been focusing its efforts on fix global current account imbalances through multilateral policy coordination rather than bilateral trade deals a u s china deal is within reach if xi and trump show courage at the g20 summit commented craig allen an analyst at the u s china business council at the 2017 g20 meeting in germany and its successor in argentina the next year trump who has scorned international platforms clashed with many of the group s members over climate trade and migration policy these meetings have struggled to cope with a u s shift toward unilateralism under trump these leaders summits have avoided using previously standard language about rejecting protectionism and promoting global cooperation but dan ciuriak economic consultant and the director of ottawa based ciuriak consulting said that progress would be possible at this year s

with the world facing crises in global security and international trade a g20 summit this week under japan s presidency will host key meetings among u s president donald trump russian federation president vladimir putin and china s president xi jinping these key actors will try to cool down the boiling trade disputes between china and the u s and seek a solution to the security crisis in the middle east negotiations will be intense at the lower diplomatic and political levels as well at the osaka based summit set for june 28 29 officials from 37 countries are gathering in osaka including turkish president recep tayyip erdogan who is due to meet separately with both trump and putin and over 2 000 journalists from around the world will follow the deliberations 3 key issues in a recent online guest column japanese prime minister shinzo abe laid out an ambitious agenda for the meeting focusing on three issues the first agenda item concerns what i believe is the most important challenge of our times working to maintain and ultimately strengthen the international order for free and fair trade he wrote for the project syndicate the second item on the agenda concerns the digital economy digitalization of the economy has enabled unique and unprecedented business models but it has also brought new challenges such as double non taxation for multinational companies we can resolve such issues only through international cooperation he continued the third issue for the osaka summit is the importance of innovation in tackling global environmental challenges he wrote the goals outlined in the intergovernmental panel on climate change s 1 5 c report are not achievable through regulation alone disruptive innovation that flips something negative into something positive will be the key to realizing the world s climate goals but much of the agenda may well be overshadowed as trump and putin discuss mideast politics and xi and trump try to find a way to stop the escalating trade war between the u s and china a conflict which is destabilizing international trade integration under japan s presidency the g20 has been focusing its efforts on fix global current account imbalances through multilateral policy coordination rather than bilateral trade deals trade tensions a u s china deal is within reach if xi and trump show courage at the g20 summit commented craig allen an analyst at the u s china business council at the 2017 g20 meeting in germany and its successor in argentina the next year trump who has scorned international platforms clashed with many of the group s members over climate trade and migration policy these meetings have struggled to cope with a u s shift toward unilateralism under trump these leaders summits have avoided using previously standard language about rejecting protectionism and promoting global cooperation but dan ciuriak economic consultant and the director of ottawa based ciuriak consulting told anadolu agency

the financial markets are relatively steady in a light day today the imminent risk of war between us and iran is eased as trump opts for more economic sanctions meanwhile it appears that us and china are both preparing for the trump xi summit at g20 in japan later in the week while practical no one expects a deal there hopes are high for at least an agreement to resume trade negotiations in the currency markets yen and swiss franc are trading a touch softer while dollar remains pressured on the other hand commodity currencies are generally firmer as led by australian dollar euro and sterling are mixed for now technically overall outlook in the markets are unchanged while dollar is expected to weaken further in the near term there are some levels that might give the greenback support at least for a rebound attempt those levels include 1 1142 projection resistance in eur usd 1 2840 fibonacci resistance in gbp usd 1 3068 support in usd cad and 0 7022 resistance in aud usd gold would also face 1452 80 projection resistance with next rise in other markets nikkei closed up 0 13 hong kong hsi is p 0 39 china shanghai sse is up 0 01 singapore strait times is down 0 45 japan 10 year jgb yield is down 0 16 china urges us to compromise and make concessions in trade talks at a news briefing regarding g20 summit chinese vice commerce minister wang shouwen said talks are underway between china and us teams regarding trade negotiations he gave no details on the highly anticipated meeting between xi and trump ahead though he reiterated china s stance on mutual respect and urged us to make concessions for compromises wang said mutual respect means each side must respect the other s sovereignty apparently referring us demand for china to implement the trade agreement with domestic laws wang also said equality and mutual benefit means the consultations have to happen on an equal basis the agreement to be reached has to be beneficial for both sides meeting each other half way means both sides have to compromise and make concessions not just one side wang also noted xi has asked trump to treat chinese companies fairly during last week s telephone conversation he added we hope that the u s can remove certain unilateral measures inappropriately taken against chinese companies in the spirit of free trade and the world trade organization rba lowe it legitimate to ask how effective further monetary easing would be australian dollar is said to be lifted by rba governor philip lowe s question on effectiveness of further rate cuts lowe said in a panel discussion in canberra today that it s a legitimate question to ask how effective further monetary easing would be lowe explained that exchange rate is an important channel through which easing stimulates growth and other transmission mechanisms are weaker at the moment however he added we trade with one another we don t trade with mars so if everyone s easing the effect that we get from exchange rate depreciation via the transmission mechanism isn t there meanwhile it s possible to ease more than other major central banks but lowe warned this was quite a dangerous path to go down instead he urged the country to switch focus to fiscal policy and structural reforms also governments here and around the world should have their top drawers full with ideas lowe also said he didn t understand why investors were pushing stocks higher while expecting central banks to cut interest rates he said there are investors who think the outlook is sufficiently weak that they expect central banks right around the world to cut interest rates but they are not worried about corporate profits or credit risk currently markets are expecting rba to cut interest rates by 50bps from 1 25 by year end the next move could come as early as in august to us we also don t understand why lowe s comments could shoot up the aussie he didn t indicate less need to loosen up monetary policies rather he s simply suggesting that cutting interests are not enough to lift inflation back to target rbnz to stand pat this week door open for further rate cut rbnz rate decision is a major focus of the week after lowering the policy rate by 25 bps to 1 50 in may the central bank would likely remain on hold this month domestic economic developments came in largely consistent with policymakers projections q1 gdp growth beat rbnz s expectations but breakdowns were mixed forward looking indicators signaled that risks to growth are skewed to the downside global economic outlook remains uncertain and major central banks have recently shifted their stance on the dovish side it is unlikely that g20 summit this week would resolve us china trade war at best both sides would agree to resume negotiations all these should lead the rbnz to adopt a cautious tone this month while opening the door for reducing interest rates again later this year here are some previews trump xi summit at g20 most crucial for market sentiments while expectations for policy easing from major central banks intensified since last wee some events ahead might cool such expectations trump xi meeting at g20 towards the end of the week will be crucial for global investor sentiments fed chair jerome powell will speak again this week and he s got another chance to clarify how imminent a rate cut is us consumer confidence and

this was supposed to be the year interest rates finally started to touch normal levels again but it isn t turning out that way the mood has changed dramatically since december when the us federal reserve increased rates for the sixth time since 2015 and warned markets to expect at least another two hikes this year with us growth and inflation slowing rate expectations have now gone sharply into reverse the fed voted nine to one to hold benchmark rates at a target range of 2 25 per cent to 2 5 per cent on thursday but chairman jerome powell said in a press conference afterwards that some officials believe the case for accommodation has strengthened and markets now expect a cut in july and possibly in september too if the fed does cut it will boost stock and property markets while hitting returns on cash and driving down the value of the us dollar and with it the uae dirham this means your local earnings may not travel as far next time you send them overseas so will you be a winner from lower rates or one of the losers chris beauchamp chief market analyst at online trading platform ig notes that the fed is not the only central bank taking a dovish stance eurozone rates currently stand at zero and last week european central bank president mario draghi left the door open to negative rates and quantitative easing qe to kick start the sluggish european economy one dovish central bank in a week is perhaps an outlier two is a trend president donald trump has even accused the ecb of currency manipulation by making it unfairly easier for them to compete against the usa he has been putting the fed under pressure to cut rates by a full percentage point rates are being cut because the global economy is slowing down amid the escalation of geopolitical risks with rates already so low how much of a boost will the economy get anyway john hardy head of fx strategy at saxo bank says the fed has been forced to reverse monetary policy because its aggressive rate hike regime has hit financial stability and left the us dollar overvalued gaurav kashyap head of futures at egm in dubai cautions against expecting a sharp drop in the us dollar no other country is in a rush to hike rates australia and canada have both cut uk rates are frozen at 0 75 per cent and won t rise until brexit is fixed and the eurozone is also dovish mr hardy however says it is likely that we are headed back towards effective zero rates in the us and eventually quantitative easing if the economy is tilting into recession as we believe it is so far this has been good news for stock markets but mr hardy warns it may not last if the us and global economy continue to show signs of weakness it is hard to believe the bull market will continue although we may see brief new highs over the summer he adds low interest rates and qe may pump up asset prices but do not fix underlying structural problems they also compound the long term problem by diverting investment into unproductive assets mr hardy says if they are not enough central bankers may be forced to adopt more extreme stimulus measures he adds maged villegas hassanain a financial adviser living in abu dhabi says cheap money could temporarily revive stock markets but agrees the impact may not last long investors may be wiser to buy the subsequent cool off period which could last for 12 to 18 months jahangir aka managing director mea at fund manager neuberger berman in dubai says modest interest rate cuts may create a soft economic landing as the us europe and china are all slowing this would be welcome news for the region s economy and businesses iyad abu hweij managing director of allied investment partners pjsc in dubai says a cut in july would boost the uae it would make borrowing cheaper for investors induce investments from neighbouring regions and revitalise the tourism sector he says fixed interest investments such as government and corporate bonds should rise in value as look more attractive when interest rates are falling investors who hold bond funds in their portfolios therefore have some protection against future stock market volatility a fed rate cut will raise some awkward questions over whether it has bowed to public pressure from mr trump to act mr hweij adds it also suggests that monetary policy has also been ineffective as the global economy is clearly in no state to withstand more expensive money fawad razaqzada technical analyst at currency specialists forex com says when investors realise why central banks are cutting interest rates jubilation could turn to despair rates are being cut because the global economy is slowing down amid the escalation of geopolitical risks with rates already so low how much of a boost will the economy get anyway how falling rates will affect savers and borrowers borrowing ambareen musa founder of uae comparison platform souqalmal com says lower interest rates can incentivise borrowing and spur economic growth in the uae the most notable impact would be on mortgage borrowing lower mortgage interest rates will make mortgages more attractive for potential homebuyers and ease the burden on existing borrowers this will encourage more people to refinance existing home loans you can do this to lower your monthly payments tap into the equity in your home or shorten your mortgage term so that you take full ownership of your property sooner and pay less interest as a result with interest rates now more likely to fall and rise taking out a variable rate mortgage can make more sense than fixing she adds ms musa says lower mortgage rates may also tempt buyers back into the uae housing market and there are now great deals available on both off plan and completed properties this could be just the stimulus required to invigorate the property market and the economy mr hassanain says uae expats and residents who are thinking of borrowing money to buy a property should consider waiting a little longer as they may be able to secure cheaper financing in the months ahead savings lower interest rates inevitably spell further bad news for savers ms musa says that is a shame as we were just beginning to see some interesting high yield savings deposit and hybrid accounts but an interest rate cut will dull their shine lower interest rates could also make it harder to protect your savings from inflation although with dubai consumer prices falling 2 61 per cent in the year to may this may be less of a concern at the moment gold the gold price has benefit from falling rates the precious metal does not pay interest so struggles when savers can get a higher return on cash ned naylor leyland manager of the merian gold silver fund says we are now witnessing a genuine structural shift in monetary policy the past seven years of hawkish promises about higher rates and central bank balance sheet unwinding was a blip in the trend of monetary policy that is loose looser and looser still as safe haven currency the us dollar looks set to weaken money is rushing into precious metals as a store of value gold and silver prices now look set to resume their bull run he adds the gold price is up 5 57 per cent in the last 30 days to 1 390 at time of writing cryptocurrencies many also see bitcoin as a store of value too and this may partly explain why its price has now topped 10 000 after plunging in 2018 the crypto currency has shot up this year almost tripling in value from 3 750 in january to 10 735 at time of writing a 15 month high as ever explanations for the latest movement are shadowy at best although some say that facebook s proposed crypto currency libra has given the market fresh credibility gary mcfarlane crypto currency analyst at uk investment platform interactive investor says bitcoin is far from realising its original vision of being digital cash for payments but is now being used as a store of value the digital gold thesis is gaining traction as asset managers such as fidelity set up custody services for financial institutions and high net worth individuals its popularity could be driven by an economic crisis or weakening faith in mainstream currencies people in

source xinhua 2019 06 24 19 48 46 editor xuxin video player close harare june 24 xinhua the zimbabwe government has banned the use of foreign currency as legal tender alongside the local rtgs dollar in an apparent bid to arrest galloping increases of prices of basic commodities and other goods and services however payment for international airline services in foreign currency will still be allowed finance and economic development minister mthuli ncube announced the ban on monday with effect from the 24th of june 2019 the use of the british pound united states dollar south african rand botswana pula and any other foreign currency whatsoever shall no longer be legal tender alongside the zimbabwe dollar in any transactions in zimbabwe the minister said in a statutory instrument si ncube said this means that the zimbabwe dollar which is at par with the rtgs dollar and the bond notes and coins would be the sole legal tender with immediate effect zimbabwe which abandoned its local currency the zimbabwe dollar in 2009 following years of hyperinflation has been using a basket of nine multi currencies dominated by the u s dollar the others are the british pound the euro the chinese yuan the australian dollar the indian rupee the south african rand the botswana pula and the japanese yen the si said the new regulations do not affect the opening or operation of foreign currency designated accounts which shall continue to be designated in the foreign currencies with which they are opened and in which they are operated or the making of foreign payments from such accounts also not affected is the requirement to pay customs duties and value added tax in any of the foreign currencies for goods specified under the law to be luxury goods a serious shortage of foreign currency has spurred a black market where the u s dollar was on monday trading at 1 11 rtgs dollars at the minimum while the official interbank rate was at around 1 6 president emmerson mnangagwa said last week that zimbabweans should expect to start using a new local currency by the end of 2019 or the first quarter of 2020 as the government has made strides putting in place macroeconomic fundamentals needed before its re introduction he said the current scenario where zimbabwe has no control over the supply and availability of the currencies in use is unacceptable
government has announced that the united states dollar south african rand botswana pula and other foreign currency were no longer legal tender in zimbabwe pressure had continued to mount on employers including the government to pay salaries in us dollars as most goods and services are being priced in foreign currency martin kadzere and enacy mapakame the abolishment of the multi currency system by government will avert the country from plunging into full re dollarisation at a time the economy do not have enough united states dollars to support it some economic analysts have said with effect from yesterday the government declared the rtgs now zimbabwean dollar as the sole legal tender effectively abandoning multi currency regime which zimbabwe adopted in 2009 when hyperinflation rendered the zimbabwean dollar worthless the rtgs dollar was introduced in february this year as the first step towards ongoing currency reforms government announced that the united states dollar south african rand botswana pula and other foreign currency were no longer legal tender in zimbabwe it means that anyone who wants to buy goods from the shop or pay for services within zimbabwe ought to go to a bank bureau de change or some other institutions to change their foreign currency into domestic currency and spend that whichever way they wish to spend that s what countries normally do that s what all countries do finance and economic development minister prof mthuli ncube said the continued depreciation of the local currency against the us dollar has seen most business preferring to quote prices in forex in an economy where the majority of the citizens are getting incomes in rtgs dollars analysts said it was going to be unsustainable not to stop re dollarisation given that the country did not have enough us on the back of limited lines of credit resulting from sanctions the policy makers saw that re dollarisation is coming back and this was going to create a lot of problems since the economy does not have adequate resource to back dollarisation economist dr gift mugano told the herald business in an interview yesterday pressure continues mounting on employers including the government to pay salaries in us dollars as most goods and services are being priced in foreign currency zimbabwe is under sanctions and has been struggling to attract reasonable lines of credit and foreign direct investment which are major sources of liquidity under dollarisation by not stopping re dollarisation it was going to be disastrous said an analyst with a local research firm the move will go a long way in restoring most critical functions of the central bank which will empower it to defend the value of local currency national business council of zimbabwe president mr langton mabhanga said zimbabwe needed own currency for local transactions and limit the usage of foreign currency for importing everywhere in the world people do not use foreign currency to transact locally said mr mabhanga in an interview yesterday we had developed a culture where we would criss cross currencies and this does not build competitiveness because all that foreign currency gets siphoned out of the country having our own currency is the way to go what this means is we will have to run a tight foreign currency exchange platform that is free of leakages to ensure companies access foreign currency for their imports and other foreign obligations he said mr mabhanga however said enforcement of the new law would be crucial to ensure success of the reforms as well as tight control of the interbank market economist mr persistence gwanyanya said this had come on the back of a depreciating rtgs dollar and government had to step in to restore confidence in local currency the rtgs was fast depreciating against high preference for the greenback which is a store of value and people wanted it as opposed to local currency even after instances where we had increased flow of foreign currency into the country it was traded on the illegal parallel market as opposed to the official interbank market in any normal economy foreign currency is sold on the official interbank market for imports not local transactions what we need is to build a strong foreign currency market said mr gwanyanya some critics however said while the latest move was expected to see more foreign currency being off loaded on the interbank market it was unlikely given that the largest chunk of forex might be in the informal sector the question is who is holding the largest chunk of foreign currency another analyst said if they are formal corporates companies which i doubt then we are likely going to have improved inflows on the interbank market but we will have problems if the biggest chunk of the foreign currency is held by the informal sector mr gwanyanya said while the move was welcome there must be confidence for it to work the framework is good but there must be confidence for it to work lack of confidence has been a huge challenge and if government is serious about this currency regime there is need to ensure confidence is restored said mr gwanyanya

introduction and summary advancing u s national interests requires getting migration policy right this site is protected by recaptcha and the google privacy policy and terms of service apply this is particularly true as large scale dislocations of people in central america and venezuela reshape realities across the western hemisphere the scale and character of these dislocations require a new approach to managing the movement of people in the americas this approach must disavow cruel and counterproductive efforts at deterrence emphasize cooperation between neighbors and recognize the fundamental humanity of those seeking a better life for themselves and their loved ones any effective approach in addition to domestic reforms 1 requires understanding what is fueling these mass dislocations it also requires being clear on what is not happening despite the toxic nativist rhetoric and policy president donald trump regularly peddles the united states is neither being invaded nor does it face an unmanageable migration crisis this does not mean however that the united states can afford to ignore current migration dynamics in the western hemisphere fear and desperation have led millions of people to uproot themselves and seek safety and security far from home this situation requires a serious and well resourced response from washington and its regional partners who must boldly reimagine both u s and regional responses in the short medium and long term anything less will aggravate an already serious humanitarian crisis and contribute to political and economic instability in the americas twitter the united states is neither being invaded nor does it face an unmanageable migration crisis as outlined in this report to accomplish these goals the united states must look and work well beyond its borders to understand the underlying drivers of migration including profound governance failures in the northern triangle of central america system failure in venezuela and the negative effects of climate change throughout the region invest at scale in peace and democracy in the americas in ways designed to address key migration drivers in both the immediate and longer term that are cheaper and more effective than the president s doomed border wall and wildly misguided punitive tariffs commit to a whole of society approach that ensures that responsibility for managing migration is shared by local national and regional civic private and government sector actors adopt a humane and effective approach to immigration and border management that allows the united states to exercise arguably indispensable hemispheric leadership on migration and restore respect for the rule of law in its system properly understood and managed migration represents not simply a challenge for the united states but an opportunity advancing u s national interests requires a fundamental reassessment of current and recent approaches in the americas beginning with abandoning the policies of the current u s administration that are impeding effective national and regional responses to migration migration in the americas during the past five years dramatic shifts in the scale and character of migration in the americas have unsettled regional politics and tested the capacity and political will of governments and international agencies to address and avert humanitarian crises violence poverty political dysfunction and environmental degradation across the western hemisphere have led to an increase in refugees asylum seekers and other vulnerable and displaced populations on a scale not seen in decades the effects of these migrations on the economies and societies of the americas have been profound and are likely to intensify in the months and years to come in the united states much of the discussion surrounding migration has centered on the sharp increase in central american asylum seekers along the u s southern border since 2014 this development is a genuine challenge that has been aggravated by the cruel rhetoric and policies of the current administration toward migrants of all kinds inhumane and punitive practices such as child separation detention in dangerous conditions and myriad efforts to severely restrict the availability of protections for people requesting asylum have rightly drawn outrage litigation and renewed calls for an overhaul of u s immigration policy in response to this outcry president trump has doubled down on irresponsible and inflammatory approaches by deploying the u s military to the southern border on an arguably unlawful mission 2 to defend against a fictitious invasion of asylum seekers from el salvador honduras and guatemala to defend against a fictitious invasion of asylum seekers from el salvador honduras and guatemala unilaterally and illegally diverting billions of dollars appropriated for military preparedness and construction to seize privately owned land and build a largely symbolic wall along portions of the southern border threatening billions in tariffs to be paid by u s consumers if mexico does not eliminate migration to the united states3 the trump administration s treatment of migrants is horrifying on its own terms but it also represents a wrongheaded and myopic approach to addressing mass displacement of peoples in the western hemisphere the central american refugee crisis is not an isolated phenomenon rather it is one aspect of a set of regional challenges that will not be solved at the border or through polices aimed at deterring specific populations from migrating the drivers of mass migrations are complex and interrelated and a crisis in one country can cause or aggravate migration pressures in others many americans may be surprised to learn that the movement of displaced persons within south america vastly exceeds northbound migration from mexico and central america toward the united states by june 2019 there were more than 1 3 million venezuelans living in colombia alongside 768 000 in peru and 130 000 in argentina 4 a total of approximately 4 million venezuelans have fled their homeland in recent years 5 potential flashpoints for deepened humanitarian and geopolitical crises abound a worsening of the political situation in venezuela a renewal of civil strife in the caribbean or a major climate catastrophe in central america could significantly exacerbate migration dynamics in the americas responding effectively to this challenge will require coordinated regional efforts that address the underlying drivers of mass migration and develop shared frameworks for processing vulnerable populations the united states can play a pivotal and arguably indispensable role in managing and reducing migration pressures in the americas it can and should provide the leadership and resources to drive collective responses from regional stakeholders and set a positive example in its own treatment of migrant populations changing migratory flows taken at face value president trump s demands for a wall along the u s southern border and his spurious claims of an invasion of migrants suggest that migration from latin america to the united states is at unprecedented levels 6 the truth is far different until recently mexican nationals represented the largest population of migrants seeking entry to the united states 7 over the past decade however out migration from mexico has decreased dramatically and apprehensions of mexicans along the u s border are at near 40 year lows 8 the reasons for these changes in migration flows are complex but the most important factors have been a reduction in employment opportunities in the united states following the 2008 recession and economic and demographic changes in mexico that have reduced incentives to seek work abroad 9 as of late 2018 both guatemalans and hondurans were estimated to be crossing the u s border in greater numbers than mexicans an unprecedented development 10 yet even this figure needs to be put in context the number of central americans migrating to the united states has increased only slightly since 2013 although recent reporting on u s border patrol apprehensions suggests a notable increase in the past six months 11 migration from south america has also decreased with the notable exception of venezuelans 12 these trends however do not tell the full story of migration in the americas while overall migration from latin america to the united states has largely plateaued the percentage of those migrants who are refugees and asylum seekers has increased sharply as discussed below in addition the venezuelan political crisis and associated economic collapse that has sent millions of venezuelan nationals fleeing to neighboring states have created ripple effects throughout the hemisphere these developments mean that migrant populations in the western hemisphere are more diverse in terms of age and gender and are also more likely to be fleeing violence persecution and hardship 13 u n high commissioner for refugees unhcr definitions and meanings14 any discussion of migration requires an understanding of the formal legal categories to which different migrant populations belong and by extension the treatment to which they are entitled under international and domestic laws in most migration scenarios the most important distinction is between individuals who claim to have left their home country because of fear of persecution refugees and asylum seekers and those migrating for other reasons such as to pursue better economic opportunities or to join family members who are already abroad the following are some key concepts and terms pertaining to u s and international classification of migrants drawn from unhcr materials 1951 refugee convention the 1951 geneva convention is the main international instrument of refugee law it clearly spells out who refugees are and the kind of legal protection other assistance and social rights they should receive from the countries who have signed the document the convention also defines refugees obligations to host governments and defines certain categories of people such as war criminals who do not qualify for refugee status the convention was limited to protecting mainly european refugees in the aftermath of world war ii but another document the 1967 protocol expanded the scope of the convention as the problem of displacement spread around the world 15 refugee refugees are individuals who have been forced to flee their country because of persecution war or violence to be entitled to protection refugees must have a well founded fear of persecution on account of their race religion nationality political opinion or membership in a particular social group such persecution or threats of persecution are often carried out by the government but they can also be carried out by private actors that the state is unable or unwilling to control importantly refugees frequently cannot return home or are afraid to do so war and ethnic tribal and religious violence are the leading causes of refugees fleeing their countries refugees should receive at least the same rights and basic help as any other foreigner who is a legal resident including freedom of thought freedom of movement and freedom from torture and degrading treatment countries may not forcibly return or refoul refugees to a territory where they face danger or discriminate between groups of refugees they should ensure that refugees benefit from economic and social rights at least to the same degree as other foreign residents of the country of asylum for humanitarian reasons states should allow a spouse or dependent children to join persons to whom temporary refuge or asylum has been granted asylum seeker when people flee their own country and seek sanctuary in another country they apply for asylum the right to be recognized as a refugee and receive legal protection and material assistance asylum seekers are individuals who are seeking to obtain refugee status in the country in which they reside under domestic laws implementing the 1951 refugee convention and associated agreements asylum seekers must demonstrate that their fear of persecution in their home country is well founded parties to the 1951 refugee convention and the 1967 protocol are required to give a fair hearing to asylum applications and recognize valid claims to asylum governments establish status determination procedures to decide a person s legal standing and rights in accordance to their own legal systems internally displaced person internally displaced persons idps are individuals who have been forced to flee their home but never cross an international border these individuals seek safety anywhere they can find it in nearby towns schools settlements internal camps and even forests and fields idps which include people displaced by internal strife and natural disasters are the largest group that unhcr assists unlike refugees idps are not protected by international law or eligible to receive many types of aid because they are legally under the protection of their own government many states and international bodies however have acknowledged a set of guiding principles commonly referred to as the deng principles relating to treatment of idps 16 stateless person a stateless person is someone who is not a citizen of any country citizenship is the legal bond between a government and an individual which allows certain political economic social and other rights to the individual as well as responsibilities to both the government and the citizen a person can become stateless due to a variety of reasons including sovereign legal technical or administrative decisions or oversights the universal declaration of human rights underlines that everyone has the right to a nationality 17 refugees and asylum seekers by country even as migration flows from mexico and central america have shrunk or held steady the percentage of the migrants who are refugees and asylum seekers from these countries and in the americas as a whole has grown substantially during the past decade according to data collected by the unhcr there were between 500 000 and 550 000 refugees and asylum seekers in the western hemisphere from 2008 to 2013 18 starting in 2014 however that number began to rise reaching approximately 870 000 in 2017 and exceeding 1 million by mid 2018 19 although data are not yet available for the end of 2018 the deterioration of the political situation in venezuela and persistent civil insecurity in some regions of central america suggest that these numbers have continued to increase markedly during the past 10 months for decades colombia has produced the largest share of forcibly displaced persons in the western hemisphere on account of its brutal and protracted internal armed conflict however it saw a decline in the number of refugees and asylum seekers between 2012 and mid 2018 reflecting the negotiation of a national peace agreement and the broader past decade trend toward political stability in the country by contrast the six other major source countries for refugees and asylum seekers saw sharp increases between 2012 and mid 2018 honduras saw an approximately 2 128 percent increase in refugees and asylum seekers from fewer than 3 500 in 2012 to more than 78 000 in mid 2018 20 likewise guatemalan refugees and asylum seekers increased from fewer than 8 000 to more than 92 000 and el salvador from fewer than 10 000 to more than 130 000 21 venezuela meanwhile saw the largest increase in absolute terms surging from around 8 500 refugees and asylum seekers in 2012 to more than 278 000 in mid 2018 22 mexico s refugee and asylum seeker population grew eightfold while haiti s increased by around 65 percent a concerning but nonetheless modest increase in comparison with the other major source countries in the region 23 in terms of recipients the united states has seen the largest influx of asylum seekers more than half a million cumulatively as of mid 2018 chiefly from el salvador guatemala honduras venezuela mexico and haiti it is not however alone in being a recipient of asylum seekers across the americas the largest groups of asylum seekers in brazil and peru for example are venezuelan nationals while mexico hosts substantial numbers of central americans and venezuelans 24 even accounting for these increases the total number of refugees and asylum seekers in the americas is small relative to historical migration flows however because international law requires states to accept refugees within their borders and give a fair hearing to requests for asylum 25 a significant increase in either of these populations can strain the capacities of domestic immigration systems in the americas the challenge of processing a growing asylum seeker population has been compounded by the fact that many of those seeking refugee status travel in family units or as unaccompanied minors 26 along the southern border of the united states parents and children now comprise nearly two thirds of border patrol apprehensions up from 10 percent in 2012 27 these changing demographics have tested the response of an immigration system that was designed when the majority of foreign persons seeking to enter the united states without authorization were single adult males most of whom sought to avoid contact with immigration authorities the magnitude of the challenge and the failure of the government s current response is highlighted by the fact that multiple children have died in or shortly after leaving u s customs and border protection s custody since december 2018 the first such deaths in a decade 28 other migration patterns refugees and asylum seekers represent only a fraction of the total number of migrants fleeing poverty violence and repression in the americas of note the collapse of the venezuelan economy under the corruption and incompetence of the maduro regime has led to a surge in migration from the country according to the unhcr the total number of venezuelan migrants and refugees worldwide was estimated at 4 million as of may 2019 and could reach 5 million by the end of the year with an estimated 5 000 migrants arriving in neighboring countries each day 29 the unhcr has also reported that as of april 2019 more than 414 000 venezuelans have applied for asylum and formal recognition as refugees since 2014 30 notably many venezuelans leaving their country due to violence persecution and extreme economic hardship are not seeking refugee status abroad they instead view their exodus as temporary holding out hope that they will return in the near future in the meantime many find work in the informal economy of their countries of destination without seeking legal protections many recipient countries including colombia and peru have encouraged venezuelans to seek temporary residence status under their domestic laws 31 colombia and peru have taken in the largest share of venezuelans there are now more than 1 million venezuelans in colombia which has allowed virtually unrestricted immigration from its neighbor in reciprocity for the many colombians who took refuge in venezuela during the colombian internal armed conflict 32 if present trends continue the number of venezuelans in the country will reach 2 million in 2019 and 4 million by 2021 33 a similar phenomenon has occurred in peru chile and ecuador which host around 1 million venezuelan nationals between them 34 colombia meanwhile continues to grapple with a population of idps that far exceeds other migration in the hemisphere notwithstanding the historic 2016 peace agreement and the return of many forcibly displaced colombians to the country conflict continues between the government and armed groups in areas previously controlled by the revolutionary armed forces of colombia farc insurgency 35 as a result the number of idps in colombia reached 7 7 million in 2017 the largest population of idps in the world exceeding in absolute terms even those of syria and congo 36 the large number of venezuelans now living in the country has placed additional strain on the colombian government s response capacity causes implications and responses the factors driving the increase in refugees asylum seekers and other migrants in the western hemisphere do not lend themselves to easy solutions and there are many plausible scenarios under which they could grow more acute for example further deterioration of the political situation in venezuela an escalation of civil conflict in haiti or nicaragua or a major natural disaster in central america or the caribbean key drivers of migration in the americas there is no single dominant factor such as a war or a natural catastrophe driving recent migration patterns in the americas rather the countries producing the largest share of migrants are all afflicted to varying degrees by an interlocking set of political economic and social challenges that have given rise to pervasive insecurity and desperation although every country s situation is to some extent unique these challenges can be grouped into the following four broad categories crime and violence as of 2018 latin america and the caribbean had the unwelcome distinction of being the most violent region on the planet accounting for nearly 40 percent of global homicides despite containing only 8 percent of the world s population 37 much of this crime has been concentrated in countries currently experiencing high levels of out migration since 2014 honduras venezuela and el salvador have traded places as the country with the world s highest murder rate with mexico and guatemala not far behind 38 extortion and kidnappings are also rampant across the region as is violence against women unsurprisingly this pervasive insecurity has led to large scale displacement a recent doctors without borders report found that 40 percent of northern triangle asylum seekers mentioned direct attacks on them or their families as the main reason for their emigration 39 the causes of this crime epidemic are complex but key factors include entrenched gang rivalries militarized policing broken and ineffective justice systems and lack of lawful employment opportunities 40 extreme poverty and economic collapse although most western hemisphere economies have strengthened over the past decade venezuela and some areas of the northern triangle have seen sharp contractions with corresponding increases in malnutrition and disease in venezuela corruption and mismanagement have magnified the effects of depressed oil prices and sanctions leading to the implosion of what was once one of the most prosperous economies in the western hemisphere 41 in the northern triangle and in guatemala especially drought and crop disease have created an epidemic of hunger in communities that were already living at or near subsistence levels 42 in both cases sharp deteriorations in quality of life have caused migration across the socio economic spectrum from college educated professionals in venezuela to women and children from indigenous communities in guatemala and honduras 43 environmental degradation and loss of traditional lifestyles closely linked to hunger and poverty as drivers of migration are the disruptive effects of climate change the agricultural sector accounts for a quarter of employment in the northern triangle and changing weather patterns in particular drought and irregular rainfall have increased food insecurity and devastated livelihoods across the region 44 indigenous communities engaged in traditional farming methods which already occupy a precarious and marginalized position in northern triangle society have been especially affected 45 in venezuela too drought has aggravated already chronic shortages of water and power contributing to a precipitous decline in living standards in the country 46 impunity and elite indifference a key factor reinforcing and enabling migration drivers in the americas is the failure of public officials and business leaders to address the entrenched dysfunction and lack of economic opportunity that is causing poor and vulnerable populations to leave 47 a combination of democratic backsliding deepening corruption and state capture and weak institutions has meant that national and regional elites in central america and mexico are uninterested in and unwilling to invest in social programs undertake much needed law and justice reforms and help communities battered by climate change manage erratic weather patterns and crop failure 48 this pervasive impunity and indifference has sown hopelessness in societies already struggling with staggering violence and high unemployment the resulting desperation and pessimism have contributed to high migration levels even in countries where levels of violence have improved in recent years for example honduras where migrant flows have increased even though homicides have dropped significantly since 2016 49 for the foreseeable future large scale movement of people in the americas is likely to be driven by fear and extreme privation rather than by the search for economic opportunity that characterized earlier waves of migration the implications of this shift are profound migrants fleeing violence and extreme poverty pose unique administrative and logistical challenges for recipient countries and are unlikely to be deterred by threats of aggressive enforcement of immigration laws 50 without a coordinated well resourced framework for managing migrant flows a future mass migration scenario in the western hemisphere could precipitate a major humanitarian crisis and destabilize governments across the region to date some regional stakeholders have taken steps to address new migration patterns but these efforts have not matched the scale of the challenge foreign assistance and migration in public discussion of mass migration events foreign assistance is often presented as a tool to mitigate migration pressures this is certainly the case in the americas where a range of public officials and commentators across the region have echoed mexican president andrés manuel lópez obrador in proposing a marshall plan for central america 51 under such a proposal billions of dollars would be invested in development projects aimed at addressing the root causes of migration 52 there is little question that the many challenges confronting central american countries justify a substantial increase in assistance to the region in fiscal year 2018 the united states spent around 879 million in foreign assistance to mexico and central america or about 3 percent of the total foreign assistance budget for that year 53 fy 2019 budget requests for those countries were considerably lower 54 such funding levels are not in proportion to the gravity of the economic political and social crises afflicting the region especially when viewed against u s commitments in other parts of the world at the same time it is important to recognize the limits of traditional foreign assistance implemented correctly foreign assistance can help rebuild broken societies strengthen fragile institutions reduce violence and improve standards of living such transformations do not happen overnight of course and they depend critically on the political will and rectitude of local elites as well as the competence of implementing partners for this reason some observers have been skeptical about increased investment in the northern triangle 55 but even where such positive changes occur they do not necessarily produce a decrease in migration outflows at least in the short term a recent study of the relationship between migration and foreign assistance examined more than 100 countries over 25 years and found that some forms of aid specifically those aimed at strengthening governance did contribute to reduced emigration from recipient countries whereas other forms focused on economic development or improving social conditions did not affect migration 56 other investigations of this topic have found that the effect of foreign assistance on migration is at best limited and in some cases may produce short term increases in migrant flows 57 these findings do not mean that the united states and other donors should reduce economic and social development projects in regions with high migration levels in favor of more governance interventions such investments are justified by their humanitarian benefits and the prosperity and stability they yield over the long term the uncertain relationship between aid and migration however cautions against setting unreasonable expectations about the ability of international actors to solve migration challenges through traditional foreign assistance alone such efforts must be paired with well resourced and coordinated efforts to process and accommodate migrant flows on the understanding that high levels of migration may continue and even increase after a surge in assistance levels they must also be accompanied by efforts designed to anchor potential migrants in their communities of origin mexico and central america the countries of the northern triangle remain gripped by extreme levels of violent crime and crushing poverty driven in significant part by broken justice systems rampant impunity and graft and lack of economic opportunity 58 although homicide rates have declined across the region since 2016 violent crime remains endemic and is rarely punished 59 levels of violence against women are among the highest in the world and extortion and forced gang recruitment are facts of life for many residents 60 political actors are often co opted by or themselves ringleaders of organized crime networks and have little incentive to reform government institutions or invest in inclusive economic growth 61 some of these countries especially honduras and guatemala are also gripped by democratic backsliding and cultures of impunity in 2017 honduran president juan orlando hernández declared victory following an election marred by grave irregularities and a questionable supreme court ruling that allowed him to seek a constitutionally dubious second term 62 nevertheless the trump administration quickly recognized the election results 63 in response to largely peaceful protests hernández suspended constitutional rights and imposed a curfew backed by military force 64 notwithstanding these actions in late 2017 the u s state department certified that the honduran government had been making efforts to promote human rights and fight corruption entitling it to continue to receive u s aid 65 in guatemala president jimmy morales who campaigned as an uncorrupted political outsider has sought to hamstring a highly effective and immensely popular anti corruption commission 66 the united nations organized commission known as the international commission against impunity in guatemala cicig has received strong bipartisan support from u s policymakers and established itself as a major force promoting transparency and accountability yet shortly after president morales expelled the head of cicig following reports that the commission was investigating corruption in his administration secretary of state mike pompeo praised guatemala s government for its efforts in counternarcotics and security 67 u s officials have continued to voice support for morales despite his sustained efforts to shut down cicig 68 these dire governance challenges have been aggravated by climate change related drought and a devastating outbreak of coffee rust in central america last year 69 beyond the northern triangle an outbreak of political violence in nicaragua in 2018 has led to hundreds of deaths a wave of repressive policies by the country s government and major economic turmoil 70 this situation has led thousands of nicaraguans to flee across the border to costa rica overwhelming local officials and triggering xenophobic and even violent reactions from residents 71 mexico suffers from similar challenges as the northern triangle albeit on a less severe scale despite improvements in governance violence against civilians and the capture of local officials by organized crime remain endemic in some areas of the country leading many residents to seek refuge in neighboring countries as of mid 2018 there were approximately 83 000 mexican asylum seekers in the united states a sevenfold increase from 2013 72 in october 2017 mexico guatemala costa rica honduras panama and belize implemented their respective comprehensive refugee response frameworks to address the inbound flows of refugees from the northern triangle of central america 73 since taking office in december 2018 mexican president lópez obrador has signaled an eagerness to advance the economic development of southern mexico and the countries of the northern triangle on his first day in office he signed an agreement with the presidents of el salvador guatemala and honduras to foster development and strengthen the rule of law in the northern triangle 74 mexico also announced a near immediate agreement albeit one long on rhetoric and short on detail with the united states to deepen regional cooperation and enhance economic development in southern mexico and the northern triangle countries 75 most recently mexico in cooperation with the u n economic commission for latin america and the caribbean eclac has presented a development plan for southern mexico and the northern triangle 76 the trump administration welcomed this plan in a joint declaration that for now averted implementation of president trump s threatened tariffs against all mexican imports if mexico fails to reduce all migration to the united states 77 all of this of course has happened against a backdrop in which president trump ordered a termination of u s assistance programs in the northern triangle 78 resulting in cancelation of 370 million in budgeted programming for fy 2018 and 180 million for fy 2017 until northern triangle countries take some unspecified action to curb migration 79 central america s dry corridor a driver fueling migration from the northern triangle alongside violence poverty and political dysfunction climate disruption in central america s dry corridor has also become a main factor driving migration from that region a tropical dry forest region on the pacific side of central america that naturally experiences irregular rainfall the dry corridor has become one of the most susceptible regions in the world to climate change related weather variability since as early as 1960 80 more than 45 million people inhabit the region many of whom are vulnerable indigenous people living in rural areas severe inclement weather has negatively impacted the resilience and economic growth of communities throughout the region and led to significant increases in malnutrition and other negative health outcomes 81 the western highlands of guatemala have been one of the regions of the dry corridor most affected by climate change in recent years climate change related drought has devastated agriculture yields in the region driving subsistence farmers and their families to abandon traditional ways of life and embark on dangerous and arduous journeys north in search of economic opportunity 82 of the 94 000 guatemalan immigrants deported from the united states and mexico in 2018 approximately half came from the western highlands a 50 percent increase since 2016 83 a u s agency for international development financed pilot program known as the climate nature and communities of guatemala which launched in 2014 and was canceled by the trump administration in 2017 showed encouraging results in helping western highlands villagers respond to climate change through crop diversification water conservation and reforestation 84 although the program represented only 190 000 annually out of a total of 200 million in assistance programming to regions with high migration levels it showed that with adequate and well targeted resources migration can be managed responsibly at its source 85 venezuela venezuela s economic collapse and descent into a corrupt authoritarian narco state is one of the great tragedies of modern latin america 86 massive declines in basic living standards have led to widespread malnutrition and disease as well as skyrocketing violence 87 the country s inflation rate surpassed 1 million percent in 2018 and is projected to reach 10 million percent by the end of 2019 88 this sharp deterioration in living conditions coupled with the increasingly repressive practices of the regime headed by nicolás maduro has sent millions of venezuelans searching for survival and a better life in neighboring countries 89 in contrast to the central american asylum seeker situation whose duration is uncertain there is every reason to believe the large scale exodus of venezuelans is a protracted crisis that like the one produced by civil unrest in colombia in the 1980s and 1990s will be felt for years if not for decades twitter the large scale exodus of venezuelans is a protracted crisis that will be felt for years if not for decades further chaos in venezuela which is likely in nearly all foreseeable scenarios could overwhelm the already stressed capacities of neighboring countries and exacerbate existing migration drivers if factors that determine venezuela s foreign income worsen oil production price of oil annual remittance and foreign aid it is estimated that the number of forcibly displaced venezuelans worldwide including the 4 million already outside the country could reach 8 2 million in the coming years 90 this level of displacement would surpass even the syrian refugee crisis and have wide ranging effects on the political stability of neighboring countries this includes above all colombia where the large numbers of venezuelans entering into unsettled border regions with significant idp populations and ongoing violence have strained the national government s capacity to respond to multiple humanitarian challenges 91 but the threat of instability also extends to peru and the countries of the caribbean basin many of which have struggled to accommodate the sudden influx of venezuelans into their small territories 92 in september 2018 argentina brazil chile colombia costa rica ecuador mexico panama paraguay peru and uruguay announced the declaration of quito to address the migratory crisis of venezuelan refugees 93 the declaration sought among other things to enhance regional cooperation including additional international community financial support for countries facing large influxes of venezuelan migrants and to provide domestic legal protections for venezuelan migrants including access to basic social services and acceptance of expired travel documents as proof of identity yet increasing inbound flows of forcibly displaced people have pressured and strained partners in the region to meet the emergency needs and asylum requests of those entering their borders to date there has been a significant disconnect between policy and practice among regional governments even those that formally accord basic rights and services to venezuelans are often not able to deliver on those guarantees 94 governments on the front lines of the venezuela crisis are also beginning to retreat from their previously liberal policies toward migrants amid backlash from their own citizens last summer peru and ecuador imposed a requirement that venezuelans seeking to enter their countries possess a valid passport whereas previously a national id card was sufficient to obtain entry this requirement was subsequently struck down in court 95 earlier this year after a highly publicized murder of an ecuadorian woman by her venezuelan boyfriend sparked xenophobic riots ecuador added an additional requirement that venezuelans present their criminal record to immigration authorities 96 these policies arguably fly in the face of the cartagena declaration a nonbinding legal instrument endorsed by most latin american countries and in many cases incorporated into their domestic laws that provides a more expansive definition of refugees than does international law 97 by contrast colombia has continued to receive venezuelans without restriction and has taken extraordinary steps to process and integrate displaced persons within the country despite the immense scale of the challenge 98 however with the colombian public increasingly viewing venezuelan migration as a net negative for the country it is not clear how much longer the country s government can sustain this approach 99 colombia also faces a significant implementation challenge with regard to integrating venezuelan migrants and refugees a challenge that is layered upon colombia s ongoing struggle to extend the reach of the central government to all of the country s territory haiti and cuba the risk of a mass migration scenario is not limited to central and south america deepening instability in haiti could lead to thousands of haitians fleeing to the united states and other neighboring latin american and caribbean countries reminiscent of the wave of haitian boat people that fled to the united states after a military coup ousted jean bertrand aristide in the early 1990s 100 in the same vein the trump administration s efforts to isolate cuba and limit travel to the country could strangle the country s nascent private sector and produce a sharp contraction in its economy 101 previous eras of heightened tension on the island have led to significant cuban out migrations 102 when these scenarios are considered against the likelihood of a climate related catastrophe equal to or greater than that wrought by hurricane maria in 2017 the probability of a major migration event in the caribbean basin becomes too great to ignore latin america s epidemic of gender based violence violence against women is pervasive across latin america especially in areas generally afflicted with high levels of violent crime according to a 2017 united nations report the region has the highest level of sexual violence against women committed outside an intimate relationship and the second highest rate of violence committed by partners or ex partners 103 the region also contains some of the highest murder rates for women in the world often linked to gang violence 104 violence against women has become a primary factor driving migration from the northern triangle especially from el salvador and honduras both countries consistently rank among those with the highest rates of femicide that is the murder of women because they are women 105 el salvador in particular has seen its rate of femicide double in five years as of this year the country experienced one femicide victim every 24 hours and had the highest murder rate of women in latin america with most cases having gone unsolved or unprosecuted 106 in addition gangs in both countries commonly use sexual violence as a tool of intimidation and social control 107 a recent study by the university of washington found that women migrants from northern triangle countries were more likely than men to report violence as a reason for leaving home 108 recent u s policy has undermined efforts to reduce gender based violence in latin america and raised obstacles for actual and potential victims of such violence to obtain asylum in the united states under president trump the united states has reduced funding for programs aimed at combatting violence against women in central america in el salvador for example total funding for such programs in 2018 was only 600 000 less than 1 percent of total foreign assistance expenditures for the country 109 at the same time the administration has sought to disqualify domestic violence as a valid basis for asylum a policy that for now has been blocked in federal court 110 recent u s policy responses to migration in the americas for more than four decades u s administrations have to a greater or lesser extent grappled with the challenge of managing migration from the americas when the increased arrival of unaccompanied minors gained national attention in 2014 the obama administration initially adopted a near exclusive aggressive deterrence approach to migration management 111 dramatically expanding the detention of families in hastily constructed or converted facilities and reducing opportunities for release from detention 112 in time this gave way to an approach that additionally involved addressing the root causes of migration by making significant targeted investments in sustainable economic development and citizen security in the northern triangle countries of central america it did so directly through 750 million in assistance primarily to nongovernmental organizations engaged in development and citizen security efforts in the northern triangle limited amounts of assistance provided directly to northern triangle governments were made dependent on the governments engaging in fiscal reforms as well as anti corruption and transparency efforts 113 it also did so by leveraging multilateral resources primarily through the inter american development bank idb 114 these efforts suffered from challenges inherent to ramping up such a significant increase in assistance 115 even so some of the investments were beginning to bear fruit by the end of the obama administration most notably in el salvador where u s assistance contributed to an improvement in the pervasive insecurity that has been a key driver of migration from that country 116 the primary setback for the approach launched by the obama administration however was the onset of the trump administration and its nativist deterrence only approach to migration in the americas even before president trump s recent impetuous decisions to threaten tariffs on mexico and cut off assistance to the northern triangle in retaliation for their alleged inaction on migration the administration had decreased and slow walked regional assistance in all categories except for borders and drug control 117 it shifted its central america approach to focus less on improving security governance and everyday life and more on preventing illegal immigration through tougher enforcement and financing opportunities for u s businesses in the form of additional overseas private investment corporation opic resources for projects in the northern triangle 118 in both honduras and guatemala the administration has made a strategic choice to tolerate democratic backsliding for the sake of security cooperation a decision questionable on its own terms corruption and authoritarianism have historically gone hand in hand with the drug trade and organized crime119 but one that is especially misguided in light of the administration s insistence that both governments must do more to stop migrant flows in 2017 the trump administration also ended the central american minors cam refugee and parole program created in 2014 which was meant to help stem the flow of unaccompanied children making the dangerous journey to the united states from northern triangle countries by offering them a shot at protection from within the region itself 120 more broadly in the americas the trump administration has disillusioned many key partners by disinvesting in diplomacy foreign assistance and democracy promotion the administration has been slow compared with its predecessors to appoint high ranking u s officials focused on latin america and the caribbean 121 president trump has expressed support for president jair bolsonaro of brazil despite his history of xenophobic rhetoric and praise for brazil s two decade period of military dictatorship 122 the administration has also lacked the will to invest in partner capacity or press for a collective response to forcibly displaced people moreover it has failed to appropriately plan for contingencies as venezuela plunges deeper into crisis instead last november the trump administration announced a new ceiling of just 3 000 refugees for fy 2019 from latin american and caribbean countries a number that is not remotely in proportion to the number of refugees generated by the crisis in venezuela alone 123 the administration s overall retreat from global refugee resettlement sets a dangerous precedent for other countries around the world which have thus far not increased their own admissions to make up the difference 124 furthermore out of the billions needed the trump administration only offered 213 million of humanitarian funding from fy 2017 to fy 2019 for the venezuela regional crisis response and in fy 2019 provided only 36 4 million in bilateral assistance to support colombian efforts to respond to venezuelan arrivals 125 the trump administration has chosen to abandon any pretense of compassion toward those fleeing disaster war and violence by demonizing asylum seekers as dangerous criminals bent on invasion 126 ending the deferred action for childhood arrivals daca program and taking steps to subject more than 700 000 daca recipients the vast majority from latin america to the threat of deportation to countries they left more than a decade ago as children 127 triggering the termination of temporary protected status tps for hundreds of thousands of salvadorans hondurans haitians and nicaraguans thus ignoring in country consular personnel s warnings that ending tps for most of these countries would undermine regional stability increase irregular migration and strain u s border security efforts 128 unilaterally rewriting asylum laws to make it harder to achieve protection for persecution related to gang violence and domestic abuse 129 engaging in abusive and degrading treatment of migrant populations and refugees including a heinous policy of separating migrant children from their parents and turning back more than 10 000 central american asylum seekers who now must wait in mexico for months often in dangerous conditions in order to have their asylum applications adjudicated at a later date130 in addition the administration has proposed irresponsible and impractical solutions to the central america refugee crisis specifically including the construction of a wall along the u s southern border the deployment of the u s military on an unnecessary and possibly unlawful mission to allegedly protect the border from migrant caravans 131 the decision to implement a remain in mexico strategy that subjects asylum seekers to violence and abuse in mexico 132 the recent threat to raise tariffs across the board on all products imported from mexico until it stops all potential migrants seeking to enter the united states the cumulative effect of these choices sets a damaging and inhumane example on immigration policy that will give legitimacy to other regional actors seeking to adopt draconian policies toward refugees asylum seekers and other migrant populations to both advance the national interest and set a strong humanitarian example the united states must do better recommendations migration realities in the americas require a fundamental reassessment of the u s approach advancing u s national interests requires tackling the drivers of migration in a far more ambitious concerted and coordinated manner than has been done to date this approach cannot come from the united states alone but the united states can and should lead the efforts doing so will required principled well resourced and well coordinated efforts that actively seek to mitigate migration enhance partner capacity and remedy severe u s shortcomings that hamper its ability to effectively manage migration in the americas invest at scale in peace and democracy in the americas too often the united states has lent support to authoritarian and repressive regimes in the western hemisphere in the name of great power competition security cooperation counternarcotics or other purportedly strategic goals in the long term however such alignments have contributed to regional instability failed to advance u s interests and values and contributed to migration drivers including violence and lack of economic opportunity this has been especially true in central america where the entrenched poverty and political dysfunction driving the current refugee crisis stem albeit only in part from u s actions in the region during the cold war and through to the present day yet history has also demonstrated that u s investment and democracy promotion in the americas can profoundly improve the lives of millions the following section details the ways in which the united states should use its unparalleled resources to help create conditions that will ease migratory pressures while also advancing other core national interests stand up for democracy human rights and the rule of law the u s approach to the americas including its approach to managing migration in the americas must prioritize support for democracy human rights and the rule of law a proliferation of democratic inclusive societies that generate across the board economic opportunities in the americas would clearly be in the u s national interest u s policy and investments should be geared to promoting those outcomes to achieve this objective it is critical to break the cycles of impunity that hamper development and foster insecurity in countries across the americas the united states has long supported the fight against organized crime and graft throughout the western hemisphere admittedly with differing levels of success it should maintain its long held policies of funding police professionalization supporting judicial reforms and institution building training lawyers and judges and assisting investigative efforts into money laundering extortion and murder in the region 133 it must robustly support anti corruption and transparency efforts throughout the region doing so not only responds to popular demands throughout the americas but also advances core u s national interests the work of cicig in guatemala for example has been credited with breaking cycles of impunity and strengthening the rule of law as homicide rates have declined in the country 134 similarly the organization of american states backed mission to support the fight against corruption and impunity in honduras maccih has begun the critical work of chipping away at honduras culture of impunity that has long held that country back 135 twitter a proliferation of democratic inclusive societies that generate across the board economic opportunities in the americas would clearly be in the u s national interest bring the full resources of the united states government to bear a sufficiently ambitious u s policy response must not only be principled it must be a top tier priority across the entire u s government to be a top tier priority the u s government must 1 dedicate sufficient resources to the task 2 reach well beyond the traditional u s foreign assistance toolbox and 3 ensure effective political leadership for years however the united states has conducted policy in the americas on the cheap especially compared with other parts of the world from 2000 to 2018 for example total u s security and economic assistance in the americas was 21 65 billion constituting 7 53 percent of all such u s investment in the world 136 for comparison in that same period the united states invested 23 08 billion in pakistan and 24 76 billion in egypt 137 the time has come to meaningfully invest in addressing those countries and dynamics that most directly affect day to day life in the united states but the answer is not simply throwing more money at the problem the u s approach must be comprehensive coordinated and creative the partnership for growth pfg initiative which was implemented by the obama administration in 2011 and 2012 in el salvador among other countries and sought to coordinate all levers of u s power to help overcome key obstacles to sustainable economic growth provides a potential northern triangle wide blueprint for reaching beyond the traditional u s foreign assistance tool box 138 that reach is needed to find mechanisms that will anchor potential migrants in their communities of origin and do so today not only after generational change in central american societies for example microcrop insurance specific market supports and alternative development tied to value chains for subsistence farmers among other creative approaches all need to be closely examined as potential avenues for mitigating migration among those communities being adversely affected by coffee rust and drought in central america s dry corridor even a creative pfg like approach however requires clear political leadership to overcome bureaucratic inertia to that end a pfg like approach should be bolstered by the designation of a senior level special coordinator for the northern triangle with a clear mandate from the president to not only lead the interagency efforts but also work on northern triangle refugee and migration issues with mexico central and south american governments the multilateral financial institutions the organization of american states and the united nations target investment at the underlying causes of migration in the northern triangle it is not enough to simply undo president trump s wrongheaded decision to cut off assistance to the northern triangle u s investments must be laser focused in ways that make a real immediate difference in people s lives on the ground physical and economic insecurity are significant drivers of migration particularly from the northern triangle u s investments should be focused on counteracting both and should be concentrated in those areas from which migration affecting the united states originates violence reduction programs have been shown to decrease migration they need to be brought to scale across the northern triangle 139 bringing programs to national and regional scale will only be possible with whole of society buy in throughout the northern triangle countries discussed below as u s resources cannot and should not be expected to address these systemic failures alone more broadly citizen security is impossible to achieve without sustainable broadly shared economic growth u s investments should promote bottom up economic development 140 this goal requires buy in and active participation from economic and political elites who to date seem all too comfortable with their compatriots fleeing their country in hopes of a better future elsewhere adverse effects of climate change are already driving migration in the americas in addition to returning to the paris climate accord and changing course at home direct u s assistance in the americas be it to central america or across the climate vulnerable caribbean basin should invest in sustainable mitigation efforts that will allow people to live out their lives where they are born 141 these efforts could include establishing a regional investment plan for southern mexico and the dry corridor of central america that pairs climate change mitigation strategies with development assistance focus law enforcement intelligence judicial and sanctions tools against transnational human trafficking organizations a u s approach that prioritizes place based citizen security and economic development efforts to mitigate migration should not set aside effective complimentary enforcement efforts to the contrary law enforcement intelligence and judicial tools need to be used to effectively target human trafficking organizations in the region as well as their u s domestic manifestations that play a significant role in stoking irregular migration in the americas 142 identifying key human traffickers in the americas and ensuring that they are at a minimum denied access to the u s financial system for example should be a top enforcement priority for the office of foreign asset control within the u s department of the treasury law enforcement and intelligence assets as well as partner services in the region should be leveraged to better understand trafficking networks and expose their vulnerabilities reinforce migration mitigation goals in domestic policy decisions given physical proximity the connection between the united states and the rest of the americas is unique that proximity creates both opportunities and responsibilities one such responsibility is to ensure that u s gun policy does not continue to aggravate violence in the nation s closest neighbors adding to migratory pressure as the center for american progress has previously noted from 2014 to 2016 u s sourced guns were used to commit crimes in nearby countries approximately once every 31 minutes 143 as previously recommended there are concrete steps that the united states should take to curb the flow of weapons to its neighbors 144 address the venezuelan migration crisis venezuela presents a particularly complex challenge as the root cause of mass emigration from the country is the maduro regime and its catastrophic impact on daily life for millions of venezuelans to halt large scale migration from this country of still more than 30 million people a peaceful democratic transition away from maduro and his corrupt cohort will be essential given the magnitude of the economic destruction however it is unlikely that large scale migration will dissipate any time soon in short venezuelan migration is a reality and one that will almost certainly intensify in the coming months and perhaps years regardless of political outcomes as a result while the united states works to promote a peaceful diplomatic transition back to democracy in venezuela it must take steps to address the venezuelan migration crisis as such neither the united states nor the region can afford to pretend that the venezuelan migration crisis is a quickly passing phenomenon it is past time to mitigate its effect on other countries in the region and on the venezuelan people to those ends the united states should take the following steps with regards to venezuela grant temporary protected status to venezuelan nationals as cap detailed in an earlier report on the political and humanitarian crisis in venezuela 145 the united states has been deporting venezuelan nationals at the same time as it has been rightly denouncing the repressive actions of the maduro regime and lamenting the severe economic hardship experienced by ordinary venezuelans 146 the u s department of homeland security must halt these deportations immediately and grant tps to venezuelan nationals in the united states providing them the opportunity to work to send critically needed financial support to desperate family members back home and providing efforts by the united states and regional partners time to gain traction failing action from the executive branch congress should pass legislation granting tps to venezuelan nationals currently in the united states on may 22 the house judiciary committee voted on party lines to advance h r 549 a bipartisan measure to grant tps to venezuelan nationals in the united states on the date of enactment 147 expand refugee opportunities for venezuelans the president should also revise the current refugee admission cap upward while taking additional long overdue steps to facilitate the granting of refugee status to venezuelans fleeing violence and repression at home 148 support regional migration management efforts from fy 2017 to date the united states has offered approximately 213 million of humanitarian funding for the venezuela regional response from fy 2018 to fy 2019 it has provided 89 9 million in bilateral assistance to support colombian efforts to respond to venezuelan arrivals and recently secretary pompeo pledged 20 million in additional humanitarian assistance to the people of venezuela 149 the world bank estimates however that venezuelan migration to colombia is costing that country approximately 0 5 percent of gross domestic product or approximately 16 8 billion per year 150 the united states must do more directly and indirectly through the united nations and other effective multilateral mechanisms to enhance the absorption capacity of venezuela s neighbors in the face of growing migratory flows work with venezuela s neighbors to develop a contingency plan for refugee flows as dire as the political and economic situation in venezuela is presently even greater political and economic turmoil in the country is likely even in scenarios in which democracy is restored the collapse of the maduro regime or an outbreak of armed conflict could lead venezuelans to flee in even larger numbers putting unbearable strain on neighboring states that already shoulder significant burdens such as colombia peru and ecuador the united states together with the united nations and the organization of american states should engage in appropriate contingency planning with central and south american governments including those that have not to date accepted a sizable number of venezuelans relative to their populations to avert the humanitarian crises and broader regional destabilization that could accompany further implosion of the venezuelan state all actors must also prepare to deal with the lasting effects of venezuelan displacement even after venezuela begins its long road to recovery as a functioning democracy and economy establish and fund a multilateral construction and humanitarian relief fund for venezuela venezuelans even factions within the maduro regime need to have hope that a better future awaits them without it venezuelans in the country likely will not generate the kind of internal pressure needed to complement external pressures and effect real change without hope for a better future more venezuelans are also likely to flee their country to foster that hope the united states should work with its international partners to develop a funding mechanism for nonpoliticized reconstruction and humanitarian relief in venezuela to stoke confidence and eliminate any dangerous lags in assistance when change comes 151 while several day after planning processes exist 152 they need to be made more real by incorporating ongoing humanitarian relief efforts and establishing seed funding for the reconstruction fund one potential funding mechanism for both purposes that should be examined is the redirection of frozen venezuelan financial assets to apolitical multilateral relief and reconstruction efforts to make clear that those funds will be dedicated to the sole benefit of the venezuelan people enhance regional capabilities the united states should use its diplomatic clout to support the efforts of regional stakeholders to address challenges generated by mass dislocations of people across the americas using that clout does not mean as the trump administration has sought to do extorting mexico with threatened tariffs or impetuously cutting off aid to the northern triangle instead washington should encourage countries on the front lines of migration crises to develop common frameworks for accepting and processing vulnerable populations to do so in addition to putting its own house in order the united states should take the following steps coordinate efforts on a regionwide basis with capable partners in response to the 2014 unaccompanied minors crisis the united states worked with the countries of the northern triangle and the idb to support integrated efforts to accelerate and sustain broad based economic growth in the northern triangle 153 with the mexican government now focused on similar objectives the united states has an opportunity to further share the responsibility in promoting the kinds of growth and development in southern mexico and the northern triangle that will alleviate migratory pressure the united states should identify the portions of the recently produced eclac plan for integrated development in southern mexico and the northern triangle that would benefit most from u s investment once it has made that determination the united states should incorporate such investments into its foreign assistance planning process for the region the effort however can neither be an expansion of a deterrence only approach that simply seeks to enlist mexico and others into those deterrence efforts nor can it be what the trump administration has announced to date an effort that relies too heavily on private sector large scale infrastructure investment and is unlikely to move the needle on community level economic development 154 this effort of course cannot include erratic moves to cut off investment in the northern triangle countries or to impose tariffs on all imports from mexico increased regional coordination and especially stepped up idb participation can also help overcome the inherent coordination and continuity challenges created by working across three countries four if mexico is more effectively incorporated with different political calendars moreover they can help mitigate a tendency among central american countries to publicly invoke a regional approach while privately clinging zealously to their distinct bilateral relationship with the united states to achieve this end the idb must also more aggressively embrace its economic development mission similarly managing the venezuelan mass displacement requires an integrated response one that draws in countries from across the americas as well as multilateral organizations and private sector and civil society actors in all affected countries to date the united nation s regional inter agency coordination platform for refugees and migrants from venezuela coupled with the efforts of the unhcr and the united nation s international organization for migration iom has played an important role in pulling together a coordinated response its ongoing efforts should be a focal point for hemispheric and global cooperation enlist central america s private and civic sectors with the task of building sustainable societies no amount of u s or international assistance can address the underlying causes of migration absent a whole of society commitment in the northern triangle or any other affected country to building sustainable societies from which individuals are not forced to migrate to that end the united states must also rekindle efforts to encourage private sector leaders in the northern triangle to be part of the solution rather than part of the problem afflicting those societies as they have been to date 155 among the policy tools that need to be deployed are programs that condition u s investment to matching investments from private sector actors in the northern triangle the united states also must not be afraid to bar members of the northern triangle private sector and their families from entering the country if they are engaged in corrupt practices that undermine sustainable economic development in addition the united states working with partner governments must champion close collaboration with civil society and community based groups part of building sustainable societies is fashioning a resilient social fabric something the countries of the northern triangle in particular lack at this time u s policy can be a catalyst for knitting that social fabric invest in the capacity of regional actors to process refugee flows in conjunction with the unhcr the united states should immediately meet the unhcr s identified funding needs with additional funding from other capable partners such as canada and the european union washington should also seek ways to leverage international financial institutions to share the responsibility of providing support to key partners in the region especially to mexico and colombia as they work to accommodate record numbers of refugees and other forcibly displaced people 156 encourage countries with inadequate migration frameworks to make appropriate reforms although there has been some coordination on migration issues among latin american governments several of the most influential and important actors in the americas sadly including the united states under president trump maintain inadequate exclusionary and in some cases punitive approaches to refugees and asylum seekers as south america in particular experiences a turn to the right in response to the failures of left leaning governments to control corruption and deliver economic growth right wing politicians have seized on migration as a potent political talking point most notably in brazil chile and argentina 157 to avoid a regional race to the bottom on migration issues the united states should seek to work with the organization of american states and key stakeholders to develop a joint approach to migration that avoids any one country shouldering a disproportionate burden in addition washington should pressure brazil which lacks a centralized bureaucratic mechanism for receiving migrants creating huge backlogs in asylum cases158 and the bolsonaro administration to reform their approach to migration and provide adequate funding to agencies responsible for enforcing immigration laws brazil can and should share more of the migration management burden in the americas similarly mexico s key government agencies handling migration lack adequate resources 159 as the united states remedies its own shortcomings it should similarly urge mexico to provide real support to its migration refugee and asylum processes and agencies adopt a humane and effective approach to immigration and border management to restore respect for the rule of law in the u s system the united states will be unable to drive a regional consensus on migration if its own approach to immigration remains cruel inflammatory and ineffective to show the necessary moral leadership to advance u s interests in managing migration in the americas the united states should at a minimum take the following steps end the incendiary and xenophobic rhetoric around asylum seekers and immigrants generally and commit to building an immigration system that truly works the dangerous anti immigrant rhetoric now coming from the white house is only making it harder for policymakers to tackle the long overdue reforms to u s immigration laws that are needed to maximize the many positive benefits of immigration and restore respect for the rule of law in the immigration system the united states overarching goal should be to build an immigration system that reflects the reality that america has long been and will continue to be both a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws and one basic element of such a system should be a recognition of the basic human rights of those seeking entry to the united states 160 twitter the united states will be unable to drive a regional consensus on migration if its own approach to immigration remains cruel inflammatory and ineffective some of the key elements of an approach that recognizes the dignity of migrants and is designed to function effectively would be to design a legal immigration system that provides realistic evidence based and sufficiently flexible avenues for migration reform immigration enforcement to preserve due process and achieve fair and just outcomes restore the integrity of the u s asylum system by ending the remain in mexico policy and other asylum bans and by overturning short sighted rulings issued by the current and former attorney general that limit who can receive asylum and when asylum seekers in detention may be entitled to a simple bond hearing before an immigration judge stop sending troops to the u s southern border fashion a modern refugee program the overall cap on refugees accepted into the united states on an annual basis should return to at least 110 000 slots with a specific increase in the number of slots available for refugee from the americas a sensible refugee program should also include a regional refugee processing element akin to the obama era cam program restore protections for tps holders over the past two years the trump administration has taken steps to revoke tps protections for virtually all current beneficiaries including every tps holder from el salvador haiti honduras and nicaragua who collectively represent more than 94 percent of foreign nationals holding tps 161 although federal courts have so far limited the impact of the administration s actions the right course of action would be for the trump administration to reverse course and restore the tps designations absent that the next administration should ensure that these individuals do not face deportation one way of doing so would be using deferred enforced departure ded a mechanism unlikely to face the potential legal challenges that could follow an attempt to administratively revive terminated tps designations pass legislation to protect vulnerable individuals such as tps holders and dreamers congress must not wait for the trump administration to reverse course on its decisions to end daca and tps nor can it afford to wait for the courts or a future administration to stave off the disastrous consequences of allowing the more than 1 million beneficiaries of these programs to lose their protections and be rendered undocumented consequences felt in communities throughout the united states and in countries around the world congress also must not allow the trump administration to use tps holders and dreamers as bargaining chips in its repeated failed efforts to advance an anti immigrant legislative agenda placing innocent lives in limbo for the sake of political gamesmanship the senate must take up and pass h r 6 the american dream and promise act legislation to provide permanent protections for tps holders and dreamers not only is this the right thing to do for these individuals their families and u s communities failing to do so would only increase the challenges in the u s immigration system and further undermine regional stability making it even harder to achieve safe orderly and regular migration in the americas 162 conclusion migration is a fundamental dynamic shaping the americas today the united states has an outsize influence on how migration is addressed in the western hemisphere and its actions can either deepen and aggravate the challenge as with the current administration or play a galvanizing strategically advantageous role in shaping and leading the regional response taking the latter path will require washington to make substantial investments in diplomacy and cooperation while standing up for core american values such as democracy and human rights both at home and abroad the exclusionary isolationist and cruel approach of the current administration is no solution to the deepening political and humanitarian crises in the americas rather than build walls the united states should seek to build a safer more democratic inclusive and cooperative hemisphere to advance its national interest by mitigating migration about the authors dan restrepo is a senior fellow at the center for american progress trevor sutton is a fellow for

martin kadzere and enacy mapakame harare bureau the abolishment of the multi currency system by government will avert the country from plunging into full re dollarisation at a time the economy does not have enough united states dollars to support it some economic analysts have said with effect from yesterday the government declared the rtgs now zimbabwean dollar as the sole legal tender effectively abandoning multi currency regime which zimbabwe adopted in 2009 when hyperinflation rendered the zimbabwean dollar worthless the rtgs dollar was introduced in february this year as the first step towards ongoing currency reforms government announced that the united states dollar south african rand botswana pula and other foreign currency were no longer legal tender in zimbabwe it means that anyone who wants to buy goods from the shop or pay for services within zimbabwe ought to go to a bank bureau de change or some other institutions to change their foreign currency into domestic currency and spend that whichever way they wish to spend that s what countries normally do that s what all countries do finance and economic development minister prof mthuli ncube said the continued depreciation of the local currency against the us dollar has seen most businesses preferring to quote prices in forex in an economy where the majority of the citizens are getting incomes in rtgs dollars analysts said it was going to be unsustainable not to stop re dollarisation given that the country did not have enough us on the back of limited lines of credit resulting from sanctions the policy makers saw that re dollarisation is coming back and this was going to create a lot of problems since the economy does not have adequate resources to back dollarisation economist dr gift mugano told our harare bureau in an interview yesterday pressure continues mounting on employers including the government to pay salaries in us dollars as most goods and services are being priced in foreign currency zimbabwe is under sanctions and has been struggling to attract reasonable lines of credit and foreign direct investment which are major sources of liquidity under dollarisation by not stopping re dollarisation it was going to be disastrous said an analyst with a local research firm the move will go a long way in restoring most critical functions of the central bank which will empower it to defend the value of local currency national business council of zimbabwe president mr langton mabhanga said zimbabwe needed its own currency for local transactions and limit the usage of foreign currency for importing everywhere in the world people do not use foreign currency to transact locally said mr mabhanga in an interview yesterday we had developed a culture where we would criss cross currencies and this does not build competitiveness because all that foreign currency gets siphoned out of the country having our own currency is the way to go what this means is we will have to run a tight foreign currency exchange platform that is free of leakages to ensure companies access foreign currency for their imports and other foreign obligations he said mr mabhanga however said enforcement of the new law would be crucial to ensure success of the reforms as well as tight control of the interbank market economist mr persistence gwanyanya said this had come on the back of a depreciating rtgs dollar and government had to step in to restore confidence in local currency the rtgs was fast depreciating against high preference for the greenback which is a store of value and people wanted it as opposed to local currency even after instances where we had increased flow of foreign currency into the country it was traded on the illegal parallel market as opposed to the official interbank market in any normal economy foreign currency is sold on the official interbank market for imports not local transactions what we need is to build a strong foreign currency market said mr gwanyanya some critics however said while the latest move was expected to see more foreign currency being off loaded on the interbank market it was unlikely given that the largest chunk of forex might be in the informal sector the question is who is holding the largest chunk of foreign currency another analyst said if they are formal corporates companies which i doubt then we are likely going to have improved inflows on the interbank market but we will have problems if the biggest chunk of the foreign currency is held by the informal sector mr gwanyanya said while the move was welcome there must be confidence for it to work the framework is good but there must be confidence for it to work lack of confidence has been a huge challenge and if government is serious about this currency regime there is need to ensure confidence is restored said mr gwanyanya

ambitious proposal to cancel student loan debt seeking to reinforce his progressive credentials days before the first debate for sanders an independent senator from vermont the student debt plan is an opportunity to reestablish himself as the democratic primary field s progressive leader on the issue of college affordability mosads the plan comes as the vermont senator finds himself facing an ascendant progressive rival in sen elizabeth warren d mass who has set herself apart by releasing a steady stream of sweeping policy proposals warren who poses perhaps the most significant challenge to sanders on the left unveiled a plan earlier this year that would cancel up to 50 000 in student loan debt for those earning less than 100 000 a year and eliminate tuition at public colleges it s smart on his part it s an extension on the 2016 campaign when he called for free college tuition in public universities said mark longabaugh a top adviser to sanders s 2016 presidential campaign so i think this is just taking it a step further both the warren and the bernie plans are not only good public policy good progressive policy but good politics the hill s naomi jagoda and max greenwood have more here the big numbers the plan calls for eliminating 1 6 trillion in u s student debt it would clear away the student debt of 45 million americans entirely sanders would pay for the bill with a wall street tax that would reportedly raise 2 trillion over 10 years the political dynamic the proposal comes at a crucial time for sanders s campaign the first democratic presidential primary debates are this week and recent polls show warren gaining momentum in the primary contest while warren still trails sanders and former vice president joe biden in most national surveys she has significantly narrowed the gap with some polls even showing her pulling ahead of sanders on tap tomorrow the senate banking committee holds a hearing on whether fannie mae and freddie mac should be

stubborn child fed blew it by not cutting rates president trump on monday said the federal reserve blew it by not cutting interest rates during its policy meeting last week arguing the central bank doesn t know what it is doing in a pair of monday morning tweets trump touted the strength of the u s economy while bashing the fed for not providing more stimulus for economic growth why the fed announced last week that it would hold interest rates for the time being but stood ready to cut rates if the economy slows trade tensions rise and inflation remains low the independent central bank had been under immense pressure from trump to cut rates the president has often accused the fed of hindering growth through its four rate hikes last year trump on monday tweeted that the u s economy is on course to have one of the best months of june in us history but could have been even better if the fed added stimulus through lower borrowing costs he added that the fed should match efforts by foreign central banks to boost their economies likely referencing pending moves from the european union and china think of what it could have been if the fed had gotten it right thousands of points

talking points most central banks remain dovish as downside risk continues but norges bank has become an outlier by hiking rates trade war disruption could come to an end at g 20 summit further losses in fx and equity markets can be expected if no deal is reached fed and ecb signal rate cuts are around the corner if economic conditions do not improve european banks could see negative rates in place for longer canada remains resilient as jobs and inflation stay strong central bank activity was at its peak last week with most outcomes in line with expectations where norges bank became the outlier amongst a sea of dovish policy makers norway s central bank rose its base interest rate for a third time in 12 months from 1 00 to 1 25 and in its remarks hinted that future hikes can be expected throughout the second half of 2019 as the scandinavian country enjoys robust growth policy makers have now increased the rate by 75 basis points since last august and it is becoming an increasing possibility that we could finish the year with two further hikes and the rate at 1 75 as norway s core inflation remains above the 2 target at 2 25 but being a petroleum based economy with a strong reliance on european demand softening oil prices and a general slowdown in demand could see the norges bank remaining cautious of further hikes throughout the rest of the year on the other side of the spectrum we had the reserve bank of australia who at the beginning of june cut rates by 25 basis points to 1 25 its first rate change since august 2016 when it also cut rates by 25 basis points their statement read the outlook for the global economy remains reasonable although the downside risks stemming from the trade disputes have increased supporting that factors that affect china have a knock on effect on australia s economy as china remains as one of the biggest importers of australia s commodities which include coal and iron ore chart of the day interst rate decisions in june but many central banks decided to leave rates unchanged in the latest round of monetary policy decisions as central bankers wait out to see if economic conditions improve recent developments in sino american trade wars could see a trade deal being confirmed at the g 20 summit in osaka later on this week as both the us and chinese presidents seemed to be open to dialogue in order to move forward but knowing donald trump s history with giving false hope no one will be holding their breath in hopes for a fruitful deal to be achieved we can expect to see equity and fx markets taking a hit if this round of talks crumbles like the previous ones have with a push in safe haven assets like the japanese yen gold and to some extent the us dollar central banks will have more pressure to turn further dovish if no trade deal is reached this week as market participants will be anticipating further economic disruption which will continue to drag on growth prospects easing monetary policy is likely already considering future rate cuts are the us federal reserve and the european central bank both of whom signalled last week that they are prepared to induce monetary stimulus if economic conditions worsen it is surprising to see such a change in forward guidance from the fed who twelve months ago was signalling up to three rate hikes in 2019 and has now done a complete u turn in their growth estimates and investors expect a possible two or three rate cuts by the end of the year some believe that mr trump may have something to do with this as he has been very critical about the fed s decision to hike rates last december and keep them unchanged for the first half of 2019 the us president has threatened mr powell with the removal of power in many occasions but the fed chairman has been resilient and defied trump s threats pointing out that job growth is still strong and it wasn t an appropriate time to cut rates just yet but given how equity markets reacted after fed chairman jerome powell turned dovish and admitted that monetary easing could unfold in the following months we can see that investors are worried about stagnant growth and europe is in a worse shape than the us already with negative interest rates in place and a continued fall in inflation below the 2 target the ecb has had no choice but to explore possible ways to keep interest rates below 0 whilst easing the pressure it causes in commercial banks liquidity ratios germany which has for long been the eurozone s strongest economy and main driver of growth is facing tougher conditions led partly by the effect that trade wars are having on its export led economy manufacturing sentiment has been below the 50 mark for some time indicating that industry is contracting whilst unemployment rose in the month of may for the first time in 5 years close behind is the bank of japan which has left rates unchanged at 0 1 since february 2016 similar to the ecb and the fed governor haruhiko kuroda left rates unchanged but signalled readiness to act as appropriate if economic conditions do not improve japan has seen weakness in its exports in 2019 on the back of the trade wars but the central bank still expects to see modest growth throughout the year despite aggressive monetary stimulus with negative rates and large asset buybacks in the last six years japan s inflation remains well below the 2 target not all data is weak in canada latest economic data showed that the country is keeping strong and inflation is on the upswing this eases off the pressure on the canadian central bank to follow suit with the fed and we might see for the first time in a long time that canadian and us interest rates converge not because the boc increases rates but because the fed is likely to decrease them if this happens we can expect the loonie to strengthen against the greenback possibly reaching levels of 1 2840 last seen in october 2018 the question now is whether central banks are able to stop the inevitable deflation that will come if trade disruption continues much longer and given how markets have reacted in the previous weeks to central bank policies it seems likely that the only person who is able to stop this ongoing economic concern is donald trump himself recommended reading eurozone debt crisis how to trade future disasters martin essex msta analyst and editor key trading

opinion our attention has been drawn to the tuesday june 18 2019 edition of the print and online versions of your outlet frontpageafrica under the banner headline grant or loan liberia imf in deadlock over us 100m from ejs era the story asks was it a loan from the imf to the sirleaf administration or a grant either way where did the money go our response was delayed out of respect for president george weah s wishes for an imf program to help resuscitate the struggling liberian economy in response to which an imf mission was in the country when your outlet ran the story it attributed to ministry of finance and development planning mfdp sources the question as to whether resources received from the international monetary fund imf were loan or grant is one that no one working in the ministry of finance and development planning would dare to ask publicly given the direct access they have to the answer that this question has surfaced from within mfdp shows that the leaker of this story is new to the ministry has not attempted to read available information about those facilities and is therefore an embarrassment to the mfdp s predominantly critical thinking staff that served me and my predecessors so well

population to hartford but lower mill rate 42 98 mills has a 6 6 billion grand list image john gale hartford city council has brought development to an absolute screeching halt said hartford city councilor and lawyer john gale it s a huge drag this has been the biggest single financial issue the city has faced in the last 15 years with limited exceptions private development has eschewed hartford over the last decade or longer unless it s been supported by state government subsidies or city tax breaks the city s small businesses in particular have felt enormous pressure from the high property tax rate part of the reason key commercial avenues franklin maple main albany etc in various neighborhoods have lost their luster and for anyone who thinks commercial taxpayers will soon get relief after the state last year helped the city avert bankruptcy by agreeing to pay off hartford s 550 million in general obligation debt over the coming decades think again despite its bailout hartford s finances remain in a precarious position and commercial taxpayers aren t likely to see a tax rate reduction anytime soon according to mayor luke bronin image hartford mayor luke bronin for a small business or any property owner paying the full freight 74 mills it s an unsustainable and unfair burden bronin said i think it s a huge issue and one that our state has to confront if we want to be competitive for hartford s mill rate to be competitive over the long run bronin said it needs to be cut in half that however would likely require major reforms at the state level or a miraculous surge in new commercial development house majority leader matt ritter d hartford said he agrees hartford still has a long road to recovery but he also thinks the bailout he helped broker provided the city with much needed financial stability he said it could take 10 to 15 years to put any sizable dent in the mill rate and that s only if hartford is able to grow its grand list and secure additional state funding among other efforts he also said the bailout deal was the best the city could have hoped for given the political environment image matt ritter house majority leader d hartford for anyone who thinks the deal could have been better they are sorely mistaken ritter said there was not an appetite to reduce the mill rate the hartford business journal has spent months interviewing property tax experts commercial property owners landlord developers policymakers homeowners city officials and others about the effects of hartford s property tax system which is complicated and broken in myriad ways occupying just 18 square miles hartford is a tiny city that also houses many tax exempt properties significantly limiting the city s ability to grow its grand list in fact 59 percent of the assessed real estate in the city is exempt from taxation because it s owned by governments nonprofits churches or other tax exempt organizations an hbj analysis of city property records shows meantime hartford is also home to one of the poorest populations in the country increasing the need for social health care and other services adding insult to injury hartford has the state s only bifurcated property tax system in which commercial property owners pay a higher tax rate than residential homeowners hartford s challenges are a statewide concern because the city s fortunes are directly tied to the state s especially as more employers and skilled workers want to be in or near vibrant cities despite its challenges some business leaders are still bullish about hartford s future especially given downtown s new vibrancy in recent years helped by the additions of dunkin donuts park uconn s west hartford campus a fledgling tech scene and about 1 500 new apartment units image jon putnam executive director cushman wakefield i m more optimistic about hartford s increasing attractiveness as a location for companies due to the urbanization trend said jon putnam executive director of commercial realty broker cushman wakefield how did we get here hartford didn t land in its current financial and property tax predicament overnight numerous factors over many decades stacked up to create an unstable and untenable situation with no clear or easy solutions the start of the decline of hartford s property tax base and system can be traced to the mid 20th century when the city like many others in connecticut and across the u s was going through major economic and demographic shifts as more people moved to the suburbs that squeezed out a large portion of hartford s middle class and the affluence that went along with it the city s manufacturing and industrial base also began to shrink while its impoverished populace grew leading to higher city government costs as taxes rose to compensate more properties also shifted to nonprofit ownership that came on top of the enormous share of city property already owned by tax exempt institutions like colleges hospitals sewage plants and even the state itself over the past half century the portion of hartford s tax exempt grand list has more than doubled image state government reimburses the city for some of its tax exempt property but it doesn t come close to filling the gap city government too has exacerbated the problem over the decades by overborrowing making pension promises whose costs have outpaced grand list growth and then kicking the can down the road either through short term and costly debt restructurings or by raising taxes however bronin who is running for reelection this year said much larger structural issues have been the leading cause of hartford s fiscal stress at the root of the problem is the fundamental flaw of having an 18 square mile city with an enormous concentration of non taxable property and intense concentration of poverty and asking that city to run itself on only one local source of revenue he said referring to the fact that municipalities in connecticut are only allowed to raise revenue through the property tax in addition to permit and other fees the biggest problem is that you have a city built on the tax base of a suburb that from the start is a structural flaw that has all kinds of consequences bronin said his administration is running a very lean government and has made deep cuts over the last few years the city council just passed the mayor s 573 2 million budget for fiscal 2020 which does raise spending by 3 2 million but doesn t rely on borrowing and keeps the city s workforce excluding public safety personnel 11 percent below 2015 levels notably since taking office in 2016 bronin has also managed to not increase the city s sky high mill rate even still hartford is unable to lower its property tax rate that shows excess borrowing isn t the root cause of hartford s problems bronin said since the state essentially eliminated most of the city s long term debt if the city had never borrowed a single dollar you would still have a mill rate of 74 29 to make the city function he said noting that city finances are now reviewed by a state oversight panel without the state bailout or bankruptcy hartford would have had to quickly raise its mill rate an additional 10 to 15 mills bronin said which wouldn t have been sustainable he argues much more drastic reforms are still needed at the state level including giving the city additional ways to raise revenue the bailout has provided enough relief to prevent a financial armageddon but the city still has limited financial flexibility bronin said at the end of the day he said there is a cost to delivering basic core services in hartford and the value of taxable property does not come anywhere near funding that image state rep jason rojas d east hartford state rep jason rojas a democrat from east hartford who co chairs the powerful finance revenue and bonding committee said the city will likely continue to lean on the state absent pretty significant economic growth in the grand list which i think is difficult to do i think there s still a lot more work to do for the long term future of the city rojas said marc fitch an investigative reporter for the yankee institute a free market think tank said there s plenty of blame to spread for hartford s fiscal situation on the one hand the city awarded really generous labor contracts in the past so fitch views the bailout at least partially as rewarding fiscal mismanagement on the other hand the state has not fully reimbursed hartford for its tax exempt property shortchanging it of vital operating funds hartford has avoided bankruptcy for now but fitch who credits bronin for his budgeting discipline said the city appears stuck in limbo for the foreseeable future even with the bailout and everything their finances are razor thin and they re relying on potential grand list growth to hopefully fill those gaps in the next few years and that is a gamble fitch said out of whack property taxes hartford s financial and economic instability over the years have birthed arguably the most dysfunctional commercial property tax structure this state has seen in the last half century besides the exorbitant mill rate hartford is the only connecticut municipality allowed to assess commercial property at a higher tax rate to calculate any property tax bill in connecticut owners must multiply their property s assessed value by a city s or town s mill rate and then divide by 1 000 in the 1970s connecticut passed a law requiring municipalities to adopt a 70 percent assessment ratio that means to determine the assessed value of a property whether it s a single family home commercial property or apartment assessors multiply its market value by 70 percent by the late 1970s hartford faced a crisis the city was in the middle of its first revaluation in 17 years and many residential properties experienced a significant spike in value if all properties were assessed at the same level some homeowners faced average tax increases of well over 80 percent which was deemed practically and politically untenable so city officials hatched an agreement with state policymakers that among other things allowed hartford to lower its residential assessment ratio to 45 8 percent that shielded homeowners from a major tax hike while leaving commercial property owners with a higher tax rate that initial bifurcated tax structure was actually phased out by 1986 but adopted again in 2006 and remains in place today commercial and apartment properties are assessed at 70 percent of value while single family homes are assessed at 35 percent there is a formula in place that gradually raises the residential assessment ratio to 70 percent but it will take decades before that happens said city assessor john s philip image bruce becker developer becker becker hartford and new haven developer bruce becker says the uneven property tax setup matched with the high mill rate dissuades commercial investment and fosters an environment in which the city must cut tax deals to spur development especially for larger costly projects he knows that firsthand he redeveloped the 777 main st 26 story office tower into 285 apartments in 2015 an 85 million project that relied heavily on public financing and tax credits he also got a tax break from the city without that support he said the project wouldn t have happened relying on the property tax exclusively to fund municipalities is inefficient becker said delayed revals one source of hartford s problems over the years is that it often waited long periods between revaluations when that coincided with wild swings in the real estate market it led to dramatic changes in assessed property values image for example hartford waited 10 years before conducting its 1998 1999 reval which shrank the city s grand list 38 percent to 3 6 billion while the mill rate jumped from 29 50 to 47 the grand list nosedived because assessed property values hadn t fully taken into account the effects of the late 1980s and early 1990s savings and loan crisis which put connecticut and the nation into recession over a 40 year period starting in 1962 hartford only conducted three revals today state law requires municipalities to do revaluations at least every five years waiting 10 years to do a revaluation is not a great idea philip said some have pitched the idea of conducting revaluations more frequently to better capture real estate value changes in a more timely manner but it s seen by many as too costly hartford has also experimented with a commercial property tax surcharge that reached as high as 15 percent and stayed at that level for nine years starting in 1997 the surcharge drew the ire of the business community led by the metrohartford alliance which eventually lobbied to phase out the additional tax in 2010 hartford s mill rate has stabilized since 2011 there have been no tax increases under the bronin administration but the mill rate went on a consistent and steady climb at the turn of the 21st century going from 29 50 in 1998 to its current 74 29 mills today bottom line impact the effect of hartford s bifurcated tax system is that commercial landlords and their tenants are shouldering a much higher tax burden than homeowners in fact city homeowners have an effective tax rate of about 2 2 percent on par with the statewide average while commercial properties have an effective tax rate of more than 5 percent that means for every 1 000 of assessed value a hartford commercial taxpayer pays more than 50 in taxes vs 22 for residential by comparison the effective property tax rates on commercial properties in boston and new york city are 1 8 percent and 3 9 percent respectively according to the lincoln institute of land policy businesses in those cities however face other unique costs property values are also much higher in those cities hartford s high tax rate has a negative effect on commercial property values said john mcdermott a former hartford city assessor during the 1970s who is now a consultant to connecticut businesses commercial properties are valued based on how much net operating income they generate from rents property taxes are typically the second highest expense behind a mortgage when taxes rise they eat into a building s profitability thus eroding their market value image that in turn negatively impacts the city s grand list in 1996 when hartford s effective commercial mill rate was 33 4 the grand list totaled 5 8 billion today hartford s grand list sits at only 4 billion making things more challenging for commercial landlords particularly those who own downtown s class a office towers is that rents have been stagnant for nearly three decades settling in at about 22 to 26 per square foot while property taxes and operating expenses increased squeezing their bottom lines combined operating expenses and taxes cost downtown landlords around 10 to 11 per square foot in the late 1980s but reached as high as 15 to 17 in the early 2000s those costs have retreated a bit more recently as landlords found ways to reduce operating expenses and the city kept a lid on real estate tax increases said putnam the cushman wakefield commercial realty broker and it s not just landlords stuck paying higher property taxes many commercial tenants have a triple net lease meaning they must pay a share of a building s property taxes businesses must also pay taxes on personal property like machinery and equipment and motor vehicles that s how tax bills begin to add up for small and midsize merchants like d aprile s d d market that rent space in the city mcdermott said hartford s mill rate is a major impediment to renaissance efforts taking place downtown it s a competitive environment he said in today s world clearly entrepreneurs have an opportunity to go anywhere they want to go there are clearly advantages to being in the city but also from an economic perspective the suburbs have a tax impact that is dramatically less you can very easily go to glastonbury or rocky hill where the tax burden is half or two thirds of the city s image photo hbj file andy bessette travelers cos executive vice president and chief administrative officer said he is bullish on hartford despite the city s challenges urban draw despite hartford s tax burden the city particularly downtown has seen noticeable development and investment in recent years most of it however has been subsidized by the state or is the beneficiary of city tax breaks still many employers find it necessary to have a hartford presence especially as millennials and others desire urban settings where they can live work and play in fact hartford has seen some employers move from the suburbs to downtown in recent years to be closer to a wider talent pool and the various amenities the city offers the vacancy rate for class a office space downtown is currently 17 7 percent down from 25 5 percent in the first quarter of 2011 according to commercial realty firm cbre the city s overall office vacancy rate fell from 26 1 percent to 16 5 percent over that same time period the state s purchase of two major office towers and the conversion of vacant office buildings into apartments have helped lower the vacancy rate image meantime the grand list despite being well below historical highs is up 23 percent since 2006 the city lately has also attracted out of state realty investment including from new york landlord shelbourne global solutions llc shelbourne has invested more than 200 million since 2014 buying up some of downtown hartford s most prized office towers cementing it as one of the center city s most prominent landlords most recently it teamed up with hartford parking giant laz parking to buy the city s iconic gold building skyscraper for 70 5 million shelbourne managing member ben schlossberg said his group finds the city attractive because it s walkable uniquely located between new york and boston and has a strong corporate and higher education presence however he is also cognizant of hartford s high tax rate shelbourne sued the city a few years ago after its appeal for lower property taxes on several of its recently revalued buildings was denied it eventually brokered a tax break deal with the city to resolve the issue without that helping hand some of shelbourne s properties would have gone into foreclosure schlossberg said an issue familiar to downtown especially in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis we are very excited about what is going on in hartford schlossberg said however he added the state needs to find a way to lower the mill rate which is oppressive travelers cos is one employer that has made significant investment in hartford in recent years the property and casualty insurer spent about 55 million giving its famous travelers tower office high rise and campus a facelift it s currently spending millions more to spruce up its interior offices the company was also one of three insurers in addition to the hartford and aetna to promise a combined 50 million donation to the city over five years to help hartford deal with its budget crisis travelers which is the second highest taxpayer in the city with 143 2 million in assessed real estate and property is aware of the high property tax rate but is also bullish about hartford s future said andy bessette the company s executive vice president and chief administrative officer he said companies look at more than just taxes when deciding where to locate and he s attracted to hartford because of the insurance talent here and the quality of life and amenities the region offers bessette also sits on the board of the capital region development authority which has helped finance development of 1 500 apartment units downtown in recent years that along with a growing innovation ecosystem has added to the center city s vibrancy do we care about property taxes absolutely bessette said adding he recognizes that the high tax rate might impact small and midsize companies more than a large corporation would you like to have them lower absolutely but you know what we believe in the city and want to be sure it s successful you need a thriving urban environment he said return to hbj s special series examining hartford s high and inequitable tax

mr editor our attention has been drawn to the tuesday june 18 2019 edition of the print and online versions of your outlet frontpageafrica under the banner headline grant or loan liberia imf in deadlock over us 100m from ejs era the story asks was it a loan from the imf to the sirleaf administration or a grant either way where did the money go our response was delayed out of respect for president george weah s wishes for an imf program to help resuscitate the struggling liberian economy in response to which an imf mission was in the country when your outlet ran the story it attributed to ministry of finance and development planning mfdp sources the question as to whether resources received from the international monetary fund imf were loan or grant is one that no one working in the ministry of finance and development planning would dare to ask publicly given the direct access they have to the answer that this question has surfaced from within mfdp shows that the leaker of this story is new to the ministry has not attempted to read available information about those facilities and is therefore an embarrassment to the mfdp s predominantly critical thinking staff that served me and my predecessors so well i say this because the facilities upon which those resources are drawn have in their names the word credit the long and short answer to the question is it was a grant and a loan imf support to liberia s ebola response and recovery amounted to 82 2 million there are three windows under which liberia has withdrawn funds from the imf since the country reached the heavily indebted poor countries hipc completion point in 2010 the extended credit facility ecf the rapid credit facility rcf and catastrophe containment and relief ccr trust it goes without saying that the first two are credit facilities it is therefore unimaginable that such questions as grant or loan would be asked if the intent is to malign the reputation of those who managed the economy in the past the risk is that those asking the questions are unknowingly impugning the reputation of the very imf whose support they seek why constantly shoot yourself in the legs simply because you intend to destroy your fellow countrymen first let me just put on the record that the very same reserve from which the government took the us 25 million to carry out its very unconventional mop up exercise in 2018 is part of the extended credit facility ecf for which they might be asking this question under the imf s ecf program whenever we achieved our agreed benchmarks the imf board of governors would approve the disbursement of certain amounts to be put in our reserves account at the federal reserve of new york to be managed exclusively by the central bank for balance of payment support liberia s balance of payments refers to all the economic transactions that occur between our country and the rest of the world in a particular period of time liberia s bop

up space to address the aforementioned ebola related challenges february 27 2015 the imf board responds approving a total of 82 2 million not 100 million comprising the following a us 45 6 million loan equivalent to sdr 32 3 million under rcf to support the fight against ebola by covering urgent budgetary and balance of payments needs and strengthening international reserves and a 36 5 million grant in debt relief from the catastrophe containment and relief ccr trust a newly established trust set up to help low income countries recover from natural disasters this money does not come into the bank but rather removes some of the government s debt obligations to the fund the imf board responds approving a total of 82 2 million not 100 million comprising the following the ecf governance reforms and the bottom line in december 2005 liberia s net reserve position was recorded at 6 5 million by december 2017 that figure had catapulted to 156 million it took 12 years of heavy lifting by the entire gol to deliver on agreed policy reforms to achieve that those policy reforms achieved over the period 2006 and 2016 included improving governance and rebuilding institutions resuming exports of our primary commodities rehabilitating key infrastructure and starting the provision of basic services to pre war levels although starting from a low base the world bank reported in 2016 that liberia had shown the largest improvement in its country policy and institutional assessment cpia rating out of all the fragile sub saharan african countries during this period these reforms and the sirleaf administration s firm commitment to achieving them also triggered major support from all our partners including the imf in turn that support enabled us to make progress on those reforms while maintaining macroeconomic stability in the best and worst of times some of those in the current regime that are denigrating these achievements today were also members of the sirleaf regime and gladly took some of the credit signing onto an imf ecf program provides the government a pathway to qualifying for sdr under the ecf that money is placed to assist with the gross reserves position to help contain the balance of payments challenges associated with liberia being an import intensive country it also helps us address our exchange rate challenges in a dual currency regime the government does not draw down on that amount according to the cbl annual report for 2017 liberia s gross international reserves position including sdrs and reserve tranche at end december 2017 was recorded at us 517 0 million a net reserve of 154 8 million it is through the ecf that we were able to accumulate net reserves by working very hard to meet agreed conditions there is no precedent for seeking legislative ratification from imf s member states because under the ecf s articles of agreement the imf may allocate sdrs to members countries only when certain conditions to build up reserves are met or during a major crisis as was the case of the ebola epidemic to build up reserves the gol does not write a check to the federal reserve bank of new york the cbl s correspondent bank liberia is only entitled to that net reserves for balance of payment support in times of crisis however due to the nature of the ebola virus disease and the devastating impacts it was having on the economy the imf provided flexible support which could be used to stabilize the economy by closing the fiscal deficit the government of liberia effectively achieved this through increased allocations to health education and other sectors as well as disbursing to road contractors to ease the fiscal risks that commercial banks were exposed to due to their huge lending to road contractors through a supplemental budget it is important to note that the executive branch through the mfdp sought legislative approval for all disbursements and payments in compliance with our established public financial management rules and regulations moving forward pushing ahead with ongoing reforms is imperative to securing and maintaining imf support along with that of our all other traditional partners to consolidate past gains and improve resilience therefore we encourage our officials to get a better understanding of the matters they discuss in the public domain if only to preserve what is left of our national image and economic stability those who are leaking false stories to the media without understanding the proper context are not helping president weah and his regime i also urge all liberians to embrace and actively support president weah s endorsement of an imf program when he addressed the nation on may 30 2019 though an imf program is not a panacea to liberia s deep seated structural challenges that require both adaptive and technical solutions it would certainly help the gol address the technical economic challenges our nations is currently facing i would like to conclude by suggesting that our current officials please take some time to unbiasedly review the files before they make public statements or leak false stories to the press everything i have written here is in the files at mfdp and cbl if they are unable to research the files a simple phone call text message or an email to their predecessors for briefs and context would save the government and country diplomatic embarrassments they may not know it but speaking loosely and leaking false information driven by emotions to settle political scores make some of our officials look incompetent which reflects negatively on our president government and country political campaigns ended eighteen months ago it is now time to help the president govern the president and liberian people deserve better sincerely amara m konneh former minister of finance and development planning

the student debt crisis reentered the news cycle monday has it ever really gone away when sen bernie sanders released a proposal to cancel all existing student debt while making all public higher education free the headline writers instant treatment of sanders plan was that he was one upping elizabeth warren his nearest progressive rival in the race for the democratic nomination for president warren announced her own plan to eliminate student debt back in april and sanders goes further than she did that s too narrow a focus the reason we should care about these proposals isn t because they indicate who s got superior progressive credentials it s because the student debt crisis is genuine it disproportionately burdens lower income families and eradicating student debt will have an immense and lasting stimulative effect on the u s economy advertisement minority borrowers take on more debt and have more trouble paying it off fullwiler kelton et al according to a report issued last year by the levy economics institute of bard college eliminating or reducing the student debt burden will increase consumer spending expand home ownership increase job creation and reduce unemployment these effects would be persistent as opposed to the one time sugar high produced by the republican tax cut of 2017 the benefits of which mostly to the top 1 already are fading let s take a look at the rationale for eliminating student debt and examine why the standard objections to the idea don t hold water one oft heard critique is that canceling existing debt would be unfair to families that valiantly paid off their college loans often making real sacrifices and now have to sit by and watch deadbeats receive a windfall it s hard to imagine a weaker objection by its logic we wouldn t have social security or medicare today the argument would be my great grandparents almost starved to death in old age and died in the street because they couldn t get healthcare so why should yours get a break the point is that the sacrifices families made to shoulder their debt burden brought home the folly of forcing families to impoverish themselves to attain higher education why should we want to force the same conditions on future generations advertisement another objection with at least a superficial logic is that a program to cancel student debt will necessarily be regressive benefiting the wealthy more than the working class it s true that wealthy borrowers tend to have higher student loan balances in absolute terms but that s the wrong figure to look at the bard economists say what s important isn t the loan balance but the loan burden debt and debt repayments as a proportion of income by that measure lower income students are massively overburdened and debt relief would be distinctly progressive the statistics on that are clear economist mike konczal of the roosevelt institute cites a 2014 speech by janet l yellen then the federal reserve chair who observed that since 2001 college costs had become especially burdensome for households in the bottom half of the earnings distribution the fed s data showed that average education debt as a percentage of average income had risen to nearly 60 in 2013 from about 25 in 1995 while for the top 5 the percentage had remained roughly steady at about 8 the highest burdens are shouldered by black and latino borrowers the bard survey adds that the picture of the typical borrower has changed dramatically in recent decades borrowers were once traditional students the survey notes those attending private universities and professional schools without a break after high school often with a family history of higher educations and with the family wealth to accompany it advertisement today they re more likely to be nontraditional students often beginning later in life and without a family background of college attendance they re more likely to opt for public higher education which has been systematically deprived of state support and thus has become more expensive for students over time minority borrowers bard says take on more debt and have more trouble paying it off for them borrowing for college tends to widen racial disparities in the credit and job markets producing lower family wealth the student debt crisis in other words is both an artifact of and contributor to wealth inequality in america what s worse a high student debt burden makes those borrowers much more vulnerable to the effects of an economic downturn the cancellation of student debt the bard paper calculates could add as much as 108 billion a year to economic growth and it would be broad based as opposed to the narrow advantages offered by the tax cut to summarize student debt cancellation could generate substantial stimulus effects while improving the financial conditions of households what remains is to consider the details of a cancellation plan in unveiling her proposal warren was sensitive to the criticisms that the wealthy would be relieved of their debtor obligations just like the non wealthy and that the highest debt balances were incurred by medical and law school students who would have a better than average chance of paying them back accordingly she proposes to phase out loan forgiveness starting with households with income of more than 100 000 eliminating it entirely for those earning 250 000 or more she would cap the forgiven loans at 50 000 which would limit the break for doctors and lawyers advertisement sanders would eliminate all existing debt for everyone he would cap the interest rate on future undergraduate loans at 1 88 both candidates would eliminate tuition and fees for public higher education institutions and offer assistance to historically black colleges and universities sanders estimates the cost of his program at 2 2 trillion including the elimination of 1 6 trillion in existing debt warren says her program would incur a one time cost of 640 billion in debt extinction plus an additional 610 billion over 10 years to make public higher education free both propose to get the money effectively by raising taxes on the wealthy warren from her ultra millonaires tax which would impose a 2 annual tax on household net worth between 50 million and 1 billion and an additional 1 on fortunes above 1 billion raising 2 75 trillion over 10 years sanders proposes a transaction tax on stock bond and derivatives trades which he estimates would produce 2 4 trillion over 10 years what both plans have in common is a recognition that higher education has become a must for economic mobility in our society the old saw that every dollar spent on college returns two to five bucks in earnings has become less true over time as the annual earnings even of college graduates have stagnated and the debt burden has eaten away at the gains but both these plans would do much to restore the ability of all american students to reap the benefits of higher education it s all right to bicker over the details as long as the fundamental concepts remain in place keep up to date with michael hiltzik follow hiltzikm on twitter see his

world powers where presidents trump and xi are expected to meet and hopefully resolve their differences on trade and tech at stake is a decision on whether washington slaps import tariffs on another 300 billion of chinese goods a scenario that goldman sachs says could sink equity markets as much as 4 it could also tip the balance between economic recovery and recession as several markets from shipping to copper sound alarm bells trump has bones to pick with other g20 leaders too he will meet turkish president tayyip erdogan who is risking u s sanctions on his country by placing an order for russian made s 400 missile defense system india mexico canada and germany have also all at different times incurred trump s wrath over trade most recently he complained about the devalued euro which he said gave european exporters an unfair edge with more and more central banks pivoting towards policy easing the issue of exchange rates looms large fears are that another currency war will further strain ties between nations japan says it will voice concern if currency moves elsewhere deviate from economic fundamentals but having just signalled readiness to ramp up stimulus it too could find itself on the receiving end of trump s anger currency and trade wars aside an actual war might be on the horizon after trump allegedly ordered a missile strike on iran before rescinding it recent

30 90 iran s ability to target and destroy the high altitude american drone which was developed to evade the very surface to air missiles used to bring it down surprised some defense department officials who interpreted it as a show of how difficult tehran can make things for the united states as it deploys more troops and steps up surveillance in the region the bad bank would house or sell assets valued at up to 50 billion euros 56 billion after adjusting for risk and comprising mainly long dated derivatives the measures are part of a significant restructuring of the investment bank a major source of revenue for germany s largest lender which has struggled to generate sustainable profits since the 2008 financial crisis the degeneration of the universalistic model of globalization and its transformation into a parody caricature of itself where the common international rules are replaced by administrative and judicial laws of a country or group of countries the fragmentation of global economic space with a policy of unbridled economic selfishness and an imposed collapse but this is the road to infinite conflict trade wars and perhaps not just commercial ones figuratively this is the road to the final struggle of all against all it is necessary to draft a more stable and fair development model these agreements should not only be written clearly but should be observed by all participants however i am convinced that talking about a world economic order such as this will remain a pious desire unless we return to the center of the discussion that is to say notions like sovereignty the unconditional right of each country to its own path to development and let me add responsibility in the universal sustainable development not just its own the american leaders say that the era of the commercial surrender of their country has come to an end but what is over is their economic intimidation of the world and their hegemony the united states must again respect international law not arrogate to itself extraterritorial rights and mandates must learn to respect its peers in safeguarding transparent and non discriminatory diplomatic and commercial relations china and the united states have negotiated other disputes in the past with good results and the doors of dialogue are open as long as they are based on mutual respect and benefits but as long as these new trade disputes persist china informs the government of the united states of america and the whole world that it will immediately impose duties on each other unilaterally on 128 products from the united states of america also we think we will stop buying us public debt it s all good night note to readers please click the share buttons above or below forward this article to your email lists

this article is strategic culture foundation tensions in the persian gulf are reaching a point of no return in recent weeks six oil tankers have been subjected to israeli sabotage disguised to look like iranian attacks to induce the united states to take military action against the islamic republic some days ago iran rightfully shot out of the sky a us drone in yemen the houthis have finally started responding with cruise and ballistic missiles to the saudis indiscriminate attacks causing damage to the saudi international airport of abha as well as blocking through explosive drones saudi oil transportation from east to west through one of the largest pipelines in the world as if the political and military situation at this time were not tense and complex enough the two most important power groups in the united states the fed and the military industrial complex both face problems that threaten to diminish washington s status as a world superpower the fed could find itself defending the role of the us dollar as the world reserve currency during any conflict in the persian gulf that would see the cost of oil rise to 300 a barrel threatening trillions of dollars in derivatives and toppling the global economy the military industrial complex would in turn be involved in a war that it would struggle to contain and even win destroying the united states image of invincibility and inflicting a mortal blow on its ability to project power to the four corners of the world just look at how surprised us officials were about iran s capabilities to shot down an advanced us drone the us dollar based economy has a huge debt problem caused by post 2008 economic policies all central banks have lowered interest rates to zero or even negative thus continuing to feed otherwise dying economies the central bank of central banks the bank for international settlements an entity hardly known to most people has stated in writing that the outstanding notional amount of derivative contracts is 542 trillion dollars the total combined gdp of all the countries of the world is around 75 trillion dollars with the dimensions of the problem thus understood it is important to look at how deutsche bank db one of the largest financial institutions in the world is dealing with this the german bank alone has assets worth about 40 trillion dollars in derivatives or more than half of annual global gdp their solution not at all innovative or effective has been to create yet another bad bank into which to pour at least 50 billion dollars of long term assets which are clearly toxic reuters explains thus not only has deutsche bank accumulated tens of billions of dollars in unsuccessful options and securities it seeks to obtain a profit that has been elusive since 2008 the year of the financial crisis deutsche bank is full of toxic bonds and inflated debts kept alive through the flow of quantitative easing qe money from the european central bank the fed and the japanese central bank without qe the entire western world economy would have fallen into recession with a chain of bubbles bursting such as in public and private debt if the economy was recovering as we are told by soi disant financial experts the central bank rates would rise instead rates have plummeted for about a decade to the extent of becoming negative loans if the western financial trend is undoubtedly heading towards an economic abyss as a result of the monetary policies employed after 2008 to keep a dying economy alive what is the rescue plan for the us dollar its status as a global reserve currency and by extension of us hegemony simply put there is no rescue plan there could not be one because the next financial crisis will undoubtedly wipe out the us dollar as a global reserve currency ending us hegemony financed by unlimited spending power all countries possessing a modicum of foresight are in the process of de dollarizing their economies and are converting strategic reserves from us or us dollar government bonds to primary commodities like gold in this economic situation that offers no escape the immediate geopolitical effect is a surge of war threats in strategic locations like the persian gulf the risk of a war of aggression against iran by the saudi israeli us axis would have little chance of success but it would probably succeed in permanently devastating the global economy as a result of a surge in oil prices the risk of war on iran by this triad seems to be the typical ploy of the bad loser who rather than admit defeat would rather pull the rug out from under everyone s feet in order to bring everybody down with him tankers being hit and then blamed on iran with no evidence are a prime example of how to create the plausible justification for bombing tehran upon closer examination it becomes apparent that the actions of bolton and pompeo seem to be aligned in prolonging the united states unipolar moment continuing to issue diktats to other countries and failing to recognize the multipolar reality we live in their policies and actions are accelerating the dispersal of power away from the us and towards other great powers like russia and china both of which also have enormous influence in the persian gulf the threat of causing a conflict in the persian gulf and thereby making the price of oil soar to 300 a barrel will not save us hegemony but will rather end up accelerating the inevitable end of the us dollar as a global reserve currency trump is in danger of being crushed between a fed that sees the us dollar s role as the world s reserve currency collapse and the need for the fed to blame someone not linked to the real causes of the collapse that is to say the monetary policies adopted through qe to prolong the post crisis economic agony of 2008 at the same time with trump as president the neocon israeli saudi supporters see a unique opportunity to strike iran a desire that has remained unchanged for 40 years as foolish as it may seem a war on iran could be the perfect option that satisfies all power groups in the united states the hawks would finally have their war against tehran the world economy would sink and the blame would fall entirely on trump the donald as a result would lose any chance of being re elected so it makes sense for him to call off possible strikes as he did after the us drone was shot out of the sky while unable to live up to his electoral promises trump seems to be aware that the path laid out for him in the event of an attack on iran would lead to his political destruction and probably to a conflict that is militarily unsustainable for the us and especially its saudi and israeli allies it would also be the catalyst for the collapse of the world economy in trying to pressure iran into new negotiations trump runs the risk of putting too much pressure on tehran and giving too much of a free hand to the provocations of pompeo and bolton that could end up triggering a war in the strait of hormuz our current geopolitical environment requires the careful and considered attention of relevant heads of state the repeated meetings between putin and xi jinping indicate that russia and china are actively preparing for any eventuality the closer we get to economic collapse the more tensions and chaos increase around the world thanks to the actions of washington and her close allies xi jinping and putin who have inherited this chaotic situation have met at least a dozen times over the last six months more recently meeting at least three times over two months the pressing need is to coordinate and prepare for what will inevitably happen once again trying to limit and contain the damage by a united states that is completely out of control and becoming a danger to all allies and enemies alike as putin just recently said the spokesman of the chancellery of the people s republic of china hua chun ying echoed this sentiment i wonder if europeans will understand all this before the impending disaster i doubt it

u s president donald trump speaking at a rally in orlando florida u s on june 18 2019 marco bello bloomberg getty images president donald trump s quest for four more years in office crucially depends on a strong economy and sound fundamentals of u s equity markets one can safely assume that trump knows that but it is far from clear whether he knows how to achieve that outcome to begin with the worst thing he can do for his presidential campaign is to keep tweeting his attacks hugely amplified by the media on the leadership of the u s federal reserve and its monetary policy trump has no reason to do that in the first two weeks of this month the fed has injected 35 5 billion of fresh funds sharply reversing a carefully calibrated pattern of 114 billion in liquidity withdrawals since the beginning of the year all that still left 1 5 trillion of excess reserves in the banking system money banks can lend that s for the fed s policy intent should the fed be doing more and faster fed s credibility is a precious public good not at all inflation is roughly where it should be but still requiring a vigilant policy oversight to anchor expectations of price stability the core consumer prices the cpi less prices of food and energy in may came in at 2 with prices in sectors sheltered from competition growing at annual rates in the range of 2 7 to 3 3 the declining energy prices are an important part of that relatively good core rate of consumer price inflation imported fuel prices declined last month for the first time this year signaling how much the u s price stability can be negatively impacted by rising world energy costs and supply disruptions caused by tariff and non tariff barriers to international trade flows those reading a note of caution in the fed s decision not to rush into interest rate cuts have a plausible point u s labor markets remain strong real disposable household incomes continue to grow at an annual rate of 2 4 and credit costs are at historically low levels the three variables that drive more than 80 of the u s economy trump therefore may wish to pause his fed tweets leaving his economic advisors to discuss monetary policy with their central bank colleagues there is plenty for him to do now on trade and acute foreign policy crises he has an urgent task of preventing the erosion of the country s growth by huge trade deficits subtractions from american gdp that are depressants of jobs and incomes that would cheer both the main street and wall street particularly if trump were to defend american interests without recourse to economic warfare and threats of military confrontations china is an example of how difficult a job that is and how wrong negotiating strategies can lead to a blind alley the economic problem with china is clear and simple america s intolerably high trade deficits china s allegedly illegal trade practices and reportedly a limited access of u s firms to chinese markets get china s us trade surplus down fast the solution is very simple tell china that the u s wants balanced trade accounts over a specific time horizon the time frame can be negotiated but with very little concession in view of america s half a trillion dollar annual deficits for the rest beijing should be on notice that the u s will apply strict rules of reciprocity and that any illegal trade practices will be dealt with through american laws and the world trade organization arbitration procedures washington s attempts to meddle in china s legislative process and to write china s trade rules are an unacceptable interference into the country s internal affairs it should have been clear that beijing would never agree to that u s complaints that changes of chinese legislation and trade rules are necessary because china s bilateral trade commitments cannot be trusted are without merit if such things were allowed to happen in the past is proof of washington s inept trade administration and of a culpable negligence of america s vitally important economic interests trump therefore should tell china s president xi jinping the man he calls his friend that he is in a hurry to see china s exports to the u s brought to roughly the same level of american exports to china that s called reciprocity he can also assure xi that all other bilateral trade issues will be transacted on the same basis intellectual property violations and illegal industry subsidies will be dealt with under u s laws and wto regulations that should be the end of the china trade story and a swift transition to north korean nukes and the freedom of air and sea navigation in east asia the persian gulf and perennial middle east quandaries are centuries old problems where only patient diplomacy can open the way to compromises a stubborn refusal of a peaceful dialogue with iran is a tragic mistake trump gets no understanding or support for that even from america s closest friends and allies because his exit from iran s nuclear deal was not motivated by iran s violation of a painfully negotiated international agreement international inspectors found that tehran fully implemented its obligations consequently trump s withdrawal from the iran nuclear deal is a geopolitical move that the european union china and russia cannot and will not follow and none of them will approve of any intractable u s led or supported military confrontation in the persian gulf and a broader middle east the world s most dangerous powder keg investment thoughts
by trend the euro advanced to a three month high against the dollar on monday as bearish bets on the u s currency remained solid after the federal reserve signalled last week it could soon cut interest rates reports trend citing to reuters the euro stretched its rally last week when it added 1 4 and rose about 0 15 to 1 1386 in early asian trade its highest since march 22 it last traded at 1 1381 the dollar index versus a basket of six major currencies was a shade lower at 96 107 having struck 96 093 on friday its lowest since march 21 after the fed last week opened the door for a potential rate cut as early as next month that weighed on the dollar and in turn reinvigorated its counterparts such as the euro which has had troubles of its own including italy s debt problem and the possibility of the european central bank having to ease policy it is true that the ecb may have to ease policy especially with the fed having shifted to an easing bias said yukio ishizuki senior currency strategist at daiwa securities but the ecb already employs a negative interest rate policy and does not have much further room to ease even if they wanted to unlike the fed it is factors like these which have seemingly supported the euro the dollar nudged up 0 1 to 107 395 yen after retreating to a near six month low of 107 045 on friday the u s currency was pressured further against the yen which often serves as a safe haven in times of political angst as tensions grew between iran and the united states but it is difficult to see the greenback fall beyond 105 yen as a sustained flight from dollar assets was unlikely said koji fukaya director at fpg securities in tokyo for example the s p 500 reached a record high thanks to prospective rate cuts stronger investor risk appetite slows any flight to quality into the yen fukaya said in focus was whether washington and beijing can resolve their trade dispute at a summit in japan this week of leaders from the group of 20 leading world economies both china and the united states should make compromises in trade talks chinese vice commerce minister wang shouwen said on monday the australian dollar rose to a 12 day high of 0 6961 after reserve bank of australia rba governor philip lowe said it would be legitimate to question the effectiveness of global monetary policy easing to boost economic growth the comments were perceived to be slightly less dovish as just last week lowe said a recent cut in australia interest rates to an all time low of 1 25 would not be enough to revive economic growth the aussie was already on a steady footing after rebounding from a five month low of 0 6832 last week when the fed s tilt towards monetary easing helped offset bearishness from the probability of policy easing in countries including australia and new zealand the new zealand dollar traded near a 10 day peak of 0 6605 scaled on friday although the reserve bank of new zealand rbnz is expected to echo the dovish sentiments of other central banks when it holds a policy meeting on wednesday
briefing highlights seven views of the canadian dollar stocks oil at a glance eldorado resorts caesars to merge required reading where s the loonie headed the canadian dollar kicks off a new week after an impressive few days that suggest bears have thrown in the towel those gains came as oil prices rallied and notably the federal reserve signalled lower interest rates are on the way pressuring the u s dollar finally the cad has started started mind to catch up with fundamental developments bank of nova scotia chief foreign exchange strategist shaun osborne and his colleague eric theoret said in a report referring to the loonie by its symbol we have highlighted a number of cad positive factors in recent weeks from relatively better data to sharply narrower u s canada spreads clear improvements in cad sentiment and positioning through to a significant turn in usdcad technical signals but been left bemused by the cad s inability to take any real advantage mr osborne and mr theoret added all of these factors week but it was confirmation of the dovish shift in the fed s policy stance which triggered broader pressure on the usd some notable gains in the cad through mid week and finally suggests that cad bears have thrown in the towel open this photo in gallery federal reserve chair jerome powellkevin lamarque reuters here then are some views of the loonie and where it could be headed from comments over the past several days kit juckes société générale when i go to canada the country feels cheap from my morning coffee to my evening dinner the oecd s measure of is at usd cad 1 25 and you might have thought that if ppp was going to be relevant anywhere it would be for two developed economies joined by a long land border and a lot of trade however with oil prices far below their highs the housing boom far in the past and the bank of canada having adopted a significantly less hawkish policy stance than the federal reserve the loonie has simply remained cheap against the dollar that purchasing power parity of 1 25 means a canadian dollar at 80 us cents there are too many reasons to be gloomy about the canadian dollar to forecast a sharp appreciation and our forecast essentially looks for it to underperform others as the u s dollar finally corrects in the face of a slowing economy mr juckes global fixed income strategist projected the loonie would be at slightly over 75 us cents by december just shy of 76 by next march and almost 77 by june 2020 the threats facing the canadian dollar include the impact on the domestic economy of the housing market slowdown the impact of a slowing chinese economy the threat of continued trade tensions even within north america and indeed the danger that oil prices drift lower as global growth slows on the positive side most of that is already in the price notably the loonie has lagged the bounce in oil prices it has also done less well than shifts in relative yields rates would tend to suggest on that basis alone the downside for the currency is pretty limited from here mr osborne mr theoret scotiabank if recent trends are any guide it may still take some time for investors to fully embrace the upside potential in the cad positioning and sentiment is perhaps only neutral now rather than outright bullish indeed the loonie s gains last week still seem somewhat light given the bounce in oil prices and narrower spreads between the yields on two year u s and canadian bonds they said fundamentally we have to think that there is more downside in the usd from here and very limited upside potential we look for minor usd rebounds to remain capped in the mid upper 1 32s and look for more losses towards 1 30 over the next one to two weeks their 1 32 would mean a canadian dollar at 75 8 us cents and mid to upper would mean mid to lower for the loonie while 1 30 would put the currency at almost 77 stephen brown capital economics the bank of canada under governor stephen poloz will have mixed feelings about the suddenly stronger currency said mr brown senior canada economist at capital economics a stronger loonie would make life even harder for exporters however at a time when gdp growth south of the border is already slowing that would be an issue for poloz who has argued that canada needs stronger business investment and export growth for the economy to successfully wean itself off an over reliance on the housing market for growth open this photo in gallery bank of canada senior deputy governor carolyn wilkins and governor stephen polozsean kilpatrick the canadian press like other observers mr brown projected the fed will cut interest rates that he added will increase the likelihood that the bank of canada also cuts a move less friendly for the loonie taylor rochwerg cibc world markets we re now calling for two cuts by the fed in the coming months while the bank of canada is in no hurry to act it rarely fails to follow the fed and we look for one rate cut by the boc in q2 2020 while markets are likely overpriced for the fed cuts the reality of the fed cutting while the boc remains on hold should see the loonie appreciate in this year with usdcad falling to 1 31 in q4 that 1 31 would put the canadian dollar at just below 76 5 us cents ms rochwerg analyst at cibc said she expects the loonie to gain in the short term amid stronger economic growth for the second and third quarters then sink again as growth slows in the last three months of this year and into next even if trade tensions ease a slowing in global growth and the near term appreciation in the canadian dollar will keep a lid on business investment and exports the bank of canada has once again placed a lot of weight on both to be drivers of growth in 2020 and beyond and could be disappointed once more such disappointment will drive a rate cut by the boc next year which would put downside pressure on the loonie again and see usdcad reach 1 38 by the end of next year which would mean a canadian dollar at 72 5 us cents as 2020 closes out daniel hui paul meggyesi meera chandan sally auld jpmorgan chase in their just released mid year outlook mr hui global foreign exchange strategist and his colleagues forecast the canadian dollar at about 74 us cents in the fourth quarter of this year and just above 74 5 in the second quarter of 2020 cad remains at a crossroads below trend growth and an output gap conflict with the booming labour market and solid inflation outcomes meanwhile trade relations remain a wildcard with yet unresolved and concerns over the u s china trade war still outstanding and furthermore the u s appears to be slowing and looks poised to cut rates multiple times this year with rates markets priced even more aggressively which has narrowed u s canada spreads to extreme levels yet we expect the boc to cut later this year as well the uncertain combination of competing forces makes for a currency that has decoupled with its traditional short term drivers especially rate spreads and instead reflects a significant risk premium to its underlying fundamentals ultimately though we struggle to see cad appreciating in the context of a deteriorating global macro environment especially when its key trade partner is contributing to much of that slowing sal guatieri bmo nesbitt burns with week s lift the loonie has already breached our year end call of 1 32 will it take flight well if by flight one means getting off the ground à la the wright brothers in 1903 then yes the u s interest rate landscape has shifted enough to warrant a firmer loonie but if one means cruising at 30 000 feet then probably no the fact that the country is still running a large trade deficit despite a low valued currency that has stayed north of estimate of purchasing power parity of around 1 30 for the better part of a year speaks to a loss of competitiveness a recent upturn in u s labour productivity has widened the gap in unit labour costs further in its favour so while the loonie might have caught a gust of wind it s probably still pretty firmly tethered to earth that 1 32 projection from the bmo senior economist translates to 75 8 us cents and 1 30 to almost 77 bipan rai sarah ying cibc world markets no the fed hasn t cut yet still there is an inherent fallacy in promoting cad strength over the long term because the fed is expected to ease the two economies are still linked and if the fed is easing the odds are likely that the boc will follow at some point too indeed the time to price in boc cuts will come and with it weakness in the cad the time may not be now but if history is any indication don t expect an extended run lower in usd cad once the fed starts easing read more markets at a glance

co produced with michael boyd back in july 2018 almost a year ago rota fortunae wrote an article titled farmland partners loans to related party tenants introduce significant risk of insolvency shares uninvestible and after the article was published shares took an immediate nosedive source yahoo finance while i had already downgraded shares in farmland partners nyse fpi to a hold citing an unsafe payout ratio i certainly didn t know that a short article on seeking alpha would drive shares down by around 50 in a recent article titled cigar butt investing 3 deep value picks for the higher risk reit investor i explained that shares have become super dirt cheap and as a result i often get this question from readers brad you really wouldn t buy such and such stock at any price we are coming up on the one year anniversary and all things considered i think most of the volatility is since past and many of those short allegations have since been disputed today farmland partners remains a great discount to net asset value story just as with timberland farmland tends to be a great uncorrelated investment with the broader markets be it land hard commodities like gold or silver or other alternative investments buying these assets when they are out of favor has been a winning strategy over the long term given the sizeable discount to net asset value nav and relatively stable outlook for farmland i think shares make for an interesting investment opportunity today particularly given the asset disposition and share buyback program that will greatly increase per share metrics over the next several years if land prices remain in the tank this is a solid speculative buy in my view photo source getting comfortable with farmland farmland is not a great income producing asset if an investor buys into my view of nav later on in this research note farmland partners is only generating roughly 50 million in net operating income on assets worth 1 1 billion that is a capitalization rate of around 4 5 a figure roughly in line with numbers reported by both usda data source farmland value and farmland reit peer gladstone land land source gladstone land may 2019 presentation slide 10 just like other areas of commercial real estate cap rates for farmland have been in long term structural decline since peaking at 8 in the mid 1980s interestingly this means that the economic earnings of farmland significantly trailed that of the so called risk free rate u s treasuries during that period that s a relatively unique situation and a strong example of how aggressive the demand for farmland can be and how during many periods of the market farmland is viewed as a great wealth compounder via appreciation why buy this kind of acreage overall farmland defined as arable hectares per capita has been in decline globally for many years that means that over time a shrinking amount of land is needed to feed a growing global population in order to make the structure work this has been done through significant improvements in crop yields through more sustainable farming practices irrigation fertilizer use and the use of improved technologies while this is true on a global scale it is also true domestically to a lower extent here in the united states tens of millions of acres of farmland have been converted from agricultural use to other forms of development such as housing subdivisions parks and other types of commercial development this puts farmers in a tough situation feeding more mouths with less acreage buying farmland today puts an investor in a position to benefit from these long term drivers remember that an acre of land cost 179 today that figure is 3 140 acre scared of a recession farmland actually posted positive returns from 2007 to 2009 as both the s p 500 and equity reits as a whole fell source gladstone land may 2019 presentation slide 5 source farmland partners 2019 investor presentation slide 23 historically anyone with a forward looking viewpoint had done well in this asset class farmland has outperformed the s p 500 spy and commercial real estate as a whole all while experiencing less volatility yet today only a small fraction of u s farmland roughly 10 15 depending on the source is owned and managed by institutional investors while a greater percentage lease most farmland in the united states remains owned and operated by the owner oftentimes by generational farmers who have been in the business for some time the lack of investment by large institutions is beginning to change as one such example the bill and melinda gates foundation picked up 14 000 acres of farmland for 171 million in 2018 one of the largest land deals of the year this was yet another transaction for the foundation that has been buying up acreage for years john hancock the prior owner more than doubled their money inside of 10 years on that holding not including the farm income not bad bill gates isn t the only one harvard has purportedly bought more than 800 000 hectares for more than 1 billion globally since the great recession there is quite a bit of so called smart money floating around this asset class and interest is on the rise for publicly traded reits however the focus is on acquiring family owned farms in the less than 50 million range these assets are likely too small for major funds on a single transaction basis but still provide a great opportunity for the buyers as some farmers look to monetize their holdings i have been bearish on many u s based agricultural stocks in recent years i m currently short deere corporation de and have been short other names in agricultural supply in the past quite profitably lindsay corporation lnn titan international twi the drivers of those shorts have been macro in nature deteriorating crop prices trade war impacts and the stressed balance sheet of the american farmer in many cases it also involved financial risk taking in lending to these farmers john deere financial i do not think being bearish on equipment makers while being bullish on farmland partners is an either or statement where i m at odds with myself by being long here beyond the differences in valuation and leverage profile farmers have always taken a long term view on the value of their holdings gyrations in crop prices have never deferred them from making investments in land but it does defer maintenance and large equipment purchases i think this is also a situation where more farmers might push more towards renting versus acquiring today the overwhelming majority of farmers own the land they work with those aforementioned capitalization rates that can get down in the 2 3 range for corn and soybeans it is relatively cheap on a cash basis to rent nearby property to try to drive out more farm scale backing into net asset value for anyone comfortable with the idea that farmland is going to continue appreciating at the value over the long term or at the bare minimum not lose value the opportunity to buy assets for nearly 50 cents on the dollar should be an appealing one source ireit management stated nav is 12 share or better using usda average land values source farmland partners q1 2019 conference call book value is closer to 9 50 share which is based on their cost basis based on book value the company is undervalued based on average land appreciation the company is even more undervalued given current trends in dispositions 37 million sold at an average of 10 above book source farmland partners 2019 reitweek presentation slide 13 there is some clear support for that above carried value case yeah michael but should we be extrapolating 36 million of sales to value a company at 1 2 billion sounds fishy what if they are being selective on sales i think investors should always be suspicious of nav and pay close attention so there are two key questions to answer management nav is based on the purchase price did the firm overpay what about overall asset quality what has been the historical premium discount to nav the fact that a reit trades at a discount to nav does not mean that the discount should close nav discounts can persist for a variety of reasons external management burdensome g a illiquid assets etc fair enough and i think that has been the major critique in its short growth fueled history there have been allegations that farmland partners has overpaid for lower quality assets while only management has the granular data on a property by property basis i think a reasonable approach to addressing asset quality is discovering whether the cash rents being received at farmland partners are in line or better on a state adjusted per acre basis assets earning above average rent per acre should will be higher quality than average if not why would farmers pay more for it given their already thin margins pretty simple thesis but one that holds water so how can we tell if farmland partners is earning above average rents on a state by state basis the usda provides this data source nass and i ve comped farmland partners acreage against that below source author calculations nearly universally farmland partners is generating above average rents on their land only a handful of states are weaker than that and luckily enough those are where the firm has very little exposure in the company s core areas constituting more than 50 of acreage and an even greater percentage of rents california the carolinas illinois farmland partners is generating well above expected rents that by itself speaks to the overall asset quality in place here in my view the company has been rather diligent in building a portfolio of institutional grade assets at formation ceo paul pittman stated that he intentionally held onto so called class c farmland personally instead selling the higher grade assets into the portfolio the goal has always been to have top tier assets within the portfolio even if that has not been communicated as well as it should have been over the years higher rents on average come down to location soil quality the specialty crop segment and an overall higher percentage of irrigated farmland which nearly universally fetches higher rents the carolinas and illinois areas where farmland partners generates higher rents is due to location soil quality and irrigation higher than average crop yields means higher than average money why is this important if farmland partners had just average assets they would be earning 20 million less per year in rents according to nass data that would be a significant haircut to the value of the portfolio given farmland is valued on a gross cap rate gross rents before divided by cap rate asset value what about california the largest delta from my table above comes from the golden state the bulk of this portfolio was acquired from american farmland in that merger and today all of the acreages in california is specialty crop driven looking for more details on these farms while farmland partners does not disclose these assets in detail american farmland did prior to their merger in the first quarter of 2016 american farmland acquired several properties for 65 million sun dial acquisition which farmed almonds lemons mandarins and other fresh citrus this was in addition to the other californian assets kimberly vineyards sandpiper ranch etc which were appraised at roughly 140 million as of 2016 source american farmland 2016 10 k page 13 so just like gladstone land american farmland used independent third party appraisals to keep an eye on its nav after the american farmland deal farmland partners buffeted its californian operations through the olam international acquisition 5 100 california acres for 110 million california is a healthy chunk of the implied valuation and if you think nav is overstated one would have to explain how two separate management teams with north of a century of farm ownership experience overpaid for these assets alongside poor prior independent appraisals but just like across the rest of the portfolio cap rate data supports the californian asset valuations given the disclosed gross rental cap rate of 6 for west coast specialty crops this area of the portfolio is now worth 313 million 18 8 million in gross rent valued at a 6 cap rate basically in line with the figures above 65 million for sun dial 140 million legacy american farmland appraisal 110 million for olam international it s strikingly close for good reason source farmland partners 2019 reitweek presentation slide 9 speaking of gross rental cap rate data based on nass data the average gross cap rate for farmland is 4 that is in line with the figure management is using above in its so called traditional approach to calculating nav with the big driver between 4 and 4 4 just due to those weaker cap rates on the west coast for those skeptical of management numbers those cap rates are in line with peer gladstone land which appraises its properties and provides the data to investors as of the first quarter of 2019 the appraised value of their portfolio was 620 million source gladstone land may 2019 investor presentation slide 21 that is a 5 4 gross cap rate yield a little higher than the metrics for farmland partners due to their greater exposure to specialty crops versus traditional row crops like soybeans which have much stronger cap rates on average for clarification on why row crops tend to trade more expensively than specialty crops do that comes down to useful life if we are talking about say almonds an almond tree has an average life span of 25 years or so this is inclusive of a short period early on when they do not generate any fruit at all almonds are not unique this is the case for other specialty crops as well including citrus there is a little more risk embedded in owning assets with decades long implied flows e g disease natural damage can devastate one of these farms and overall annual operating and harvesting costs tend to be higher for the farmer on the plus side specialty crops tend to trade on a slightly different cycle from what commodity crops do very true today given the pain among corn farmers in the midwest and revenue collection is at different times of the year since the bulk of farm rents are collected after harvest that reduces the lumpiness of earnings for a farmland asset manager the history of the nav discount what about the historical discount to nav at farmland partners the fact that a reit trades at a discount doesn t mean it will trade towards nav over the years reits have tended to average a mild discount to private asset value overall particularly among smaller reits where administrative expense drag and illiquidity both in the stock and in some areas of real estate have an impact farmland reits being a relatively new asset class does not help matters nor does the low daily trading volume which keeps some major institutions away while there is always some subjectivity to nav i ve pulled my view of how the stock has traded versus nav below to build this i used forward revenue estimates for the firm at the time important for when the company takes on additional debt equity to grow coupled with a shifting cap rate dependent on their asset mix which has seen some changes over the years source author calculations historically the firm has traded around that 15 20 discount to nav area that points to more than 40 upside to the share price today and i think bulls would speculate there is a solid case for a tighter discount to nav because of the asset divestiture share repurchase program that was put into place to address this growing issue management has communicated pretty well that the current 10 million quarter pace on land sales as a base case with that capital plowed back into the buybacks so long as this discount persists i think there is also some justification of a take private situation here either by the founder or a large investor with a very long time horizon endowment pension fund etc selloff creates opportunity the greater nav discount came about for a reason in july of 2018 a research note by rota fortunae hit seeking alpha causing a significant selloff in the shares farmland partners has since filed a lawsuit alleging that the research note was intentionally false and misleading written to profit directly from a large short position the author had built prior to release having spoken to paul pittman at length about this issue management intends to press this lawsuit for as long as it takes for those critical of management giving this much attention i think it s important to remember the heavy retail investor ownership and large hit to the valuation investors that were scared away by the report or even just saw the 40 intraday volatility and sold out of fear are unlikely to return it s done a lot of damage to the prospective base of stockholders as far as that short report goes allegations boiled down to a few key points failure to disclose that the firm s small mortgage lending program has made loans to prior and or current individuals that have ties to either farmland partners and or ceo paul pittman the allegation that those loans many of which ended up distressed were used to artificially inflate revenues because the firm often bought those assets prior to maturity and leased them back to the borrower at above market rates conjecture that farmland partners overpaid for properties calling into question how management calculates nav assuming fair value paid at acquisition plus average market appreciation coupled with other expenses transaction costs ongoing operating expense legal actual nav available to shareholders is materially lower going through this couple things on disclosure here since the short report came out farmland partners has filed its audited 10 k statement changes were minimal there has been no investigation formal or informal by the sec even though they are aware of the case this is something rota fortunae readily admits these loans do not meet the sec definition of a related party transaction to the counterpoint that information on loan status is relevant to investors i agree as far as whether they should have made these loans in the first place i also agree they should have probably just avoided doing so altogether i think the optics here were far more damaging than anything else with 12 million in principal outstanding as of the first quarter of 2019 we are talking about 0 32 share in a full write off the share price fell by more than 10 times that intraday on the report s release i think management is aware of this as well having underwritten just one small line of credit for 210 000 since the report s release even if the loans were viable and underwritten in good faith loans to business partners and acquaintances never go over well with the market as far as the allegation of rent inflation goes while rota fortunae claims up to 6 of 2017 revenue could be inflated the math there doesn t make sense the properties involved do not generate those kinds of rents we are talking about the supposition that two tenants out of more than 100 have above market rental contracts at the end of the day i think the story is pretty simple this is a small cap reit run by a management team with deep relationships in this space like many business owners family and friends get approached often because owners know their local markets better than those elsewhere paul pittman saw an opportunity to step in where other lenders would not on assets he knows i don t see any scheme here that was done to inflate farmland partners numbers remember we are one year post short report at this point in the first quarter farmland partners reported 10 9 million in revenue down 2 8 versus the prior year period however owned acreage was also down 2 1 as well the same property portfolio was reported to have rents up 2 3 versus a year ago 92 of the portfolio is now in the same property pool around one third of leases were rolled over this time frame if so called round tripping of revenue was necessary to keep revenue comps up because rents were above market why is the firm still comping this well particularly given the conjecture that many of these leases coming into renewal were above market to begin with given recent trends in cash rents what we have here is a situation where an incredibly small piece of a business a couple million dollars in gross loans and even smaller in terms of actual potential loss has destroyed hundreds of millions of dollars in market cap i understand avoiding these situations when management structure is not aligned with shareholders but insider ownership pittman owns 2 4 million shares a little more than 6 of the firm coupled with a land divestiture buyback program eliminates those concerns for me executive salary is not out of line either the ceo pulls down 1 1 million that figure is in line with both peers and small cap companies as a whole general and administrative expense which totaled only a little more than 7 million last year is also very light and compares favorably with other triple net lease reits of this size shareholders are not being bled dry and the ceo has a vested interest in seeing the share price head higher common versus preferreds eventual dilution investors have two choices here the common stock and the series b preferred fpi pb given the oscillations in the common stock and the present volatility i can understand the incentive to maybe take a little nibble a little higher in the capital stack doing so also builds in quite a bit of cushion on the nav story if i as an analyst think the nav is understated by this degree any investor should take solace in the asset backstop for the preferreds if something went awry and the structure was unwound i get the investment thesis but not at current prices the low 20s would be more attractive to me the life cycle of this security is rather interesting and also has some strong implications for the common as well which i think i need to go into in greater detail the series b preferreds were issued in august of 2017 and unlike the series a preferreds which came about in 2016 with the forsythe acquisition these series b preferreds pay double the coupon 6 versus 3 the series b was primarily issued to fund the olam acquisition which consisted of 5 100 acres of permanent crop farmland in california remember higher yields on these assets 6 cap rates on california crops investor comments on how these preferreds never made sense as an investment really misunderstand the value proposition while investors are right that cap rates of 3 4 are normal on row crops this security did make sense on a permanent crop buy adding scale at a time when management was on a growth path cash yields on olam likely are 6 and any property appreciation either buying at a discount or natural growth would have excess return here with the cash flow from the assets paying the coupon what i think created that misunderstanding is the participation component these preferreds have an interest in the overall appreciation in farmland fva across the entire farmland partners portfolio not just olam using nass state wide data which i actually used above in my nav calculation these preferreds get their par value adjusted upwards if farmland value tracks higher the state mix largely mirrored that of farmland partners at the time of issuance can find the breakdown here a rate of 2 fva which would be well below the historical pace would result in a liquidation preference of 26 50 share not 25 share that builds in a little extra upside to the preferreds than what might be present at first glance there is a good chance that buyers of the preferred today pick up 10 15 appreciation into redemption given the discount to likely eventual liquidation preference alongside the annual 6 coupon that isn t a bad value in my opinion at reitweek i spent a good bit of time speaking to paul pittman about these preferreds how they are treated and when has profound implications for the common stock there are two trigger points here after september 30 2024 the dividend rate ramps to 10 per annum on the initial liquidation preference plus the fva amount if any very heavy cost after september 30 2021 farmland partners may convert the entirety of the series b preferreds into common stock at a rate equal to the sum of the initial liquidation preference plus the fva amount very heavy dilution but could make sense this is important paul has always viewed these preferreds as essentially equity he made the decision to issue these securities in 2017 rather than selling common stock at a discount to nav back when the share price was at 9 share we are lower today still while not stating this directly i think the assumption was that eventually the nav story would play out farmland would continue to appreciate in value and he could then convert to common at his choosing when the timing is right a few years down the line that could happen at either of the two dates above for it to happen at the end of 2021 i think the common has to be above 9 share that was the hurdle point before and i think he would take the viewpoint that deferring another three years buys him some time to continue to work out the nav story via share buybacks by the time 2024 rolls around however these securities have to go away farmland partners cannot afford to pay out another 10 million annually and i think they would take the option to convert at that time in all but the most ludicrous of scenarios a question i ve gotten asked is why are they not buying more of the series b preferred in the open market i think that s a volume situation they have bought the preferreds but average volume tends to be pretty light if they became a consistent material buyer they would not be getting much of a deal when faced with the value proposition of either buying the preferred to pick up maybe 10 12 compound annual return capital gains plus distribution or buying the common at a 40 50 discount to nav immediately paul pittman is going to choose the common every time commentary from the third quarter 2017 conference call the first after the issuance of these proceeds spells out his views pretty clearly here i think a lot of people frankly misunderstand and miss and look at the preferred in the wrong way the preferred is fundamentally equity i don t have to pay the dividend i can convert it to common equity if i choose i d rather issue plain old common equity don t get me wrong but i d rather issue that preferred than issue plain old common equity at 9 a share in my view i think i d much rather be aligned with the common today the ceo has a large stake here one that will only grow with time as the buybacks continue along with the impact of stock options and straight up open market purchases i do agree there is significant risk via the timing of the conversions above it s likely the common will react negatively to being diluted heavily 15 million to 20 million shares if the option to convert in 2021 is exercised the price is based on the 10 day volume weighted average price vwap prior to the conversion not after owners of the preferred might get converted to common on an assumed stock price of say 10 share and then be met with 8 share or lower prices a lot of preferred investors do not own common stock and many funds invested in farmland partners would be forced to liquidate with no regard to price leverage is a touch high here even taking nav at face value what i ll call loan to value debt plus preferreds gross asset value is in the 67 range gladstone land is below that and most reits are going to target something more in the 50 range if not lower that could change with time land appreciation but absent a massive rally in farm prices or a significant divestiture i do not think they can roll those preferreds into debt at a reasonable cost dilution to get rid of the preferreds is likely but that does not change the nav story at all which i think is important to emphasize this the below shows just how much value can be created by the current strategy on a nav per share basis even if nominal reported numbers shrink due to divestitures there is a reason management is hard pursuing this strategy buybacks create a lot of value source author calculations assumptions 52 million base revenue in 2019 excludes some crop share and one time items asset sales of 40 million per year at 4 5 cap rates 1 8 million revenue impact per year 1 same property cash rent increases below historic levels straight lined nav calculated based on gross rents at 4 5 cap rates current blended market average 10 million per year of sale proceeds go to debt reduction to keep leverage flat preferreds outstanding remains stable share buybacks done at an average price of 7 share in 2019 7 50 share in 2020 8 share in 2021 and 8 50 share in 2021 price target based on historical discount to nav in line with other small cap reits that are viewed as mediocre management can increase per share nav by 30 by 2022 even during a very bearish outlook for farmland price appreciation remember that no five year period has ever seen negative land returns and that average appreciation has been in the 5 range while a lot of that has been due to the long term trends in bond yields 1 annual growth remains a very conservative assumption we upgrade to strong spec buy there is no question that the rota fortunae short report did untold damage to the share price and market perception yet the allegations that the fpi lending program was being used to falsify revenues is pretty much dead in the water given the comp growth today with that program all but dead at this point it turns out this was just a simply a case of management underwriting loans to individuals where they should have avoided it due to the relationships in place source ireit that was a mistake but it wasn t a game changing mistake in many ways the current situation is an opportunity allowing management to unwind portions of its portfolio and invest itself at a compelling valuation discount leverage remains manageable costs are low and for those that take an opposite view of my own overall sentiment could improve dramatically if row crop pricing turns positive we like the story here and think it makes sense as a strong speculative reit buy we recently added farmland partners to our small cap reit portfolio and our new money portfolio recognize that this reit is a small cap and trading could become more volatile our small cap reit portfolio performance is up 41 6 since inception vs vanguard real estate etf vnq author s note brad thomas is a wall street writer and that means he s not always right

for more than four months haitians have been taking to the streets to demand the resignation of president jovenel moïse amid allegations he embezzled hundreds of thousands of dollars of government funds earmarked for badly needed social programs a damning report on government corruption delivered to the haitian senate by official auditors on may 31 has triggered fresh demonstrations with thousands marching through the capital port au prince and other cities throughout june on june 20 a delegation from the organization of american states traveled to haiti in hopes of the political temperature an official told the miami herald one government program petrocaribe is at the center of the 600 page report and protesters anger under petrocaribe a strategic oil alliance signed with nearby venezuela in 2006 haiti the poorest country in the americas saved precious dollars by borrowing fuel from its oil rich neighbor and deferring payment for up to 25 years governments were supposed to use the extra money to develop the economy and fund social programs instead at least 2 billion equivalent to almost a quarter of haiti s total economy for 2017 went missing and haitians saw few of the promised benefits according to protesters and local media haitian taxpayers still owe venezuela billions of dollars for the borrowed oil the scandal has become a rallying cry for anti corruption activists many of whom call themselves petrochallengers here s what to know about petrocaribe and how it helped spark haiti s protests what is petrocaribe venezuela s former president hugo chávez set up petrocaribe in 2005 venezuela has the world s largest proven oil reserves and in the mid 2000 s long before its current economic collapse the country was producing around 2 5 million barrels of oil per day chávez wanted to convert those resources into greater regional influence and win allies against the u s in the organization of american states the petrocaribe program was effectively a way for venezuela to give other countries development loans except it loaned oil instead of cash venezuela s state oil company sold oil to haiti and 17 other caribbean countries and allowed them to defer payment on 40 of what they bought for up to 25 years charging a low rate of interest for the debt recipient governments then sold that oil and used the proceeds to pay for social programs with global oil prices at record levels in the early years of the program the oil sales generated a lot of cash the program suffered after venezuela s economy began to break down in 2014 as a drop in the oil price laid bare the effects of years of corruption and mismanagement venezuela s oil production is down to 830 000 barrels a day and it stopped fulfilling its petrocaribe commitments to haiti last year reuters reports haiti is one of the most vulnerable members of the petrocaribe agreement according to analysts at the economist intelligence unit and it is now suffering fuel shortages as a result of the program s decline what happened to petrocaribe in haiti in haiti the petrocaribe money was precious particularly after the 2010 earthquake that killed more than 200 000 people and led to a still ongoing cholera outbreak the government was supposed to use it to fund infrastructure and healthcare projects it claimed to have funded around 400 such projects using almost 4 billion dollars raised by petrocaribe oil between 2008 and 2016 but a lack of visible results sparked suspicion and in november 2017 a five person commission in the haitian senate investigated the program and reported evidence of widespread corruption in the use of the funds under three successive governments during that period the amount of money in government coffers was misreported exchange rates were adjusted and more than half of the contracts given to companies to service the projects did not go through the usual government bid process according to the report because the money was not from a conventional international aid package analysts say there was little oversight of how governments spent the proceeds and few conditions on what they could do with it leaving ample opportunity for corruption the missing funds became a simmering political scandal but the corruption didn t spark protest until after summer 2018 when inflation was spiraling and government plans to raise fuel taxes caused violent protests gilbert mirambeau a haitian videographer living in canada tweeted his frustration at haiti s economic situation with a photo of himself blindfolded asking in creole where is the petrocaribe money other social media users wondering the same thing helped spread the hashtags kotkòbpetwokaribea pwosèpetrocaribea meaning prosecute those involved in petrocaribe petrocaribechallenge and rallies began taking place in cities around haiti demanding the resignation of politicians implicated in the ongoing investigation including moïse petrocaribe is partly a cipher for haiti s widespread and deep rooted corruption problem the country is ranked 161 of 180 countries on watchdog group transparency international s annual corruption perceptions index and questions have also been raised about the destination of up to 13 billion in international aid sent to the country after its 2010 earthquake the world bank says corruption is a fundamental cause of haiti s staggering levels of poverty how is president moïse involved in the petrocaribe scandal moïse took office in february 2017 after the period the petrocaribe investigations looked at but the report published may 31 the second phase of a three part investigation alleges that he helped embezzle funds from a large petrocaribe project before he came to office when he was head of the company agritrans agritrans was paid around 700 000 to repair some roads even though its entire businesses was growing bananas on june 12 moïse denied any wrongdoing and reiterated that he will not step down despite the ongoing protests i m looking you in the eye today to say your president whom you voted for is not guilty of corruption he said at a press conference adding that those who had misused state funds would be brought to justice in a fair equitable trial without political persecution
with brent d griffiths the ticker megabanks all sailed through the first half of their annual stress test from the federal reserve last week but industry watchdogs say the results should not assuage

rather the exam has gotten easier part of a broader trump era push to roll back the post crisis rules governing the financial sector the results confirm that our financial system remains resilient fed vice chairman randal quarles who has led the central bank s effort to relax the tests said in a friday afternoon statement the nation s largest banks are significantly stronger than before the crisis and would be well positioned to support the economy even after a severe shock advertisement the test the first version of which was deployed in the teeth of the financial crisis in 2009 aims to ensure that the biggest banks have a sufficient capital cushion to withstand a severe economic shock without presenting a risk to the rest of the system the fed splits the test into two parts the quantitative portion the results of which it released friday after the market close evaluates the preparedness of banks for different kinds of potential downturns the second portion set for release on thursday examines each bank s plans to pay out dividends or buy back stocks but the first half of the test presented the biggest hurdle and no banks are in serious jeopardy of failing now by some

burden it has largely eliminated the qualitative objection which allowed officials to flunk institutions that couldn t demonstrate an adequate grasp of the risks they faced it has released details of

slowdown has become more acute now that the stimulus from the 2017 tax legislation has run its course meanwhile u s equity markets have remained frothy since our initial commentary and there are added risks associated with the rise of newer forms of debt including in many emerging markets where much borrowing is denominated in foreign currencies with central banks ability to serve as lenders of last resort increasingly constrained illiquid financial markets are vulnerable to flash crashes and other disruptions one such disruption could come from president donald trump who may be tempted to create a foreign policy crisis wag the dog with a country like iran that might bolster his domestic poll numbers but it could also trigger an oil shock beyond the u s the fragility of growth in debt ridden china and some other emerging markets remains a concern as do economic policy financial and political risks in europe worse across the advanced economies the policy toolbox for responding to a crisis remains limited the monetary and fiscal interventions and private sector backstops used after the 2008 financial crisis simply cannot be deployed to the same effect today the tenth factor that we considered was the federal reserve s interest rate policy after hiking rates in response to the trump administration s pro cyclical fiscal stimulus the fed partially reversed course in january looking ahead the fed and other major central banks are more likely to cut rates to manage various shocks to the global economy while trade wars and potential oil spikes constitute a supply side risk they also threaten aggregate demand and thus consumption growth because tariffs and higher fuel prices reduce disposable income with so much uncertainty companies will likely opt to reduce capital spending and investment under these conditions a severe enough shock could usher in a global recession even if central banks respond rapidly after all in 2007 2009 the fed and other central banks reacted aggressively to the shocks that triggered the global financial crisis but they did not avert the great recession today the fed is starting with a benchmark policy rate of 2 25 2 5 compared to 5 25 in september 2007 in europe and japan central banks are already in negative rate territory and will face limits on how much further below the zero bound they can go and with bloated balance sheets from successive rounds of quantitative easing qe central banks would face similar constraints if they were to return to large scale asset purchases on the fiscal side most advanced economies have even higher deficits and more public debt today than before the global financial crisis leaving little room for stimulus spending and as rosa and i argued last year financial sector bailouts will be intolerable in countries with resurgent populist movements and near insolvent governments among the risks that could trigger a recession in 2020 the sino american trade and technology war deserves special attention the conflict could escalate further in several ways the trump administration could decide to extend tariffs to the 300 billion worth of chinese exports not yet affected or prohibiting huawei and other chinese firms from using u s components could trigger a full scale process of de globalization as companies scramble to secure their supply chains were that to happen china would have several options for retaliating against the u s such as by closing its market to u s multinationals like apple under such a scenario the shock to markets around the world would be sufficient to bring on a global crisis regardless of what the major central banks do with the current tensions already denting business consumer and investor confidence and slowing global growth further escalation would tip the world into a recession and given the scale of private and public debt another financial crisis would likely follow from that both trump and chinese president xi jinping know that it is in their countries interest to avoid a global crisis so they have an incentive to find a compromise in the next few months yet both sides are still ratcheting up nationalist rhetoric and pursuing tit for tat measures trump and xi each seem to think that his country s long term economic and national security may depend on his not blinking in the face of a new cold war and if they each genuinely believe the other will blink first the risk of a ruinous clash is high indeed it is possible that trump and xi will meet for talks during the g 20 summit on june 28 29 in osaka but even if they do agree to restart negotiations a comprehensive deal to settle their many points of contention would be a long way off as the two sides drift further apart the space for compromise is shrinking and the risk of a global recession and crisis in an already fragile global economy is rising source marketwatch

move seen as bid to support fledgling new currency that s been roiled by black market speculation harare zimbabwe in a bid to defend its fledgeling new currency against black market speculation zimbabwe s finance minister mthuli ncube on monday outlawed the use of the united states dollar and a host of other foreign currencies in local transactions in 2009 zimbabwe allowed the us dollar and other foreign currencies to be used as legal tender in the country after hyperinflation decimated the value of the zimbabwean dollar earlier this year to pave the way towards ending so called dollarisation the country laid the foundations for a new zimbabwean dollar by introducing an interim currency the real time gross settlement dollar rtgs or zollar but since its launch in february the rtgs has struggled amid black market speculation that has seen its value slide sharply against the us dollar monday s government decree values the rtgs at par with the zimbabwe dollar and mandates it be used as the country s sole legal tender for local transactions with immediate effect the british pound united states dollar south african rand botswana pula and any other foreign currency whatsoever shall no longer be legal tender alongside the zimbabwe dollar in any transactions in zimbabwe read the decree but some believe the measure will not arrest the decline of the rtgs i think its ridiculous measure said eddie cross an economist and founding member of the movement for democratic change the main opposition party in zimbabwe the exchange rate will run and this is completely out of sync for heaven s sake this is economic sabotage i hope people will not go on the street tomorrow this is just catastrophic cross told al jazeera independent economist victor bhoroma said businesses with debts denominated in foreign currencies could see the cost of servicing those obligations soar it means that all debts contracted in usd are now payable in the local currency bhoromoa told al jazeera all products and services that were being indexed in usd ie insurance and property since it was legal tender will now be indexed in local zimbabwean dollar bhoroma warned that this could trigger a spate of defaults and litigation against both businesses and the government he added that businesses are unlikely to use the official exchange rate to price their products which negatively impact supply as producers adopt a wait and see attitude since taking over as finance minister ncube has hinted at currency reforms and the introduction of a full fledged currency monday s decree is believed to be part of those reform efforts but some economists are sceptical whether it can stop the country from gravitating back towards foreign currencies definitely it is an attempt to stop redollarisation said bhoromoa however dollarisation has many levels zimbabwe will still be in de facto dollarisation as long as inflation levels for the zimbabwean dollar are very high and in the absence of confidence in government institutions
africa moyo deputy news editor industrialists labour and economists have thrown their weight behind currency reforms which culminated in the scrapping of the multi currency system on local transactions saying it was a great move that brings stability in the economy through statutory instrument 142 of 2019 government announced yesterday that it was abandoning the multiple currency regime and allow all local transactions to be conducted in the zimbabwe dollar the move brings everyone into the economy as some were beginning to be disenfranchised by businesses that are pricing in foreign currency primarily the united states dollar businessman and former zimbabwe national chamber of commerce zncc president mr davison norupiri told the herald last night that the scrapping of the multi currency system was a good move generally i think it is a very good move which brings back normalcy in the economy said mr norupiri where we were going as a country was becoming uncontrollable in terms of pricing in terms of costing of goods by industry and in terms of inflation simply because the economy was self dollarising so the fact that the economy was self dollarising meant that the us dollar was now in the hands of a few people and many people didn t have access to the us dollar and things were now becoming very difficult and very expensive for ordinary citizens mr norupiri added that the move by reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz governor dr john mangudya to buttress the policy pronouncements were also critical in turning around the fortunes of companies i think the situation whereby all the legacy debts are going to be paid on a 1 1 is a very big plus to business businesses are going to wipe off their legacy debts if they have enough rtgs balances and businesspeople can start on a new slate if you also look at the banking sector there is a 50 percent interest that has been highlighted in the rbz circular and i believe this is going to see bankers redeeming some value from loans because the rate of inflation meant that what one borrowed would be meaningless in terms of repayments say after six months so borrowers had advantage but the announcement by the rbz governor dr mangudya brings back normalcy in terms of lending i think the minister of finance prof ncube has done the right thing because where we were going it was only the fittest who were making it and they were very few yes it may be tough to adjust now but it is much better than there recession we were headed to which would have been difficult to move out of so i want to applaud the minister and the governor for their interventions said mr norupiri economist mr persistence gwanyanya said the removal of the multiple currency system would be central to re industrialisation which was elusive under a us dollar environment i think it s an issue of finishing a journey that government started government had undertaken to introduce a local currency that was the journey and finally we have arrived said mr gwanyanya he added that any responsible government would have adopted the same move to prevent economic implosion that was being driven by the loss of value of the local unit due to market manipulation by parallel market forex dealers mr gwanyanya said the decision by rbz to increase forex on the interbank and issue lcs would be a soft landing measure to avoid economic shocks in addition the pushing up of interest rates on borrowing to 50 percent is expected to stamp out borrowing for speculative purposes the country s second biggest labour representative body the zimbabwe federation of trade unions zftu s secretary general cde kennias shamuyarira overwhelmingly welcomed the move by government cde shamuyarira added that they acknowledge the role of the rbz in buttressing si 142 of 2019 adding that the move will correct the black market exchange rate distortions that eroded the purchasing power of rtgs dollars confederation of zimbabwe industries czi president mr henry ruzvidzo last night said he needed to digest the measures before commenting
eu leaders fail to agree on top jobs at council a meeting of the european council this week failed to come to an agreement on which candidates should fill the positions of european commission president president of the european council president of the european central bank and high representative for foreign affairs the post of european parliament president though not a matter for the council is also taken into account the need to create a balance across political groups geographic distribution and gender has proved particularly challenging as political consensus has become harder to find though the european people s party came first in the european parliament elections their lead candidate for commission president manfred weber is manifestly unpopular with both the other groups in the parliament and with a number of national leaders finding a candidate for the commission presidency in particular is not being helped by division within the european parliament where each group is so far only backing its respective lead candidate as they have failed to agree on a common position boris johnson still leads to be next uk prime minister the uk conservative party s leadership contest has now finished its first phase with the votes among mps cutting down the number of candidates to just two boris johnson and current uk foreign minister jeremy hunt as a committed brexiteer and the face of the vote leave campaign johnson remains the favourite to win the leadership of the party hunt though he has since converted fully to brexit backed remain in 2016 and his approach to brexit is seen as too close to theresa may s to allow him to really win over many supporters within the conservative party membership a recent poll estimated that conservative members would prefer to see brexit go ahead even if it meant scotland leaving the uk 63 to 29 northern ireland leaving the uk 59 to 28 or even the end of the party 54 to 36 poland s conservatives look to clamp down on foreign owned media the polish governing party law and justice has set out plans to repolonise the media in the country significant parts of polish media are owned by german and american companies and the government has often accused these groups who tend to be critical of the government of representing foreign interests journalists with these groups have criticised the government idea and argue it is an attempt to clamp down on freedom of speech and restrict the power of the media to hold the government to account potentially heading to a situation like hungary where independent media has been all but wiped out the plan is provoking concern not just with the eu but also in washington in spite of law and justice s attempts to build close relationships with the trump administration trump attacks competitive euro this week president of the european central bank mario draghi gave a speech where he confirmed that the ecb would cut interest rates or buy eurozone government debt if economic growth became too weak while completely within the remit of the ecb and an expected position from draghi the effect on the markets was to slightly drop the value of the euro against the dollar donald trump took to twitter to attack this situation effectively arguing that the ecb was unfairly manipulating the currency markets in order to make the euro more competitive it is not the first time that trump has attacked europe for its trade position relative to the united states just recently describing the euro as devalued in response to a bloomberg article on overtourism in europe the tone of trump s criticism of european trade and monetary policy is heavily reminiscent of the us president s approach to china even though european policy is very different and much more market driven than its chinese counterpart russians charged for the downing of malaysia airlines flight mh17 on wednesday prosecutors in the netherlands announced that they will be charging four suspects including three russian nationals for the downing of malaysia airlines flight mh17 in 2014 the murder charges come as the men are suspected of using a missile launcher to murder the 298 on board of the plane plus its crew over eastern ukraine the flight was en route from amsterdam to kuala lumpur when it was shut down giving jurisdiction to a dutch investigation team by their names igor girkin sergey dubinskiy and oleg pulatov and ukrainian national leonid kharchenko the four men now have arrest warrants out and are thought to be currently residing in russia the latter in eastern ukraine moreover the russians were part of the russian intelligence services and are thought to have armed the separatists in eastern ukraine with the buk missiles that brought the plane down ecj blocks germany s autobahn tax this week the european court of justice responded to a complaint filed by austria regarding germany s plan to enact a tax cut and leave foreigners to pay the highway taxes alone thus breaking eu rules germany along with a few other eu countries does not charge motorists for using highways maintaining them through taxes but germans sometimes complain about foreigners using the autobahns for free since they don t pay taxes in germany and so the csu ally to merkel s christian democratic union drafted a new plan to tax foreigners as well despite the opposition of the chancellor the plan would have had german registered cars to be charged 130 a year with the cost deducted from road taxes non german drivers would have been able to buy vignettes for shorter periods but wouldn t get a rebate this would be indirect discrimination on grounds of nationality said the ecj not to mention a breach in the freedom of movement berlin freezes rents for 1 5

this is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated as the united states nears its longest economic expansion on record it s tempting to proclaim that all the problems brought about by the great recession have been fixed that would be wrong despite the currently healthy economic figures from unemployment to foreclosure rates under the surface the country still bears bruises from the financial crisis some of them may never heal without a targeted treatment plan here s what s still ailing america after ten years on the mend 1 wins for big cities losses for small towns the recession and its aftermath shifted the geography of prosperity in america and workers still haven t caught up manufacturing employment which had been in decline since the 1980s dropped suddenly between 2007 and 2009 as factories failed that left towns in michigan ohio and upstate new york gasping those places were hit harder by the recession and are slower to recover than the national average said dave swenson an economics professor at iowa state university in a double whammy for residents of declining towns the places where new opportunities arose bigger cities like san francisco and new york didn t add nearly enough apartments after the housing crisis to keep up with demand wage gains in big cities have concentrated at the top so even if you found a mid skill job serving the tech or financial industries moving to take that job was financially impossible the cost of living in core metro areas has just become prohibitive swenson said it s slowed some of that migration into the most urban areas 2 state budgets atrophied state and local tax revenues took a massive hit during the recession and were only partially backfilled by federal grants forcing widespread layoffs that weakened all manner of public services on the surface according to the pew charitable trusts tax collections have recovered in 2018 revenues across all 50 states exceeded their 2008 levels by 13 4 however states have also had to cope with rising costs particularly for medicaid that s made it more difficult to allocate funds for other priorities state spending on infrastructure as a share of gross domestic product is as low as it s been in 50 years pew found and state governments have 132 300 fewer non education employees than they did in 2008 funding for schools also remains short twenty nine states are now spending less per k 12 pupil than they did in 2008 and state spending on higher education is 13 lower as public universities have shifted the tuition burden on to students which one study found reduced degree attainment among both graduates and undergraduates 3 the mixed blessing of low interest rates to keep money circulating after the financial crisis the federal reserve cut short term interest rates to near zero in late 2008 and didn t start raising them until 2015 that unprecedented action along with several rounds of bond purchases known as quantitative easing pushed cash into the economy and fueled an epic stock market recovery but just like taking painkillers for too long can have side effects the fed s monetary policy remedy gave rise to some unintended consequences for example low bond yields led the big funds that control trillions in investment to put their money into private equity and hedge funds that paid high rates as a result initial public offerings which allow a wider group of people to benefit from the creation of new businesses virtually dried up meanwhile low interest rates have been bad news for pension funds which mostly depend on bond yields in order to remain solvent public pensions assets amounted to just 66 of their liabilities in 2016 down from 86 in 2007 according to the pew charitable trusts for the 100 largest private pensions that ratio was 87 1 in 2018 according to the actuarial firm milliman compared to 105 7 in 2007 for retirees counting on fixed income securities like government bonds low interest rates can also mean a lower standard of living low interest rates while they have a lot of benefits have a lot of costs for society as well said kevin kliesen an economist at the federal reserve bank of st louis and that s just short term rates which the fed controls directly long term interest rates were in decline before the financial crisis and the ensuing recession depressed them even further fed officials are now struggling to nudge inflation up to their 2 target those low interest rates may be sapping the economy of its vitality one study published this year found that they give larger firms a greater incentive to invest than smaller ones that fuels market concentration and reduces business dynamism that is the ability of startups to disrupt incumbents as interest rates go down they disproportionately favor market leaders as opposed to market followers said atif mian a finance professor at princeton university who coauthored the study that effect he found is large enough for low interest rates to not have any expansionary effect on the economy any more 4 a hobbled generation in any downturn the worst hit group is the one just starting out a study published this year by economists at stanford and the university of california los angeles found that people entering the labor market during recessions have lower lifetime earnings especially if they have only a high school education they also have higher death rates in mid life the great recession which was unusually deep and prolonged is having a lasting effect on young people who graduated from college in 2010 and 2011 employment and earnings are lower among those classes found university of california berkeley economist jesse rothstein as they move on to the age when previous generations bought houses and had kids those markers of adulthood are less attainable and not because millennials don t want them rather the federal reserve found they have fewer assets to work with and higher student debt 5 the shadow of fear however persistent the financial effects of the recession may be the psychological effects fade even more slowly people who lived through times of high local and national unemployment spend less money and use more coupons than those who weren t personally affected even if they earn the same amount a 2018 study by researchers at the university of california berkeley found the recession also caused an increase in suicides especially in rural areas and among women americans perceptions of their own financial situations have been slow to recover in a survey by bankrate 23 of respondents said they were worse off than they were before the economy collapsed that sentiment however isn t purely dependent on material well being a study published in the journal plos one found that the psychological pain of a financial loss is greater than the psychic benefit of an equivalent gain since the recession there has been more of a disconnect between peoples perceptions and their actual economic conditions said dana glei a georgetown university sociologist who co authored that study glei thinks that may have had to do with the spread of social media which allows people to compare themselves to people who appear to be in better financial shape and it probably exacerbates the political division already fomented by rising income inequality when people find someone to blame for their adverse economic fortunes it raises issues of status anxiety glei says people are cutting in line and i m being left behind

required message you have entered an invalid email address from email required message required the u s stock market capped a day of listless trading with modest losses monday as investors focused on upcoming trade talks between the u s and china the major stock indexes drifted between small gains and losses for much of the day though smaller company stocks had their worst day since may the losses erased some of the market s solid gains from last week when the benchmark s p 500 index closed at an all time high the muted trading came as investors looked ahead to a highly anticipated meeting between the leadership of the u s and china later this week the world s two largest economies have been embroiled in a trade war that has taken the market on a volatile roller coaster ride this year and wall street is hoping for a deal the market right now seems to be pricing in some combination of at least a de escalation between the u s and china from a trade standpoint to the point where it doesn t drive us into a recession said michael crook head of americas investment strategy at ubs global wealth management the s p 500 index slipped 5 11 points or 0 2 to 2 945 35 the index is about 0 3 below the record high it set on thursday the dow jones industrial average rose 8 41 points or less than 0 1 to 26 727 54 the nasdaq composite dropped 26 01 points or 0 3 to 8 005 70 the russell 2000

year investors have been reassured by statements from the federal reserve this month that suggest the central bank is prepared to cut interest rates in response to a slowing global economy even so traders remain concerned that corporate profits might suffer should the kind of economic slowdown that would prompt the fed to cut rates take hold trade policy remains the biggest source of uncertainty looming over the market worries about the dispute and its potential impact on global economic growth sent the broader market on a bumpy ride during the second quarter as the tensions escalated presidents donald trump and xi jinping plan to meet at the group of 20 summit in japan which starts friday wall street is once again hoping that the two sides can find a path to making a deal that will end their trade war the two sides are in a stalemate after 11 rounds of talks that have failed to overcome u s concerns over china s acquisition of american technology and its massive trade surplus china denies forcing u s companies to hand over trade secrets and says the surplus is much smaller than it appears health care stocks accounted for a big share of the selling monday led by a slide in shares of pharmaceutical giant bristol myers squibb the stock fell after the company said it would divest its blockbuster psoriasis treatment otezla as part of a push to win regulatory

trade tensions the yield on the 10 year treasury note fell to 2 02 from 2 06 late friday the pricing in the bond market right now does indicate that it wouldn t take much to create a recession if we had some bad policy mistake either from the fed or from a trade standpoint crook said traders welcomed news that eldorado resorts has agreed to buy casino operator caesars entertainment in a cash and stock deal valued at 17 3 billion the deal creates a casino giant with about 60 casinos and resorts in 16 states under a single name caesars has been struggling since emerging from bankruptcy in 2017

legal think tank veritas zimbabwe says regulations outlawing the use of foreign currency for local transaction were hastily concocted and might not stop the downward spiral of the local currency which has plunged to record levels over the past few weeks zimbabwe today outlawed the use of the british pound the united states dollar the south african rand and the botswana pula as legal tender saying the zimbabwe dollar which is in the form of the bond notes and rtgs dollars is the only legal tender the government however allowed people to retain their foreign currency accounts veritas said the new law did not actually ban businesses from pricing their goods in us dollars according to marketwatch the united states dollar traded at 6 32 on the interbank market 10 32 to the bond note 12 9 to the rtgs dollar and 11 08 on the old mutual implied rate below is the full commentary only rtgs dollars are legal tender this morning an important statutory instrument was published in a government gazette extraordinary the reserve bank of zimbabwe legal tender regulations 2019 si 142 of 2019 the instrument can be viewed on the veritas website the effect of the instrument is that from today only rtgs dollars whether in the form of bond notes or coins or electronic currency are legal tender in zimbabwe all other currencies the instrument specifically mentions us dollars british pounds south african rands and botswana pula are no longer legal tender the instrument states that it is not intended to affect nostro fca accounts and the use of foreign currency in those accounts to make payments overseas nor does it affect the obligation to pay duties and taxes in foreign currency where required under the customs and excise act and the value added tax act effect of the si the si is not so far reaching as its makers perhaps intended as we pointed out in our bill watch 15 of the 21st march 2019 legal tender means a currency which if offered in payment of a debt discharges the debt unless the creditor and the debtor have specifically agreed otherwise so if a debtor owes a creditor 20 say the debtor can normally repay the debt by offering 20 in rtgs dollars because they are legal tender if however the parties have agreed that the debt should be repaid in us dollars then the debtor must repay it in those dollars there is no law in zimbabwe which invalidates a contract that stipulates payment in a foreign currency similarly there is no law in zimbabwe that requires prices to be marked up in legal tender or accounts to be drawn up in legal tender the new instrument does not specifically forbid contracts that require payments to be made or calculated in a foreign currency so if shopkeepers mark their prices in us dollars say or insist on payment in that currency there is nothing to stop them doing so the instrument has all the hallmarks of a hastily concocted measure to stop the downward spiral of the rtgs dollar against other currencies whether it will have any such effect remains to be seen 385 views
pound to canadian dollar rate forecasts downgraded at bmo image adobe images bmo forecasts downgraded amid cad strength gbp weakness cad capitalises on us yield retreat as politics weigh on the gbp gbpcad faces losses before end june and heading into year end the pound faces a months long period of confinement to its current depressed levels against the canadian dollar according to the latest forecasts from the toronto headquartered bmo capital markets which have been downgraded due to a strong performance from the loonie in recent months bmo capital markets canada s fourth largest lender has upgraded some of its forecasts for the canadian dollar because of the loonie s strong performance over the last month which has seen the currency benefit from strong economic data as well as a downturn in u s dollar exchange rates canada s currency is still the best performer in the g10 league table for 2019 after having knocked pound sterling off its perch back in may now the british currency s fortune is going from bad to worse and the canadian unit is holding its own in a market that s undergoing a regime change we have moved our 1m view down to 1 32 due to the collapsing interest rate differential and rising pressure on long usdcad positions says greg anderson head of fx strategy at bmo in a note to clients event risk hedging prior to october s canadian election is likely to be cad negative in the july september period although we think the election could flip and became a cad positive factor by the time we get to october above u s canadian 2 year yield gap alongside usd cad black line left axis at daily intervals statistics canada data showed last week that canadians continued to put their hands in their pockets in order to spend on the high street in april while other figures have also recently shown the unemployment rate falling to a fresh record low while inflation has picked up sharply the combination of those figures suggest the economy is still doing well and could mean the bank of canada boc would find it difficult to justify cutting its interest rate in the near future which is important for markets given the current international backdrop canada s currency is riding high and its economy motoring along at the same time that financial markets are betting heavily the u s federal reserve will cut its interest rate as many as three times before the year is out that led canadian government bond yields to rise and u s yields to fall so that the additional return earned by investors who buy bonds in america rather than canada has now reduced notably since the beginning of may this has dragged the usd cad rate lower and pushed up most other canadian exchange rates including the pound to canadian dollar rate bmo s anderson says these factors could continue supporting the loonie for a while yet usdcad is far out of alignment with its 2y interest rate differential see chart even if that interest rate differential rebounds a bit usdcad would need to come lower to re establish it previous alignment anderson writes canada s dollar is one of the few currencies to have capitalised on a deteriorating outlook for the u s economy and federal reserve interest rate policy while pound sterling has been deprived of the same level of support by the brexit farce recently seen in the uk parliament and by the ongoing conservative leadership election above bmo capital markets graph showing usd cad alongside u s canada yield differential the pound s troubles are not yet over according to anderson s european counterpart stephen gallo who projects more losses for sterling over the coming months as the uk heads for a no deal brexit or for a general election that risks handing 10 downing street to an openly marxist opposition party we think the balance of domestic international factors favours a move to 1 23 in gbpusd over the coming 3m our longstanding position has been that some combination of a no deal brexit and or early elections will continue to weigh on the gbp so we continue to expect a political risk discount to remain embedded in the currency as far out as the 6m part of the curve gallo writes in a may review of the pound sterling outlook meanwhile canada s loonie could see further gains this year especially if the opposition conservative party tables a pro business manifesto that includes tax cuts and solutions designed to make the country more competitive canada s economy has lost competitiveness in the wake of president donald trump s mammoth programme of tax cuts which almost cut the corporate tax rate in half while also handing a sizeable chunk of wages and salaries back to the average worker with the u s being canada s largest trade partner while located just across the border not to mention inside of the tariff busting north american free trade area some economists have feared that canada could lose out over the long term if its tax policies do not keep pace with those across the southern border an average of the 8 opinion polls taken in june regarding october s canadian election has the conservative party 5 ahead the conservatives have yet to release a detailed economic platform but that should happen at some stage if it involves tax cuts and if the final debate regards competing competitiveness plans cad could rally hard anderson says above pound to canadian dollar rate shown at daily intervals bmo forecasts the pound to canadian dollar rate will fall from 1 68 monday to 1 65 by the end of june and that it will remain around that level until the final quarter of the year when it is expected to drop further to 1 64 the september to december forecasts are downgrades from earlier projections of 1 68 and 1 72 respectively the usd cad rate on the other hand is projected to end the june month at its current level of 1 32 before rising to 1 34 in september ahead of the october election and then falling back to 1 32 the exchange rate is forecast to fall to 1 31 by march 2020 and 1 30 by june 2020

the canadian dollar fell on friday with the release of retail sales showing a lower than expected gain in both core and headline data the loonie will end up the trading week by gaining 1 45 percent against the us dollar the fed signalled at the end of its june federal open market committee fomc meeting that the central bank is ready to cut interest rates oil prices surged as the dollar retreated as geopolitical risks and a refinery fire in the us will impact global supplies gold was also bid as investors sought the metal as an alternative asset class offering refuge from rising uncertainty the bank of canada boc is part of the dovish choir of major central banks but with inflation pushing higher it has not signalled it is ready to start easing its monetary policy in the short term the interest rate divergence will shrink with the us benchmark as the fed could try to be pro active although a fruitful meeting between presidents trump and xi could remove some of the pessimism inside the american central bank g20 trump xi meeting the top market event the us dollar fell across the board against major pairs in the last five trading days the fed delivered a dovish statement and a rate cut seems imminent based on chair powell s press conference the greenback is lower as investors are looking for yield elsewhere a big factor of the lack of appeal in the us dollar is the optimism on trade president trump and xi will meet in japan on a sidebar during the g20 meeting and the thawing of trade talks could lead to the much anticipated agreement between the two nations commodities have risen on the softness of the dollar but the iranian attack on a us drone increased tensions as iran could be under further economic sanctions us stocks have hit record highs as the fed is ready to cut the benchmark interest rate and the optimism on trade but there are concerns around the situation in the middle east and all eyes will be on the g20 meeting for updates on the us china relationship dollar on back foot on trade optimism and fed rate cut plans the eur usd rose 1 49 percent during the week the single currency was not the biggest winner against the greenback and it was mainly because the european central bank ecb was also dovish in its assessment of the european economy but reassured the market that the central bank is ready to act by cutting rates if necessary unlike the fed the ecb has not ended its easing cycle so it put its first possible rate hike further way until summer of 2020 german ifo business confidence will be published on monday the large sample size survey has declined in the past two months with businesses more dovish on the german economy in the next six months the german leading indicator will be crucial for the eur as the country is the engine of the union and low confidence could be contagious the us could be making trade peace with china at the g20 but the european car industry is next on the agenda as tariffs were delayed but not forgotten oil rises on supply disruptions and soft dollar west texas intermediate rose 9 19 percent during the week and brent gained 5 39 percent after the us drone incident iran shot the drone and versions differ if the spy drone had entered iranian airspace or if was flying in international airspace us president trump tweeted aggressive words towards iran but armed conflict eased as sanctions appear to be the preferred tactic us production has been on the rise but a fire at a major refinery could create a supply shortage of gasoline during peak driving season the trump xi meeting at the g20 meeting benefited the black stuff if an amicable tone is reached that will be putting less downward pressure on global growth concerns gold higher on safe haven appeal gold surged 4 36 percent during the last five trading days and remains close to the 1 400 price levels the yellow metal had struggled to break above 1 350 but the fed removed that obstacle when it dropped heavy hints that a rate cut is coming the us dollar fell and with macro risks keeping investors tense the appeal for gold as a safe haven was higher

the economic recovery since 2013 has increased employment for both regular and irregular workers brought record profits to businesses and more than doubled share prices but compared with these changes wage trends are not that promising perhaps because of that 60 to 80 percent of respondents in various surveys reply no when asked whether they share the sense that the economy is recovering what then is the long term trend of average wages it is deplorable that the labor ministry s inappropriate handling of wage statistics which surfaced earlier this year has spoiled the long term consistency in wage data but there are other sets of wage data compiled by the national tax administration agency in fact the tax agency data is even more reliable because they are based on records of withholding income tax on individuals wage income the disadvantage is that they show only the annual data and since it takes time to tally them and make them public the latest statistics currently available are the ones from 2017 the movement of average wages since 1980 both nominal and real with the latter adjusted by consumer prices in the base year of 1980 shows that nominal wages increased rapidly until the beginning of the 1990s after which growth lost speed although their growth dipped into the negative territory in the 2000s they returned to a trend of moderate increase in 2013
by a theme often repeated in the media is that japan is suffering terribly because of its low birth rates and shrinking population this has meant slow growth labor shortages and an enormous government debt like many items that are now popular wisdom the story is pretty much nonsense let s start at the most basic measure per capita gdp growth yeah i said per capita gdp growth because insofar as we care about growth it is on a per person basis not total growth after all bangladesh has a gdp that is more than twice as large as denmark s but would anyone in their right mind say that the people of bangladesh enjoy a higher standard of living denmark s gdp is more than twelve times as high on a per capita basis on a per capita basis japan s economy has grown at an average annual rate of 1 4 percent since the collapse of its stock and real estate in 1990 that s somewhat less than the 2 3 percent rate of the u s economy but hardly seems like a disaster by comparison per capita growth has averaged just 0 8 percent annually since the collapse of the housing bubble in 2007 in the united states but per capita income is just the beginning of any story of comparative well being there are many other factors that are as important in determining people s living standards to take an obvious one that gets far too little attention the length of the average work year has declined far more over this period in japan than in the united states according to the oecd the length of the average work year has declined by almost 16 percent between 1990 and 2017 the last year for which data are available by comparison the length of the average work year in the united states has declined by less than 3 percent over this period this is a really big deal in terms of peoples lives if we use a start point of a 40 hour workweek for 50 weeks a year a 16 percent reduction in hours would be equivalent to 8 weeks a year of additional vacation alternatively it would mean a 6 4 hour reduction in the length of the average workweek meaning that people would be working 33 6 hours a week rather than 40 hours my guess is that most people in the united states would be very happy to see the same sort of reduction in work hours as in disaster japan turning to health statistics the oecd reports that life expectancy at birth in japan increased from 75 9 years in 1990 to 81 0 years in 2016 the last year for which data are available in the united states it increased from 71 8 years in 1990 to 76 1 years in 2016 this means that the gap in life expectancy between japan and the united states has increased from 4 1 years in 1990 to 4 9 years in 2016 there is an even more dramatic difference in life expectancy at age 65 in japan this went from 20 0 years to 24 4 years in 2016 in the u s life expectancy at age 65 increased by just 1 7 years over this period from 18 9 years in 1990 to 20 6 years in 2016 if we look at unemployment rates most of us are happy to see that the unemployment rate in the united states has fallen to 3 6 percent a fifty year low by comparison the unemployment rate in japan is just 2 4 percent if we flip the picture over and look at employment to population ratios epop the percentage of the working age people ages 15 to 64 who have jobs the difference is even more dramatic the most recent figure for the united states is 71 9 percent for japan it is 77 5 percent while most of this gap is due to higher epops among men 84 3 percent in japan compared to 76 3 percent in the united states japan now has higher epops among women as well in the most recent data the epop for women was 70 5 percent in japan compared to 66 0 percent in the united states this is due to the fact that japan unlike the united states has made an effort to extend access to quality child care in the last decade the oecd does not have good data on inequality extending back beyond the last decade but just looking at levels the united states does far worse than japan the oecd puts the gini coefficient post tax and transfer for the united states in 2016 at 39 1 near the top among wealthy countries it puts japan s gini coefficient at 33 9 in 2015 pretty much in the middle for wealthy countries it is likely that inequality had increased in japan over the last three decades but it started at a lower level than in the united states and remains at a considerably lower level in terms of greenhouse gas emissions japan is a much better global citizen than the united states emitting a bit more than half as much person as the united states however per person emissions have risen modestly in japan over the last three decades while they have fallen in the united states however part of the decline in the u s is due to the growth in our trade deficit as we now buy more items where the emissions associated with their production take place in our trading partners rather than here what about japan s scary government debt that is now more than 240 percent of its gdp that would be equivalent to a debt of 48 trillion for the united states the conventional story would be that a debt of this size would impose an enormous interest burden or alternatively would lead japan s government to print large amounts of money leading to massive inflation the conventional story doesn t seem to fit very well rather than imposing a huge burden the debt service for japan s debt is trivial the i m f projects the burden to be roughly 0 1 percent of gdp this year the equivalent of 20 billion in the united states by 2021 it projects the debt service burden will be negative it turns out that instead of having sky high interest rates savers are actually paying the japanese government to lend it money there also is not a run away inflation story from printing money japan s central bank has actually been struggling to raise its inflation rate which has hovered near 1 0 percent for the last two decades at times actually going slightly negative rather than having high interest rates and sky rocketing inflation as a result of its large budget deficits japan has extremely low interest rates and concerns about deflation japan s biggest problem has been the opposite of one ordinarily associated with high budget deficits it has insufficient demand in its economy it needs large budget deficits to maintain high levels of employment because the private sector is not spending enough it is very hard to see the budget deficit or debt as a problem in this story but what about the underlying problem of a declining population and workforce again let s keep our bearings straight the standard story of an aging and shrinking population is too few workers to support too many retirees that is a story of too much demand which the economy is unable to meet because it doesn t have a large enough workforce that doesn t look like japan at all economists often like to make things complicated that is how you create jobs for economists but it is often helpful to approach things first at the most simple level in this case the question is whether the problem is too much demand or too little demand the standard story of an aging population is too much demand japan has an obvious problem of too little demand secular stagnation policy types are trying desperately to shove this square peg into a round hole turning japan s problems into a demographic one and warning us that we might share the same fate the all time champion here is robert samuelson who last week posed this terrifying prospect that half of japanese children born in 2007 are expected to live to 107 to be clear an aging population will pose problems society will have to shift more resources to caring for the elderly but there were also problems associated with a rapidly growing population when the baby boomers were growing up there was a serious problem of overcrowded schools the playground of the public school i attended in chicago in the mid 1960s filled up with mobile classrooms there may be political obstacles to securing the necessary resources to care for the elderly but this is not due to the economy s inability to meet the needs the problem is the resistance of powerful interest groups if the concern is framed in that way i e powerful groups in the united states will block efforts to meet the needs of a growing elderly population then it is entirely reasonable but that is not the picture that we have been getting in the media about japan or the united states there is one final issue that deserves a heaping helping of ridicule it is true that if we project far enough out in the future any country with a declining population will cease to exist making a policy claim based on this arithmetic truth is to put it simply nuts japan s population is shrinking at the rate of 0 2 percent annually suppose this continues for the next fifty years its population will have declined by almost 10 percent from current levels that means in 2070 japan will have roughly nine times the population density of the current u s level rather than ten times we all have more serious things to worry about notes i should also add that any effort to look at government debt without considering the rents from government granted patent and copyright monopolies deserves only ridicule direct spending and the granting of these monopolies are alternative mechanisms the government uses to pay for services it is not serious to only consider one type of commitment that the government makes for the public and not the other this column
