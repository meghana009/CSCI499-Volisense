the economic implications of rising protectionism a euro area and global perspective prepared by vanessa gunnella and lucia quaglietti published as part of the ecb economic bulletin issue 3 2019 the risk of a trade war came sharply into focus in 2018 as protectionist threats by the us administration and its trading partners were followed by concrete actions tensions rose over the summer and while these have been defused on some fronts the risk of further escalation remains material the impact of the measures implemented so far on the global and euro area economic outlooks is expected to remain contained however large negative effects could materialise if trade tensions were to escalate further uncertainty related to protectionism is weighing on economic sentiment and it may raise further potentially eroding confidence and affecting the euro area and the global economy more significantly the complexity of intertwined international production chains could also magnify the impact against this backdrop this article reviews the changes in the trade policy landscape over the past decade it discusses the macroeconomic implications of the recent surge in protectionism and evaluates the possible effects that an escalation in trade tensions could have on the global economy and the euro area 1 introduction trade integration has slowed over the last decade the process of trade integration started after the second world war it gained new impetus in the 1980s and had a golden age in the period 1990 2008 when total trade in goods and services increased from 39 to 61 of world gdp since then trade has slowed to its current 58 of world gdp while protectionism has been on the rise driven by an increase in non tariff and more recently tariff barriers at the same time public support for globalisation has declined on both sides of the atlantic while factors such as brexit and euroscepticism have challenged the principles of freedom of movement and economic integration in europe the benefits of free trade have been openly called into question in the united states trade tensions escalated in 2018 and as protectionist threats by the us administration and retaliatory responses by its main trading partners were followed by concrete actions the risk of a trade war came sharply into focus rising protectionism could harm trade and activity there is widespread consensus among economists on both the overall net benefits of trade openness and the need to cushion the negative impact it has had on certain groups in society however raising trade barriers is not the solution to the latter reversing trade integration may put at risk the net economic gains that it generated by unravelling the long term benefits of closer trade and investment links retreating into protectionism also has the potential to unsettle global financial markets against this backdrop the article discusses the macroeconomic implications of rising protectionism and evaluates its effects on the global economy and the euro area section 2 puts the recent surge in trade tensions into context discussing how the trade policy landscape has changed over the past decade section 3 reviews the measures announced by the us administration in 2018 and the retaliation that ensued section 4 discusses the short and long term macroeconomic implications of rising protectionism from a theoretical and model based perspective it also investigates whether the tariff measures implemented in 2018 may have already contributed to the progressive deterioration in global and euro area activity and trade in recent months including via uncertainty effects section 5 concludes 2 a changing trade policy landscape the trade policy landscape has undergone a significant transformation over the last decade the drive towards economic integration that characterised previous decades has now faded which is evident in the slow pace of trade growth in recent years having expanded at approximately twice the rate of global gdp in the years leading up to the global financial crisis the ratio of average imports to gdp growth or the income elasticity of trade has fallen to around 1 since 2011 by 2016 there was a growing consensus that lower trade growth had become a permanent feature of the world economy for example ecb analysis concluded that global trade was unlikely to revert to its pre crisis trend and that post 2011 developments constitute a new normal several reasons have been identified that explain the recent decline in trade activity including compositional effects and structural factors analysis by the ecb and the international monetary fund imf suggests that geographical shifts in economic activity and changes in the composition of aggregate demand e g to services which are less trade intensive although they are becoming increasingly more so may have been weighing on the sensitivity of trade to economic activity specifically it is found that around half of the slowdown in trade elasticity between the periods 1995 2007 and 2012 16 was due to compositional factors namely the growing weight in the world economy of emerging market countries which typically have a lower trade intensity than advanced economies moreover countries such as china have progressively moved from being assemblers of foreign inputs to relying increasingly on domestic inputs other studies suggest that further structural developments might have contributed to the decline in trade elasticity these include waning growth in global value chains gvcs the relocation of production closer to final markets and the declining marginal impact of financial deepening chart 1 new trade measures announced left hand scale number right hand scale percentages source global trade alert database notes data have been adjusted for reporting lags the cut off date for each year is 31 december steadily rising protectionism may well be an additional factor driving the decline in trade activity from the end of the second world war tariffs followed a downward trend that levelled off in both advanced and emerging market economies during the first part of the 21st century before starting on an upward trajectory in recent months at the same time the use of regulatory measures and non tariff barriers such as export subsidies restrictions on licensing or foreign direct investment and domestic clauses in public procurement has increased leading to an overall surge in trade distortions according to data from the global trade alert database encompassing traditional and non traditional trade measures the number of new discriminatory actions announced by g20 economies has risen steadily since 2012 and surged further in 2018 see chart 1 anti dumping measures and import tariffs were the two most widely used instruments together accounting for around 30 of all of measures imposed the use of indirect measures such as state loans to exporting companies has also increased gradually the rise in protectionism implies that a progressively larger share of global trade has been affected by trade distortions data from the global trade alert database show that by 2017 more than 50 of exports from g20 countries was subject to harmful trade measures up from 20 in 2009 see chart 1 accordingly trade growth has decelerated more sharply in those sectors in which extensive discriminatory measures have been adopted than in sectors that have benefited from trade liberalisation along with these developments public support for trade openness has declined while protectionism has increased globally perceptions of the risks associated with open trade have added to the broader list of concerns related to globalisation for example free trade is sometimes believed to have made countries more vulnerable to international crises and spillovers from abroad given its distributional consequences free trade is also considered to be a factor behind the rising inequality both within and across countries however the merits of free trade are also widely recognised international trade allows countries to specialise in the production of goods in which they have a comparative advantage while at the same time enabling consumers to enjoy a greater variety of consumption goods empirical studies have found that trade openness has led to higher income per capita across countries spurring productivity growth and helping to reduce poverty globally nevertheless the benefits of trade openness and their distribution across social groups vary between countries factors such as the nature of export specialisation the degree of production diversification and the quality of a country s institutions are found to be important pre conditions for the benefits of trade openness to be fully realised some have also challenged the benefits of free trade by claiming that unfair practices have damaged domestic growth and job creation 3 tariffs announced by the us administration in 2018 protectionist threats made by the us administration in 2017 have been followed by concrete actions over the past year as shown in chart 2 the implementation of tariffs on solar panels and washing machines in january 2018 came first followed by tariffs of 25 on imports of steel and 10 on imports of aluminium for a wide range of countries in march 2018 after an initial exemption in june 2018 the tariffs on steel and aluminium were also applied to canada mexico and the european union which resulted in a raft of retaliatory measures the european union imposed a 25 duty on a range of us products worth usd 3 2 billion which came into force in the same month the us administration in turn initiated a new investigation of automobile and auto parts imports to determine their effects on national security hinting at the possibility of a 20 25 tariff increase box 1 assesses the potential impact that this would have on the world economy and the euro area if it were to materialise chart 2 timeline of tariffs proposed and implemented in 2018 usd billions sources peterson institute for international economics united states trade representative and ecb calculations notes the values of imports affected by the tariffs on washing machines and solar panels and steel and aluminium refer to estimates produced by the peterson institute for international economics the percentages in brackets indicate the size of the applied tariffs tensions with china escalated in the second half of 2018 following an investigation by the us authorities into chinese intellectual property practices which concluded that china has a policy of forced technology transfer the us administration initiated trade action against china the measures implemented in july 2018 included 25 ad valorem duties on 1 300 product types imported from china with an annual import value equivalent to usd 50 billion see chart 2 in september 2018 the us administration announced a further wave of tariffs targeting usd 200 billion of chinese exports china responded by imposing tariffs on exports from the united states worth usd 60 billion at the same time there has been some de escalation of trade tensions on other fronts concerns over tensions between the united states and the european union eased after the summit held in july 2018 in addition canada mexico and the united states reached an agreement to replace the north american free trade agreement with the united states mexico canada agreement usmca which effectively maintains tariff free trade for most goods a truce agreed between china and the united states on 1 december 2018 whereby tariffs on usd 200 billion of chinese imports would remain at 10 rather than be increased to 25 as previously announced defused the us china trade tensions temporarily nevertheless there is still a strong risk of renewed escalation us tariffs against china target in particular the electronics and machinery sectors the tariffs imposed directly on china affect a broad range of industries with a total nominal value of usd 217 billion or 2 of chinese nominal value added the industries most affected are those that produce electronic components electrical equipment and machinery see chart 3a which all feature in the chinese government s made in china 2025 industrial plan with regard to the euro area tariffs imposed by the united states affect around usd 5 5 billion of euro area value added mainly in the basic metal and to a lesser extent the fabricated metal sectors chart 3 trade affected by tariff measures in 2018 usd billions sources world bank world integrated trade solution wits wto and comtrade notes the list of sectors is based on the two digit isic rev 4 classification and quantities have been aggregated from hs6 product lists of affected goods retaliatory responses by the united states trading partners particularly china have targeted us imports across a wide variety of industries and sectors the food chemicals and car industries have been the sectors most affected by china s retaliation see chart 3b with tariffs affecting around 7 5 of those sectors combined value added eu retaliatory measures have been much smaller and are targeting non metallic minerals electrical equipment textiles furniture food products other transport equipment including light vehicles such as motorbikes and chemicals covering a total of 0 04 of us industrial value added the latest round of us tariffs imposed on china target a significant part of the two countries bilateral trade while the share of euro area and global trade directly affected is still limited as shown in chart 4 the products targeted by the tariffs announced in the first half of 2018 by the us administration and its trading partners affect relatively small shares of us 2 euro area 0 2 chinese 2 and world trade 0 4 their impact on the world economy is therefore likely to remain contained by contrast the latest round of us tariffs coupled with china s retaliation measures in september 2018 target almost half of china s bilateral trade with the united states as a result around 12 of total us and 8 of total chinese goods trade is affected to some extent these tariffs may weigh on activity in the united states and china and the organisation of production in supply chains could further amplify the adverse effects the share of euro area and world trade affected remains small 2 chart 4 us tariffs and china s retaliation measures shares of us chinese and global trade affected percentage of total goods trade for the united states china and the world sources imf and ecb staff calculations 4 the macroeconomic implications of rising protectionism this section discusses the short and long term macroeconomic implications of rising protectionism from a theoretical and a model based perspective section 4 1 describes the channels through which higher tariffs may affect activity and trade in view of the progressive deterioration in global and euro area activity and trade data in recent months section 4 2 investigates whether the tariff measures implemented in 2018 might have been a contributing factor including as a result of uncertainty effects finally section 4 3 discusses the possible consequences of a renewed surge in trade tensions 4 1 channels of transmission of rising protectionism rising protectionism can affect economic activity through several channels higher import duties increase trade costs which may alter both the quantity and the price of internationally traded goods this is often referred to as the trade channel of transmission the existence of complex global production supply chains can amplify this effect in addition higher trade costs can affect financial flows and credit conditions this may occur for example if increased uncertainty over future trade policy leads to financial stress and a broad reassessment of risk premia the way in which the different channels play out in a trade dispute and the consequent impact on economic activity depends on several factors including whether trading partners retaliate and whether the dispute remains confined to a small number of countries rather than developing into a full blown trade war the impact on economic activity in the country imposing tariffs depends on a whether imported goods can be substituted by domestic production and b whether trading partners retaliate to the extent that the higher trade costs brought about by higher tariffs are not absorbed in lower profit margins for producers import prices rise and relative prices change higher import prices push up domestic firms production costs and domestic inflation thereby lowering households real disposable income these effects weigh on consumption investment and employment and have a negative impact on activity however the higher prices of imported goods may also induce domestic customers to switch from imported to domestically produced goods the relative importance of these two effects and the net impact on economic growth depends on the degree of substitutability between domestically produced goods and imported goods if imported goods can be easily substituted through domestic production consumption and activity rise the positive impact on activity could be lessened if the exchange rate appreciates following the increase in import prices in addition if the trading partners hit by the tariffs retaliate as is often the case any potential benefit could be reversed domestic firms lose competitiveness in foreign markets and exports and activity fall as a result as such rising trade distortions imply higher trade costs for all countries involved which may hinder the optimal allocation of resources all economies involved are in the end worse off in a trade dispute involving two countries third countries may temporarily benefit from rising protectionism specifically third countries can gain market share in countries where tariffs have risen for example in a trade dispute concerning exclusively the united states and china euro area goods would gain competitiveness vis à vis us goods in china and vis à vis chinese goods in the united states this stems from the fact that higher tariffs make us goods more expensive in china and chinese goods more expensive in the united states with bilateral trade flows between the two eventually declining the extent to which third countries benefit from this trade diversion depends on how easily a country can substitute imported products from different countries higher substitutability implies more trade diversion chart 5 production chain linkages in exports to the united states usd billions sources world input output database 2016 release wang z

several times and exporter s value added that goes to the united states through other countries is the value added in intermediate products produced by an exporter which is used by third countries to produce goods to be exported to the united states for the euro area aggregate only extra euro area countries are considered as other countries the following abbreviations are used ca for canada cn for china mx for mexico jp for japan and kr for south korea while the pace of expansion might have slowed in recent years gvcs remain highly fragmented and can amplify the impact of tariffs on trade and activity gvcs have become increasingly complex with goods crossing borders multiple times during the production process although analysis by the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd suggests that gvcs pace of expansion might have slowed since 2011 production remains highly fragmented across borders this is well illustrated in chart 5 which considers the gvc linkages embodied in exports of goods to the united states from several trading partners in the case of the euro area only around one third of exports are consumed in the united states see the blue parts in chart 5 in fact a significant share of euro area exports to the united states consists of intermediate goods which are used in the production of goods in the united states and then re exported to third countries see the yellow parts in chart 5 in turn domestic production and exports include intermediate inputs from third countries for example euro area exports to the united states include goods from countries that are closely embedded in european production chains such as for instance central and eastern european countries in the automobile sector see the grey parts in chart 5 euro area exports also include value added from the united states itself see the red parts in chart 5 finally euro area exports are sometimes first shipped for processing to third countries such as mexico before being exported to the united states see the blue shaded parts in chart 5 in a world characterised by complex gvcs goods cross borders several times and tariff costs accumulate owing to the cascading effect this occurs when tariffs are applied to intermediate goods intermediate inputs incur tariff costs every time they are shipped to another country for further processing by the time the finished goods have reached the final consumer the final price may have risen significantly moreover imported intermediate goods are often used in domestic production when these goods are subject to tariffs domestic producers in the country imposing the tariffs may also suffer higher production costs are likely to be passed on through the various stages of the value chain with demand production and investment being negatively affected in all phases in addition tariffs are typically levied on a good s gross value of imported goods therefore if foreign inputs account for a large share of exports a low nominal tariff can translate into a high value added tariff for the exporter compared with a situation in which the entire value added of goods is produced domestically tariffs may have a proportionally larger impact on the profits of exporting firms thereby increasing the incentive to pass the higher costs on through the value chain third countries involved in intermediate stages of production may also face higher production costs reducing the possible benefits of trade diversion an increase in uncertainty coupled with financial stress could also amplify the impact of rising protectionism on economic activity there are several ways in which elevated uncertainty about future trade policies can dampen demand for example households may delay spending when economic prospects become more uncertain furthermore firms may reassess their economic prospects amid rising uncertainty taking a wait and see approach and postponing investment in response to uncertainty shocks firms can also adjust their inventory policies by disproportionately cutting their foreign orders of intermediate goods with a disproportionate impact on international trade flows an uncertain trade policy outlook may also give firms a reason to delay entering a foreign market or upgrading their technology finally elevated uncertainty may push up borrowing costs for households and firms as investors demand greater compensation to protect themselves against future risks the materialisation of a global uncertainty shock such as a trade war may also drive investors to shift their portfolios to safe haven currencies with implications for the allocation of capital flows across countries higher trade costs can also weigh on productivity the tighter financing conditions associated with rising uncertainty can raise the cost of capital with a negative impact on investment that could hinder productivity growth in the countries affected by the tariffs trade barriers can also lead to the misallocation of production factors across firms and countries less open markets diminish global competition thereby reducing incentives for innovation and technological advances and keeping less productive firms in the market as a result aggregate productivity may decline 4 2 can the impact of the tariffs announced by the united states and its trading partners already be detected in the data some initial evidence in the united states firms operating in the targeted sectors seem to have initially circumvented part of the adverse impact of tariffs by frontloading their imports us imports from china of products targeted by the us tariffs increased before the tariffs came into effect and declined in the aftermath see chart 6 total us imports also rose sharply by 9 1 year on year in the third quarter of 2018 partly reflecting firms stockpiling the increase was associated with a surge in inventories while business investment declined although this suggests the presence of frontloading effects the sharp rise in imports may also reflect buoyant us domestic demand on the back of procyclical fiscal stimuli and strong labour market conditions chart 6 us imports from china and tariff implementation t months of tariff implementation sources census and ecb staff calculations note the data shown in the chart are for nominal imports trade diversion effects may also be at play in retaliation for us tariffs on chinese goods the chinese authorities imposed a 25 tariff on chinese imports of us soybeans in july 2018 while total chinese imports of vegetable products mostly soybeans remained broadly stable following the announcement imports from the united states were significantly lower than usual however imports from brazil which are unaffected by additional tariffs have been rising more sharply than usual see chart 7 chart 7 chinese imports of vegetable products by counterparty usd millions sources ceic and ecb staff calculations notes the shaded areas show the range of values for imports of vegetable products from the united states and brazil for each month of the year in the period 2010 17 in order to show the typical seasonal pattern the latest observation is for september 2018 the impact of rising tariffs on financial markets appears to have remained confined to the targeted sectors global financial markets have generally been resilient to the announcements of new tariffs this may reflect the fact that they have thus far targeted only a small fraction of global trade at the same time us companies potentially affected by higher tariffs such as those highly exposed to regions outside the united states in terms of revenue generation have clearly underperformed see chart 8 an analysis by the ecb indicates that underperformance in the affected sectors can almost always be traced back to changes in risk premia whereas fundamentals such as earnings expectations and credit risk do not change much chinese equity prices were also harder hit in

survey based indicators point to some tangible moderation in activity in china with trade disputes often being identified as one of the factors contributing to the weak chinese investment seen in recent quarters however this decline in investment might also have been driven by tighter domestic credit conditions as discussed in section 4 1 the extent to which asian economies exports to china are embedded in china s exports to the united states e g as components of chinese products us tariffs could also impinge on their exports via the regional value chain there seems to be a negative correlation between the exposures of asian countries to the chinese us supply chain and the changes in countries manufacturing purchasing managers index pmi since january 2018 which suggests that rising tariffs may be affecting sentiment across the region see chart 9 in the united states consumer and business confidence indicators have fallen somewhat in recent months although they remain

demand for euro area goods extra euro area exports have been particularly weak since the start of 2018 with the decline being driven mainly by a sharp deterioration in the manufacturing machinery and transport equipment sectors see chart 10 manufacturing exports are closely linked to trading partners investment growth and historically tend to display a relatively high negative correlation with some measures of uncertainty such as the vix while this suggests that uncertainty related to rising protectionism might have affected euro area exports it is difficult to disentangle this possible effect from other factors including the introduction of new emission standards in europe specific adverse changes to regulations in the car sector in china financial turbulence in emerging markets and brexit chart 10 euro area exports volume three month moving average of year on year growth rates and contributions sources eurostat and ecb staff calculations note the latest observation is for

4 3 what might be the impact of a renewed escalation of trade tensions some model based simulations the risks related to a further exacerbation of trade tensions remain prominent as more concrete actions could follow to assess the impact of a renewed escalation of trade tensions this subsection investigates the scenario of a hypothetical trade war in which the united states increases tariff and non tariff barriers on imports from all trading partners by 10 and the other countries retaliate symmetrically the impact would of course be much more pronounced in the case of a free for all full blown trade war despite their limitations model based estimates can help to gauge some of the medium and long term implications of an escalation in trade tensions two different methodologies are used to shed light on both medium and long term outcomes the imf s global integrated monetary and fiscal model gimf in combination with the ecb s global model are employed to investigate the effects of a trade war scenario over a medium term horizon under this scenario not only trade but also confidence effects are assessed in order to gauge the long term steady state implications for trade a multi country and multi sector general equilibrium model is used in this model tariff and non tariff barriers are assumed to be 10 higher on a permanent basis thereby allowing long term predictions to be made in the simulations of medium term effects an escalation of trade tensions might have a significant direct impact on us activity compounded by heightened financial stress and a drop in confidence an increase in tariff and non tariff barriers on imports induces domestic consumers and firms to switch to domestically produced goods however this effect is likely to be more than offset by the increase in prices and the reduction in exports resulting from the retaliatory measures taken by all trading partners consequently the direct effects on us gdp are negative and could lower activity by 1 5 relative to the baseline after the first year confidence effects stemming from a tightening of financing conditions could depress us gdp further for the purpose of this scenario confidence effects are simulated assuming an increase in corporate bond risk premia of 50 basis points and a fall in stock prices of two standard deviations in all countries although some countries may initially benefit from trade diversion global trade and global activity are expected to decline significantly chinese producers may improve their competitiveness in third countries vis à vis us producers as all us trading partners would raise tariff and non tariff barriers on imports from the united states in the simulated scenario see chart 12 for the first year effects therefore in this simulation the trade effects on china s gdp are slightly positive 0 6 and are only partially outweighed by confidence effects turning to the euro area despite some possible gains in export market shares the spillovers arising from the deterioration in global confidence would most probably outweigh the gains in competitiveness thus causing an overall modest decrease in activity finally global trade and global activity could fall by more than 2 5 and 1 respectively as a result of the combined negative effects via the trade and the financial channels chart 12 estimated impact of an escalation in trade tensions first year effects gdp response deviation from baseline levels percentages source ecb calculations notes the results are a combination of the direct trade effects derived from the gimf model and the confidence effects modelled using the ecb s global model heightened trade tensions could also have pronounced long term effects on us exports and imports in the model simulations the steady state effects account for trade through supply chains although they disregard financial channels and the confidence effects that might arise in the medium term in the long term consumers and producers could fully switch to products from domestic or third markets while some production processes could be partly relocated to destination markets affected by the measures in the united states trade flows could be severely affected with real exports declining by 26 6 and imports decreasing to a lesser extent 22 8 with an overall negative net trade effect on activity the large impact on us flows reflects the fact that us exports to and imports from all trading partners face higher tariffs by contrast china is likely to incur more limited losses see chart 13 as lower exports to the united states are partly offset by higher exports to those countries in which china has improved its price competitiveness vis à vis us producers similarly other countries could improve their competitiveness

car sectors would incur a loss of around 10 and 4 respectively retaliatory tariffs and the increase in input prices could affect other sectors in the united states thereby offsetting the positive

trade between sectors within a country is also totally attributed to final goods in the model without gvcs tariffs would only be applied once a final good crossed a border the results confirm that the organisation of car production in supply chains involving several stages of production in several countries see chart a plays an important role in transmitting tariff effects failing to account for the gvc related trade in the sector level model would understate the welfare effects by at least 10 in the case of the euro area the amplifying effects of gvcs are even more evident in the case of the united states whose car sector relies heavily on imported intermediate inputs the role of gvcs is particularly interesting in the case of canada without accounting for gvc effects canada would experience some gains in terms of welfare however when the indirect and loop effects of tariffs through supply chains e g increase in prices also through tariffs affecting the united states are taken into account the welfare effects turn negative chart b welfare effects of tariffs deviation from non tariff welfare as a percentage sources world input output database 2016 release and ecb staff calculations notes welfare is defined as real household income the following abbreviations are used ca for canada cn for china mx for mexico jp for japan and kr for south korea overall the impact of rising tariffs on cars is assessed as being more pronounced for car exporting countries and could be intensified by confidence effects although world unit production of cars is large the auto industry accounts for only a small share of value added in most countries it is estimated that the impact on the euro area as a whole would be small even when the magnifying effects of global supply chains are taken into account however the consequences of an increase in car tariffs may weigh significantly on some countries it is assessed that a possible increase in tariffs would have some negative effects in the united states and in those countries with a large exposure to the us market chiefly south korea and japan in addition confidence effects or the effects of uncertainty with regard to the car industry that have not been taken into account could have a more negative impact on the world economy 5 conclusions taken in isolation the repercussions of the tariffs implemented in 2018 pose only a modest adverse risk to the global and euro area outlooks preliminary evidence indicates that in order to circumvent the effects of rising tariffs firms operating in the targeted sectors may have been frontloading their import orders while trade flows in the affected sectors may have started to decelerate after the tariffs came into effect particularly in china the impact of implemented tariffs and tariff announcements owing to uncertainty effects appears to have remained confined to the targeted sectors for the time being if trade tensions were to escalate once again however the impact would be larger model based simulations indicate that the medium term direct impact of an escalation could be sizeable compounded by heightened financial stress and a drop in confidence despite some trade diversion effects euro area and global trade and therefore activity would decline the longer term effects would be even more pronounced trade liberalisation within the framework of multilateral cooperation has been a key factor driving global economic prosperity trade integration helped to drive economic growth in advanced and developing economies in the second part of the 20th century while also helping to pull hundreds of millions of people out of poverty at the same time although free trade is often seen as one of the factors behind rising inequality both within and across countries winding back globalisation is the wrong way to address these negative effects a retreat from openness will only fuel more inequality depriving people of the undisputed economic advantages that trade and integration bring instead countries should seek to resolve any trade disputes in multilateral fora by encouraging regulatory convergence multilateral cooperation helps to protect people from the unwelcome consequences of openness and therefore remains crucial as a response to concerns about the fairness and equity of trade the distributional and social effects of greater economic integration should also be addressed by targeted policies that achieve fairer outcomes including for example redistributive policies or adequate training and educational measures
cryptocurrency the next phase by victor hill 24 april 2019 26 mins to read in december 2017 i wrote a piece for this magazine entitled the future of money i explained that is just a conceptual construction of the human mind it does not exist in nature animals have no notion of it even humans managed to live for countless millennia without it if people agree to use cowrie shells as money then cowrie shells aremoney so the world of monetary economics is like alice through the looking glass when i use a word humpty dumpty said in rather a scornful tone it means just what i choose it to mean neither more nor less money is whatever people regard as money even if it only exists on computer hard drives that piece came out at the apogee of the bitcoin boom i was partly trying to explain how the new asset class of digital money cryptocurrency had come about when bitcoin plunged in value in early 2018 many of us thought that was that cryptocurrency always a dubious asset class had hyped itself out but it turns out that the bitcoin bubble was just the beginning of the story cryptocurrency did not go away even though it became less attractive for speculators and now social media networks in particular facebook nasdaq fb which also owns whatsapp and instagram and payment platforms like paypal nasdaq pypl are working out how to use digital currency to effect secure transactions between their users and subscribers the technology which makes cryptocurrency possible blockchain is still generating huge interest in the world of tech it is quite possible that second generation cryptocurrencies will soon be everywhere we look bitcoin triumph and tragedy on 18 august 2008 somebody registered the domain name bitcoin org on 31 october 2008 a link to a paper authored by a certain satoshi nakamoto entitled bitcoin a peer to peer electronic cash system was posted to a cryptography website supposedly nakamoto then released the software behind bitcoin as open source code meaning that anybody could develop it in january 2009 but was it the mysterious nakamoto whose identity remains one of the great mysteries of our time first seen in master investor magazine never miss

community of cyber geeks who understood the sheer originality of the blockchain software technology on which the digital currency relied blockchain is a decentralised digital public ledger by means of which the entire history of each coin is recorded not in one place but spread across hundreds of thousands of computers consequently the supply of bitcoin or other cryptocurrency is limited and every user can be confident that the provenance of any digital coin they buy has been verified in time of course the speculators piled in viewing bitcoin as a type of digital gold in january 2010 one bitcoin traded for 0 06 and it didn t go much above that for years but around mid 2015 the world s leading digital currency began to gain value gathering momentum throughout 2016 by 01 january 2018 each bitcoin was worth 19 498 63 early enthusiasts many of whom were by no means professional investors had become nominally at least multi millionaires i was one of those who urged caution i argued in these pages in november 2017 that while bitcoin like other digital currencies was a medium of exchange it was not a store of value and therefore had no intrinsic worth in the event a collapse followed the spike and many bitcoin fortunes in dollar terms were lost in the first two months of 2019 the value of bitcoin has been hovering around the 4 000 mark in terms of the total value of all bitcoin in circulation that fell from an estimated 230 9 billion in january 2018 to 66 6 billion by the end of december last year some said bitcoin was the future others that it was a fraud either way bitcoin and its imitators were branded as volatile and ultimately unregulated for all that a number of prominent hedge funds have continued to show interest ibm nyse ibm microsoft nasdaq msft and jp morgan chase nyse jpm have all announced that they are developing blockchain technology for their own ends jamie dimon ceo of jp morgan in october 2017 called bitcoin a fraud yet in february this year guess what jp morgan announced the first bank backed digital token the jpm coin the jpm coin the value of which is linked to the us dollar will be used to settle transactions instantaneously between its largest clients within its settlements system regulation arguably the real key to the future success of cryptocurrency is regulation most major financial centres have yet to approve cryptocurrency as they regard the technology for mining and storing it as still unproven in july 2017 the securities and exchange commission sec in the united states announced that laws governing the trading of securities may also apply to some cryptocurrency transactions but it failed to provide concrete guidelines at about the same time china banned outright initial coin offerings icos by means of which software start ups were raising finance in promised digital currency to fund their expansion several asian countries including china and south korea also outlawed cryptocurrency exchanges where investors can convert cryptocurrency into real fiat currency when digital entrepreneurs launch so called initial coin offering icos they sell their own virtual currencies in order to raise money for software they plan to develop in return for real money investors receive digital tokens regulators worry that this novel fund raising method allows start ups to flout investor protection rules financial authorities around the world have been promising to crack down on icos which came out of nowhere in 2017 to become a popular way for start ups to raise tens of millions of dollars interestingly the swiss authorities thus far have proved accommodating ethereum was launched there via an ico in 2014 one reason advanced for tighter regulation is the fear of money laundering but proponents of cryptocurrency argue that the role of crypto in the criminal underworld has been exaggerated in 2014 the common reporting standard crs was adopted by most of the world s central banks though not the federal reserve which had first instigated it under the crs the chinese authorities for example could demand that the hong kong authorities hand over information on any chinese citizen residing in hong kong except for property information for this reason property rather than cryptocurrency is still the preferred way for people with guilty consciences to launder money the swiss canton of zug and the us state of wyoming have both passed laws to accelerate the trade in cryptocurrency in zug you can pay parking fines in bitcoin the wyoming law gives cryptocurrency a distinct legal status alongside cash bonds and property those who advocate the wider adoption of cryptocurrency argue that it makes perfect sense for a digital global economy to have a digital global means of exchange once a major regulator defines a workable regulatory regime for trading cryptocurrency others will probably follow for fear of losing out how cryptocurrency could change the world during the bitcoin bubble the global economic establishment from george soros to mark carney told us perhaps with some justification that bitcoin was a serious threat to financial stability and that sensible investors should stay away but for all the frenzied speculation throughout the second half of 2017 we need to stand back and ask what the world would be like if just as when cowrie shells gave way to metal coins the nature of money were fundamentally to change the fact is that most major banks have started to trade cryptocurrencies to some degree and bitcoin is accepted quite widely by retailers around the world it is difficult to get information about the number and value of total transactions conducted in digital currency but anecdotally they are still growing first seen in master investor magazine never miss an issue of master investor magazine sign up now for free read the latest master investor magazine if the use of cryptocurrency were to become truly widespread then there would be massive implications for the economy firstly central banks would no longer be able to control the money supply as they do for conventional fiat currencies by setting interest rates and carrying out interventions in the money markets such as through quantitative easing qe you can t just print more bitcoin when the whim takes you because the supply is fixed second bitcoin or another cryptocurrency could become a truly global form of payment which would render central banks irrelevant as people dump traditional fiat money in favour of the most popular cryptocurrency the loss of power by central banks over monetary policy might be mirrored by a loss of control over fiscal policy by governments up until now governments collect taxes in their own fiat currency and borrow in the bond markets the gilts market in the uk to make up any shortfall if most people were paid in digital currency then the state would have to levy taxes in that currency but would governments be able to borrow in cryptocurrency to cover the fiscal deficit the answer to that question is unclear governments would no longer be able to inflate their way out of debt the classic pattern over the last century instead they would have to rely on direct taxation alone and that will put pressure on states to shrink their spending programmes then there is the impact on the banking sector if people start to store much of their purchasing power in their digital wallets then that implies that they will reduce conventional deposits of fiat money within the banking system once traditional banks start to lose deposits on a large scale many will become illiquid and some ultimately will fail as the threat of systemic failure within the banking system increases especially in highly vulnerable currency systems such as the eurozone so individuals will convert more of their traditional cash assets into cryptocurrency this would further exacerbate the banking crisis there might even come a point where collectively we decide that we don t need banks any more much as i have been rude about bankers in these pages that would imply a massive change to the structure of our economy political repercussions the rise of cryptocurrency will probably also impact our political institutions some crypto enthusiasts like vijay boyapati have proposeda new form of delegative democracy instead of representative democracy whereby a voter could choose different representatives for different issues e g transport of education and change them at any time proponents of delegative democracy believe that private decentralised solutions will replace traditional public institutions then there are the crypto anarchists who live in hacker communes a certain amir taaki has set one up barcelona and the people who want to start their own micro states possibly floating at sea in seasteads each of which will have its own cryptocurrency one fervent champion of bitcoin brock pierce who is director of the bitcoin foundation tried to set up a crypto financed state in hurricane ravaged puerto rico to be called puertopia get ready for weird facebook likes crypto in may 2018 facebook nasdaq fb announced that it was setting up a team to explore blockchain technology and to determine how to commercialise it the team was to be headed by david marcus a former president of paypal there are now at least 45 engineers working on this top secret project and facebook is still recruiting new blockchain experts in a report by the new york times on 28 february the veil was lifted for the first time on what that team has achieved the nyt claimed that five facebook employees had briefed the newspaper on condition of strict anonymity the company is working on a digital coin facecoin that users of whatsapp will be able to exchange with their contacts instantly since reporting this on the mi website on 08 march i have learned that facebook quietly secured a digital currency license from the central bank of ireland two years ago permitting the issuance of digital money and the provision of payment services throughout the eu sources suggest that the new cryptocurrency will first be made available in india where whatsapp has 200 million regular users moreover india receives more remittances from indian citizens working overseas than any other country in 2017 these amounted to 69 billion according to world bank figures facebook has about 2 5 billion users across its three messaging platforms facebookmessenger whatsapp and instagram many of those accounts are corporate and there is much double counting as many individuals have multiple accounts but that is still about one third of humanity so it is probably fair to say that facebook whatever you may think of it on an ethical or societal level is the

there are almost 32 million bitcoin wallets according to data compiled by statista however most bitcoin users have several bitcoin wallets and use multiple wallet addresses to increase their financial privacy when transacting in bitcoin so the number of individual users is somewhat less than that as i write bitcoin is trading at just under 3 000 etherium eth was first released in july 2015 ether is

this new generation of messaging giants have the power to propel cryptocurrency into a new phase of its evolution do cryptocurrencies have intrinsic value unlike bitcoin fiat currencies have underlying value because men with guns say they do this was nobel prize winning economist paul krugman writing in the new york times last year in other words fiat currencies work because they are backed by the state the german sociologist max weber 1864 1920 defined the state as the monopoly of legitimate violence over a given territory but hang on professor krugman all bitcoin transactions are automatically verified by the blockchain and millions of people are confident enough to use bitcoin to buy and sell products and services every day moreover it is government that debauches fiat currency by triggering hyperinflation as in zimbabwe and venezuela despite the men with guns professor krugman also claimed that transaction costs are higher with bitcoin than with fiat money yet bitcoin offers international clearance within an hour whereas payments through the international banking system usually take days to clear bitcoin and the rest are definitely a medium of exchange one that is immune from inflationary pressure precisely because states cannot print or mine them the question is whether they are a store of value initially i thought not because it had no intrinsic value

with cryptocurrency investment has been that you are only a hard drive away from losing everything it was recently reported that cryptocurrency guru gerald cotten took a reported 200 million of bitcoin with him to the grave when he died in india last december mr cotten was ceo of quafrigacx canada s biggest cryptocurrency exchange it is an outfit that is currently subject to litigation and contention and which i am absolutely not recommending if you google this company you will find that the website contains a message reporting that the company is under investigation for financial issues first seen in master investor magazine never miss an issue of master investor magazine sign up now for free read the latest master investor magazine the problem is that mr cotten had erected layered security around his bitcoin stash with complex passwords for each layer when he unexpectedly died his family realised that they could not get into his hard drive as a result a huge fortune remains locked on a piece of hardware potentially forever that is not the first time that a cryptocurrency fortune has been literally wiped out by death in 2013 matthew moody an early bitcoin advocate died in a light aircraft crash in california his father has spent these last years trying to reclaim his digital fortune so far without success and supposedly the mysterious progenitor of bitcoin one satoshi nakamoto who if he ever existed has now vanished holds a stash of an estimated 3 billion worth of bitcoin one can only wish him the best and what if a bitcoin holder were to be kidnapped a gruesome thought well it has already happened in december 2017 an executive at uk based bitcoin exchange exmo was kidnapped in kiev ukraine and only released after a 1 million ransom was paid one possible safeguard is to set up a so called multi signature key let s say so long as three out of four account holders log in then the digital wallet can be unlocked to be quite clear if you do not have the private keys then the bitcoin is lost characteristics of next generation cryptocurrencies while using the same basic technology blockchain the next generation of cryptocurrencies will seek to avoid the shortcomings of first generation cryptocurrencies firstly the nyt thinks that any digital currency that facebook were to develop would reside on a decentralized network of computers independently from its creators the same goes for ones developed by messaging networks and payments platforms in other words such currencies could be used universally new cryptocurrencies would make it easier to move money between countries particularly in the developing world where it is harder for ordinary people to open bank accounts and to obtain credit cards second new cryptocurrencies will do away with the energy intensive mining process that bitcoin relies on facebook s digital currency will be a stablecoin that is to say a digital currency pegged to the us dollar though its value could vary marginally from the dollar according to the website stable report there are three types of stablecoin asset backed on chain asset backed off chain and algorithmic the first kind would be cryptocurrencies which are backed by other cryptocurrencies the second type of stablecoin is collateralised by real world fiat currency such as the us dollar or the euro or by a commodity such as gold the third type algorithmic relies on a combination of algorithms and contracts to maintain price equilibrium but would the algorithms work as far as we can tell facebook is working on the second type of stablecoin which would be collateralised by greenbacks or by other currencies this implies that there would be a trusted third party which actually holds a dollar of real cash residing somewhere in the banking system for every dollar of digital currency in circulation the question is would facebook act as the trusted third party and how much control would facebook retain over the digital currency if facebook is to be responsible for approving every transaction and keeping track of every user it is not clear why it would need a blockchain system at all rather than a traditional centralised ledger like the one that paypal uses the whole point of blockchain was that it obviated the need for a trusted third party to sit between the two sides of a transaction a digital token with a stable value would not be of interest to speculators the main champions of cryptocurrencies thus far but consumers could hold it in order to pay for things online without worrying about its value fluctuating too much the nyt reported that some facebook insiders had suggested that its digital currency will be linked to the value of a basket of foreign currencies rather than just to the us dollar on the other hand second generation cryptocurrencies are likely to face many of the same regulatory and technological hurdles that constrained bitcoin the absence of a cryptocurrency central bank has supposedly made them useful to criminals though arthur hayes co founder of bitmex argues that buying bitcoin is a terrible way to launder dirty money because all transactions are recorded on the public ledger further computer networks that manage cryptocurrencies hitherto made it hard to process huge volumes of transactions simultaneously a stablecoin known as basis recently closed last december after just eight months the new jersey based company announced that there was no apparent way around being classified as a security as opposed to a currency which would significantly reduce

stablecoin to date tether usdt has been surrounded by controversy while tether s creators claim that each of its tokens is backed by one us dollar the company s refusal to be audited has raised doubts as to whether that is true on 14 march 2019 tether changed the collateral to include loans to affiliate companies the largest cryptocurrency exchange bitmex the bitcoin mercantile exchange is the world s largest bitcoin exchange it was founded by sam reid arthur hayes and ben delo in 2014 bitmex is not a spot market but a derivatives exchange users deposit bitcoin and then use those deposits to speculate on the future price of bitcoin using various futures and options contracts it is the only bitcoin exchange which offers users the chance to leverage up their positions by up to 100 times apparently chinese users call bitmex 100x unlike conventional futures markets there are no margining arrangements but no one can lose more collateral than they have put up by last november the daily value of trades on bitmex was between 2 5 billion and 8 billion equivalent to the daily turnover of the australian stock exchange asx bitmex also provides in depth reports on the crypto currency ecosystem meanwhile in russia and china in january it was reported in the daily telegraph that russia s central bank was preparing to replace the us dollar as a reserve currency with bitcoin supposedly this will be a bid to circumvent the effect of western sanctions which were imposed on russia further to its annexation of crimea in february 2014 and were then intensified further to the

that the russian central bank could buy as much as 10 billion of bitcoin financed by dumping us treasuries however the cryptoslate website has cast doubt on mr ginko s credibility apparently mr ginko has tweeted on russia s move into bitcoin several times before without showing great insight in july 2018 he tweeted that russia would soon move to a cryptorouble in 2017 he predicted that bitcoin would rise to 2 million no one has been able to verify his bona fides at ranepa there have been more reliable reports in the second half of last year to the effect that the people s bank of china pboc was preparing to launch its own digital currency during a march political gathering in beijing former central bank ceo zhou xiaochuan said that any state digital currency must be compatible with financial stability while at the same time protecting consumers the digital currency research institute of the pboc has been hiring people with knowledge and experience of blockchain technology according to fintech news yao qian head of research at the pboc said last year that a digital currency could drive down transaction costs increase the efficiency of monetary policy and extend financial services to rural areas it would also be easy to trace an autocratic government s dream he asserted that the development of the digital economy required an electronic currency issued by the central bank that is to say it would be a state sponsored digital currency non state digital currencies would presumably be outlawed it is likely that such a state sponsored digital currency would be pegged to the existing fiat currency in the first instance so as to make it less volatile a stablecoin there is conjecture that such a stablecoin could be adjusted in value periodically in accordance with the consumer price index in that way while fiat money might lose its value over time thanks to inflation the stablecoin would have constant purchasing power will mr trump go for gold in mid march 2019 rumours started to circulate to the effect that president trump has been considering the return of the us dollar to the gold standard it is suggested that he fears that the imf is going to issue a global currency in the form of special drawing rights sdrs so as to usurp the greenback as the currency of choice for most international transactions but the maga president will not take the demotion of the dollar lying down moreover mr trump is known to be a lover of gold trump towers everywhere are marked out with gold lettering and he is thought to have made a killing in gold investments in the past while on the campaign trail in 2016 mr trump said bringing back the gold standard would be very hard to do but boy would it be wonderful we d have a standard on which to base our money mr trump and many of his supporters regard the imf world bank as the ultimate globalist conspiracy a supra national central bank but he knows that reviving the pre 1971 gold standard would be problematic as i wrote here in the december 2017 issue it is very unlikely that gold could ever be restored as the key reference commodity in the global monetary system now here is my point some economists regard the adoption of a state sponsored digital currency as the equivalent of a return to the victorian gold standard therefore this is purely conjecture on my part i would not be surprised if team trump is looking seriously at digitising the dollar prepare for the next phase in an interesting interview on 18 march the winklevoss brothers who were around at the birth of facebook declared themselves extremely confident about the crypto industry the internet took 30 years to become universal blockchain technology is barely ten years old and has only received the serious attention of investors over the last three years or so even if bitcoin bombed in 2018 the number of people with digital wallets which are capable of storing digital money has continued to rise if a new generation of stablecoins does emerge in the near future immune from the speculative volatility which characterised the first wave of digital currencies manic buying and hoarding that development could be a game changer especially for investors for example commodity backed cryptocurrencies could become a way for investors to get exposure to gold copper brent crude whatever at the click of a mouse action i am not qualified to judge the investment potential of buying into cryptocurrencies for speculative purposes however i would urge investors to consider who would gain most in a world where cryptocurrencies were to become the principal medium of exchange and where conversely conventional fiat currencies took a back seat this could happen sooner than we think if you think this is likely to happen soon that would be an argument in favour of investing in social media platforms especially facebook and twitter nyse twtr and of leading payment platforms such as paypal and even credit card providers like visa nyse v facebook and messaging networks like telegram can put digital wallets full of cryptocurrency at the disposal of hundreds of millions if not billions of users with more than 40 billion in annual revenue and greater experience in navigating regulatory issues facebook has a good chance of creating a stablecoin that will be accepted by regulators this will be bad news for banks if they do not keep up jp morgan has shown itself once again to be ahead of the curve also opportunities may arise to invest in the various cryptocurrency exchanges this is

franc are steady to slightly higher disappointment with the german ifo survey kept the euro on the defensive while sterling is near two month lows asia pacific soft australian inflation data boosted the likelihood of a rate cut and sent the australian dollar below 0 7030 to its lowest level since mid march consumer prices were unchanged in q1 the median forecast in the bloomberg survey was 0 2 after a 0 5 gain in q4 18 this translates to a 1 3 year over year pace down from 1 8 the underlying measures softened as well australia s two year yield tumbled 15 basis points to 1 30 the cash rate sits at 1 5 the pendulum of market expectations has swung from around a 1 in 9 chance of a cut next month at the end of last week to better than even money now the market is trying to decipher the policy signal of the injection of liquidity by the people s bank of china via the targeted medium term lending facility many see this as a sign of restraint and reluctance to ease policy broadly we are hesitant to read much into this operation officials surprised at the start of the week by announcing the may 1 holiday would be extended for three days western press accounts play up official wariness of unrest and report some types of censorship have risen e g some music removed from streaming platforms and controls on academics have tightened the may fourth movement s 100 year anniversary is the ostensible catalyst although the may fourth movement gave rise to modern china and the communist party claims to be the heir the vision of universal and individual freedoms has withered and left a gap between the ccp and the people which chinese leaders seem to be well aware of even if it is an example of affirmation through negation then in june june 4 is the 50th anniversary of the violent suppression of the tiananmen square demonstration the dollar continues to hover around jpy112 00 today it is holding in a quarter yen range below this nemesis it had closed a few days near the middle of the month above jpy112 but there has not been a convincing break a convincing break of jpy111 60 may suggest the market has given up for the moment the australian dollar

suggesting that europe s largest economy is continuing to struggle with its manufacturing and trade the weakness is carrying into q2 the overall assessment of the business climate slipped back to 99 2 from a revised 99 7 in march from 99 6 note that this measure has increased only twice since the middle of last year once last august and once in march measures of the current assessment and expectations both retreated that said the pessimism may be checked by news that sentiment in the service sector has risen to a four month high the uk government talks with labour do not appear to be going anywhere quickly prime minister may seems to be of two minds after the withdrawal bill failed to draw much support from the tories for the third time may has made some overtures toward labour but reports indicate she is unwilling to make the necessary concessions such as a customs union perhaps this is because she is using talks with labour to force the conservatives to back her reports are suggesting that may could offer her bill again in a way to allow amendments to be attached that might enable it to pass we are not particularly hopeful that may s tactics will succeed indeed it may not be original but the end of may might very well be the end of may the euro has traded below 1 12 during five sessions this year including today and has consistently found bids thus far it has

according to the bank for international settlement triennial central bank survey bis the foreign exchange market or fx or forex market is the largest and most liquid in the world with a global turnover measuring 5 1 trillion per day in 2016 as disclosed in the table below courtesy of bis foreign exchange swap transactions cleared an impressive turnover of more than 2 3 trillion per day in 2016 trailed reasonably close by foreign exchange spot transactions at more than 1 6 trillion per day spot market trading activity actually fell by 19 in april 2016 this is the first time since 2001 spot turnover has decreased the fx market is in effect a global auction house for currency transactions determining the relative value of currencies unlike other financial markets the fx market is decentralised an over the counter market meaning no central location or formal exchanges exist according to bis turnover by currencies shows the us dollar remains the world s dominant vehicle currency it was on one side of 88 of all trades in april 2016 up slightly from 87 in april 2013 daily share approx no matter which trading style you employ familiarising yourself with some of the market s g10 currencies ten of the most heavily traded and liquid currencies in the world is imperative the us dollar distributed by the federal reserve regularly titled the fed the us dollar is the official currency of the united states of america typically referred to as the greenback or buck the us dollar snatches the lion s share in terms of daily volume in the fx market the dollar is called greenback as the paper notes issued during the american civil war in 1861 had a distinctive green colouring on the back the exact origin of the term buck isn t clear though strong evidence indicates people began calling dollars bucks in the 18th century thanks to deer specifically with the trading of deerskins long term government stability the world s largest economy and a power house in international trade contributes to the dollar s popularity in addition to this the us dollar is the world s primary reserve currency valued at approximately 63 of currency reserves according to imf figures another interesting point is the greenback s connection to commodities the us dollar is influenced by demand for commodities as many are denominated in dollars this indicates commodities are subject to not only market supply and demand but also to the relative value of the us dollar as a result should the value of the dollar decline it ll cost investors more dollars to purchase commodities and vice versa major currency pairs all foreign exchange trades involve purchasing one currency and selling hence the term currency pair to keep an eye on containing the greenback are the eur usd usd jpy gbp usd aud usd usd chf and usd cad it is also worth observing the us dollar index the index factors in the exchange rates of six major g10 currencies over half of the index s value is represented by the dollar s value measured against the euro the additional five currencies consist of the japanese yen the british pound the canadian dollar the swedish krona and the swiss franc one use of this index is deciphering usd positioning across neighbouring currencies as a base for correlations as an example say the us dollar index is trading from demand a form of technical analysis by way of price action and the eur usd from supply the odds of price turning lower from the said supply increases the euro issued by the european central bank or more commonly referred to as the ecb the euro is the second most traded currency worldwide the euro also known as either the single or shared currency is the official legal tender of 19 of the 28 member states of the european union eu this group of states is known as the eurozone or euro area and holds approximately 340 million citizens as of 2019 the popularity of the euro is primarily down to the scale and economic clout of the area it s used the eurozone the euro s value is strongly influenced by political and economic developments decisions regarding interest rates made by central banks tend to have a significant impact on their respective currencies inflation is another key factor affecting all currencies including the euro the key measure of inflation in the eurozone is the consumer price index cpi major currency pairs containing the euro to watch are the eur usd eur jpy and eur gbp the japanese yen headquartered in the heart of tokyo the bank of japan boj is responsible for issuing yen implementing monetary policy and maintaining the stability of the japanese financial system the yen s value is highly dependent on the strength of japan s economy particularly its manufacturing sector in many respects international trade is the lifeblood of japan s economy while the yen serves as the official currency of japan it is also asia s most traded currency many foreign exchange traders pay attention to economic releases out of japan including but certainly not limited to boj meets and announcements industrial production figures unemployment data and gdp numbers it might also interest some traders to note the japanese yen the third most traded currency in the fx market and swiss franc tend to serve well as safe haven currencies in times of economic uncertainty this is attributed to the fact japan is one of the world s largest exporters in dollar terms japan has always been a large exporter and has continually exported significantly more goods and services than it imports the result has been decades of current account surpluses positioning the country as a net creditor to the world major currency pairs containing the japanese yen to watch are the usd jpy eur jpy and gbp jpy the british pound for more than 300 years the bank of england boe has been the authority issuing british pound banknotes also known as pound sterling or cable pound coins originally weighed one troy pound of sterling silver giving the currency the name pound sterling cable is also a popular nickname for the gbp usd currency pair foreign exchange traders often base the pound s value the fourth most traded currency in the fx market on the overall strength of the british economy and political stability of its government central bank monetary policies employment and gdp releases among other reports tend to have a marked effect on the direction the pound takes across the board sterling s value has significantly declined of late affected by the country electing to exit the european union eu on march 2019 creating a somewhat divided country between those who wish to remain in the eu and those who want to exit major currency pairs containing the british pound are the gbp usd gbp jpy and the eur gbp the australian dollar the australian dollar often labelled as a commodity linked currency due to its relationship with china s movement china is australia s largest trading partner in both exports and imports while australia is china s sixth largest merchandise trading partner and the commodity markets behind china australia is the world s largest producer of gold and therefore has a positive correlation with the precious metal so when gold prices rise the australian dollar typically finds support and appreciates as well is the currency of the commonwealth of australia issued by the reserve bank of australia and representing the fifth most traded currency in the foreign exchange markets the aussie dollar often reacts to both local macroeconomic events and those released out of china for reasons briefly highlighted above major currency pairs containing the australian dollar are the aud usd and aud jpy the swiss franc the official currency of switzerland and the sixth most traded currency in the fx market switzerland s reputation for financial services and relatively sound monetary policies has made the swiss franc a safe haven currency also known as the swissie among the financial community the country has a low rate of inflation and people have confidence in the swiss national bank the swiss national bank has the exclusive right to issue banknotes in switzerland the swiss franc similar to the japanese yen typically advances to higher ground in times of global economic uncertainty an important inverse correlation to keep an eye on is between the eur usd and the usd chf currency pairs this can help traders pin down potential reversals using a myriad of trading strategies for example price trading at support on the eur usd coupled with a similar scenario present on the usd chf from resistance adds weight to a move being seen in both markets major currency pairs containing the swiss franc are the usd chf eur chf and chf jpy bottom line as demonstrated above each currency has specific traits while it is beyond the scope of an article to list all the currency pair s twists and oddities the piece has hopefully provided traders a foundation to expand one s knowledge in the foreign exchange market
so said the sunday telegraph last week the sunday telegraph is more the weekend reading of the average conservative voter than it is the authoritative voice of our ruling class it said jeremy corbyn is on course to sweep into no 10 after theresa may failed to deliver on her promise to take the uk out of the eu by march 29 this scary analysis designed to galvanise tory opinion is that conservatives would lose 59 seats in the event of a general election making labour the largest party in the commons the sunday telegraph panicked iain duncan smith the former conservative leader and amber rudd the work and pensions secretary would be at high risk of being voted out cheering though this news is a tory rout is not yet a done deal the prospect of a general election frightens more than the most unpopular tory figures like rudd and duncan smith tory terror goes beyond the scores of conservative mps heading for electoral oblivion the handful of liberal democrats in parliament who split three ways over brexit have failed to compete effectively for the remain vote and are set to remain outside of government even if they retain much of a parliamentary toehold many snp seats are held by small majorities and are vulnerable to an effective labour campaign the green vote leaks both ways losing people to change tinge to the right and on the left to labour s enhanced credibility as a party of radical government none of these people want an election but the most substantial opposition to an early general election lies more with the decisive sectors of the ruling class who understand better than do electors in general that a left led labour government is a real threat to ruling class hegemony and the wealth and power on which this rests this is why despite a government unable to command a commons majority one beset by irreconcilable divisions and with its approval ratings dropping through the floor the powers that be are determined to prevent an election it is axiomatic that oppositional parties like labour get a chance at government most usually when capitalism is undergoing one of its cyclical crises equally axiomatic is the forlorn experience of left wing governments abandoning their radical policies under pressure from the class power and institutional reach of capital our most recent example is greece where syriza captured the anti austerity sentiments of millions where a very wide coalition of political and social movements invested their hopes in its promise of change the disastrous opportunism of syriza s leadership in arousing people s expectations of a rupture with eu economic orthodoxy in assembling a huge national movement to repudiate the demands of the troika and then capitulating serves as a warning the inevitable price of such a betrayal lies not just in the misery and impoverishment which inevitably accompanies the brutal imposition of eu austerity but in demoralisation demobilisation and growth of far right forces which follows it when push came to shove the syriza leadership chose accommodation with the power of capital and its institutions the european central bank the international monetary fund and the eu commission and with domestic reaction local capital and in government with a right wing nationalist formation to which they awarded the defence ministry the syriza coalition of the left has ended up administering the most damaging austerity regime in europe tied more tightly into nato s war machine than even earlier pasok governments and is cuddling up to the israeli regime of course greece is a smaller economy and a weaker capitalist entity than britain and the failure of syriza to challenge the illusions many greeks retained in the country s membership of the eurozone meant that the troika held even stronger cards in the negotiations in a european union which itself serves to both institutionalise and intensify some of the contradictions that inevitably exist between competing capitalist states the relatively smaller greek economy could be easily robbed of its socially owned assets in order to service debts held by german and french banks the coteries of troika officials parachuted into greek ministries with dictatorial powers reinforced the reality that locked into the euro there is little that any government can do we have our own experience of the pressures that can destabilise a government from springtime in 1990 britain then holding the presidency of what was then the european economic community eec was part of the so called exchange rate mechanism this was the instrument which laid the ground to more closely align european currencies in preparation for monetary union and the substitution of the euro for francs marks etc on wednesday september 16 1992 i was in the white hart on the edge of the city with a crowd of trade union activists and full timers in the same bar was a bunch of bankers and currency traders the pound had been under extreme pressure from currency speculators and in order to shore it up and keep it with the limits of the erm the government raised the interest rate to 10 per cent treasury orthodoxy grounded in a ruling class terror of inflation was to avoid devaluation at all costs the pressure was intensified by george soros s quantum hedge fund empire based in new york london and the tax havens of curacao and the cayman islands which the day before had begun to offload its stash of sterling black wednesday as it came to be called demonstrated just how an avaricious pack of speculators could bring pressure to bear on a government interest rates rose to 12 per cent and then 15 per cent by the time we were sinking our after work pints the pound was sinking precipitously that evening chancellor of the exchequer norman lamont pulled britain out of the exchange rate mechanism the episode cost the exchequer more than 6 billion soros however found his speculative adventure highly profitable and trousered a cool 1bn which was estimated to cost each person in britain more than a tenner that is how soros came to be known as the man who broke the bank of england very instructive were the reactions of the two groups of white hart drinkers the bankers heavily invested in the market myths of finance capitalism were sunk in despair and it emerged in the lively arguments which followed quite unsystematic in their thinking highly focused on technical aspects of currency trading and both ignorant of and unengaged with problems of the wider productive economy and of human and social needs the trade unionists were exuberant some had a good grasp of the processes and a political and moral aversion to the parasitic nature of speculative capitalism but all of us were delighted to see the strategies of the tory regime thatcher s successors confounded the episode cemented in the public mind both the idea that the casino economy was inherently unstable and that the tories were spectacularly incompetent britain of course is not a member of the eurozone instead our central bank is truly independent really truly independent even of the government especially the government which has little power over the bank s independent decision making this is gordon brown s tribute to the idea that the main instrument of fiscal and monetary policy should be unassailable by popular power or democratic oversight but instead control should be invested in a group of top civil servants and mainstream bourgeois economists the independence of central banks from government interference is a foundational tenet of neoliberal economic thought located in the heart of the largely autonomous city state that is the city of london and tied to it by 1 000 human and professional links the bank of england exercises enormous power over the direction of the british economy and serves to buttress the global reach of capital notwithstanding any tensions which inevitably arise between these two competing instruments of power the domination by neoliberal economic orthodoxies over both central bank and the treasury functionaries means that both entities sing from the same song sheet whichever party is in office the bank of england has the power to change interest rates its monetary policy committee periodically meets to consider this question and the course taken by its deliberations surface in the press in the form of carefully coded disputes about the utility to the smooth functioning of the economy of this or that rise or fall in interest rates a precipitous rise in interest rates imposed independently of any government decision has the capacity to seriously derail a government programme in a british economy in which millions of working people are up to their necks in debt and saddled with mortgages a rise in interest rates is potentially disastrous and a powerful weapon in the hands of our class enemy the underlying rationale for the idea that a bunch of central bank officials and orthodox economists should have the power to independently control the monetary policy of a country of 60 odd million people might strike the innocent observer as wanting a rational explanation the conventional answer to this question is that politicians cannot be trusted with these matters the democratic response to such a suggestion is that hitherto the wrong kind of politicians have been in government and the wrong kind of economists are working at the bank and sitting on its monetary policy committee all this is of course just part of the armoury at the disposal of big capital controlling the export of capital corralling capital for productive investment bringing the rich into an equitable tax system are very big tasks for which labour s recent history in government does not give much guidance beyond these directly economic tasks are a very challenging set of political tasks which will turn on whether our working class and working people as a whole and the labour movement understands the forces at play is conscious of the many ways in which capital will manoeuvre to protect itself and is organised to defend a government which is for the many and not the few

use the lexology getting the deal through tool to compare the answers in this article with those from other jurisdictions mining industry standing what is the nature and importance of the mining industry in your country there is a large potential in different geological provinces for mining projects of world class magnitude with only 25 years of consistent though not continuous mining exploration bulk mineable ore bodies for copper gold silver lithium specially in brines have been identified resulting probably in one of the largest undeveloped resources within latin america today in accordance with official data recently published by the ministry of energy and mining the mining industry represented only 1 per cent of national gdp in recent years however the trend and forecast indicate that the mining sector s overall contribution to the country s gdp will increase by 3 or 4 per cent in 2025 as projects in the portfolio start being developed and new funds from foreign direct investment are allocated to greenfield exploration after many years of unreliable official industry statistical information the current administration has been producing and publishing credible and reliable economic and geological data pursuant to a report made in 2018 by the argentine chamber of mining enterprises in 2017 the mining industry contributed us 3 774 million to the economy increasing by 4 2 per cent compared with 2016 total mining exports in 2017 increased by 6 per cent totalling us 4 143 million target minerals what are the target minerals the main target minerals in argentina were and still are copper gold silver and lithium this last mineral with an increasing interest in the past couple of years other targeted minerals include potash iron aluminium uranium boron molybdenum lead and zinc during the past few years and particularly in 2016 2017 there has been an increased interest in minerals used in battery technology and renewable energy such as lithium cobalt and manganese in the main the increasing trend worldwide regarding lithium has also taken place in argentina the country is part of the lithium triangle together with chile and bolivia and is considered potentially the third largest producer of lithium in the world therefore the interest in this mineral will continue to increase owing to different regulatory schemes both in chile and bolivia which are more restrictive argentina has gained a very strong position as a target for investors in this mineral additionally and in recent years there has been a growing interest in fracking sands intended to supply the needs of argentina s flagship shale oil and gas deposit vaca muerta regions which regions are most active the majority of mining deposits in argentina are concentrated alongside the andes mountains which are one of the most important sources of mineral resources in the world in addition in the deseado massif located in the patagonian province of santa cruz there are many significant mining resources consequently the most active and traditional provinces in the mining industry are san juan catamarca salta santa cruz and more recently jujuy in connection with lithium where the main producing mines are located in terms of mining exploration including early and advanced stages are the provinces of san juan santa cruz salta jujuy and rio negro and chubut legal and regulatory structure basis of legal system is the legal system civil or common law based the legal system in argentina is civil law based the system is mainly based on its pillars which are the national constitution nc and the national civil and commercial code nccc regulation how is the mining industry regulated argentina is organised as a federal republic consisting of 23 autonomous provinces and the autonomous city of buenos aires organised under the nc each province enacts its own provincial constitution as a result the mining industry is regulated at national provincial and municipal levels in accordance with the nc the provinces are the original owners of the natural resources existing in their territories therefore while the national congress enacts the substantive mining legislation through the argentine mining code amc and related legislation the provinces are empowered to regulate the procedures related thereto which cannot conflict with substantive legislation and enact complementary regulation which includes environmentally protected areas municipal governments have jurisdiction in regulating related issues what are the principal laws that regulate the mining industry what are the principal regulatory bodies that administer those laws were there any major amendments in the past year the principal law that regulates the mining industry is the amc which governs the rights obligations and procedures regarding the exploration exploitation and use of mineral substances the amc sets forth the legal framework that rules the relationship between the state and the miner through an exploration permit or a mining concession and between the miner and third parties in relation to the regulatory bodies administering the legal framework it depends on whether the legislation is national provincial or municipal the provinces are the granting authorities of mining rights depending on the administrative structure of each province the rele vant provincial mining authority may either be a mining directorate within the provincial executive branch or a mining court within the provincial judicial branch additionally there are other key regulations at the national and provincial levels that constitute the legal mining framework such as the provincial proceedings mining codes the mining investment law no 24 196 as amended by law no 25 161 mil the federal mining agreement approved by law no 24 228 recently amended by the new federal mining agreement though subject to its ratification by the national congress and provincial legislatures and resolution no 110 2017 of the national secretariat of mining which abrogates resolution no 12 2012 and resolution no 13 2012 it is also important to mention other material regulations that although not being of a strictly mining nature affect the industry which are as follows national and provincial environmental regulations archaeological and paleontological heritage protection national law no 25 743 border zone restrictions rural lands law no 26 737 provincial zoning laws public private partnership law no 27 328 ppp law and anti corruption law no 27 401 major amendments to the mining legal framework over the past year include the following resolution no 110 2017 of the national secretariat of mining which abrogated resolution no 12 2012 resolution no 13 2012 and resolution no 54 2012 that established the obligation for beneficiary companies of the mil to hire national freight services for the export operation of minerals or derived products additionally resolution no 110 2017 established that new mining projects and expansion projects seeking to request the benefit of fiscal stability contemplated in section 8 of the mil must submit along with the project s feasibility study a participation in national industry plan and also the beneficiary companies are requested to provide information on purchases and contracting of capital goods equipment parts or components elements of said goods inputs services and a project for substitution of imports the new federal mining agreement signed on 13 june 2017 sets general principles and guidelines for the mining sector the signatory parties are the federal government and the argentine provinces except for the provinces of la rioja chubut la pampa and san luis the agreement intends to make uniform the different rules and practices adopted by the provinces for the mining sector in past years and it intends to modify some provisions of the amc and the mil however all the provisions of the federal mining agreement that require legislative approval or ratification to be in force or operative must become in force with the approval of the federal congress and each of the provincial legislative bodies as applicable it is foreseen that the federal congress will approve these provisions during 2018 although not specifically for the mining sector the regime established by the ppp law was approved in 2016 and regulated in 2017 the regime sets forth a new tool for infrastructure development in the country ppp is conceived as a new alternative regime for public construction works different from the traditional system the ppp projects announced by the federal government are related to transport infrastructure construction and amendments of roads and highways and extension of existing power transmission lines among others these significant projects once finalised could improve the infrastructure for many mining projects in addition once the ppp regime is consolidated it could be used for mining related infrastructure as well and become an important tool to foster mining development in certain areas of the country also unrelated specifically to mining although very relevant for all industries in 2017 the argentine anti corruption law no 27 401 was enacted and established a corporate criminal liability regime for offences against public administration and for international bribery the legal entities involved in the offences described in the regime are liable for the crimes committed to avoid being held liable legal entities must show that the individual who committed the crime acted on his or her exclusive benefit and that the company did not benefit from such act also the legal entity shall not be subject to any sanction or administrative liability when all the following circumstances are present self reporting as a consequence of an internal investigation existence of an adequate compliance programme in place prior to the occurrence of the offence and refunding of the monies illegally obtained finally the anti corruption law states that legal entities must have an adequate compliance programme in place and in february 2018 the provincial government of the province of san juan enacted two provincial laws that foster and promote mining activity provincial law no 1722 m created a provincial incentive fund for mining entrepreneurs that will encourage and help projects at the exploration stage aiming to invest in mining entrepreneur activities through corporate and other types of participation or investment in new projects provincial law no 1723 m established a mining promotion regime exempting mining exploration companies from paying provincial taxes such as gross incomes and stamp taxes among others such exemptions are provided only from the exploration stage of the project until the production date classification system what classification system does the mining industry use for reporting mineral resources and mineral reserves argentina lacks specific regulation in this field local geologist associations have been lobbying with the support of professional bars and industry chambers for the implementation of an argentinian code on classification and reporting of mineral resources and mineral reserves based on the guidelines and standards set forth by the committee for mineral reserves international reporting standards notwithstanding the foregoing since the vast majority of investments in the mining industry are undertaken by foreign companies the resources and reserves of argentinian hosted projects are usually classified and reported by the controlling entities in accordance with the system in force in their place of incorporation or listing mostly canada or australia it is relevant to note however that there are ongoing negotiations between chambers of commerce and the comisión nacional de valores the capital markets regulator to develop guidelines in this respect mining rights and title state control over mining rights to what extent does the state control mining rights in your jurisdiction can those rights be granted to private parties and to what extent will they have title to minerals in the ground are there large areas where the mining rights are held privately or which belong to the owner of the surface rights is there a separate legal regime or process for third parties to obtain mining rights in those areas provinces are the original owners of the natural resources existing within their territories although they are not allowed to exploit such resources directly the relevant mining rights are granted by the provinces to third parties by way of a legal concession once a mining concession is granted the title holder owns all the in place deposits within the boundaries of the property whatever the mineral substance contained therein surface landowners lack proprietary rights over the mineral deposits which may only be obtained by means of a legal concession exception is made with regards to certain types of industrial and non metallic minerals over which surface landowners have priority rights or exclusivity rights depending on the type of mineral publicly available information and data what information and data are publicly available to private parties that wish to engage in exploration and other mining activities is there an agency which collects mineral assessment reports from private parties must private parties file mineral assessment reports does the agency or the government conduct geoscience surveys which become part of the database is the database available online law no 24 466 created a national database of geological information managed by public entity segemar whose mission is to obtain process and make available to the public all information generated by the geological and geophysical research and exploration activities conducted within the argentinian territory the national government and other national entities as well as the miners beneficiaries registered under the mil are required to periodically supply the database all the mining and geological information produced with the exception of that which qualifies as confidential even though the information should be publicly available in practice access to it may not be direct or straightforward it is expected that this situation will be improved in the coming years in addition certain provinces make material mining cadastral information available and some of them provide a mining cadastral map online acquisition of rights by private parties what mining rights may private parties acquire how are these acquired what obligations does the rights holder have if exploration or reconnaissance licences are granted does such tenure give the holder an automatic or preferential right to acquire a mining licence what are the requirements to convert to a mining licence the amc provides for two types of mining rights exploration permits and mining concessions both of which are granted on a first come first served basis exploration permits are exclusive authorisations to explore a certain area during the period and to the extent provided by the amc the exploration permit is opposable with regard to third parties and holders of such will have exclusivity rights to apply for and obtain a mining concession within the area covered by such permit mining concessions grant the title holder the right to conduct further exploration works after a discovery has taken place and to exploit all the in place deposits within the boundaries of the mine mining concessions are not subject to a life term and therefore to the extent the title holder does not incur in any of the concession termination events set forth in the amc the concession will last until the extinction of the mineral reserves the two essential obligations to keep the title of a mining concession in good standing are the payment of an annual mining fee and the lodgement of and compliance with an investment plan non compliance with these obligations provides for the termination of the concession to obtain an exploration permit the miner needs to lodge an application including a minimum work plan an estimate of the investments to be made and pay a provisional exploration fee the area shall be free of previous mining rights in force mining concessions are granted on mine discoveries which may or may not have an exploration permit as precedent and mines that are vacant on account of expired concessions renewal and transfer of mineral licences what is the regime for the renewal and transfer of mineral licences exploration permits are not renewable and no person can be granted successive permits over the same area within one year from its expiry mining concessions are not subject to a life term thus they do not need to be renewed the transfer of a mining rights title or change of control is not subject to governmental approval although certain formalities may apply ie public deed in the case of surveyed mines once the title has been assigned the transfer documents need to be filed with the authority which registers such in the public registries for publicity purposes with regard to third parties notwithstanding the foregoing certain governmental approvals may be required for the transfer and change of control with respect to surface lands duration of mining rights what is the typical duration of mining rights as explained in question 10 mining rights can involve exploration permits and mining concessions exploration permits have a limited duration and expire according to the amc regulations since they are intended to allow for an exclusive area and within such mining concessions can be applied for mining concessions do not have a duration they will follow an procedure to become a mine that will be in legal existence until the minerals are exhausted notwithstanding this mining concessions can be revoked if the main conditions to keep them are not fulfilled these conditions as explained in question 10 are the annual mining fee payment and the investment additionally a mining concession can eventually be revoked if a mine has been inactive for more than four years in accordance with the terms of section 225 of the amc acquisition by domestic parties versus acquisition by foreign parties is there any distinction in law or practice between the mining rights that may be acquired by domestic parties and those that may be acquired by foreign parties there is no distinction between the mining rights that may be acquired by domestic or foreign parties nevertheless foreign companies need to register in argentina as a local vehicle incorporation of a branch or as a shareholder of a local company in order to own mining rights or conduct activities that exceed the threshold of an isolated act of commerce also certain restrictions and prior approvals apply to the acquisition of land by foreign entities protection of mining rights how are mining rights protected are foreign arbitration awards in respect of domestic mining disputes freely enforceable in your jurisdiction the nc provides for a general and comprehensive protection to property rights stating that they may not be violated and no inhabitant can be deprived thereof except by virtue of a judgment based on law argentina has an independent judicial system organised under the rule of law and the principle of due process depending on the issue discussed the courts with jurisdiction on the matter may be either national or provincial with regards to the enforcement of foreign arbitral awards argentina is a party to the un convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards of 1958 should there be no treaty between argentina and the relevant jurisdiction the relevant procedural laws of each province shall apply for instance procedural codes usually provide that in order to have an arbitral award recognised and enforced without further discussion of its merits it must comply with different requirements ie the arbitral tribunal must have had valid jurisdiction the dispute may be validly referred to arbitration under argentinian law or the arbitral award must not violate public policy under argentinian law surface rights what types of surface rights may mining rights holders request and acquire how are these rights acquired can surface rights holders oppose these requests mining rights form a different property from the land in which the deposits are located thus title to the mining rights does not entail title to the surface land the amc allows for different kinds of mining easements such as easement of road occupation water use and transport infrastructure and any other necessary use of land that would allow for an easement placement technically surface rights holders should not be entitled to oppose the request of any easement since it would be based on the public utility of the mining activity they could only challenge the compensation if considered unsuitable therefore the amc sets forth certain legal tools in favour of the miner for purposes of achieving access to the surface lands such as the right to obtain easements use and occupation road water and even the right to demand the compulsory sale of the surface land notwithstanding the foregoing owing to the complexity of implementing these processes in practical terms and the increasing reputation and social costs associated it is always advisable for both parties to reach an agreement also where the surface land is state owned miners have the right to access this land and use it without the need to pay any monetary compensation participation of government and state agencies does the government or do state agencies have the right to participate in mining projects is there a local listing requirement for the project company the amc restricts as a general rule the government s ability to exploit mining rights although such restriction is not applicable to state owned entities the amc allows governments or their state owned entities to conduct exploration works within their territory without the need of obtaining a prior permit and have exclusive areas of special interest for mining prospecting purposes in these cases the amc allows private parties to participate in these areas of interest by public tender the successful bidder of an area may apply for one or more exploration permits or mining concessions within that area which are to be governed by the general provisions of the amc notwithstanding any such further obligation that may be applicable in accordance with the tender rules note that to increase the share of mining profits provincial state owned mining entities have started to show more interest in participating in mining projects developed by private companies a trend along this line with new joint ventures and associations started a couple of years ago and may still continue based on the fact that profits of the projects need to be better allocated or shared with the public which purpose may not necessarily be fulfilled by this structure in addition and in certain provinces eg jujuy that may consider certain minerals as strategic eg lithium this also provides grounds for the provincial state to participate in the project government expropriation of licences are there provisions in law dealing with government expropriation of licences what are the compensation provisions the nc provides that expropriation for reasons of public interest must be necessarily established by law and previously indemnified this constitutional guarantee applies to all significant interests that a human being or a legal entity can possess including mining rights furthermore section 16 of the amc provides that mines might be expropriated only for reasons of public interest of a higher level than the privilege recognised to them under section 13 of the amc which states that the exploration exploitation and concession of mines have the status of public benefit law no 21 499 regulates the procedure applicable to expropriations decided at the national level according to this regulation the indemnification for the expropriation only comprises the objective value of the asset or right and those damages that are a direct and immediate consequence thereof if no settlement agreement is reached on the value of the expropriated property the matter shall be decided by a judicial court provinces have their own expropriation rules in line with the national ones there are no specific rules for valuation and indemnification of expropriated mining rights protected areas are any areas designated as protected areas within your jurisdiction and which are off limits or specially regulated national parks law no 22 351 prohibits the performing of any kind of economic activity except tourism within certain protected areas located in the argentinian territory mining activities are specifically prohibited therein as well as in the establishment of industrial sites note also that there are many areas considered protected areas or reserve areas regulated locally within the boundaries of each province that may allow activities or restrict them in some way including mining activities this is a matter that requires a case by case analysis an example is the reserve area of los andes in the province of salta that comprises quite a number of projects including lithium projects in addition national law no 26 639 on minimum standards for the preservation of glaciers and periglacial environments establishes a general prohibition rule that bans the development of all those activities that negatively affect the natural condition of glaciers involving destruction removal or interference with their progress mining exploration and exploitation activities are specifically prohibited in may 2018 the national inventory of glaciers stage 1 was published by argentina s institute of nivology glaciology and environmental sciences ianiglia final work will require stages 2 and 3 special reference must be made to law no 3 105 of the province of santa cruz enacted in 2009 which created an area of special mining interest within which it is allowed to conduct mining activities the law also identifies certain areas that are excluded from the area of special mining interest law duties royalties and taxes duties royalties and taxes payable by private parties what duties royalties and taxes are payable by private parties carrying on mining activities are these revenue based or profit based argentina is organised as a federal country in which the taxing power is distributed between the national government and the provinces in addition municipalities also hold taxing power faculties with limited scope as a general rule entities carrying on mining activities in argentina are subject to the general taxation framework applicable to all companies which comprises income tax vat alternative minimum income tax gross turnover tax etc with regards to specific duties payable by the mining sector the provinces as owners of the mineral resources are entitled to collect a royalty payment to be calculated as a percentage of the pithead value of the mineral extracted the mil capped the royalties to be collected by the provinces at 3 per cent provinces that have adhered to the mil which most have are legally committed not to exceed this cap export taxes on mineral concentrates and gold bullion have recently been removed it is worth noting that some provinces have been considering increasing the mining royalty although from a legal perspective this would require that the relevant province waives its adherence to the mil in recent times provinces had also initiated a trend to create additional taxes or fees in order to participate to a more significant degree in the benefits of the projects tax advantages and incentives what tax advantages and incentives are available to private parties carrying on mining activities the mil establishes a promotional regime that provides for certain tax incentives and benefits for companies duly registered thereunder which has proven to be especially useful for large scale mining projects the main features and benefits of the mil are as follows tax stabilisation 30 years of tax stabilisation cap on royalties 3 per cent on the pithead value income tax benefits deductibility benefits right to deduct each year from their income tax return 100 per cent of the amounts invested in prospecting special research mineral and metallurgical tests pilot plants applied research and other works performed for the purpose of determining the technical and economic feasibility of a project in the cases of expansion of existing projects or starting new projects the above mentioned deductions may be recognised in the fiscal year in which production commences in addition beneficiaries are allowed to deduct provisions of cost to prevent and remedy any environmental damage derived from their activity up to 5 per cent of their operational costs accelerated depreciation benefits investments in housing transport construction of plants and equipment in connection with the necessary infrastructure for mining activities including gas pipelines transmission lines roads may be depreciated within three years in accordance with certain rules capital contributions any income derived from the contribution of mines and mining rights as payment for the subscription of shares of registered beneficiary companies are exempt from income tax such contributions must be maintained on the beneficiary s books for a minimum term of five years except where otherwise authorised by the national mining authority the relevant capital increase and issue of shares is exempt from stamp taxes vat benefits beneficiaries that purchase or import new capital assets or services that are directly or indirectly applied to mining activities may obtain a relief in the financial impact of vat by means of two special mechanisms advance vat reimbursement or interest free loan import benefits exemption on duties and other charges in relation to the import of capital assets associated to local projects and other tax benefits assets associated to mining projects under the mil are exempt from alternative minimum presumed income tax in addition to the federal advantages most argentine provinces foresee the following exemption or reduced gross turnover tax rates on the local commercialisation of minerals export of minerals is not subject to gross turnover tax in any province and stamp tax exemptions the scope and extension of each benefit depends on each jurisdiction tax stablisation does any legislation provide for tax stabilisation or are there tax stabilisation agreements in force the mil provides a 30 year tax stability applicable to the project s tax burden in force as at the filing of a feasibility report the mil works as a general framework applicable to all mining companies that comply with its requirements there are no tax stabilisation agreements consequently the total tax burden applicable to the project at the national provincial and municipal levels will not be increased as a result of any new tax duty or charge the benefit works as a cap thus if taxes are abrogated or tax rates decreased stabilised projects will bene fit from those changes general information exchange regimes and customs duties regulations are likewise included in the law except for exchange rate reimbursements and refunding of taxes as a result of exports that are governed by different specific laws indirect taxes eg vat and excise taxes and social security contributions are excluded from the tax stability benefit carried interest is the government entitled to a carried interest or a free carried interest in mining projects the government does not have carry rights in mining projects nevertheless it had become common practice in certain provinces that mining rights were awarded to state owned companies which in turn entered into farm out or option agreements with private third parties and retained free carry rights or options over these properties or over the vehicles through which these were held transfer taxes and capital gains are there any transfer taxes or capital gains imposed regarding the transfer of licences the transfer of mining rights is subject to capital gains tax which varies depending on the status of the seller this tax also applies if the transfer is accomplished by transferring the shares of the argentine vehicle distinction between domestic parties and foreign parties is there any distinction between the duties royalties and taxes payable by domestic parties and those payable by foreign parties there are no substantial distinctions between resident and non resident investors from an argentine tax perspective the only factor that could lead to tax differentiation is for business entities or vehicles resident in non cooperative jurisdictions with tax transparency as a general rule this includes those with which argentina does not have an in force convention for information exchange or is not in the course of negotiating an international treaty including an information exchange clause business structures principal business structures what are the principal business structures used by private parties carrying on mining activities there are different business vehicles available to conduct mining activities under argentinian law although the structures most commonly used are the sociedades anonimas sa similar to corporations and branch offices the advantages that derive from the use of sas are related to the share structure and therefore flexibility in transfer and related arrangements and the isolation of responsibility in turn branches enjoy certain advantages over sas eg there is no requirement of having at least two shareholders neither of having a majority of residents in argentina to form the board there were two recent business vehicles added to the regulatory regime the sau sociedad anónima unipersonal or single shareholder corporation and the sas sociedad anónima simplificada or simplified corporation the sau was foreseen by the nccc enacted in 2015 this vehicle would stand as a good alternative for foreign investors since only one shareholder is required in contrast to sas which require at least two also intercompany funding may not prove as flexible as in other entities the sas entered into force in september 2017 with lower complexity and administration costs and greater flexibility to regulate internal corporate affairs it is considered an additional vehicle option the sas can be incorporated by digital means and its mandatory book and records should be identified and kept by the general inspector of corporations by electronic means local entity requirement is there a requirement that a local entity be a party to the transaction this is required for foreign companies in order to own mining rights or conduct mining activities their registration in argentina as a local vehicle or to participate in a local company bilateral investment and tax treaties are there jurisdictions with favourable bilateral investment treaties or tax treaties with your jurisdiction through which foreign entities will commonly structure their operations in your jurisdiction argentina has subscribed to over 50 bilateral investment treaties for the reciprocal protection and promotion of investments if a dispute under these agreements cannot be settled amicably the national or private company concerned may choose to submit the dispute for resolution in the courts of the party that is a party to the dispute or for settlement by binding arbitration either at the international centre for settlement of investment disputes or in accordance with uncitral arbitration rules australia canada china russia the uk and the us are some of argentina s counterparties additionally as a member of the wto argentina has participated as an observer to the investment committee of the oecd and is a member of the multilateral investment guarantee agency argentina has also entered into double taxation treaties with australia austria belgium bolivia brazil canada chile denmark finland france germany italy mexico the netherlands norway russia spain sweden switzerland the united arab emirates already signed though not in force and the uk under these treaties reduced withholding rates are contemplated for dividends royalties interest and capital gains or business profit clauses for types of income not specifically treated financing principal sources of financing what are the principal sources of financing available to private parties carrying on mining activities what role does the domestic public securities market play in financing the mining industry argentina has no developed capital market to allow the funding of mining companies most mining companies conducting mining activities in argentina are controlled by foreign entities and therefore the financing of local projects is mostly obtained by the companies headquarters in overseas jurisdictions usually exploration activities are funded by equity finance in the toronto stock exchange tsx tsx venture exchange the australian securities exchange and london s alternative investment market at a production stage besides equity finance corporate debt by the controlling entities and project finance have played a role in argentina s largest producing mines resource orientated private equity funds as well as streaming and royalty finance companies also provide funding to the sector additionally and most recently end users have become a source of financing specially in lithium related projects direct financing from government or major pension funds does the government its agencies or major pension funds provide direct financing to mining projects there are no local agencies or pension funds providing specific financing to the sector however certain credit facilities for the acquisition of capital assets may be obtained from the local banking sector security regime describe the regime for taking security over mining interests mines that are surveyed are capable of being mortgaged owing to the fact they are considered real estate properties these mortgages comprise related easements mortgages must be passed into public deeds and registered with the relevant mining authority in the case of exploration permits and mining concessions of mines not yet surveyed it is not legally possible to grant a mortgage over such rights as these do not qualify as real estate properties nevertheless other rights may be granted for purposes of securing these assets eg pledges of the local vehicle shares and guarantee trusts among others restrictions importation restrictions what restrictions are imposed on the importation of machinery and equipment or services required in connection with exploration and extraction in the past argentina had an overall import restrictive policy not specifically targeted at the mining industry but this has been gradually removed and relaxed by the current national administration in general terms there are no specific restrictions on the importation of machinery and equipment or services for the mining industry nevertheless national mining secretariat resolution no 110 2017 abrogated resolution no 12 2012 resolution no 13 2012 and resolution no 54 2012 these resolutions created a framework applicable to mining companies registered under the mil aimed at prioritising the sourcing of local products and services the new framework establishes that new mining projects and expansion projects seeking to request the benefit of fiscal stability contemplated in section 8 of the mil must submit along with the project s feasibility study a participation in national industry plan and also the beneficiary companies are requested to provide information on purchases and contracting of capital goods equipment parts or components elements of said goods inputs services and a project for substitution of imports standard conditions and agreements which standard conditions and agreements covering equipment supplies are used in your jurisdiction there are no specific standard conditions and agreements covering equipment suppliers that are used in argentina however it is worth noting that resolution no 110 issued by the secretary of mines currently in force refers to mandatory submission of a participation in national industry plan along with the project s feasibility study and also to provide information on purchases and contracting of capital goods equipment parts or components of said goods inputs services and a project for substitution of imports in addition the provinces usually have their local procurement regulations that also need to be addressed mineral restrictions what restrictions are imposed on the processing export or sale of minerals are there any export quotas licensing or other mechanisms that prevent producers from freely exporting their production as a general rule there are no restrictions on the export of minerals exception is made with regards to the export of nuclear minerals concentrates and derivatives which enjoy special treatment import of funds restrictions what restrictions are imposed on the import of funds for exploration and extraction or the use of the proceeds from the export or sale of minerals the inflow and outflow of funds to and from argentina is subject to a complex set of foreign exchange fx regulations that are subject to constant change argentina s current administration has removed and relaxed material fx restrictions moreover the fx policy of the new administration provides for certainty and clarity on regulations and their application as a general rule fx transactions the purchase sale and cross border transfer of foreign currency in argentina can only be made in the local fx market upon prior authorisation of the central bank except for those transactions specifically foreseen under the fx regulations that may be conducted without prior authorisation there is no restriction on the inflow of funds resulting from capital contributions or indebtedness although such funds are required to meet a 120 day minimum mandatory waiting period in order to be repatriated it is worth noting that the current administration has recently removed the mandatory deposit which provided for an interest free mandatory deposit for 365 calendar days of 30 per cent of the funds transferred into argentina unless a specific exemption applied to the case with regards to the proceeds from the export of minerals argentine residents are required to repatriate to argentina and sell these proceeds in the local fx market nonetheless companies will be allowed to then repatriate these amounts to their jurisdictions by means of dividends payable by the local vehicle to its shareholders or by servicing intercompany debt where applicable environment principal applicable environmental laws what are the principal environmental laws applicable to the mining industry what are the principal regulatory bodies that administer those laws the nc and specific minimum standards laws such as the general environmental law no 25 675 are the main sources of environmental legislation together with the following the complementary title of the environmental protection for mining activity of the amc as amended by law no 24 585 the complementary rules approved in 1996 by the federal council of mining and provincial local procedural regulations additionally there are also many other national and provincial environmental protection regulations eg on hazardous and industrial wastes protection of archaeological and paleontological heritage water effluents and gas emissions and conservation of natural resources flora and fauna regarding regulatory and enforcement authorities according to article 41 of the nc the national government must issue basic regulations containing minimum standards on environmental protection natural resources natural and cultural heritage biological diversity and environmental information and education while the provincial governments must issue the provisions required to complement said basic regulations in order to effectively implement the protection provided by the nc adapting them to their own environment and development modalities and peculiarities at a national level the environmental legal framework is administrated by the ministry of environment and sustainable development at a provincial level and regarding the mining industry in particular the environmental and enforcement authorities are in certain cases the mining authorities themselves environmental review and permitting process what is the environmental review and permitting process for a mining project how long does it normally take to obtain the necessary permits according to the amc as amended by law no 24 585 prior to the commencement of any of the different phases of mining activity an environmental impact report eir shall be submitted to the relevant provincial enforcement authority provided that until approval has been obtained no mining activity shall be performed the eir shall be assessed with a technical scientific and legal administrative process of analysis and assessment and once the process has concluded the enforcement authority shall issue an environmental impact statement eis containing the terms under which the activity shall be performed in connection with the environment the community and the authority in some cases the environmental authorisation requires summoning the affected community to an obligatory public hearing although the opinions or objections of those attending do not force administrative decisions the specific procedural rules applicable to the authorisation process as well as the time it might take to obtain the relevant permit vary from province to province it must also be mentioned that the eis must be updated at least every two years through the filing of a new eir containing the results of executed environmental actions as well as any new factors that have been generated closure and remediation process what is the closure and remediation process for a mining project what performance bonds guarantees and other financial assurances are required according to the amc the environmental protection rules established by law no 24 585 are applicable to all those activities related to the closure of the mine at a national level there are no detailed specific rules for closing procedures only annex iii of the complementary rules of the amc which determines the contents of the eir for the exploitation stage establishes that an environmental management plan shall include actions concerning the cessation and abandonment of the exploitation and post closure monitoring nonetheless at a provincial level and as a first mover the province of catamarca enacted in 2016 a regulation that foresees specific rules for closing procedures it includes a guide to be followed for the preparation of the mine closure plan with technical and economical requirements to be submitted before the mining authority at the commencement of the mining activity and that should include a closure procedure for each stage of the mining project which must be updated every two years once approved in addition the new federal mining agreement if ratified by the federal and provincial legislative bodies would seek to regulate and established a regime for mine closure under the amc regime no specific bonds guarantees or assurances are required note however that the mil requires companies to allocate an annual amount to a reserve fund to finance prevention and remediation tasks the amount of this reserve is left to the decision of the mining company in addition as a general requirement foreseen under law no 25 675 environmental insurance needs to be taken out by any company conducting activities that might involve a risk to the environment the new catamarca regulation provides the granting of a guarantees and financial assurances restrictions on building tailings or waste dams what are the restrictions for building tailings or waste dams the construction and operation of tailings or waste dams are mostly subject to local regulations which may vary from province to province national regulations contained in the amc establish certain general principles concerning technical conditions applicable to mining exploitation though with a low degree of detail as regards alarm systems and emergency drills the amc provides that in the event of an accident or whenever there is reason to fear that a serious accident might occur the manager of the mining project shall notify the mining authority without delay the mining authority will then decide the urgent necessary measures to be adopted to eliminate all danger or mitigate existing damage at the same time the mining company shall observe its own action plan for environmental contingencies which shall be submitted and approved as a condition precedent to obtaining the relevant environmental permit again in this respect it shall be noted that specific requirements concerning emergency drills and responsibilities related to the rescue of people may vary from province to province since national rules do not regulate such furthermore it must be noted that according to the amc the relevant mining authority shall visit once a year at least the mining projects subject to its jurisdiction and additionally when it becomes aware of an accident or of any violation of applicable regulations above this minimum each provincial mining authority has its own inspection schedule that is managed according to its own criteria of opportunity and need health safety and labour issues principal health and safety and labour laws what are the principal health and safety and labour laws applicable to the mining industry what are the principal regulatory bodies that administer those laws health and safety at work in argentina is governed by law no 19 587 and decree no 351 1979 as amended in addition the mining industry has specific rules established under decree no 249 2007 labour contract law no 20 744 is the main source for regulating employer and employees relationships in argentina this law governs the relationships of all workers independently of their nationality and place of execution of the labour agreement as long as the activities are conducted in argentina other sources of regulation are the nc and applicable international treaties the employment injuries act and the collective bargaining agreement act local and specific industry collective bargaining agreements should also be considered the enforcement authorities of these regulations are the national superintendence of work risks the national ministry of labour employment and social security and the relevant provincial authorities management and recycling of mining waste what are the rules related to management and recycling of mining waste products who has title and the right to explore and exploit mining waste products in tailings ponds and waste piles management of industrial waste products is mainly regulated by law no 24 051 of hazardous wastes to which most of the provincial jurisdictions have adhered and law no 25 612 of integrated management of industrial wastes and services activities which provides the minimum mandatory standards of environmental protection applicable to waste derived from industrial processes or from service related activities there are other relevant environmental provisions such as law no 23 922 which adopts the basel convention governing cross border movements of hazardous waste law no 25 018 which provides the minimum standards on management of radioactive waste law no 25 670 which provides the minimum standards on management of polychlorinated biphenyls law no 25 916 which provides the minimum standards on management of household waste and law no 26 011 which adopts the stockholm convention on persistent organic pollutants title holders of mining concessions have the right to exploit the wastes generated by the mining exploitation in compliance with the applicable environmental rules additionally even when the amc contains general provisions referring to the possibility of having third parties conducting mining activities over wastes products note that this is not common practice and moreover it is to be stressed that such provisions were established a century ago for more basic mining operations and may not be appropriate today for large scale mining projects use of domestic and foreign employees what restrictions and limitations are imposed on the use of domestic and foreign employees in connection with mining activities foreign workers must obtain a residence permit from the argentine national migrant authorities a temporary residence permit for migrant workers is granted for a limited period applicants of this type of permit must comply with certain conditions including being sponsored by a local company which needs to be registered with renure nationals of the southern common market eg brazilians do not need to be sponsored by local companies additionally certain provinces establish a mandatory minimum threshold of local employees to be hired by mining companies social and community issues community engagement and csr what are the principal community engagement or csr laws applicable to the mining industry what are the principal regulatory bodies that administer those laws no specific csr regulations are in force at the national level applicable to mining companies exception is made regarding those liabilities and obligations foreseen under the general environmental legal framework note that the national mining authority announced its intention to create an environmental and social responsibility fund which should be funded with private contributions of 1 per cent of mining exports payable by the mining companies no further details regarding the structure and implementation of this fund are available to date at the local level is quite common that provincial and municipal governments agree with the mining companies on a case by case basis the assumption of certain commitments aimed at compensating the affected communities as a novelty the province of santa cruz created a csr trust fund that has been subscribed to by several mining companies operating in the province rights of aboriginal indigenous or disadvantaged peoples how do the rights of aboriginal indigenous or currently or previously disadvantaged peoples affect the acquisition or exercise of mining rights pursuant to the nc the national congress has to guarantee the indigenous peoples of argentina the ownership of the lands they have been traditionally occupying and their participation in issues related to their natural resources and in other interests affecting them accordingly the recently enacted nccc establishes that indigenous communities have the right to possess and own those lands they have traditionally occupied as well as those other lands that might be adequate and sufficient for human development although this right still needs to be further regulated by a special law it is expected following ilo convention 169 ratified by argentina through law no 24 071 that the exploitation of natural resources that might have an impact on indigenous habitats would be subject to prior information and consultation of the indigenous communities concerned international law what international treaties conventions or protocols relating to csr issues are applicable in your jurisdiction in 1992 argentina ratified through law no 24 071 ilo convention 169 related to indigenous and tribal peoples 1989 and has adopted the un declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples 2007 moreover and as part of soft law international finance corporation performance standards are also guidelines that are being taken into account by exploration and mining companies currently investing in argentina anti bribery and corrupt practices local legislation describe any local legislation governing anti bribery and corrupt practices argentina is a party to the inter american convention against corruption ratified by law no 24 759 and the oecd convention on combating bribery of foreign public officials in international business transactions ratified by law no 25 319 law no 25 188 the statute on ethics in the exercise of public office was enacted in order to implement the inter american convention against corruption and the argentine criminal code as amended by laws nos 25 188 and 25 825 punishes bribery meeting the standards of the oecd convention finally and specifically law 27 401 enacted in november 2017 creates a specific regime for anti corruption and bribery for more details see question 6 foreign legislation do companies in your country pay particular attention to any foreign legislation governing anti bribery and foreign corrupt practices in your jurisdiction given the extraterritorial reach of anti bribery and foreign corrupt practices regulations and the fact that most mining companies conducting mining activities in argentina are controlled by entities headquartered overseas market participants principally major mining companies have started paying attention to these regulations disclosure of payments by resource companies has your jurisdiction enacted legislation or adopted international best practices regarding disclosure of payments by resource companies to government entities in accordance with the extractive industries transparency initiative eiti standard on 6 december 2017 the ministry of energy and mines announced a formal request to join the eiti argentina is currently in a preliminary stage towards the implementation of the eiti standard for the global standard to be applied in the country argentina will need to pass legislation internalising the eiti prior to becoming an implementing country argentina must complete a few sign up steps related to the commitment of the government companies and civil society engagement the establishment of a multi stakeholder group and agreement on an eiti work plan foreign investment foreign ownership restrictions are there any foreign ownership restrictions in your jurisdiction relevant to the mining industry there is no restriction on foreign ownership of mining rights the foreign investments law no 21 382 establishes that foreign investors that invest in economic activities in argentina shall have the same rights and obligations that the nc and other laws award to local investors nevertheless as previously stated foreign companies need to register in argentina as a local vehicle to own mining rights in addition decree law no 15 385 1944 as amended establishes that the acquisition rental or lease of real estate properties located within a security zone mainly borderlands by foreign companies requires prior government approval although there is a special exemption for mining permits and concessions this exemption does not comprise the surface land over which the mining rights are located rural lands law no 26 737 as regulated by decree no 274 2012 also establishes certain limits to the acquisition or possession of rural lands by foreign investors international treaties applicable international treaties what international treaties apply to the mining industry or an investment in the mining industry argentina has signed more than 50 bilateral investment treaties that are applicable to the mining industry specifically in 1997 argentina and chile signed a mining integration and complementation treaty the purpose of the treaty is to allow investors of each country to participate in the mining integration development of the mining projects located in the designated area of the international border through a number of benefits such as easy border crossing and a

at a time when the appeal of and demands for a new democratic socialism seem to have caught the imagination of many among the young and are reflected in the promises of a good number of political candidates running for high office there is one already existing socialist institution in america with few opponents the federal reserve system the fact is central banking is a form of central planning the federal reserve has a legal monopoly over the monetary system of the united states it plans the quantity of money in circulation and its availability for lending purposes and it sets a target for the annual rate of price inflation currently around 2 percent while also intentionally influencing interest rates affecting investment spending and supporting full employment almost all discussions and debates concerning the federal reserve revolve around how it should undertake its monetary central planning which policy tools should be used what target goals should be aimed for and who should be in charge of directing america s central bank federal reserve independence in the trump era a complementary issue that has received renewed attention concerns the question of how much independence the federal reserve and other central banks should have to determine and implement monetary and interest rate policy this has recently come to the fore due to comments made by president donald trump concerning federal reserve interest rate policy and the individuals he has recently proposed for positions on the federal reserve board of governors several times over the last year president trump has expressed irritation and frustration with increases in market rates of interest under the federal reserve board leadership of jerome powell who trump nominated for fed chairman and who has held that position since february 2018 trump has publicly pouted and whined that while barack obama was president he had a central bank that gave him rock bottom low interest rates fed chairman powell on the other hand has raised interest rates several times over the last year preventing america from being as great as trump thinks it can be because of the higher costs of borrowing for both the private sector and the federal government being informed that he really cannot just fire chairman powell because he doesn t like federal reserve policies trump wants to get around the powell problem by nominating for open positions on the fed board those he thinks will more likely direct federal reserve policies in the way he wants thus he has put up as names for senate approval those of stephen moore a policy analyst at the heritage foundation and a former trump campaign advisor and herman cain the former ceo of godfather s pizza a previous chairman of the kansas city branch of the federal reserve and a past republican presidential hopeful himself trump critics on the left on the right and at the economist trump has been attacked from both the left and the right for seeming to want to pack the federal reserve board of governors with political types reflecting trump s desire for looser monetary policy and lower interest rates some on the political left oppose his nominees simply because well they are trump s choices along with the additional criticisms that neither are ph d economists nor known and respected experts on monetary policy others more to the political right don t want them on the board because they would prefer a more hawkish fed policy the the magazine admits that central bankers have not always gotten it right even the most well intentioned central planner is only human let s not forget but in their wise hands the world has been saved from destabilizing price inflations and short run policy manipulations that might have been harmful to full employment and steady growth the austrian critique of central planning vs markets others more to the political right don t want them on the board because they would prefer a more hawkish fed policy desmond lachman a resident scholar at the conservative american enterprise institute thinks the federal reserve should raise interest rates so the central bank will have the room for future successful monetary stimulus policies when the next economy wide downturn comes along in other words he just wants monetary central planning in a different direction than president trump the economist magazine had as its cover topic for the april 13 2019 issue the threat to central bank independence from trump and others like him in charge of governments around the world what is needed and has to be preserved the economist argues are professional monetary planning technocrats who rise above and are free from interference by politicians so those at the central banking helm can focus on long run price level stability and non ideological banking and interest rate policies the magazine admits that central bankers have not always gotten it right even the most well intentioned central planner is only human let s not forget but in their wise hands the world has been saved from destabilizing price inflations and short run policy manipulations that might have been harmful to full employment and steady growth rarely heard or suggested in all these commentaries on the federal reserve is whether the united states needs or should have a central bank i would like to suggest that the answer is no and for many of the same reasons that can be made against socialist central planning in general it will be 100 years in 2020 since the austrian economist ludwig von mises first published his famous critique of socialist central planning in his article it will be 100 years in 2020 since the austrian economist ludwig von mises first published his famous critique of socialist central planning in his article economic calculation in the socialist commonwealth 1920 and then extended the challenge to all facets of collectivism in his 1922 book socialism an economic and sociological analysis the gist of his argument was that a centrally planned economy did away with the essential institutions necessary for rational economic calculation private property in the means of production market competition and a functioning price system in a complex and ever changing social system of division of labor all the multitudes of participants are interdependent for all the things needed for everyday life it is necessary to have some means of knowing what it is that people want to buy in their role as consumers and the value they place on those things and it is also essential to know what resources are available out of which desired consumer goods might be produced and what their values might be in the alternative uses for which they could be applied in other words do consumers desire hats or shoes or bananas or breakfast cereal or classical music or serious books on economics or anything else and what are the relative values they may place on possibly purchasing them at the same time what are the available types and quantities of labor land resources and raw materials and capital goods machinery tools equipment that may be used in various combinations to produce those consumer items and what might be their appraised values in being employed in different and competing lines of production market prices and economic calculation the market solves that problem mises explained through the emergence of a competitive price system for both finished goods and the factors of production with exchangeable private property there are opportunities to buy and sell with the ability to buy and sell people have motives and incentives to make bids and offers to each other out of those bids and offers may arise agreed upon terms of trade and those agreed upon terms of trade create the complex structure of relative prices for both those finished goods and the factors of production in a complex market system there also historically emerged a medium of exchange to overcome the hurdles of direct barter transactions to better facilitate the buying and selling of virtually everything as the most widely used and generally accepted medium of exchange the commodity that becomes the money good comes to be on one side of every exchange people trade their goods for money and then trade away that money for other goods they desire to buy almost every good and service on the market therefore comes to have a money price that then enables an ease of economic calculation through which all the physically heterogeneous goods offered on the market may be expressed in a single valuational common denominator the money prices for everything thus all traders on the market can readily do their comparison shopping what would this bundle of consumer items cost me to buy and what are the relative costs if i substitute one good for another to buy instead if i buy one hat for 10 then i have to forgo the equivalent of two pairs of gloves that cost 5 a piece the same applies on the supply side of market production decisions the entrepreneur can try to make an informed judgment concerning what a consumer good sells for in the present and might possibly sell for in the future if he were to bring some quantity of it to market likewise he can determine what it would cost to rent hire or purchase alternative combinations of inputs labor land capital to manufacture some such consumer item on the basis of which he can decide whether he thinks that doing so would be a profit making or a loss making endeavor and if seeming to be profitable which combination of those inputs would minimize his costs of production to potentially maximize the anticipated and hoped for profits central planning leads to planned chaos a system of socialist central planning does away with all of this with government nationalization of the means of production there is nothing to legally buy and sell on the production side of the economy with nothing to buy and sell there are obviously no bids or offers for the factors of production with no bids and offers for labor land resources and capital there are no market based prices for appraising profitable from unprofitable lines of production and deciding which alternative ways of making finished goods would minimize the costs of production it is not surprising that a bit more than a quarter of a century after mises first offered his criticisms of socialist central planning he titled a short monograph on the same theme planned chaos 1947 without market based and competitively generated prices to assist the ongoing process of rational economic calculation in a changing world the central planners would be flying blind in trying to decide what to produce and how to produce it to get the most out of the scarce factors of production in value terms in supplying the goods and services consumers actually might want to buy and what they would have been willing to pay for them see my article it is not surprising that a bit more than a quarter of a century after mises first offered his criticisms of socialist central planning he titled a short monograph on the same theme planned chaos 1947 without market based and competitively generated prices to assist the ongoing process of rational economic calculation in a changing world the central planners would be flying blind in trying to decide what to produce and how to produce it to get the most out of the scarce factors of production in value terms in supplying the goods and services consumers actually might want to buy and what they would have been willing to pay for them see my article why socialism is impossible most economists around today would find the gist of this argument fairly obvious if asked to agree with it or not even if many mainstream economists would no doubt insist that there were problems of monopoly and undersupplied public goods and assert the need for various redistributive welfare programs outside of the arena of market exchange due to income inequalities but the notion that market based competitive prices enable effective and cost efficient economic calculation for much that goes on in a complex society would be accepted in this general formulation without too much disagreement central banking denies freedom of choice in money on this basis i would argue that monetary central planning in the form of central banking creates many of the same problems for economic calculation and effective and efficient use of resources as traditional socialist economic planning first of all what commodity or commodities should be used as a medium or media of exchange under our current monetary system anyone who attempts to offer and market alternative monies for use in domestic transactions is subject to legal penalty including arrest and imprisonment for instance back in the late 1990s bernard von nothaus decided to mint and market an alternative for business and related transactions in 2009 mr nothous was arrested for circulating millions of his gold coins called liberty dollars in over 80 cities on counterfeiting charges and for undertaking a conspiracy against the u s government s monetary monopoly he was found guilty in 2011 and in 2014 he was given six months house arrest and three years probation in 2018 mr nothous was back this time saying that he was starting up a private voluntary currency for business and related transactions in 2009 mr nothous was arrested for circulating millions of his gold coins called liberty dollars in over 80 cities on counterfeiting charges and for undertaking a conspiracy against the u s government s monetary monopoly he was found guilty in 2011 and in 2014 he was given six months house arrest and three years probation in 2018 mr nothous was back this time saying that he was starting up a cryptocurrency that was to be 100 percent backed by silver how the government responds this time to his attempt to undermine america s socialist monetary system remains to be seen but the fact is how can any government and even the wisest and most ph d ed of their federal reserve experts know what people in the marketplace would find attractive advantageous and profitable to use as a medium of exchange in market transactions or whether there might not be a demand for different types of money for different forms of market activities the answer is that there is no way of fully knowing this other than allowing private enterprisers and entrepreneurs in the financial and other everyday markets to competitively discover and offer what we the buying and selling public might want for this purpose it is now more than 40 years since austrian economist f a hayek published his 1976 in which he called for the simple monetary reform of ending legal tender laws and allowing people to choose and use in domestic and foreign transactions any medium of exchange they desire he considered this a necessary freedom to break the history of abuse under government monopoly money and to allow people to use whatever money they want choice in currency 1976 in which he called for the simple monetary reform of ending legal tender laws and allowing people to choose and use in domestic and foreign transactions any medium of exchange they desire he considered this a necessary freedom to break the history of abuse under government monopoly money and to allow people to use whatever money they want only markets can discover the optimal amount of money second how can the monetary central planners know how much money should be in circulation and in the banking system this is no more possible than the old soviet central planners knowing how much toilet paper to produce or the quantities and varieties of any other everyday household necessity what the soviet planners produced invariably turned out to be in the wrong amounts and of the wrong types a visit to a people s lingerie store and i use this term very loosely in moscow before the collapse of the soviet union found one size fits all in women s underpants any needed adjustment of the waistband well comrade that is what safety pins are for no unnecessary quantities or wasteful duplication under bright and beautiful socialist planning the central planners were no doubt soviet socialism s best and brightest and with ph d s under a commodity money such as gold in a fully free enterprise system the amount of money in the market is a reflection of supply and demand people have uses for gold for either commercial or monetary purposes gold has its price in the marketplace based on this those on the supply side could estimate the profitability of prospecting mining minting and marketing greater quantities of produced gold for sale for monetary and other commercial uses an increased demand for gold as money sees a shift of the commodity from commercial uses to monetary ones and with the resulting rise in the value of gold in general a greater profitability from gold prospecting mining and minting as the supply increases the rise in the market value of gold is tempered with the increasing supply tending to satisfy the greater demand yes there have been noticeable gold based fluctuations due to newly discovered gold sources in various parts of the world but in general these incidents have been few and far between with gold annually being extracted from known pockets based on current and trend demand the crucial element in this is that the optimal quantity of money is the interactive outcome of the market participants themselves the gold market provides the price system that reflects the demand for gold in its various uses of which money is one and the related markets for the needed means of production to mine mint and supply gold provide the cost prices that facilitate the rational economic calculations for an ever adapting and ever adjusting optimal market guided quantity of money see my article government gold and separating money from the state the central bankers determine how much money today we are dependent on the decisions of a handful of central planning executives on the board of governors of the federal reserve what is their guide the personal judgments of what they think the economy needs based upon the prevailing macroeconomic theories used in the central bank about how the economy works and therefore how much money should be pumped into the banking system our monetary fate is dependent upon whether the central bank experts this year are old style keynesians new keynesians monetarists new classical economists taylor rule followers supply siders new modern monetary theorists or any number of other possibilities in the old soviet union it all depended upon whether stalinists or trotskyites were to be in charge for the central planning of scientific research genetics was or was not considered compatible with marxism leninism as interpreted by the leadership of the party just as it is said that central banking needs to be independent so the objective and scientific monetary experts can guide the economy based on the latest and correct macroeconomic models it was insisted under soviet and all other socialisms in practice that it was all objective and scientific being based on marxian dialectical materialism given what that meant in any particular situation it s all a politics and ideology of planning a few say they know what is right for the many and will use government to give it to them the false target of 2 percent price inflation also important to keep in mind is that there is no optimal rate of price inflation to begin with any benchmark meant to determine whether prices in general are rising or falling is based upon some statistical averaging of selected and weighted individual prices tracked through time to determine whether or not a constructed and imaginary basket of goods has become more expensive or less expensive and if so by what percentage amount from an earlier point in time changes in the cost of living affect each of us differently based on the reality of what we as individuals and separate households choose to buy and in what relative amounts also our individual baskets are not invariant points of comparison even for ourselves since changes in our tastes and preferences in the relative prices among the goods we buy and in the market s offering of new and better quality goods on a frequent basis all bring about changes in what goods are in our respective baskets and their relative quantities such statistical creations as the consumer price index are at most very rough and ready general pieces of information for the consumer or citizen concerning what the central bank may be doing to the overall value of the money we use the fact is its importance is not for you or me but as one of the signals used by the central bankers to decide the rate of monetary expansion and for influencing interest rates see my articles it s all based on a macroeconomic conception that in general a falling price level is bad and that growth and employment are stimulated by modestly rising prices it has fallen mostly though not exclusively to the austrian school over the last 100 years to demonstrate that falling prices due to greater outputs and supply side cost efficiencies are not only not harmful to the wealth and health of modern society but are an indication of increasing prosperity and rising real standards of living see my article likewise whether it is the attempt to maintain a relatively stable general level of prices as partly guided federal reserve policy in the 1920s or the contemporary central bank target of 2 percent price inflation the primary institutional tool at the federal reserve s disposal is to buy u s government securities and now a variety of other market assets including mortgaged backed securities during the financial crisis of 2008 9 and after and to increase loanable reserves in the banking system see my article this becomes the means for influencing interest rates for investment and all other types of borrowing to try to stimulate spending and employment in the economy as a whole even the fed s latest policy trick since the financial crisis to pay banks not to lend the very trillions of dollars of excess reserves the central bank pumped into the banking system is a way for the federal reserve to try to influence interest rates and aggregate spending in the economy the fact is interest rates should be left free and competitive to do their job as the network of intertemporal prices connecting and coordinating the savings decisions of lenders with the investment choices of borrowers in other words interest rates are the prices that are supposed to bring markets and the use of the factors of production into balance with each other across time instead by viewing and using interest rates as a policy tool to be manipulated the federal reserve s monetary central planners only succeed in distorting and preventing interest rates from telling the truth how much savings is in the economy to sustain and maintain a structure of gross and net investments with varying time horizons see my article just as soviet central planners may have believed that they could coordinate it all for better and more successful outcomes than market economies our central bankers never fail in their enthusiasm and arrogant confidence that this time they will get it right that they now have the right macroeconomic model of how it all works they finally have bigger and better statistical data and computer capacity to successfully read and measure the entrails of the economic goose see my articles changes in the cost of living affect each of us differently based on

buenos aires argentina tomás ruiz embraced his father one last time at the buenos aires airport before he boarded a plane in search of a new life in ireland his sister recently did the same when she moved to spain like many other young argentines the siblings hold european passports by descent and they are returning to the home countries of their grandparents far from argentina s sizzling inflation high unemployment and sharp currency depreciation my country s situation prompted me to take this decision ruiz said as he finished packing his bags for his trip to dublin surrounded by photos of his family and friends on the wall it was a constant frustration to live constantly on the edge barely making it to the end of the month ruiz studied gastronomy and was employed as a cafe manager in argentina s capital but even when he worked extra shifts he couldn t manage to save money and for months he had been living with his mother to save on rent outside his room family members left him and his sister farewell messages on a chalkboard i love you and i ll miss you his mother wrote others said the best is yet to come and carpe diem latin for seize the day it s not the first time argentines have sought shelter in europe in times of economic uncertainty hundreds of thousands emigrated to the old continent to escape hyperinflation in the early 1990s and an economic meltdown in 2001 and 2002 now argentines are losing purchasing power to a nearly 50 annual inflation rate one of the world s worst many have also protests president mauricio macri s decision to cut subsidies leading to a spike in the costs of utilities and public transportation last year the argentine peso lost more than half its value to the u s dollar following a run on the local currency causing the government to seek a record 56 billion bailout loan with the international monetary fund to try to come out of the recession as a result of the economic crisis and the devaluation more young professionals are thinking about a future in europe said alejandro servide director of professionals and recruitment process outsourcing at argentina s branch of randstad the world s second largest staffing company as part of the austerity measures aimed at balancing the budget macri s administration has laid off thousands of government workers and slashed funding for dance science and other programs hundreds recently protested outside the headquarters of the national scientific and technical research council argentina s main agency for science and technology the science sector is suffering because these budget cuts ordered by macri endanger the continuity of scientific activity said alberto kornblihtt a molecular biologist this is undoubtedly contributing to a brain drain that we ve suffered at other times of crisis in our country there are no official statistics available on how many argentines have moved to europe argentina s immigration directorate said it is nearly impossible to keep track of the number because argentines leaving the country don t have to provide information on their destination or how long they ll stay but academics research groups and consulting firms agree there has been a rise in the number of people leaving especially among young educated argentines just as there was during the nation s worst crisis 17 years ago back then millions were plunged into poverty more than 20 percent of the population became unemployed and many reportedly went hungry in a country that is one world s biggest producers of beef soy and wheat when argentina goes through these profound crises people search for options and just like it happened in 2001 2002 when nearly 800 000 argentines went abroad today we re living through perhaps the initial phase said ariel gonzalez executive secretary of the center for international studies at the catholic university of argentina that means that there s a sector of society the middle and high class professionals who are eyeing a plan b which is that if the crisis deepens one of the options would be to go abroad servide said randstad argentina carries out about 160 daily interviews for surveys one of the questions they ask is whether if given the chance they would be interested in living abroad about 80 percent tell you yes he said manuel miglioranza a 26 year old lawyer is moving next month to toulouse france although he doesn t have dual argentine french nationality he s going to take french lessons and find a job through a temporary work permit allowed through a treaty between the two nations the economic situation in argentina is not helping you can t progress unless you work for the state or you have dollars he said i know many people who are leaving millions of europeans flooded into argentina in the 19th century to escape war and poverty back home which has been a source of pride for the country argentina gave peace to those who were escaping war freedom to those escaping religious persecution and bread and work to those escaping hunger said horacio garcia director of argentina s national migration directorate of the last six presidents four of them were first generation sons of immigrants garcia noted their fathers came to argentina with a cardboard suitcase and they saw that their children in a short amount of time became presidents of the nation that hardly happens anywhere else in the world by the 20th century a strong workforce along with export earnings from agricultural products and beef had helped turn argentina into one of the

urbanization the largest middle class as well as the best newspapers universities and publishing houses but political mismanagement and lower prices for agricultural products that form the country s economic backbone have for decades led to cyclical booms and busts the spanish government recently launched an initiative that allows a limited number of descendants of spaniards living in argentina without a spanish passport to seek a special three month work visa once they find a job they can request spanish nationality and bring their families there were 76 328 argentines officially registered

below are calculated on a constant currency basis a non gaap financial measure defined at the end of this release and reconciled to the most comparable gaap measures in the financial statements in this release the average mexican peso to u s dollar exchange rate for the three month period ended march 31 2019 was 19 2 pesos dollar an unfavorable change of 2 versus the comparable prior year period latin america operations revenues for the first quarter of 2019 totaled a record 150 million an increase of 22 on a u s dollar basis and 25 on a constant currency basis as compared to the first quarter of 2018 core pawn revenues which are composed of pawn fees and retail merchandise sales increased 20 for the quarter on a u s dollar basis driven by a 29 increase in pawn fees and a 16 increase in retail sales compared to the prior year quarter on a constant currency basis core pawn revenues for the quarter increased 23 with pawn fees and retail merchandise sales increasing 32 and 19 respectively as compared to the prior year quarter segment pre tax operating income for the quarter increased 19 or 21 on a constant currency basis compared to the first quarter of 2018 driven by increased store additions and increased same store revenues pre tax segment margin for the first quarter of 2019 was 22 and consistent with the prior year despite the impacts of the significant acquisition activity last year and in the first quarter of 2019 the earnings drag from the increased pace of new store openings in 2019 and the discontinuance of non core unsecured consumer lending products in mexico in june of 2018 pawn loans outstanding totaled a record 112 million at march 31 2019 an increase of 30 on a u s dollar translated basis and 38 on a constant currency basis versus the prior year same store pawn loans at quarter end increased 3 on a u s dollar translated basis while they increased 9 on a constant currency basis compared to the same prior year quarter despite a 2 decline in the value of the mexican peso compared to the prior year quarter same store core pawn revenues increased 1 on a u s dollar translated basis consisting of a 5 increase in same store pawn fees and flat same store retail sales compared to the prior year quarter on a constant currency basis same store core pawn revenues increased 4 composed of an 8 increase in same store pawn fees and a 3 increase in same store retail sales compared to the prior year quarter segment retail margins increased to 37 in the first quarter compared to 36 in the prior year quarter driven primarily by focused efforts on merchandise valuation and lending practices inventories at march 31 2019 increased 16 million to 83 million compared to 67 million a year ago the increase was driven by the net addition of 425 pawn stores over the past twelve months and continued maturation of existing stores as of march 31 2019 inventories aged greater than one year remained extremely low at 1 and inventory turns in latin america for the trailing twelve months ended march 31 2019 remained strong at 3 8 times total store operating expenses increased 27 for the quarter or 30 on a constant currency basis due primarily to store additions same store operating expenses increased only 2 in the first quarter of 2019 or 4 on a constant currency basis u s operations segment pre tax operating income for the quarter increased 5 compared to the first quarter of 2018 driven primarily by increased pawn fees retail margins and continued store level expense reductions the increase in the segment contribution was partially offset by an expected reduction in non core consumer lending operating profits segment pre tax operating margin improved to 21 for the first quarter of 2019 as compared to 20 in the prior year quarter primarily due to improved retail margins pawn loan fees and operating efficiencies total revenues for the first quarter were 318 million a decrease of 3 compared to the first quarter of 2018 and included the expected impact of a 30 decline or 5 million in non core consumer loan and credit services fees and a 23 decline or 7 million in non core scrap jewelry sales core revenues from pawn fees and retail sales increased by 1 net revenue or gross profit for the first quarter of 2019 increased 1 despite the declines in non core revenues more importantly net revenue from core pawn operations increased 3 compared to the prior year quarter as a result of the continued improvements in retail sales margins and pawn yields as highlighted below retail sales margin increased to 37 for the quarter compared to 35 in the prior year quarter the increase in margins has been driven primarily by optimizing loan to value ratios and reduced aged inventory levels in the legacy cash america stores despite continued growth of online retailing in general the company s retail sales which are all store generated were flat compared to the first quarter of 2018 and same store retail sales declined only 1 compared to the prior year quarter pawn fees increased 2 and same store pawn fee revenues increased 1 in the first quarter compared to the prior year quarter as pawn yields improved by 3 quarter over quarter pawn loans outstanding at march 31 2019 totaled 234 million a decrease of 1 in total and 3 on a same store basis the decrease was partially due to the continued focus on increasing the volume of direct purchases of goods from customers in the legacy cash america stores which resulted in a 21 increase in the percentage of such direct purchase transactions for the quarter as compared to the prior year quarter inventories at march 31 2019 declined 12 million or 7 to 175 million compared to 188 million a year ago primarily from strategic reductions in overall inventory levels as of march 31 2019 u s inventories aged greater than one year were 4 which was an improvement over the 5 aged level in the prior year comparable quarter inventory turns in the u s for the trailing twelve month period were 2 7 times which represents the sixth sequential quarterly increase and compares to 2 5 times for the twelve month period ended march 31 2018 inventory turns in the u s are slower than in latin america due to the larger jewelry component in the u s compared to a greater general merchandise inventory component in latin america total store operating expenses for the quarter were flat while on a same store basis they declined 1 in the first quarter of 2019 primarily due to continued efforts to realize purchasing synergies and optimize labor efficiencies consumer lending contraction and asset impairments as expected u s consumer lending revenues declined 5 million in the first quarter or 30 compared to the same quarter a year ago as the company continues to de emphasize consumer lending operations in light of increasing regulatory constraints and internet based competition with plans for further contraction in the future as previously disclosed the provisions of the ohio fairness in lending act the ohio act passed in 2018 are to become effective on april 26 2019 and are expected to significantly impact the consumer loan industry in ohio once the ohio act becomes effective the company will continue to look for opportunities to service customers seeking loans any services offered will likely result in reduced revenues in the ohio locations compared to the prior year while most of the company s ohio stores also offer pawn products the decrease or elimination of consumer lending revenue or other customer services could cause one third or more of its ohio stores to become unprofitable or inoperable further discussion of the projected results is provided in the 2019 outlook section of this release cash dividend and stock repurchases the board of directors declared a 0 25 per share second quarter cash dividend on common shares outstanding which will be paid on may 31 2019 to stockholders of record as of may 15 2019 any future dividends are subject to approval by the company s board of directors during the first quarter the company repurchased 343 000 shares at an aggregate cost of 29 million and an average per share cost of 85 17 leaving 114 million available for future repurchases under the current share repurchase programs future share repurchases are subject to expected liquidity debt covenant restrictions and other relevant factors since the merger with cash america in september 2016 and through the first quarter of 2019 the company has repurchased a total of 5 3 million shares at an average repurchase price of 74 83 per share resulting in an 11 reduction from the number of shares outstanding immediately following the merger liquidity and return metrics the company generated 224 million of cash flow from operations and 186 million in adjusted free cash flow during the twelve months ended march 31 2019 compared to 248 million of cash flow from operations and 259 million of adjusted free cash flow during the same prior year period current period free cash flow includes the impact of accelerated store expansion activities while the prior year comparative amount included a 21 million cash inflow from a non recurring tax refund related to the merger and larger than normal cash inflows related to the liquidation of excess inventories in the legacy cash america stores the company continues to maintain excellent liquidity ratios while funding share repurchases totaling 198 million dividends of 41 million and acquisitions of 133 million during the trailing twelve months ended march 31 2019 the net debt ratio which is calculated using a non gaap financial measure for the trailing twelve months ended march 31 2019 was 1 8 to 1 on january 1 2019 the financial accounting standards board s new lease accounting standard asc 842 became effective requiring lessees to recognize a liability for the present value of future minimum lease payments the lease liability and an asset representing its right to use the underlying leased property for the lease term the right of use asset the adoption of asc 842 resulted in a 298 million right of use asset an 85 million current lease liability and a 189 million non current lease liability as of march 31 2019 the adoption did not have a material impact to the consolidated statements of income consolidated statements of cash flows or any of the company s financial debt covenants return on assets for the trailing twelve months ended march 31 2019 was 7 3 while return on tangible assets was 14 4 for the same period which compared to 7 4 and 13 5 returns respectively for the comparable prior year period the return on assets for the trailing twelve months ended march 31 2019 was negatively impacted by the first time inclusion of the right of use asset arising from the implementation of asc 842 which was not included on the balance sheet prior to january 1 2019 return on tangible assets is a non gaap financial measure and is calculated by excluding goodwill intangible assets net and the right of use asset from the respective return calculations return on equity was 11 5 for the trailing twelve months ended march 31 2019 while return on tangible equity was 43 1 this compares positively against returns of 10 4 and 28 5 respectively for the comparable prior year period return on tangible equity is a non gaap financial measure and is calculated by excluding goodwill and intangible assets net from the respective return calculations 2019 outlook the company is raising its full year 2019 guidance for diluted earnings per share to be in a range of 3 80 to 4 00 compared to the previous guidance of 3 75 to 3 95 the revised guidance range represents an increase of 8 to 13 over the prior year adjusted earnings per share of 3 53 as described below the guidance for 2019 includes the impact of an expected net reduction in earnings from u s unsecured consumer lending operations of approximately 0 25 to 0 30 per share a forecast foreign currency drag of approximately 0 08 to 0 10 per share and a 0 04 to 0 07 per share impact from a higher blended effective income tax rate excluding these impacts at their midpoint estimates estimated earnings per share in 2019 would increase in a range of 20 to 25 compared to 2018 the estimate of expected earnings per share for 2019 includes the following assumptions an anticipated earnings drag of approximately 0 25 to 0 30 per share during 2019 primarily due to the impact of the ohio act and further strategic reductions in consumer lending operations outside of ohio the company is currently modeling total consumer lending revenues for 2019 to be in a range of 25 million to 31 million which represents a 45 to 56 reduction compared to 2018 consumer lending revenues consumer lending operations are expected to contribute less than 2 of total revenue in 2019 given recent currency volatility and the potential for further volatility the company continues to use an estimated average foreign currency exchange rate of 20 0 mexican pesos u s dollar for the remainder of 2019 compared to the average exchange rate of 19 2 mexican pesos u s dollar for 2018 the projected change in the exchange rate represents an earnings headwind of approximately 0 08 to 0 10 per share for 2019 when compared to 2018 results each full mexican peso change in the exchange rate to the u s dollar represents approximately 0 10 to 0 12 per share of annualized earnings impact an expected blended effective income tax rate of between 26 5 and 27 5 for 2019 this represents an increase over the 2018 effective rate of 26 1 adjusted for the 1 5 million non recurring tax benefit as a result of the tax act due in part to the increasing share of earnings from latin america where corporate tax rates are higher and an increase in certain non deductible expenses resulting from the tax cuts and jobs act which combined represents an additional earnings headwind of approximately 0 04 to 0 07 per share as compared to 2018 results plans to open approximately 80 to 85 new full service pawn stores in 2019 in latin america which includes targeted openings of 55 to 60 stores in mexico and approximately 15 stores in guatemala and 10 stores in colombia the company is on target to open at least 30 full service pawn stores during the second quarter the increased number of projected store openings in 2019 combined with the first half frontloading of new store openings will cause an expected additional drag to earnings of approximately 0 02 to 0 03 per share compared to last year the company expects to complete additional acquisitions in 2019 primarily in latin america which are not reflected in the guidance the company expects to continue repurchasing shares in 2019 with a targeted shareholder payout ratio which includes share repurchases and dividends of approximately 100 of net income additional commentary and analysis mr wessel further commented we are very pleased with the first quarter results highlighted by strong revenue and earnings growth in latin america pawn receivables a leading indicator of future revenue growth increased an impressive 30 on a u s dollar basis and 38 on a local currency basis due to the store growth and strong same store increases on a same store basis pawn receivables grew 3 in u s dollars and 9 in local currency representing a rapid rebound from slower growth rates experienced in the middle of 2018 due primarily to what we believe were macro factors related to the 2018 election cycle in mexico we now operate over 1 500 stores in four countries in latin america having grown the latin america pawn store base by 38 over the past twelve months through a combination of acquisitions and new store openings in three countries we believe there is meaningful long term revenue and earnings upside in both the new and acquired stores all of the stores acquired to date have been fully migrated onto the firstpawn it platform while most of the prendamex stores acquired over the past year are smaller footprint locations we believe over time these stores have the opportunity to increase retail sales and margins through our superior point of sale system and other retail strategies additionally as we look at the entire latin american marketplace we are optimistic about the potential for additional acquisitions we are also excited about the increased pace of de novo or new store openings this year in latin america last year we opened 52 stores over the entire year our first quarter openings this year totaled 36 locations alone and with 30 stores expected to open in the second quarter we believe we are on track to open 80 to 85 locations for the full year our strategy is to front load the store openings this year to get them established before the fourth quarter holiday season and minimize distractions to our existing operations during our busiest season of the year as expected our u s operating results continue to improve as well highlighted by growth in segment earnings despite expected declines in non core consumer lending earnings this marks the second sequential quarter we have posted an increase in same store pawn fees the increase in pawn fees is driven primarily by improving the quality of our pawn receivable portfolio and optimizing loan to value ratios which has resulted in higher cash yields from the performing loans our focus on retail margins is also paying off with 37 retail margins during the quarter versus 35 in the same prior year period additionally we continue to see opportunities to drive store level operating efficiencies with same store operating expenses declining versus the same quarter a year ago we believe that there are also additional opportunities to further expand u s operations as evidenced by the announced acquisitions of 10 stores in texas in the first quarter and an additional 10 stores in texas in april although the u s remains an extremely fragmented market we are focused on identifying strategic opportunities for tuck in locations within our existing footprint especially in states with favorable customer demographics and growing populations cash flows remain strong as evidenced by a 40 million reduction in outstanding debt during the quarter even after our investment of 55 million in acquisitions capital expenditures and store real estate and returning 40 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the trailing twelve months these numbers are even more impressive with 212 million in store investments and the return of 240 million to shareholders which yields a 151 percent payout ratio with these outstanding first quarter results we are off to a great start in 2019 we have raised our full year earnings guidance despite additional short term earnings drags from the front loading of our de novo store openings and additional administrative expenses in latin america due to the significant acquisition activity over the past twelve months we believe that we will begin to see even greater profitability growth in the latter part of the year as the de novo stores ramp revenues and we realize cost synergy opportunities in latin america in summary we remain extremely optimistic about continued revenue growth store expansion in multiple markets and further opportunities to improve margins coupled with our strong cash flows and commitment to shareholder returns we believe that we are driving

not consider to be representative of its actual operating performance these financial calculations are non gaap financial measures as defined in sec rules the company uses these non gaap financial measures in operating its business because management believes they are less susceptible to variances in actual operating performance that can result from the excluded items other infrequent charges and currency fluctuations the company presents these financial measures to investors because management believes they are useful to investors in evaluating the primary factors that drive the company s operating performance and because management believes they provide greater transparency into the company s results of operations however items that are excluded and other adjustments and assumptions that are made in calculating these non gaap financial measures are significant components in understanding and assessing the company s financial performance these non gaap financial measures should be evaluated in conjunction with and are not a substitute for the company s gaap financial measures further because these non gaap financial measures are not determined in accordance with gaap and are thus susceptible to varying calculations the non gaap financial measures as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies the company has adjusted the applicable financial measures to exclude merger and other acquisition expenses because it generally would not incur such costs and expenses as part of its continuing operations merger and other acquisition expenses include incremental costs directly associated with merger and acquisition activities including professional fees legal expenses severance retention and other employee related costs contract breakage costs and costs related to the consolidation of technology systems and corporate facilities among others the company has certain leases in mexico which are denominated in u s

recognition of foreign currency exchange gains or losses the company has adjusted the applicable financial measures to exclude these remeasurement gains or losses because they are non cash non

management considers the store real property purchases to be discretionary in nature and not required to operate or grow its pawn operations to further enhance transparency of these distinct items the company now reports purchases of store real property and purchases of furniture fixtures equipment and improvements separately on the consolidated statements of cash flows as a result the current definitions of free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow differ from prior period definitions as they now exclude discretionary purchases of store real property and the company has retrospectively

measures the company has utilized non gaap financial measures in this release which are provided to assist readers understanding of the company s results of operations these amounts exclude certain items that at times materially impact the comparability of the company s results of operations the adjusted information is intended to be indicative of the company s primary operations and to assist readers in evaluating performance and analyzing trends across periods these results should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for results reported in accordance with gaap the non gaap financial measures include comparisons related to profit they exclude gains from the sale of property plant and equipment and insurance settlements related to casualty losses other income in connection with real estate related operations inventory obsolescence and operating losses in conjunction with decisions to exit wind down or significantly restructure businesses along with asset sales related to exited or restructured businesses certain asset retirement obligations re engineering including the exit of businesses and fixed asset impairment charges pension settlements and significant discrete impacts of new tax laws upon adoption while the company is engaged in a multi year program to sell land adjacent to its orlando florida headquarters and also disposes of other excess land and facilities periodically these activities are not part of its primary business operations additionally amounts recognized in any given period are not indicative of amounts that may be recognized in any particular future period for this reason these amounts are excluded as indicated the company excludes significant charges related to casualty losses caused by significant weather events fires or similar circumstances it also excludes any related gains resulting from the settlement of associated insurance claims while these types of events can and do recur periodically they are excluded from indicated financial information due to their distinction from ongoing business operations inherent volatility and impact on the comparability of earnings across periods the company periodically records exit costs accounted for using the applicable accounting guidance for exit or disposal cost obligations and other amounts related to rationalizing its supply chain operations and other re engineering activities including the exit of businesses and upon liquidation of operations in a country the recognition in income of amounts previously recorded in equity as a cumulative translation adjustment also the company excludes the impact of changes in tax laws on cumulative deferred taxes from items previously recorded as cumulative translation adjustments the company believes these amounts are similarly volatile and impact the comparability of earnings across periods therefore they are also excluded from indicated financial information to provide what the company believes represents a useful measure for analysis and predictive purposes the company believes that excluding from reported financial information costs incurred in connection with a change in its capital structure that is of a nature that would be expected to recur sporadically also provides a useful measure for analysis and predictive purposes the company accounts for its operations in argentina and venezuela using hyper inflation rules under gaap due to volatility in changes in exchange rates the company s non gaap measures exclude for analysis and predictive purposes the impact from devaluations on the argentine peso and venezuelan bolivar denominated net monetary assets and other balance sheet positions that impact near term income since they appear in the income statement at the exchange rate at which they were originally translated rather than the exchange rate at which current operating activity is being translated the company has also elected to present financial measures excluding the impact of amortizing the purchase accounting carrying value of certain definite lived intangible assets primarily the value of its fuller trade name recorded in connection with the company s december 2005 acquisition of the direct selling businesses of sara lee corporation the amortization expense related to these assets will continue for several years similarly in connection with its evaluation of the carrying value of acquired intangible assets and goodwill the company has periodically recognized impairment charges the company believes that these types of non cash charges will not be representative in any single reporting period of amounts recorded in prior reporting periods or expected to be recorded in future reporting periods therefore they are excluded from indicated financial information to also provide a useful measure for analysis and predictive purposes the company enters into a limited number of business to business transactions in which it sells products to a partner company since the level of these sales is volatile from quarter to quarter and year to year and is largely independent of the activities of its sales force the company at times in addition to disclosing reported sales discloses core sales amounts and comparisons which exclude amounts sold under business to business transactions this illustrates sales results and trends directly associated with activities of its independent sales force also as the impact of changes in exchange rates is an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons the company believes the presentation of results on a local currency basis in addition to reported results helps improve readers ability to understand the company s operating results and evaluate performance in comparison with prior periods the company presents local currency information that compares results between periods as if current period exchange rates had been the exchange rates in the prior period the company uses results on a local currency basis as one measure to evaluate performance the company generally refers to such amounts as calculated on a local currency basis as restated or excluding the impact of foreign currency these core sales and local currency results should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for results reported in accordance with gaap core sales and results on a local currency basis may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not measures of performance presented in accordance with gaap in information included with this release the company has referred to adjusted ebitda and a debt adjusted ebitda ratio which are non gaap financial measures used in the company s credit agreement the company uses these measures in its capital allocation decision process and in discussions with investors analysts and other interested parties and therefore believes it is useful to disclose this amount and ratio the company s calculation of these measures is in accordance with its credit agreement and is set forth in the reconciliation from gaap amounts in an attachment to this release however the reader is cautioned that other companies define these measures in different ways and consequently they may not be comparable with similarly labeled amounts disclosed by others tupperware brands corporation first quarter 2019

currency exchange rates the company does not intend to update forward looking information except through its quarterly earnings releases unless it expects diluted earnings per share for the current quarter excluding items impacting comparability and changes versus its guidance of the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates to be significantly below its previous guidance non gaap financial measures the company has utilized non gaap financial measures in this release which are provided to assist readers understanding of the company s results of operations these amounts exclude certain items that at times materially impact the comparability of the company s results of operations the adjusted information is intended to be indicative of the company s primary operations and to assist readers in evaluating performance and analyzing trends across periods these results should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for results reported in accordance with gaap the non gaap financial measures include comparisons related to profit they exclude gains from the sale of property plant and equipment and insurance settlements related to casualty losses other income in connection with real estate related operations inventory obsolescence and operating losses in conjunction with decisions to exit wind down or significantly restructure businesses along with asset sales related to exited or restructured businesses certain asset retirement obligations re engineering including the exit of businesses and fixed asset impairment charges pension settlements and significant discrete impacts of new tax laws upon adoption while the company is engaged in a multi year program to sell land adjacent to its orlando florida headquarters and also disposes of other excess land and facilities periodically these activities are not part of its primary business operations additionally amounts recognized in any given period are not indicative of amounts that may be recognized in any particular future period for this reason these amounts are excluded as indicated the company excludes significant charges related to casualty losses caused by significant weather events fires or similar circumstances it also excludes any related gains resulting from the settlement of associated insurance claims while these types of events can and do recur periodically they are excluded from indicated financial information due to their distinction from ongoing business operations inherent volatility and impact on the comparability of earnings across periods the company periodically records exit costs accounted for using the applicable accounting guidance for exit or disposal cost obligations and other amounts related to rationalizing its supply chain operations and other re engineering activities including the exit of businesses and upon liquidation of operations in a country the recognition in income of amounts previously recorded in equity as a cumulative translation adjustment also the company excludes the impact of changes in tax laws on cumulative deferred taxes from items previously recorded as cumulative translation adjustments the company believes these amounts are similarly volatile and impact the comparability of earnings across periods therefore they are also excluded from indicated financial information to provide what the company believes represents a useful measure for analysis and predictive purposes the company believes that excluding from reported financial information costs incurred in connection with a change in its capital structure that is of a nature that would be expected to recur sporadically also provides a useful measure for analysis and predictive purposes the company accounts for its operations in argentina and venezuela using hyper inflation rules under gaap due to volatility in changes in exchange rates the company s non gaap measures exclude for analysis and predictive purposes the impact from devaluations on the argentine peso and venezuelan bolivar denominated net monetary assets and other balance sheet positions that impact near term income since they appear in the income statement at the exchange rate at which they were originally translated rather than the exchange rate at which current operating activity is being translated the company has also elected to present financial measures excluding the impact of amortizing the purchase accounting carrying value of certain definite lived intangible assets primarily the value of its fuller trade name recorded in connection with the company s december 2005 acquisition of the direct selling businesses of sara lee corporation the amortization expense related to these assets will continue for several years similarly in connection with its evaluation of the carrying value of acquired intangible assets and goodwill the company has periodically recognized impairment charges the company believes that these types of non cash charges will not be representative in any single reporting period of amounts recorded in prior reporting periods or expected to be recorded in future reporting periods therefore they are excluded from indicated financial information to also provide a useful measure for analysis and predictive purposes the company enters into a limited number of business to business transactions in which it sells products to a partner company since the level of these sales is volatile from quarter to quarter and year to year and is largely independent of the activities of its sales force the company at times in addition to disclosing reported sales discloses core sales amounts and comparisons which exclude amounts sold under business to business transactions this illustrates sales results and trends directly associated with activities of its independent sales force also as the impact of changes in exchange rates is an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons the company believes the presentation of results on a local currency basis in addition to reported results helps improve readers ability to understand the company s operating results and evaluate performance in comparison with prior periods the company presents local currency information that compares results between periods as if current period exchange rates had been the exchange rates in the prior period the company uses results on a local currency basis as one measure to evaluate performance the company generally refers to such amounts as calculated on a local currency basis as restated or excluding the impact of foreign currency these core sales and local currency results should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for results reported in accordance with gaap core sales and results on a local currency basis may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not measures of performance presented in accordance with gaap in information included with this release the company has referred to adjusted ebitda and a debt adjusted ebitda ratio which are non gaap financial measures used in the company s credit agreement the company uses these measures in its capital allocation decision process and in discussions with investors analysts and other interested parties and therefore believes it is useful to disclose this amount and ratio the company s calculation of these measures is in accordance with its credit agreement and is set forth in the reconciliation from gaap amounts in an attachment to this release however the reader is cautioned that other companies define these measures in different ways and consequently they may not be comparable with similarly labeled amounts disclosed by others tupperware brands corporation first quarter 2019

or restated changes are measured by comparing current year results with those of the prior year translated at the current year s foreign exchange rates notes a the lower active sales force than local currency sales comparison in europe established markets was mainly due to business to business b2b sales in tupperware france and switzerland which do not relate to sales force statistics b the larger decrease in active sales force than local currency sales comparison in asia pacific emerging markets was primarily from a mix shift towards tupperware china which does not have a traditional sales

foreign direct investment fdi in vietnam economy foreign direct investment has positive impacts on developing economies however without proper and effective policies in attracting and management of foreign investment there can be negative impacts as well this study attempts to provide a picture of foreign investment in vietnam over the past time the main research method used in the article is statistics analysis and input output analysis method using data from vietnam general statistics office along with some contemporary policy discussion a comprehensive statistical investigation shows that while fdi sector consistently accounts for about 20 of vietnam gdp since 1995 this sector is becoming dominating in importing and exporting relatively to state and other non state sectors besides policies exercised by the government are both showing signs of unfair treatment between fdi and domestic sectors and showing loopholes exploited by fdi firms such as tax avoidance and price transfer from the input ouput analysis we discovered that the sector which needs state investment the most domestic sector with highest spillover effects to income and lowest to import is begin neglected in favor of fdi sectors consequently this has created a fragmented domestic economy that is assembly based and not fully utilising its manufacturing potentials some recommendations drawn from the study are increase effectiveness of policy in attracting and using foreign investments ensure fairness in treatment between foreign and domestic firms create incentives to boost domestic manufacturing priorities foreign capitals which have positive spillover effects and technology transfer 1 introduction foreign direct investment fdi has a very important meaning both in the start up phase of the economy as well as in the depth of development on the way of industrialization modernization and development of knowledge economy this is because foreign direct investment is a very important source of supplementary capital to the total investment capital and contributes to economic growth since 1978 when the law on foreign investment of vietnam was passed a large amount of foreign capital was attracted making important contributions to economic development stimulating exports and improving quality of human resources technology and an important premise for vietnam s economic growth on the other hand attracting foreign direct investment is also one of the main objectives in vietnam s socio economic development although attracting foreign direct investment is very important to mobilizing and long term usage of capital it is necessary to select and make policies suitable to each stage of development in recent years fdi enterprises in vietnam have enjoyed many incentives from tax and land policies which in turn have caused many difficulties and disadvantages for domestic enterprises this article aims to assess the status of the fdi sector s contribution as well as vietnam expectations for fdi enterprises through analysis some recommendations will be given to domestic businesses and to the state to have appropriate policies that ensure mutual benefits for all kind of business and harmonize with the country s interests vietnam investment law stipulates that foreign direct investment is when foreign investors bring into vietnam capital in cash or any assets to invest investors may be an organization or individual there are also a number of widely recognized definitions of fdi foreign direct investment fdi is a foreign owned capital of assets such as factories mineral mines and land in countries but does not include securities it is also possible to understand that direct investment is a long term form of investment by an individual or company investing in another country by establishing a business production facility in which an individual or foreign company that will take control of this business in the country where the investment is made the world trade organization wto has also made the following definition of fdi foreign direct investment is made when an investor from a country called the investor country acquires investment assets in order to invest at another country the host country that attracts investment along with the right to manage the property direct management is a sign to distinguish fdi from other financial instruments such as securities and credit thus it can be seen that fdi has the following basic characteristics there are elements of investment capital from abroad may be individuals or organizations businesses use that capital to invest abroad by setting up new assets the foreign party has the right to manage the use and exploitation of such capital economists have come up with explanations on why fdi exists and the phenomenon of moving capital from one country to another this is because there is a difference in the productivity of the increase in the marginal productivity the amount of output that a manufacturer can obtain by using an additional unit of production factor of capital between countries therefore some countries are both foreign capital investor and receiver a capital surplus country in a certain field often has lower marginal productivity when using it in another country because it has reached critical point a capital deficit country often has a higher marginal productivity due to many untapped potentials this situation will lead to the movement of capital from surplus to relatively scarce places in order to maximize profits because the production costs of excess capital countries are often higher than those of capital deficit and wishing to receive capital growth theories often focus on production factors typically the notions of ricardo smith karl marx which are followed by the solow swan model as a model of exogenous growth capital labor technological processes management methods total factor productivity tfp next paul romer and robert lucas 1988 put technological progress and the role of human capital as the central point of their theoretical model it was robert barro barro jr sala i martin who emphasized not only the technological process but also human capital and public policies as contributors to the increased continuous growth the input output analysis is also used in this study there are not many studies using the i o model to assess the impact of fdi some related studies such as shri prakas shalini sharma and f kasid in iioa conference at san paolo presented the approach input output model of impact of fdi on indian economic growth bruno de souza lopes et al used input output approach in order to compared foreign direct investment versus domestic investment trinh bui and pham le hoa used also input output approach for comparing structure of vietnam economy and china economy research on vietnam economic structure change based on input output system also mention ha et al this study indicates that the foreign invested sector may increase gdp but may also reduce the economy s resources which can make the gross national income gni smaller and the flow of money going abroad is getting bigger and bigger while people and host countries hardly get any benefits from fdi enterprises 2 methodology and data sources this study is based on the criteria of the system of national accounts sna the path from income generation to income distribution and redistribution is expressed through macro indicators such as export import gdp gni another study by leontief also used input output analysis approach in order to find the induced impacts by final demand to output value added and import in this research the gross capital formation was divided into state non state and fdi areas data in this research are available in website of gso and the input output table was updated in 2016 approach update input output table 2016 based on structure of the input output table 2012 with competitive import type and row vectors as intermediate input and gross input collected by enterprise survey call ii 2012 and ii 2016 are intermediate input vectors in 2012 and 2016 gi 2012 and gi 2016 are gross input vectors in 2012 and 2016 element of intermediate input matrix defined as follow x i j 2016 x i j 2012 i i 2012 i i 2016 household consumption was collected by vhlss survey export and import based on report of vietnam general statistics office gross capital formation was collected by report of provinces and enterprise survey after that the ras1 method was used for balancing gross input and gross output apply input output system the standard leontief 1941 was solving x i a d 1 y d 1 where x is an output matrix that is induced by factor of domestic final demand ad is domestic direct intermediate coefficient matrix yd is domestic final demand matrix dimension of this matrix is number sectors in row and factors on domestic final demand final consumption gross capital formation of state area gross capital formation of non state area gross capital formation of fdi area and export from 1 we have v v i a d 1 y d 2 with v is value added matrix and v is their coefficient matrix and m m i a d 1 y d 3 with m is import vector and m is their coefficient vector from 1 2 3 the induced impact of output value added and import defined as follow output multipliers x y 4 value added multipliers v y 5 import multipliers m y 6 where shows scalar division the data of these indicators are collected at the general statistics office gso an office under vietnam ministry of planning and investment this data are from 1995 to 2017 and preliminarily calculated in 2018 therefore the data evaluated here are relatively long term in 22 years vietnam experienced important milestones during this period such as officially normalized relations with the united states in 1995 officially became a member of wto in 2007 became a low middle income country in 2010 as the data is compiled from the general statistics office this ensures consistency in calculation and definition of figures however the data does not show particularly where fdi comes from i e which country which times this is a major setback for fdi statistics in particular but also for vietnam in general for example export and import data only became available recently from ministry of industry and trade in the framework of analyzing data from the general statistics office the analysis in part 3 and policy recommendations in part 4 focus on clarifying the current status of fdi in vietnam in more than 20 years not clarifying vietnam s trade relations 3 status of foreign direct investment in vietnam although the flow of investment from the fdi sector is expected to generate growth for vietnam according to the general statistics office gso the proportion of investment capital of the state economic sector still accounts for the largest proportion and if compared 2013 to 1995 only decreased by 1 6 points from 42 down to 40 4 particularly since vietnam joined the wto in 2007 the investment capital of the state economic sector has tended to increase while the non state and fdi sectors tend to decrease table 1 although the fdi sector s capital accounts for only about 22 of the total capital the import export value of this sector increasingly accounts for a significant proportion of the total import export value table 1 from 2000 up to now vietnam has always had high trade deficits highest in 2008 with a total trade deficit of over 18 billion for a developing economy like vietnam trade deficit is not necessarily bad if imported goods serve the demand for production and for domestic consumption however in fact the imported goods mainly serve the fdi sector an area where most of the machinery equipment materials raw materials etc are used for production are mainly imported then again table 1 structure of investment by types of ownership source vietnam gso are used for export some major exporting products of vietnam such as electronics computers and components phones and components textiles footwear are heavily assemble based in nature have low value added content the efficiency of the economy is not significant according to research on trade deficit and gdp growth rate in the period of 2000 2016 whether trade deficit is high or low gdp still grows well in this period in 2012 trade surplus was 284 million gdp growth still reached 5 03 even though it was low in the past 12 years the statistics also show that since the wto accession 2007 the openness of the vietnamese economy was huge the export of goods in the period of 2007 2016 increased by 364 the import of goods increased 279 however considering the ownership it can be seen that the fdi sector increased much faster than the domestic sector the export of fdi in this period increased by 454 and the import of goods of the fdi sector increased by 472 the average export growth rate of the fdi sector in the period of 2007 2016 is about 21 annually and the average growth of import of fdi sector is about 22 annually while the export and import growth of the domestic sectors in this period is 11 and 7 annually respectively the import and export structure also shows that the fdi sector is rapidly gaining market share of exports and imports in 2005 exports of fdi sector accounted for about 57 of the total export value in 2016 the region s exports sector accounts for 72 of the total export value similarly the import structure of the fdi sector also increased from 35 in 2005 to 59 in 2016 import and export trends of the fdi sector are also increasingly dominating gradually occupying the market share of the domestic economic sector the export structure of the domestic economic sector in 1995 accounted for 73 of total export turnover by the year 2000 it was 52 98 down to 27 5 in 2017 meanwhile the fdi sector increased from 27 in 1995 to 47 02 in 2000 and 72 5 in 2017 import structure also changed significantly as the domestic economic sector yielded 33 2 market share to the fdi sector in the period 2000 2017 figure 1 and figure 2 figure 1 structure of goods exports in the period 2000 2007 source authors calculation from gso data figure 2 structure of goods imports in the period 2000 2007 source authors calculation from gso data in recent years many policy makers and experts have been optimistic because vietnam export of goods has been a trade surplus while domestic economy sector experienced trade deficit from 1995 to 2017 foreign investment sector has always enjoyed trade surplus in 1995 the foreign invested sector only had a trade surplus of 5 million in 2017 the trade surplus of this region was over 25 billion in comparison domestic area s trade deficit in 1995 was about 2 7 billion and in 2017 was over 25 billion thus we can see that the total trade surplus or trade deficit is brought by the foreign invested sector does this indicate that praising trade surplus actually is praising the outsider s money according to gso the export of fdi sector is very large 72 5 in 2017 but the value adding to gdp only accounts for 18 of the total export value figure 3 even though in the fdi sector s exports which are including exports of resources coal oil etc the ratio of intermediate costs is not high but the proportion of value increases of this area in total gdp is only approximately 20 in fact the contribution of the fdi sector to gdp of 20 is not small while the private sector only contributes about 10 the contribution of the state economic sector accounts for 32 including state owned enterprises contributions to state management and non business activities money from recurrent budget estimated contribution of state owned enterprises to gdp is about 20 2 the largest contribution to gdp is the household sector accounting for 33 of gdp once again affirming that vietnam s economy is not only a processing economy but also one that is very fragmented one country cannot grow if the economy is based on manufacturing and small households unfortunately this proportion has not changed noticeably since 2005 table 2 the production of the foreign investment sector is mainly for processing and the portion of the export of this sector is only in the processing the value added is extremely low in the export value in essence export from this sector is the export from the owner s country exploiting vietnamese market s favoring conditions to other third party countries if goods are produced by foreign investment sectors but sold in vietnam they are in fact exported to vietnam and have higher profits when they produce in their home countries and then export to vietnam because they enjoy many advantages and cheap labor this is partly reflected in the contribution of the fdi sector to gdp although the export value is very large but the value added of this sector in gdp is low only about 18 based on estimated net foreign ownership payment data in 2018 it shows that net foreign ownership is of more than 20 billion in which more than 10 figure 3 net export of domestic economic sector and foreign invested sector usd million source vietnam gso table 2 proportion of gdp contribution of economic sectors source statistical yearbook of vietnam various years billion is for debt repayment and more than 10 billion is for a legal money transfer abroad and on average fdi sector paid about 7 5 billion in tax in which essentially vat is not the money of the fdi sector but the money of vietnamese consumers contributing to the budget through the consumption of products from this sector this is not to mention how businesses can bring products into and out of vietnam which are very difficult to grasp so the real profit may have been located overseas but vietnam cannot know and cannot tax this part of tax payment may have been enjoyed by the fdi enterprise originating country according to the principle of the national account system sna resident unit the value added of the foreign capital sector is accounted for gdp and then businesses in this sector can keep the profit to re invest and also transfer money to the mother country originating country gni gdp property income property payment cash outflow property income property payment thus although the foreign capital sector adds up significantly to gdp growth it nevertheless contributes considerably to net foreign cash outflow to be faster than gdp growth rate the average gdp growth by current price during the period of 2007 2017 is 22 while the growth rate of cash outflow is 32 thereby reducing the ratio of gross national income gni to gdp from 97 2 in 2000 to 95 2 in 2017 almost similarly is the final consumption of the population when banks lend out money for consumption it will make the final consumption of the population increase leading to the increase in gdp at the time but the complications accompanied are the risk of bad debt inflation and decreased savings of the household in the next cycle similar argument can be made about government procurement an increase in government procurement will lead to an increase in gdp but also budget deficit overspending investing in projects such as monumental construction gates road digging filling also increases gdp but leads to a higher ratio of savings to investment and debt risks increase this is the reason many experts believe that the higher the gdp growth the more the country s resources are reduced when growth is based on the foreign capital sector or procurement driven as above therefore the growth of the fdi sector can increase gdp but make the economy a shrinking resource through the targets of gni ndi and saving of the economy while those of the originating country through fdi enterprises increased one problem is that in addition to the good management and capital source of the fdi sector vietnamese policies are too favoring this sector while domestic non state enterprises are not entitled to incentives it is impossible to understand what people think when exempting processing enterprises from taxes basically fdi are processing firms if the domestic enterprises also import those goods for domestic production they are taxed for import and vat of imported goods but those who do processing are exempted from tax3 so what other incentives to businessmen not to only process so how can the manufacturing industry of auxiliary products be developed in addition fdi enterprises are entitled to corporate income tax incentives newly established enterprises from investment projects in the economic zone are entitled to the tax rate of 10 for 15 consecutive years from the first year that revenue is generated and then receives further incentives in addition businesses operating in the economic zone will be exempted from corporate income tax for 4 years from the time the business has taxable income and 50 reduction in the next 9 years it is comparable to say agricultural emphasis is needed but agricultural production and agricultural inputs such as pesticides are entitled to a non taxable policy ie the input vat is not deducted while being exported by the household is subject to the tax rate of zero i e it is both not taxable and deducted from input vat why are domestic enterprises selling domestic products not entitled to preferential tax policies but only fdi enterprises enjoy vietnamese people have suffered from hardships for long should they continue to suffer thus with such a tax preferential policy is one of the reasons that the structure of the domestic private enterprise sector could not exceed 8 9 of gdp during the past 15 years in gdp only the transition between the two favored areas is the state owned enterprises and the fdi sector if nothing changes or only changes in words then the individual economic sector will remain dominant for many years contributing over 30 of gdp while the fdi sector is not managed and tightly bound thus the integration of cptpp will be the only playground of fdi enterprises and other countries when examining the issue in a comprehensive way based on the updated input output model for 2016 this model shows the spillover effect of final demand elements including final consumption investment investment of state economic sector non state economic sector and fdi sector and exports to production value output and income from production added value the calculation results indicate that although the non state economic sector has a lowest effect to production value it has a highest effect to income and lowest to import the basic principle when choosing a key industry or choosing the factors of the final demand is to consider which sectors or factors of demand have a high spillover coefficient to income and a low spillover coefficient to import therefore policy makers can intervene to stimulate production and control import from 2007 up to now the state s policies have tried to manage the demand curb inflation and stimulate economic growth it is nothing wrong with management of demand to stimulate production in the short term but according to keynes s general theory demand management should only be momentary and should not be done for a long time most importantly if intervention in demand is decided which factors will be most beneficial to the economy for many years the government has stimulated economic growth through increasing public investment while actually public investment has the lowest effect to income investing 100 vnd only spread to 27 vnd of income while 100 vnd invested in non state sector can spread to 35 vnd of income table 3 tax policies for export seem to be a mistake when export of host country is actually export of other countries in a machining economy the priority for export not only brings low value added but also constrains the non state economic sector to develop and increases the trade deficit as well as the balance of payments deficit table 3 was calculated which was based on equations 4 5 and 6 above 4 conclusions and some policy recommendations vietnam has signed many multilateral and bilateral trade agreements in an open table 3 output value added and import induced by domestic final demand equations 4 6 sources authors calculation based on vietnam input output 2016 and integrated world the flow of foreign investment directly or indirectly into vietnam is inevitable what do the government and the people expect from this capital inflow into vietnam firstly they expect to attract the workforce technology transfer but perhaps the most likely is the achievement driven motives from the central to local administration levels when capital flows into any province their grp and national gdp increases despite the fact that vietnamese people do not considerably benefit from this but only some people benefit from this growth achievement in fact some experts complain about this sector not because they are against it but they see an unjust treatment in implementing policies between different types of businesses since due to foreign investment tax incentives vietnamese people have to bear additional tax burden so the first thing to do is to eliminate the achievement driven motives and tenure culture of the leadership levels followed by a real just of both policy and policy implementation in addition it is not that experts who often write and talk about foreign invested sector do not have hope in this capital flow but rather they expect a boost in economic structural change a promotion in transparency and equality so that domestic enterprises have a motivation to compete healthily with foreign invested enterprises to do so it is necessary to push back and proceed to eliminate petty corruption it is the petty corruption that terribly discourages the terrible domestic enterprises they must compete by bribing bribing to shake hands with officials when attracting foreign capital people of authority need to firstly think about the benefits of the country of vietnamese people in the short medium and long terms thus it is necessary to introduce principles of technology transfer after a certain time it is necessary to regulate enterprises with foreign capital on labor use in quantity as well as in quality priority should be given to attracting foreign investment flows into industries with high spillovers to other sectors low spillovers to imports energy and environment but the important thing is that domestic businesses have to raise themselves if a domestic enterprise refuses to stand up or cannot stand up it is not the fault of foreign invested enterprises if the situation does not change the economy will be the economy of foreign businesses that s okay but sad it may not be sad because working for anyone is working as a laborer but working for the righteous people is still better enterprises with foreign capital according to a senior official of the ministry of industry and trade in a recent conference on december 3 between da nang university of economics and hanoi foreign trade university are more righteous than domestic businesses notes 1some experts believe that the ras method is named after the economist richard stone 1919 1991 who among his other achievements co authored the 1968 sna together with abraham aidenof his full name was john richard nicholas stone he did not have a as his middle initial so there must be another explanation for ras 2currently economic situation assessments are often tied to targets gdp in vietnam today is not only calculated but also recognized in terms of supply side that is to add all value added by basic prices of industries in the economy and product tax in value added according to the calculation method of vietnam statistical office does not include product tax on the principle of permanent residence for example a fdi enterprise operating in the territory of vietnam for more than one year the entire value the increase of that enterprise is included in vietnam s gdp an fdi enterprise exploiting natural resources in vietnam is also calculated according to the above principle thus the growth in scale as well as the number of gdp indicators does not really reflect the picture of the economy such as fdi enterprises specializing in resource exploitation they will transfer profits to their country but the figures are still reflected in vietnam s gdp 3pursuant to point a clause 1 article 10 of decree no 134 2016 nd cp of september 1 2016 of the government stipulates article 10 tax exemption for goods imported for processing or export processed products

costs q1 2019 financial costs increased 8 million to 72 million 13 above q1 2018 the increase was due mainly to higher net interest expenses and bank commissions due to a 6 million mark to market valuation of the financial instrument related to the netafim acquisition 5 million of bank commissions related to bank loans 3 million less interest earned due to the lower average cash position in q1 2019 versus q1 2018 2 million of higher interest expenses related to the 200 million bilateral loan taken by mexichem at the end of january 2018 for the netafim acquisition 2 million of lease interest related primarily to ifrs 16 and a 2 million decrease in the monetary position in our venezuelan and argentinean operations these impacts were offset by a decrease of 12 million in foreign exchange

dollar in q1 2019 compared to q1 2018 taxes while income from continuing operations before income taxes decreased 28 in q1 2019 compared with q1 2018 cash tax increased 4 or 2 million due mainly to a

bowman biff bowman chief financial officer good morning everyone let me join mark in welcoming you to our first quarter 2019 earnings conference call starting on page 2 of our quarterly earnings review presentation this morning we reported first quarter net income of 347 1 million earnings per share were 1 48 and our return on common equity was 14 as noted on the second page of our earnings release this quarter s results included 12 3 million of severance related and restructuring charges within expenses before going through our results in detail i would like to comment on some macro factors impacting our business during the quarter equity markets rebounded during the quarter following a challenging fourth quarter compared to the prior year the s p 500 ended the quarter up 7 3 while the msci eafe was unchanged on a sequential basis end of period markets were favorable with the s p 500 and the eafe indices increasing 13 1 and 9 6 respectively recall that some of our fees are based on lagged pricing and those comparisons are challenging both versus one year ago as well as sequentially on a month lag basis the s p 500 and eafe were down 2 6 and 9 on a year over year basis and down 4 7 and 4 1 sequentially on a quarter lag basis the s p 500 and eafe were down 6 2 and 13 4 on a year over year basis and down 14 and 12 5 sequentially u s short term interest rates were modestly higher in the quarter on average driven by the full quarter impact of the federal reserve december rate hike on a sequential basis average one month and three month libor increased 15 and 7 basis points respectively currency rates influenced the translation of non u s currencies to the u s dollar and therefore impact client assets and certain revenues and expenses the british pound and euro versus the u s dollar ended the quarter down 7 and 9 respectively compared to the prior year the year over year declines favorably impacted expense but had an unfavorable impact on revenue on a sequential basis the british pound ended the quarter up 2 while the euro declined 2 let s move to page 3 and review the financial highlights of the first quarter year over year revenue was flat with noninterest income down 3 and net interest income up 9 expenses increased 3 from last year the provision for credit losses was zero in the current quarter compared to a credit of 3 million one year ago net income was 9 lower year over year in the sequential comparison revenue declined 2 with noninterest income down 3 and net interest income flat expenses increased 1 compared to the prior year net income declined 15 sequentially return on average common equity was 14 for the quarter down from 16 one year ago and 17 from the prior quarter assets under custody and administration of 10 9 trillion increased 1 compared to one year ago and were up 8 on a sequential basis assets under custody of 8 2 trillion were also up 1 compared to one year ago and up 8 sequentially the year over year performance was primarily driven by favorable markets partially offset by the impact of unfavorable moves in currency exchange rates the sequential performance was primarily driven by favorable markets and new business assets under management were 1 2 trillion flat on a year over year basis and up 9 on a sequential basis the year over year performance reflect the higher markets and new business offset by lower period ending securities lending collateral the sequential increase was driven by higher markets and new business let s look at the results in greater detail starting with revenue on page 4 first quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was 1 5 billion flat compared to last year and down 2 sequentially trust investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were 929 million in the first quarter down 1 from both last year and the prior quarter foreign exchange trading income was 66 million in the first quarter down 16 year over year and down 15 sequentially both the year over year and sequential declines were driven by lower volatility as well as lower foreign exchange swap activity in our treasury function the sequential decline was also impacted by lower client volumes other noninterest income was 64 million in the first quarter down 16 compared to one year ago and down 15 sequentially the year over year decline was primarily due to lower security commissions and trading income higher visa related swap expense and lower miscellaneous income the sequential decline was due to a leasing gain recognized in the prior quarter as well as higher visa related swap expense net interest income which i will discuss in more detail later was 430 million in the first quarter increasing 9 year over year and flat sequentially let s look at the components of our trust and investment fees on page 5 for our corporate and institutional services business fees totaled 535 million in the first quarter and were down 2 year over year and flat on a sequential basis the translation impact of changes in currency rates reduced year over year c is fee growth by approximately 2 custody and fund administration fees the largest component of c is fees were 375 million and essentially flat on both the year over year and sequential basis the year over year performance was driven by new business partially offset by both unfavorable markets and an unfavorable currency translation on a sequential basis the impact of lower markets was mostly offset by new and favorable currency translation assets under custody and administration for c is clients were 10 2 trillion at quarter end up 1 year over year and up 8 sequentially the year over year performance was primarily driven by favorable markets partially offset by the impact of unfavorable moves in currency exchange rates the sequential performance was primarily driven by favorable markets and new business recall that lagged market values factor into the quarter s fees with both quarter lag and month lag markets impacting our c is custody and fund administration fees investment management fees in c is of 104 million in the first quarter were down 5 year over year and down 1 sequentially the year over year decline was primarily due to the impacts of unfavorable markets on a sequential basis the impact of lower markets was partially offset by new business assets under management for c is clients were 868 billion down 1 year over year and up 10 sequentially the year over year decline was driven by lower period end securities lending collateral mostly offset by favorable markets and new business the sequential growth was driven by favorable markets higher period end securities lending collateral and new business securities lending fees were 23 million in the first quarter down 13 year over year but up 5 sequentially the year over year decline was primarily driven by lower volumes while the sequential performance reflected slightly higher spreads securities lending collateral was 165 billion at quarter end and averaged 158 billion across the quarter average collateral levels declined 14 year over year and were flat sequentially moving to our wealth management business trust investment and other servicing fees were 394 million in the first quarter and were flat compared to the prior year and down 1 sequentially the year over year performance reflected the impact of new business offset by the impact of lower markets on a sequential basis the impact of lower markets was mostly offset by new business assets under management for wealth management clients were 294 billion at quarter end up 2 year over year and up 6 sequentially moving to page 6 net interest income was 430 million in the first quarter up 9 year over year earning assets averaged 111 billion in the first quarter down 4 from the prior year total deposits averaged 91 billion and were down 7 year over year interest bearing deposits declined 3 from one year ago to 74 billion noninterest bearing deposits which averaged 18 billion during the quarter were down 19 from one year ago loan balances averaged 31 billion in the first quarter and were down 4 compared to one year ago the net interest margin was 1 58 in the first quarter and was up 20 basis points from a year ago the improvement in the net interest margin compared to the prior year primarily reflects the impact of higher short term interest rates and a balance sheet mix shift on a sequential quarter basis net interest income was flat average earning assets declined 1 on a sequential basis as deposit levels declined 2 from the prior quarter on a sequential basis the net interest margin increased 6 basis points due to the favorable impact of higher short term rates as we have discussed in our most recent quarters we did continue to see the opportunity for foreign exchange swap activity within our treasury function this activity has the impact of reducing our interest income relating to central bank deposits as we swap out of u s dollars but increase our level of foreign exchange trading income for this quarter we saw additional foreign exchange trading income of 13 million offset by 10 million less in net interest income looking at the currency mix of our balance sheet for the first quarter u s dollar deposits represented 69 of our total deposits this is equal to one year ago and down from 70 in the prior quarter turning to page 7 expenses were 1 billion in the first quarter and were 3 higher than the prior year and up 1 sequentially as previously mentioned the current quarter included 12 3 million in expense associated with severance and other charges for comparison purposes note that the prior year and prior quarter included 8 6 million and 5 7 million in severance and other related charges respectively excluding the called out charges expense for the current quarter was up 3 from one year ago with respect to the remaining increase in year over year expense growth the following items were key drivers within the categories compensation was higher primarily driven by base pay adjustments within salaries which were effective in april of 2018 the impact of staff growth on salaries was more than offset by staff actions and our ongoing location strategy efforts employee benefits were lower compared to last year primarily due to lower medical expense as well as lower retirement plan costs outside service costs were higher driven by increased technical services and higher levels of legal and consulting costs partially offset by lower third party advisor fees and lower subcustodian expense equipment and software expense was up year over year mainly due to higher software related spend other operating expenses were up from the prior year due to higher staff related business promotion and other miscellaneous expenses partially offset by lower fdic expense shifting to the sequential expense view including the expense charges in both the current and prior quarter expenses were flat compared to the prior quarter compensation expense increased primarily reflecting the higher expenses related to long term performance based incentive compensation due to divesting provisions associated with grants to retirement eligible employees in the current quarter this quarter s compensation included 30 million in expense associated with retirement eligible staff it is worth noting due to changes in service requirements associated with performance share compensation there will no longer be an additional component of the retirement eligible expense impacting the second quarter as we have seen occur over the previous two years employee benefits declined sequentially primarily due to lower medical and retirement plan costs partially offset by higher payroll tax withholding outside services declined sequentially due to lower third party advisor fees and consulting costs the sequential decline in equipment software costs is primarily due to a prior quarter software related charge other operating expense declined 16 million from the prior period driven by lower business promotional expense as well as lower sequential costs associated with account servicing activities and other miscellaneous expenses staff levels increased approximately 5 year over year and 2 sequentially the staff growth was all attributable to staff increases in lower cost locations which include india manila limerick ireland and tempe arizona partially offset by reductions within our higher cost locations turning to page 8 as we have discussed on previous calls through our value for spend initiative we are realigning our expense base with the goal of realizing 250 million in expense run rate savings by 2020 we continue to embed a sustainable expense management approach we expect these efforts to slow our expense growth to be more closely aligned with our organic fee growth our first quarter results reflect approximately 45 million in expense savings reducing the year over year expense growth rate by approximately three points this would equate to just under 180 million on an annualized basis against the 250 million goal we continue to cultivate a healthy pipeline of opportunities turning to page 9 a key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability and returns this slide reflects the progress we have made in recent years to improve the expense to fee ratio pre tax margin and ultimately our return on equity the ratio of expense to fee is a particularly important measure of our progress as it addresses what we can most directly control while this quarter s ratio of 111 does demonstrate the impact that macroenvironment particularly lower equity markets can have we remain focused on continuing to drive organic growth in our business and managing our expense to improve our efficiency and productivity when we look at our results for this quarter absent the market impacts we would say that our expense to fee ratio was comparable to where we were tracking in the most recent quarters turning to page 10 our capital ratios remained strong with our common equity tier 1 ratio of 13 5 under the advanced approach and 13 under the standardized approach the supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation was 7 2 and at the bank was 6 6 both of which exceeded the 3 requirement that became applicable to northern trust effective at the start of 2018 with respect to the liquidity coverage ratio northern trust is above the applicable 100 minimum requirement as northern trust progresses through fully phased in basel iii implementation there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final basel iii rules during the quarter we increased our quarterly dividend from 0 55 to 0 60 representing a 9 sequential increase and a 43 increase on a year over year basis during the quarter we also repurchased more than 2 8 million shares of common stock at a cost of 257 million in closing despite the challenging backdrop from the impact of lagged equity markets and flatter interest rates our performance during the quarter was resilient generating return on average common equity of 14 our balanced business model continued to generate organic growth with each of our client facing reporting segments of c is and wealth management contributing approximately 50 of our earnings we are confident in our competitive positioning within attractive markets and our ability to continue to generate organic growth our focus remains on providing our clients with exceptional services improving our productivity and driving profitable growth before i conclude as is customary for our first quarter earnings call we will need to end today s call a bit earlier than in other quarters to allow sufficient time for all of us to get to our annual meeting which begins at 10 30 a m central time this morning please accept our apologies in the event that we have to close off the question and answer period earlier than our normal practice thank you again for participating in northern trust s first quarter earnings conference call today mark and i would be happy to answer your questions carrie please open the line questions and answers operator and our first question will come from betsy graseck from morgan stanley betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst hi good morning thanks so much for the update i just wanted to understand as you re thinking through the operating levers that you delivered on this quarter was there anything unusual in the expense line i know you called out a couple of items but then the follow on is as you re thinking through 2q and 3q can we expect the same kind of run rate that you delivered in 1q biff bowman chief financial officer so other than the charges that we called out in the expense lines i would say it was pretty much expenses as normal so pretty much core run rate in our expenses mark bette director of investor relations we did have a higher retirement eligible impact and compensation of 30 million in the first quarter but some of the other spend like business promo is sometimes a little bit lower in the first quarter too but all are pretty clean biff bowman chief financial officer yes and we have the compensation expense in every first quarter which you can see flow through but the rest of the other line items i think were pretty much as reported betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst i know you don t give guidance specifically i m not asking for that i m just wondering the run rate that you re seeing in 1q do you think that kind of pace is something you can continue with or is there any kind of investment spend that you d be ramping up on the back of this for 1q biff bowman chief financial officer well we continue to focus on our value for spend initiatives and to try to drive our expense base as hard as we can but we also are growing as you could see and when you strip out the impacts of markets it was pretty good underlying growth again in the quarter so there is some expense that comes with supporting that growth but i d say in general we think that the trajectory you saw here is something that we re going to is a decent run rate and that we re going to continue to try to improve it with our value for spend initiatives but i think it s a pretty good run rate operator our next question will be from alex blostein from goldman sachs alex blostein goldman sachs analyst hey guys good morning so i know you obviously don t give i know you guys don t give guidance obviously but i was hoping we can talk through some of the nir dynamics as a jumping off point from here so i guess one noninterest bearing deposits down a little bit over 1 billion i think as you talked about in the past you thought that kind of that excess number was sort of in that 1 billion range so should we be thinking of that being sort of done or do you guys think there s more to go and broadly speaking is there anything you guys can do from a kind of firm specific idiosyncratic perspective to protect the level of nir from here or is this pretty much kind of peak nir for you guys biff bowman chief financial officer so let me walk through without providing guidance the way we re thinking about it the first alex is the volume of the balance sheet and the thing we feel we can control most on the volume is through the continued organic growth in our custody business primarily our auc which produces that growth in the balance sheet and we ve had pretty good results there and we think if we can continue to do that that the balance sheet should continue to grow with that inherent growth that we talk about in our custody business as it relates to noninterest bearing deposits that you talked about in this quarter and we talked to the past about that pool of a couple billion i think we ve used is that of that runoff in noninterest bearing deposits this quarter half of it was from one client so we still do have some sizable lumpy type deposits that could be yield seeking but we think it s inside the bucket that we told you in the past the 1 billion to 2 billion of the noninterest bearing so we can control the volume the second part of the forward look if you will without guidance is the mix what we ve seen in the mix of the balance sheet is we have seen interest bearing deposits move from about 78 of the balance sheet to 80 so that s a trend i think that s a trend that we see in our industry among our competitors and i think that s a market dynamic so i m not sure how much is controllable there but we continue to look at that and then the last piece that we still focus on is the spread or the yield that we can get from that and i ll break that a little bit apart on the asset side look we re still asset sensitive as a firm and so it breaks sort of flat now from here there is still the ability to have assets repriced higher for us so that is a positive based on where we are but then the liability side the deposit beta and the pricing in the market is something we have to watch from a competitive dynamic and i think we ve been disciplined and we have a good process to watch that and if we think it flattens out from here with no rate movements on the horizon then there might still be the ability to grind up a little bit on the nim over time that s where we are there s a lot of ifs in there but if pricing in the competitive landscape holds stead we still think we could see a grind up on the nim alex blostein goldman sachs analyst got it that s helpful and then my second question around just the core fees i mean looks like custody and admin fees in particular came in quite strong relative to a challenging exit as of the end of last year i know you guys highlighted new business so maybe expand on that a little bit was this a quarter of outsized new business wins that sort of drove fees where we ended up obviously being for the quarter without obviously naming clients but maybe you can just help us kind of characterize where some of that business is coming from biff bowman chief financial officer yes we continue to see a strong pipeline across both of our businesses both c is and wealth then both produced particularly versus first quarter of the previous year strong performances in fact our c is business produced a really strong year over year comparison to the first quarter of last year on the new business front and we continue to see a broad range of wins both geographically product line client types in both sides in fact on the wealth side our organic growth rate was at the higher end of the range as we ve talked about as well in the first quarter so pretty strong new business momentum and then obviously the markets and others in the first quarter came back and we have obviously some lag impacts but we also have some month lag impacts and so we saw the benefit of rising markets alex blostein goldman sachs analyst awesome thanks for that operator our next question will be from michael carrier with bank of america merrill lynch michael carrier bank of america merrill lynch analyst all right thanks good morning biff maybe some of the expenses given that you re at the 180 million the 250 million how should we be thinking about timing i think you guys said through 2020 but are there any like initiatives in place that we should see some steps along the way as we get into 2020 biff bowman chief financial officer yes so we ve said the 250 million we re continuing to push forward on that and make a good progress as you can see what i would say is that we re trying to build in the dna and the culture here is that ongoing expense savings has to be a part of our regular routine so while we ve got a program defined that s 250 million we also know that we have to embed culturally the ability to go in there and create economic savings from an expense standpoint on a longer term basis than just 2020 we ve got a program we ll define it by 2020 but that discipline of taking some of the inflationary pressures out of our business through strong expense initiatives is embedding and we can see it and it s becoming part of the culture so we ll continue to track to the 250 million that we ve told you about but i think more importantly is embedding that discipline for forward looking years beyond 2020 michael carrier bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok and then just and the follow up too on the last question in terms of the organic growth and even the fees you tend to hold up or continue to hold up better than some of the peers out there and maybe if you can just provide some color on some of the wins that you re seeing maybe whether it s like asset mix the client mix just trying to get some color particularly on the c is side and how much from like a competitive fee standpoint are you seeing versus maybe the mix the product that continues to maybe hold up better than the industry biff bowman chief financial officer yes so let me pull it apart a little bit on the c is side i would say first let s take some regional we ve seen strong growth in our australia market where we ve moved up near the top portion of the league tables i was just talking with pete cherecwich before i came in so we re near the top of the league charts there in our growth from a geographical perspective there luxembourg is another area with the ubs acquisition and other new business where we ve seen outsized geographic growth that s organic it s strong in the client type i d say let me highlight two we continue to do very well with hedge funds our acquisition and hedge fund services has allowed us to grow i think last year we cited and continues to see wins in the hedge fund space i think we had the largest hedge fund launch that was launched last year is a northern trust client we had a press release on that but we ve also done very well in the foundation in the endowment space is another example and we ve brought what i would say is a product and a capability there a front office solution for what i ll say a large in house pools of money which is commonly or typically done in a foundation or endowment so that s two examples of a client type and a geography where i think we re seeing outsized growth we ve got more of those we can highlight but we just have a strong performance right now in the growth in terms of the second part of your question and the competitive nature of the pricing look this is a competitive business as a bank for 34 years it s been a competitive business for 34 years i would say that we haven t seen it at least in our client mix the outsized versus normal which we would typically see somewhere a 1 5 to 2 type of fee pressures which we assume in our organic growth rate we had to overcome that we ve still seen that and i think that in our client mix that s what we ve seen i don t know that it s been higher than that right now but it s also not lower and it seems pretty constant michael carrier bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok thanks a lot operator our next question will be from steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak wolfe research analyst hi good morning so just wanted to unpack some of the remarks around the nii commentary and recognizing it s not a guidance but i was hoping you could speak to your appetite to maybe extend the duration of the balance sheet given some concerns over the next move could be a fed easing cycle and how we should think about against that backdrop maybe what the deposit trajectory could look like over the coming quarters if we are in a flat rate environment biff bowman chief financial officer well what we say typically here is that we have a process where we go through and look at our own internal projections for interest rates and then we make decisions of how to position the balance sheet i think it s fair to say that in the previous quarters we ve had some of the interest rate projections that i think are now being held more widely and we have extended the duration in particularly the long term portion of our securities portfolio so we have that thought process and we do take actions when we see that so that provides some protection against that down rate scenario what i would also say is that if it behaves as normal the deposit betas on a down rate cycle are typically pretty fast and pretty high and we would anticipate that being the case here too so depending on just how that rate curve move happens and shifts we could protect some of that spread and margin in a down rate scenario plus with some of the actions we ve taken on our asset sensitivity by adding the duration so we have contemplated that and i think we ve got a lot of views from our investment management firm and our own chief economists that have views on the rate trajectory so we take those all in and then make decisions on the overall alco asset liability policy steven chubak wolfe research analyst no it s very helpful color and just switching gears to the capital side you guys continue to run with best in class capital ratios i know you try to avoid deviating from some of your peers and try to manage to similar capital targets through the cycle just given some commentary from some of your trust bank peers about increased confidence given some upcoming changes to leverage ratio as well as what appears to be maybe a more benign cash than in the coming exam how you are thinking about your capital ask and whether you have increased confidence in your ability to maybe raise your payout target a bit biff bowman chief financial officer yes so we re pleased to enter this cycle that we just submitted here in april from a position of real strength as you could see from our ratio and the flexibility that that gives us entering that period of time the slr was not a binding constraint for us so that changed in definition while we will take regulatory definitions that end up easing the ratio for us in that case it wasn t a binding constraint so i pull back on that what i would say is in the quarter i think we had a payout ratio of 119 in the quarter that we cited so i think in the environment we re in we don t feel constrained with what we want to ask other than our own constraints which are do we have enough capital to support the growth we foresee in the business do we have enough capital to withstand our own idiosyncratic stresses do we have enough capital to support our clients needs and wants and i think the answer to that with where we are currently positioned is a pretty strong yes with a 13 cet1 so again we like the flexibility that gives us going into the review by our regulators steven chubak wolfe research analyst thanks for taking my questions operator next question will be from brennan hawken with ubs brennan hawken ubs analyst good morning i think she just said my name ok thanks so the c is fee rate saw a bit of a balance here this quarter and i know this is an imperfect way to model your servicing revenues but it s the best we ve got so could you maybe help us i know that you flagged new business wins this quarter and so i m guessing that contributed to some of that servicing fee rate improvement is that right and then were there other factors can you just help us sort of level set given that this is the way most of us model your servicing revs and how to think about that line from here mark bette director of investor relations it s mark i would say as we look at the asset servicing fees on a sequential basis there was certainly the market drag mainly from both month lag and quarter lag we re probably looking at about a 2 to 2 5 drag from markets and then currencies were actually modestly better but very little so really the new business that we saw on the fee side would have been kind of offsetting that because the fees were basically flat during the quarter so pretty strong on the new business side i mean it does become a function of the business that we re adding i would say that we are going to look at the mix of business that we re adding these days we probably are from a fee bid rate perspective that new business is probably coming on at a higher level than what a traditional custody would be for instance and some of the moves that we ve seen large moves on a year over year basis where there has been we talked about one transition last quarter would have been at a lower bid rate than what we re saying we re bringing on new global fund servicing business so it kind of comes back to the mix of what s coming on and then kind of how the point in time assets look versus the fees that you kind of earn kind of as you go through the quarter brennan hawken ubs analyst yes ok that makes a lot of sense mark and then next one is on nii and some of the comments that you ve made here so far and this is sort of a cleanup so i m kind of dumping a couple of cleanups in here into one when we think about i think you said that there was one large outflow with the noninterest bearing that you still think nonoperating is one to two so was some of the outflow from the nonoperating and just so we can kind of think about that or was this more competitive pressure and then given the fact that you still think and nim can grind higher and your deposits can grow that seems to suggest that you guys feel pretty good about nii growth from 1q as a starting point is that fair or do we need to be concerned about upward pressure on deposit costs biff bowman chief financial officer let me take the second question first on the upward pressure that is a competitive dynamic i think we feel that we have stayed abreast of the market and that we have competitive pricing in the institutional space today but we have to observe the market and i mean that as you know there s sort of very public our clients probably are aware of the market pricing from a relatively small number of competitors and so that pricing is pretty transparent particularly on the institutional side so we ll remain competitive is all i can say and there s not upward pressure from others than i think on the deposit pricing there and the first question was on the mark bette director of investor relations on the decline in noninterest bearing and on that i mean this was a situation where a client was seeking other yield enhancement on that money but i would also add that of the decline so call that half of a decline there was also a decline that we saw about one third of the decline was not in u s dollar currency it was actually in nonmajor currency around the world so those were probably just more transactional frictions that those clients have kind of moving through the system not necessarily an indicator of future trends because that wasn t part of some of the fee revs dollars looking for higher yields brennan hawken ubs analyst ok great thanks so much for the call operator next question will be from brian bedell from deutsche bank brian bedell deutsche bank analyst great thanks very much hi good morning let me just go back to the organic growth trends so just especially in the custody and fund admin business looks like we should have a decent tailwind coming into the second quarter both on a markets basis but also if you can just comment on the cadence of organic growth it looked like you said very strong if that came in during the quarter so we also have a little bit of a fee tailwind from that and then to add onto that maybe if you can talk about your front to back office integration the open architecture approach i know it s counter to state street i think you have a partnership with bloomberg i guess how new is that effort and should we expect that to be something that can enhance your organic growth over time biff bowman chief financial officer sure let me do the organic growth part first i must split the businesses apart here if i could real quick yes we ve talked as a firm of the range that we re comfortable with from an organic growth perspective in any given quarter we can be in that range slightly lower slightly higher but then our businesses themselves can have different trajectories as well our wealth business as i said actually i think saw organic trajectory at a higher end of its historical range but that s lower than what we talked to you about target it s a slightly lower organic growth business and our c is business if you exclude securities lending which is heavily capital markets influenced also was in the range that we ve talked about for that business from an organic growth standpoint it s hard to ignore the securities lending and asset management businesses but if you peel those out we were in the organic kind of growth rate from a pure asset servicing business that we ve seen so that was a strength there in terms of the value chain or our positioning what i would say is we don t believe we have to own every piece of the value chain an example is an oms an order management system it s i think it s our goal is to allow our clients to access our technology and allow them to communicate and process their trades in an efficient manner it s a competitive landscape in the oms space and there s some very good providers out there so we think being able to partner and integrate with those vendors is very important we do have a relationship as we highlighted in our press release at the end of march with bloomberg where we re doing just that but that s an example of a very important vendor in the space that we ve struck out a strategic partnership with and can bring there to bear so i would say at the end of the day we believe very much that we don t have to bring every piece of that component of the value chain and own it all the way through that we can partner with some best in class providers in different spaces and make it work brian bedell deutsche bank analyst no that s great color and then just maybe just one on expense growth looking at the year over year basis if i m measuring this right looks like about 3 3 5 which would be tracking below your organic i believe correct me if i m wrong but maybe slightly below your organic growth rate on a year over year basis so is that mostly due to value for spend program coming through because i know you ve tried to match that expense growth i know it can t be on every quarter but would generally sound like you re tracking very well against that goal biff bowman chief financial officer so what i would say is in all transparency and candor that that growth rate is a little higher than that on an organic basis because we have some currency benefits mark bette director of investor relations about 4 5 biff bowman chief financial officer yes so call it 4 5 type of a growth rate which is in the range of where we ve talked about organic fee growth rate so i think they re reasonably well aligned we d like to get that organic growth rate and the expenses down a little lower so we created leverage to what we ve talked about but in full transparency the reported number had some currency benefit in it obviously fees have some currency drag equal and offsetting to that but we would have probably pinned it somewhere in the 4 5 type range from the quarter on an organic expense growth rate brian bedell deutsche bank analyst great thanks so much operator next question will come from jim mitchell with buckingham research jim mitchell buckingham research analyst hey good morning guys maybe just a follow up on wealth management you noted that you re at the high end of the organic growth range i know you ve been investing there to try to accelerate organic growth is that sort of early evidence that you re getting success and maybe just talk a little bit more broadly about what you re doing to drive better organic growth there and what you think the traction is so far biff bowman chief financial officer yes so i would i d pick a couple of components to that one i think the technology that underpins that the goals powered solutions and the approach to the holistic advice so the goals driven wealth management has really resonated with our clients we ve really seen that be a differentiator in the market and we ve been told that consistently by our clients and other setters of influence that influence the wealthy individuals that we have a differentiated technology to bring to bear for people so i think that s been really successful and the other thing i would say is we ve done a good job of attracting clients in what i will call our virtual markets as you know we ve got physical offices and about 60 locations in most of the wealth centers around the country but there are other cities where we don t have necessarily physical presence and we ve been able to create i ll call a virtual team type environment and really penetrate some i don t want to say secondary cities but cities that aren t in the major metropolitan wealth centers but still have significant wealth without having to put physical footprints in it s been a really successful strategy that s two examples of really strong growth that are i think pushing us up toward a pretty significant organic growth rate relative to the industry in wealth management jim mitchell buckingham research analyst ok that s helpful and maybe one other question on deposit betas it seemed like this quarter at least on an aggregate level your deposit beta has actually slowed versus the last three or four quarters i think some of your peers are mentioning accelerating deposit betas and high competition so just trying to get a sense of maybe the difference that you re seeing are you seeing that competitive pressure on deposit rates it doesn t look like it just maybe talk to the deposit beta this quarter and where you think if anything s changed going into 2q biff bowman chief financial officer yes i caution you to look at one quarter s beta we could be catching up slowing down from previous moves that we ve made i think if you go back and look at our beta across the cycle you would start with the right cycles and hikes and go back to 2016 if you want to go back our beta will look much more like you would expect across a longer horizon so i think it s a little bit dangerous to only look at it from one quarter because we like i said we could have slowed because we were comfortable with our positioning in a quarter or we could jim mitchell buckingham research analyst i think i lost you mark bette director of investor relations we d be about 75 ish probably percent beta and then lower than that obviously on the retail jim mitchell buckingham research analyst sorry i think my phone got cut out for half of your response i ll follow up later operator our next question will be from ken usdin with jefferies ken usdin jefferies analyst hey guys just a couple of quick follow ups cleanups i guess biff you mentioned earlier that the second quarter won t have the same stock based compensation that the year ago quarter had can you just tell us then again what was the magnitude of that a year ago and so how much will be absent this year relative to what was in last year mark bette director of investor relations ken it s mark we are having some audio difficulties on our end hopefully what we re saying is coming through but yes you re right so a couple of years you ll remember there was an extra expense that came through in the second quarter from the retirement eligible grants last year there was 11 million in the second quarter so we had 32 million in the first 11 million in the second a year ago this year we had 30 million in the first but there will not be further retirement eligible stock expense that would impact the second quarter because of the changes in the service requirements around the performance shares so 11 million during the second quarter of last year but this year we would not have that ken usdin jefferies analyst got it that s a nice year over year starting point helper and then second one on the deposits biff you mentioned that the customer related deposits should be growing with the growth of the business but obviously the balance sheet has been net shrinking because again of that removal of liquidity and how has the core deposits been growing underneath the surface and how can you help us like understand the inflows versus outflows in terms of trying to unguess and estimate when that total earning asset base starts to bottom and turn the corner upwards mark bette director of investor relations yes yes thanks so the answer is at the core and it s hard to see in any of the financials we put out there but i would say it s a general statement at the core we have seen that core operating balance has sort of flattened out it s hard to see like you said all the liquidity moving on and off the balance sheet so it can be difficult to see the other thing i would say too is when we say that the new business that we win comes with balances some of the wins we ve been having are administration in nature and they don t always come with balances so the mix of business we win matters too over time we tend to win a broad based mix of business some which come with custody balances some which come with administration i would say we had more wins in the large wins in the administrative side that may or may not come with balances it s one of the reasons you may see our auc and auc a a little bit flatter but revenue still going up and fees going up because the mix of that business is different because of the balance itself so you got the dynamic of the win mix matters and then you ve got the dynamic of the underlying balance sheet because that s what i would call the liquidity flows or the excess balances moving around you ve seen that in our competitors underneath the core operating deposits continue to be pretty stable ken usdin jefferies analyst ok thanks operator our next question will be from brian kleinhanzl and he s from brian kleinhanzl keefe bruyette and woods analyst just a couple of questions here you had mentioned you re taking a while a bit more duration in the securities portfolio can you actually give what the securities duration is now and still how much is tied direct repricing on a basis biff bowman chief financial officer so the duration of the portfolio has historically been closer to one and it moved up by 30 or something like that the long end of the securities portfolio is longer than that but of the portfolio has moved up by that 30 or so percent and the second part of your question broke up i apologize can you repeat mark bette director of investor relations i think it may have been the exposure to the 30 day rates within the year brian kleinhanzl keefe bruyette and woods analyst yes how much reprices in the next 30 mark bette director of investor relations yes so on the securities side the short end of the i should say if you split the securities portfolio in half a little bit more than half is the shorter portfolio and there we would say a lot of that would be driven by the one month three month type of libor moves with a little bit more weighted toward the one month side so it does that part of the securities must reprice pretty quickly and when you get to the longer portfolio obviously not all that is going to roll over in one quarter or even one year that s kind of over the course of if for instance if you re sitting with on average two year securities and even book in theory that means that one eighths of it would roll through every quarter that s not to say we re right but that s just an example of what you would have if you were staying with a two year book when you have the longer portfolio does that help we re having some audio problems here brian kleinhanzl keefe bruyette and woods analyst it does and then just a second quick follow up on the deposit runoff i think in the past you said that you ve been able to capture as much as two thirds of those deposits is that still is it now that s still true or is it a lot of that deposit runoff just running away from you in total biff bowman chief financial officer i think we ve said we ve captured about half of it can move into a money fund and then half to some other vehicle and investment vehicle somewhere else or would lead i don t know that i know if that s changed dramatically from what we ve seen so i think it is still we ve seen growth in our cash funds as you can see particularly on the institutional side when we saw growth in our cash funds so there s clearly a part moved in the cash funds from the balance sheet and we continue to look at a range of opportunities for both the balance sheet and cash funds so we ve been able to capture a meaningful portion through the company operator and i d now like to turn the call back over to our presenters for closing remarks mark bette director of investor relations thank you for joining us for the first quarter call and we look forward to talking to you again in july thank you operator duration 60 minutes call participants mark bette director of

everything to know about the april 8 eclipse in atlantic canada saltwire eclipse saltwire by saqib iqbal ahmed new york reuters the euro slumped to a 22 month low against the u s dollar on wednesday after a surprise drop in a leading indicator for economic activity in germany highlighted the divergence between economic data in the united states and the euro zone german business morale deteriorated in april bucking expectations for a small improvement as trade tensions hurt the industrial engine of europe s largest economy related stories the euro fell 0 68 to 1 1149 its lowest since june 2017 the common currency was on pace for its worst one day fall in about seven weeks the broader importance of the german data is that market participants had been hoping that the rebound in chinese monetary conditions in lending in china would help to boost demand for german exports and would lift spirits in the euro zone s core economies said karl schamotta director of foreign exchange strategy and structured products at cambridge global payments we are seeing successive prints that show that germans are not necessarily turning more positive here said schamotta the greenback has fared well in recent weeks supported by upbeat data the dollar is winning the reverse beauty contest said schamotta it s not necessarily that fundamentals of the u s are improving dramatically or anything like that but in relative terms u s markets are looking like attractive places to park capital he said the dollar index which measures the u s currency versus a basket of six major rivals was up 0 49 at 98 119 its highest since june 2017 investors will watch the release on friday of u s gross domestic product data for the first three months of 2019 for signs of whether the united states remains stronger than other leading economies the dollar was 0 38 higher against the japanese yen ahead of the conclusion on thursday of a two day rate review meeting where the japanese central bank is widely expected to keep monetary policy steady on wednesday the australian dollar fell 1 25 after weaker than expected australian inflation numbers heightened the prospect of an interest rate cut latin american currencies broadly softened against a robust dollar with the argentina s peso slid to its lowest level in more than two weeks the pound held at a two month low weighed down by the strong dollar and fading hopes of a breakthrough in brexit talks between the british government and the opposition the canadian dollar weakened against its u s counterpart to its lowest in nearly four months as investors raised bets on a bank of canada interest rate cut this year after the central bank slashed its economic growth outlook reporting by saqib iqbal ahmed editing by lisa shumaker
australian dollar is overwhelmingly the worst performing one today it suffers heavy selling after much weaker than expected cpi raises the chance of rba rate cut later this year new zealand dollar follows as second as rbnz is also expected to cut just probably earlier in may canadian dollar is the third weakest on anticipation that boc would drop tightening bias with today s rate decision statement on the other hand yen is the strongest one for today despite yesterday s strong rally in us stocks asian markets are generally weaker dollar follows as the second strongest one solid corporate earnings are reducing the chance of a fed cut at least sterling is the third weakest strongest for today while gbp usd breaks 1 2960 key support the pound is still range bound against euro and yen technically with today s steep decline aud usd is now likely resuming the decline from 0 7295 0 7003 support will be an immediate focus and we d expect a decisive break there to confirm near term bearishness similarly aud jpy is heading towards 77 44 equivalent support while eur aud is heading to 1 6122 equivalent resistance eur usd recovers well ahead of 1 1176 low but this level will remain the focus in near term usd cad breaches 1 3451 resistance and focus is immediately on 1 3467 firm break will resume rebound from 1 3068 towards 1 3664 high elsewhere at the time of writing nikkei is down 0 56 hong kong hsi is down 0 85 china shanghai sse is down 0 92 singapore strait times is up 0 21 japan 10 year jgb yield is down 0 0096 at 0 04 overnight dow closed up 0 55 s p 500 rose 0 88 nasdaq rose 1 32 10 year yield dropped 0 002 to 2 57 rejected by 2 6 handle again big downside surprise in australia cpi adds to case for rba cut australian dollar is sold off sharply after much weaker than expected consumer inflation data headline cpi rose 0 0 qoq 1 3 yoy in q1 down from 0 5 qoq 1 8 yoy missed expectation of 0 2 qoq 1 5 yoy the 1 3 annual rate is also the slowest since september 2016 rba trimmed mean cpi rose 0 3 qoq 1 6 yoy below expectation of 0 4 qoq 1 7 yoy annual rate is slowest since december 2016 rba weighted median cpi rose 0 1 qoq 1 2 yoy well below expectation of 0 4 qoq 1 6 yoy the weak inflation data heighten the prospect of rba rate cut in may together with rbnz but for now it still seems a bit early for rba to act given relative resilience in job data may is more an ideal occasion for rba to turn dovish with new economic projections and somp if it happens the case for a cut in august would be secured s p 500 and nasdaq closed at records no follow through in asia us stocks enjoyed strong rally overnight as boosted by solid corporate earnings from coca cola to twitter s p 500 and nasdaq closed at records of 2933 68 up 0 88 and 8120 82 up 1 32 respectively though they re both held below intraday highs dow also gained 0 55 to 26656 39 technically the strong momentum suggests that both s p 500 and nasdaq will easily take out intraday records at 2490 91 and 8133 30 that could likely pull dow upward to equivalent level at 26951 81 yet we re still not too convinced that the indices are in long term up trend resumption yet two developments give us some doubts over the underlying momentum of the global markets firstly asian markets are not following and with major indices except singapore strait times turned red after initial gains today secondly yen is the strongest one for the week so far while usd jpy is stuck in tight range only which isn t the usually development seen in strong risk on market thus there will be a lot of caution in the next move up us china trade talks to resume in beijing on apr 30 kudlow said cautiously optimistic but not there yet the white house announced that trade representative robert lighthizer and treasury secretary steven mnuchin will travel to beijing to on april 30 to continue trade talks china s team will again be led by vice premier liu he liu is expected to fly to washington on may 8 for additional discussions in the statement it s noted that the subjects of next week s discussions will cover trade issues including intellectual property forced technology transfer non tariff barriers agriculture services purchases and enforcement earlier yesterday larry kudlow director of the white house national economic council said the negotiations were making progress and he was cautiously optimistic on striking a deal he hailed that we ve come further and deeper broader larger scale than anything in the history of u s china trade but kudlow also noted that we re not there yet but we ve made a heck of a lot of progress we re still working on the issues so called structural issues technology transfers also ownership enforcement is absolutely crucial lowering barriers to buy and sell agriculture and industrial commodities it s all on the table boc to drop tightening bias or would it boc is widely expected to keep overnight rate unchanged at 1 75 today back in march the central bank has already shifted to a more cautious stance and noted outlook warrant a policy interest rate that is below its neutral range also given the mixed picture it will take time to gauge the persistence of below potential growth and the implications for the inflation outlook but after all tightening bias was maintained and there was just increased uncertainty about the timing of future rate increases since then data have been mixed headline cpi rose to 1 9 yoy in march sharply higher than february s 1 5 yoy core cpi also picked up slightly from 1 5 yoy to 1 6 yoy median cpi rose to 2 0 while trimmed mean cpi rose to 2 1 yoy job data remained resilient too however boc s business outlook survey bos disappointed with the overall business index falling to 0 6 in 1q19 the result pointed to a moderation from previously high levels of domestic and foreign demand for firms in most regions there are speculations that boc could totally drop tightening bias and indicate that rates will stay there for longer however the recent data might not be giving enough pressure for boc to do it also oil price has been in strong rally since wti bottomed at 42 05 last december the current picture with wti back above 65 is drastically different from that one in january thus the anticipated neutral shift is far from being certain boc will also release new economic projections today s announcement is a wild card some suggested readings elsewhere german ifo business climate will also be watched closely today ecb will release monthly bulletin uk will release public sector net borrowing aud usd daily outlook daily pivots s1 0 7075 p 0 7107 r1 0 7135 more aud usd s decline accelerates to as low as 0 7027 so far the strong break of 0 7052 support affirms the case of resumption of fall from 0 7295 intraday bias remains on the downside for 0 7003 support first break will confirm and target 100 projection of 0 7295 to 0 7003 from 0 7205 at 0 6913 decisive break there will indicate further downside acceleration on the upside above 0 7081 minor resistance will turn intraday bias neutral and bring consolidation before staging another fall in the bigger picture with 0 7393 key resistance intact medium term outlook remains bearish the decline from 0 8135 2018 high is seen as resuming long term down trend from 1 1079 2011 high decisive break of 0 6826 2016 low will confirm this bearish view and resume the down trend to 0 6008 2008 low however firm break of 0 7393 will argue that fall from 0 8135 has completed and corrective pattern from 0 6826 has started the third leg targeting 0 8135 again economic indicators update

good morning everyone let me join mark in welcoming you to our first quarter 2019 earnings conference call starting on page 2 of our quarterly earnings review presentation this morning we reported first quarter net income of 347 1 million earnings per share were 1 48 and our return on common equity was 14 advertisement advertisement as noted on the second page of our earnings release this quarter s results included 12 3 million of severance related and restructuring charges within expenses before going through our results in detail i would like to comment on some macro factors impacting our business during the quarter equity markets rebounded during the quarter following a challenging fourth quarter compared to the prior year the s p 500 ended the quarter up 7 3 while the msci eafe was unchanged on a sequential basis end of period markets were favorable with the s p 500 and the eafe indices increasing 13 1 and 9 6 respectively recall that some of our fees are based on lagged pricing and those comparisons are challenging both versus one year ago as well as sequentially on a month lag basis the s p 500 and eafe were down 2 6 and 9 on a year over year basis and down 4 7 and 4 1 sequentially on a quarter lag basis the s p 500 and eafe were down 6 2 and 13 4 on a year over year basis and down 14 and 12 5 sequentially u s short term interest rates were modestly higher in the quarter on average driven by the full quarter impact of the federal reserve december rate hike on a sequential basis average one month and three month libor increased 15 and 7 basis points respectively currency rates influenced the translation of non u s currencies to the u s dollar and therefore impact client assets and certain revenues and expenses the british pound and euro versus the u s dollar ended the quarter down 7 and 9 respectively compared to the prior year advertisement advertisement the year over year declines favorably impacted expense but had an unfavorable impact on revenue on a sequential basis the british pound ended the quarter up 2 while the euro declined 2 let s move to page 3 and review the financial highlights of the first quarter year over year revenue was flat with noninterest income down 3 and net interest income up 9 expenses increased 3 from last year the provision for credit losses was zero in the current quarter compared to a credit of 3 million one year ago net income was 9 lower year over year in the sequential comparison revenue declined 2 with noninterest income down 3 and net interest income flat expenses increased 1 compared to the prior year net income declined 15 sequentially return on average common equity was 14 for the quarter down from 16 one year ago and 17 from the prior quarter assets under custody and administration of 10 9 trillion increased 1 compared to one year ago and were up 8 on a sequential basis assets under custody of 8 2 trillion were also up 1 compared to one year ago and up 8 sequentially the year over year performance was primarily driven by favorable markets partially offset by the impact of unfavorable moves in currency exchange rates the sequential performance was primarily driven by favorable markets and new business assets under management were 1 2 trillion flat on a year over year basis and up 9 on a sequential basis advertisement advertisement the year over year performance reflect the higher markets and new business offset by lower period ending securities lending collateral the sequential increase was driven by higher markets and new business let s look at the results in greater detail starting with revenue on page 4 first quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was 1 5 billion flat compared to last year and down 2 sequentially trust investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were 929 million in the first quarter down 1 from both last year and the prior quarter foreign exchange trading income was 66 million in the first quarter down 16 year over year and down 15 sequentially both the year over year and sequential declines were driven by lower volatility as well as lower foreign exchange swap activity in our treasury function the sequential decline was also impacted by lower client volumes other noninterest income was 64 million in the first quarter down 16 compared to one year ago and down 15 sequentially the year over year decline was primarily due to lower security commissions and trading income higher visa related swap expense and lower miscellaneous income the sequential decline was due to a leasing gain recognized in the prior quarter as well as higher visa related swap expense net interest income which i will discuss in more detail later was 430 million in the first quarter increasing 9 year over year and flat sequentially let s look at the components of our trust and investment fees on page 5 for our corporate and institutional services business fees totaled 535 million in the first quarter and were down 2 year over year and flat on a sequential basis the translation impact of changes in currency rates reduced year over year c is fee growth by approximately 2 custody and fund administration fees the largest component of c is fees were 375 million and essentially flat on both the year over year and sequential basis advertisement advertisement the year over year performance was driven by new business partially offset by both unfavorable markets and an unfavorable currency translation on a sequential basis the impact of lower markets was mostly offset by new and favorable currency translation assets under custody and administration for c is clients were 10 2 trillion at quarter end up 1 year over year and up 8 sequentially the year over year performance was primarily driven by favorable markets partially offset by the impact of unfavorable moves in currency exchange rates the sequential performance was primarily driven by favorable markets and new business recall that lagged market values factor into the quarter s fees with both quarter lag and month lag markets impacting our c is custody and fund administration fees investment management fees in c is of 104 million in the first quarter were down 5 year over year and down 1 sequentially the year over year decline was primarily due to the impacts of unfavorable markets on a sequential basis the impact of lower markets was partially offset by new business assets under management for c is clients were 868 billion down 1 year over year and up 10 sequentially the year over year decline was driven by lower period end securities lending collateral mostly offset by favorable markets and new business the sequential growth was driven by favorable markets higher period end securities lending collateral and new business securities lending fees were 23 million in the first quarter down 13 year over year but up 5 sequentially the year over year decline was primarily driven by lower volumes while the sequential performance reflected slightly higher spreads securities lending collateral was 165 billion at quarter end and averaged 158 billion across the quarter average collateral levels declined 14 year over year and were flat sequentially advertisement advertisement moving to our wealth management business trust investment and other servicing fees were 394 million in the first quarter and were flat compared to the prior year and down 1 sequentially the year over year performance reflected the impact of new business offset by the impact of lower markets on a sequential basis the impact of lower markets was mostly offset by new business assets under management for wealth management clients were 294 billion at quarter end up 2 year over year and up 6 sequentially moving to page 6 net interest income was 430 million in the first quarter up 9 year over year earning assets averaged 111 billion in the first quarter down 4 from the prior year total deposits averaged 91 billion and were down 7 year over year interest bearing deposits declined 3 from one year ago to 74 billion noninterest bearing deposits which averaged 18 billion during the quarter were down 19 from one year ago loan balances averaged 31 billion in the first quarter and were down 4 compared to one year ago the net interest margin was 1 58 in the first quarter and was up 20 basis points from a year ago the improvement in the net interest margin compared to the prior year primarily reflects the impact of higher short term interest rates and a balance sheet mix shift on a sequential quarter basis net interest income was flat average earning assets declined 1 on a sequential basis as deposit levels declined 2 from the prior quarter advertisement advertisement on a sequential basis the net interest margin increased 6 basis points due to the favorable impact of higher short term rates as we have discussed in our most recent quarters we did continue to see the opportunity for foreign exchange swap activity within our treasury function this activity has the impact of reducing our interest income relating to central bank deposits as we swap out of u s dollars but increase our level of foreign exchange trading income for this quarter we saw additional foreign exchange trading income of 13 million offset by 10 million less in net interest income looking at the currency mix of our balance sheet for the first quarter u s dollar deposits represented 69 of our total deposits this is equal to one year ago and down from 70 in the prior quarter turning to page 7 expenses were 1 billion in the first quarter and were 3 higher than the prior year and up 1 sequentially as previously mentioned the current quarter included 12 3 million in expense associated with severance and other charges for comparison purposes note that the prior year and prior quarter included 8 6 million and 5 7 million in severance and other related charges respectively excluding the called out charges expense for the current quarter was up 3 from one year ago with respect to the remaining increase in year over year expense growth the following items were key drivers within the categories compensation was higher primarily driven by base pay adjustments within salaries which were effective in april of 2018 the impact of staff growth on salaries was more than offset by staff actions and our ongoing location strategy efforts advertisement advertisement employee benefits were lower compared to last year primarily due to lower medical expense as well as lower retirement plan costs outside service costs were higher driven by increased technical services and higher levels of legal and consulting costs partially offset by lower third party advisor fees and lower subcustodian expense equipment and software expense was up year over year mainly due to higher software related spend other operating expenses were up from the prior year due to higher staff related business promotion and other miscellaneous expenses partially offset by lower fdic expense shifting to the sequential expense view including the expense charges in both the current and prior quarter expenses were flat compared to the prior quarter compensation expense increased primarily reflecting the higher expenses related to long term performance based incentive compensation due to divesting provisions associated with grants to retirement eligible employees in the current quarter this quarter s compensation included 30 million in expense associated with retirement eligible staff it is worth noting due to changes in service requirements associated with performance share compensation there will no longer be an additional component of the retirement eligible expense impacting the second quarter as we have seen occur over the previous two years employee benefits declined sequentially primarily due to lower medical and retirement plan costs partially offset by higher payroll tax withholding outside services declined sequentially due to lower third party advisor fees and consulting costs the sequential decline in equipment software costs is primarily due to a prior quarter software related charge other operating expense declined 16 million from the prior period driven by lower business promotional expense as well as lower sequential costs associated with account servicing activities and other miscellaneous expenses staff levels increased approximately 5 year over year and 2 sequentially the staff growth was all attributable to staff increases in lower cost locations which include india manila limerick ireland and tempe arizona partially offset by reductions within our higher cost locations turning to page 8 as we have discussed on previous calls through our value for spend initiative we are realigning our expense base with the goal of realizing 250 million in expense run rate savings by 2020 we continue to embed a sustainable expense management approach we expect these efforts to slow our expense growth to be more closely aligned with our organic fee growth our first quarter results reflect approximately 45 million in expense savings reducing the year over year expense growth rate by approximately three points this would equate to just under 180 million on an annualized basis against the 250 million goal we continue to cultivate a healthy pipeline of opportunities turning to page 9 a key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability and returns this slide reflects the progress we have made in recent years to improve the expense to fee ratio pre tax margin and ultimately our return on equity the ratio of expense to fee is a particularly important measure of our progress as it addresses what we can most directly control while this quarter s ratio of 111 does demonstrate the impact that macroenvironment particularly lower equity markets can have we remain focused on continuing to drive organic growth in our business and managing our expense to improve our efficiency and productivity when we look at our results for this quarter absent the market impacts we would say that our expense to fee ratio was comparable to where we were tracking in the most recent quarters turning to page 10 our capital ratios remained strong with our common equity tier 1 ratio of 13 5 under the advanced approach and 13 under the standardized approach the supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation was 7 2 and at the bank was 6 6 both of which exceeded the 3 requirement that became applicable to northern trust effective at the start of 2018 with respect to the liquidity coverage ratio northern trust is above the applicable 100 minimum requirement as northern trust progresses through fully phased in basel iii implementation there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final basel iii rules during the quarter we increased our quarterly dividend from 0 55 to 0 60 representing a 9 sequential increase and a 43 increase on a year over year basis during the quarter we also repurchased more than 2 8 million shares of common stock at a cost of 257 million in closing despite the challenging backdrop from the impact of lagged equity markets and flatter interest rates our performance during the quarter was resilient generating return on average common equity of 14 our balanced business model continued to generate organic growth with each of our client facing reporting segments of c is and wealth management contributing approximately 50 of our earnings we are confident in our competitive positioning within attractive markets and our ability to continue to generate organic growth our focus remains on providing our clients with exceptional services improving our productivity and driving profitable growth before i conclude as is customary for our first quarter earnings call we will need to end today s call a bit earlier than in other quarters to allow sufficient time for all of us to get to our annual meeting which begins at 10 30 a m central time this morning please accept our apologies in the event that we have to close off the question and answer period earlier than our normal practice thank you again for participating in northern trust s first quarter earnings conference call today mark and i would be happy to answer your questions carrie please open the line questions and answers operator and our first question will come from betsy graseck from morgan stanley betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst hi good morning thanks so much for the update i just wanted to understand as you re thinking through the operating levers that you delivered on this quarter was there anything unusual in the expense line i know you called out a couple of items but then the follow on is as you re thinking through 2q and 3q can we expect the same kind of run rate that you delivered in 1q biff bowman chief financial officer so other than the charges that we called out in the expense lines i would say it was pretty much expenses as normal so pretty much core run rate in our expenses mark bette director of investor relations we did have a higher retirement eligible impact and compensation of 30 million in the first quarter but some of the other spend like business promo is sometimes a little bit lower in the first quarter too but all are pretty clean biff bowman chief financial officer yes and we have the compensation expense in every first quarter which you can see flow through but the rest of the other line items i think were pretty much as reported betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst i know you don t give guidance specifically i m not asking for that i m just wondering the run rate that you re seeing in 1q do you think that kind of pace is something you can continue with or is there any kind of investment spend that you d be ramping up on the back of this for 1q biff bowman chief financial officer well we continue to focus on our value for spend initiatives and to try to drive our expense base as hard as we can but we also are growing as you could see and when you strip out the impacts of markets it was pretty good underlying growth again in the quarter so there is some expense that comes with supporting that growth but i d say in general we think that the trajectory you saw here is something that we re going to is a decent run rate and that we re going to continue to try to improve it with our value for spend initiatives but i think it s a pretty good run rate operator our next question will be from alex blostein from goldman sachs alex blostein goldman sachs analyst hey guys good morning so i know you obviously don t give i know you guys don t give guidance obviously but i was hoping we can talk through some of the nir dynamics as a jumping off point from here so i guess one noninterest bearing deposits down a little bit over 1 billion i think as you talked about in the past you thought that kind of that excess number was sort of in that 1 billion range so should we be thinking of that being sort of done or do you guys think there s more to go and broadly speaking is there anything you guys can do from a kind of firm specific idiosyncratic perspective to protect the level of nir from here or is this pretty much kind of peak nir for you guys biff bowman chief financial officer so let me walk through without providing guidance the way we re thinking about it the first alex is the volume of the balance sheet and the thing we feel we can control most on the volume is through the continued organic growth in our custody business primarily our auc which produces that growth in the balance sheet and we ve had pretty good results there and we think if we can continue to do that that the balance sheet should continue to grow with that inherent growth that we talk about in our custody business as it relates to noninterest bearing deposits that you talked about in this quarter and we talked to the past about that pool of a couple billion i think we ve used is that of that runoff in noninterest bearing deposits this quarter half of it was from one client so we still do have some sizable lumpy type deposits that could be yield seeking but we think it s inside the bucket that we told you in the past the 1 billion to 2 billion of the noninterest bearing so we can control the volume the second part of the forward look if you will without guidance is the mix what we ve seen in the mix of the balance sheet is we have seen interest bearing deposits move from about 78 of the balance sheet to 80 so that s a trend i think that s a trend that we see in our industry among our competitors and i think that s a market dynamic so i m not sure how much is controllable there but we continue to look at that and then the last piece that we still focus on is the spread or the yield that we can get from that and i ll break that a little bit apart on the asset side look we re still asset sensitive as a firm and so it breaks sort of flat now from here there is still the ability to have assets repriced higher for us so that is a positive based on where we are but then the liability side the deposit beta and the pricing in the market is something we have to watch from a competitive dynamic and i think we ve been disciplined and we have a good process to watch that and if we think it flattens out from here with no rate movements on the horizon then there might still be the ability to grind up a little bit on the nim over time that s where we are there s a lot of ifs in there but if pricing in the competitive landscape holds stead we still think we could see a grind up on the nim alex blostein goldman sachs analyst got it that s helpful and then my second question around just the core fees i mean looks like custody and admin fees in particular came in quite strong relative to a challenging exit as of the end of last year i know you guys highlighted new business so maybe expand on that a little bit was this a quarter of outsized new business wins that sort of drove fees where we ended up obviously being for the quarter without obviously naming clients but maybe you can just help us kind of characterize where some of that business is coming from biff bowman chief financial officer yes we continue to see a strong pipeline across both of our businesses both c is and wealth then both produced particularly versus first quarter of the previous year strong performances in fact our c is business produced a really strong year over year comparison to the first quarter of last year on the new business front and we continue to see a broad range of wins both geographically product line client types in both sides in fact on the wealth side our organic growth rate was at the higher end of the range as we ve talked about as well in the first quarter so pretty strong new business momentum and then obviously the markets and others in the first quarter came back and we have obviously some lag impacts but we also have some month lag impacts and so we saw the benefit of rising markets alex blostein goldman sachs analyst awesome thanks for that operator our next question will be from michael carrier with bank of america merrill lynch michael carrier bank of america merrill lynch analyst all right thanks good morning biff maybe some of the expenses given that you re at the 180 million the 250 million how should we be thinking about timing i think you guys said through 2020 but are there any like initiatives in place that we should see some steps along the way as we get into 2020 biff bowman chief financial officer yes so we ve said the 250 million we re continuing to push forward on that and make a good progress as you can see what i would say is that we re trying to build in the dna and the culture here is that ongoing expense savings has to be a part of our regular routine so while we ve got a program defined that s 250 million we also know that we have to embed culturally the ability to go in there and create economic savings from an expense standpoint on a longer term basis than just 2020 we ve got a program we ll define it by 2020 but that discipline of taking some of the inflationary pressures out of our business through strong expense initiatives is embedding and we can see it and it s becoming part of the culture so we ll continue to track to the 250 million that we ve told you about but i think more importantly is embedding that discipline for forward looking years beyond 2020 michael carrier bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok and then just and the follow up too on the last question in terms of the organic growth and even the fees you tend to hold up or continue to hold up better than some of the peers out there and maybe if you can just provide some color on some of the wins that you re seeing maybe whether it s like asset mix the client mix just trying to get some color particularly on the c is side and how much from like a competitive fee standpoint are you seeing versus maybe the mix the product that continues to maybe hold up better than the industry biff bowman chief financial officer yes so let me pull it apart a little bit on the c is side i would say first let s take some regional we ve seen strong growth in our australia market where we ve moved up near the top portion of the league tables i was just talking with pete cherecwich before i came in so we re near the top of the league charts there in our growth from a geographical perspective there luxembourg is another area with the ubs acquisition and other new business where we ve seen outsized geographic growth that s organic it s strong in the client type i d say let me highlight two we continue to do very well with hedge funds our acquisition and hedge fund services has allowed us to grow i think last year we cited and continues to see wins in the hedge fund space i think we had the largest hedge fund launch that was launched last year is a northern trust client we had a press release on that but we ve also done very well in the foundation in the endowment space is another example and we ve brought what i would say is a product and a capability there a front office solution for what i ll say a large in house pools of money which is commonly or typically done in a foundation or endowment so that s two examples of a client type and a geography where i think we re seeing outsized growth we ve got more of those we can highlight but we just have a strong performance right now in the growth in terms of the second part of your question and the competitive nature of the pricing look this is a competitive business as a bank for 34 years it s been a competitive business for 34 years i would say that we haven t seen it at least in our client mix the outsized versus normal which we would typically see somewhere a 1 5 to 2 type of fee pressures which we assume in our organic growth rate we had to overcome that we ve still seen that and i think that in our client mix that s what we ve seen i don t know that it s been higher than that right now but it s also not lower and it seems pretty constant michael carrier bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok thanks a lot operator our next question will be from steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak wolfe research analyst hi good morning so just wanted to unpack some of the remarks around the nii commentary and recognizing it s not a guidance but i was hoping you could speak to your appetite to maybe extend the duration of the balance sheet given some concerns over the next move could be a fed easing cycle and how we should think about against that backdrop maybe what the deposit trajectory could look like over the coming quarters if we are in a flat rate environment biff bowman chief financial officer well what we say typically here is that we have a process where we go through and look at our own internal projections for interest rates and then we make decisions of how to position the balance sheet i think it s fair to say that in the previous quarters we ve had some of the interest rate projections that i think are now being held more widely and we have extended the duration in particularly the long term portion of our securities portfolio so we have that thought process and we do take actions when we see that so that provides some protection against that down rate scenario what i would also say is that if it behaves as normal the deposit betas on a down rate cycle are typically pretty fast and pretty high and we would anticipate that being the case here too so depending on just how that rate curve move happens and shifts we could protect some of that spread and margin in a down rate scenario plus with some of the actions we ve taken on our asset sensitivity by adding the duration so we have contemplated that and i think we ve got a lot of views from our investment management firm and our own chief economists that have views on the rate trajectory so we take those all in and then make decisions on the overall alco asset liability policy steven chubak wolfe research analyst no it s very helpful color and just switching gears to the capital side you guys continue to run with best in class capital ratios i know you try to avoid deviating from some of your peers and try to manage to similar capital targets through the cycle just given some commentary from some of your trust bank peers about increased confidence given some upcoming changes to leverage ratio as well as what appears to be maybe a more benign cash than in the coming exam how you are thinking about your capital ask and whether you have increased confidence in your ability to maybe raise your payout target a bit biff bowman chief financial officer yes so we re pleased to enter this cycle that we just submitted here in april from a position of real strength as you could see from our ratio and the flexibility that that gives us entering that period of time the slr was not a binding constraint for us so that changed in definition while we will take regulatory definitions that end up easing the ratio for us in that case it wasn t a binding constraint so i pull back on that what i would say is in the quarter i think we had a payout ratio of 119 in the quarter that we cited so i think in the environment we re in we don t feel constrained with what we want to ask other than our own constraints which are do we have enough capital to support the growth we foresee in the business do we have enough capital to withstand our own idiosyncratic stresses do we have enough capital to support our clients needs and wants and i think the answer to that with where we are currently positioned is a pretty strong yes with a 13 cet1 so again we like the flexibility that gives us going into the review by our regulators steven chubak wolfe research analyst thanks for taking my questions operator next question will be from brennan hawken with ubs brennan hawken ubs analyst good morning i think she just said my name ok thanks so the c is fee rate saw a bit of a balance here this quarter and i know this is an imperfect way to model your servicing revenues but it s the best we ve got so could you maybe help us i know that you flagged new business wins this quarter and so i m guessing that contributed to some of that servicing fee rate improvement is that right and then were there other factors can you just help us sort of level set given that this is the way most of us model your servicing revs and how to think about that line from here mark bette director of investor relations it s mark i would say as we look at the asset servicing fees on a sequential basis there was certainly the market drag mainly from both month lag and quarter lag we re probably looking at about a 2 to 2 5 drag from markets and then currencies were actually modestly better but very little so really the new business that we saw on the fee side would have been kind of offsetting that because the fees were basically flat during the quarter so pretty strong on the new business side i mean it does become a function of the business that we re adding i would say that we are going to look at the mix of business that we re adding these days we probably are from a fee bid rate perspective that new business is probably coming on at a higher level than what a traditional custody would be for instance and some of the moves that we ve seen large moves on a year over year basis where there has been we talked about one transition last quarter would have been at a lower bid rate than what we re saying we re bringing on new global fund servicing business so it kind of comes back to the mix of what s coming on and then kind of how the point in time assets look versus the fees that you kind of earn kind of as you go through the quarter brennan hawken ubs analyst yes ok that makes a lot of sense mark and then next one is on nii and some of the comments that you ve made here so far and this is sort of a cleanup so i m kind of dumping a couple of cleanups in here into one when we think about i think you said that there was one large outflow with the noninterest bearing that you still think nonoperating is one to two so was some of the outflow from the nonoperating and just so we can kind of think about that or was this more competitive pressure and then given the fact that you still think and nim can grind higher and your deposits can grow that seems to suggest that you guys feel pretty good about nii growth from 1q as a starting point is that fair or do we need to be concerned about upward pressure on deposit costs biff bowman chief financial officer let me take the second question first on the upward pressure that is a competitive dynamic i think we feel that we have stayed abreast of the market and that we have competitive pricing in the institutional space today but we have to observe the market and i mean that as you know there s sort of very public our clients probably are aware of the market pricing from a relatively small number of competitors and so that pricing is pretty transparent particularly on the institutional side so we ll remain competitive is all i can say and there s not upward pressure from others than i think on the deposit pricing there and the first question was on the mark bette director of investor relations on the decline in noninterest bearing and on that i mean this was a situation where a client was seeking other yield enhancement on that money but i would also add that of the decline so call that half of a decline there was also a decline that we saw about one third of the decline was not in u s dollar currency it was actually in nonmajor currency around the world so those were probably just more transactional frictions that those clients have kind of moving through the system not necessarily an indicator of future trends because that wasn t part of some of the fee revs dollars looking for higher yields brennan hawken ubs analyst ok great thanks so much for the call operator next question will be from brian bedell from deutsche bank brian bedell deutsche bank analyst great thanks very much hi good morning let me just go back to the organic growth trends so just especially in the custody and fund admin business looks like we should have a decent tailwind coming into the second quarter both on a markets basis but also if you can just comment on the cadence of organic growth it looked like you said very strong if that came in during the quarter so we also have a little bit of a fee tailwind from that and then to add onto that maybe if you can talk about your front to back office integration the open architecture approach i know it s counter to state street i think you have a partnership with bloomberg i guess how new is that effort and should we expect that to be something that can enhance your organic growth over time biff bowman chief financial officer sure let me do the organic growth part first i must split the businesses apart here if i could real quick yes we ve talked as a firm of the range that we re comfortable with from an organic growth perspective in any given quarter we can be in that range slightly lower slightly higher but then our businesses themselves can have different trajectories as well our wealth business as i said actually i think saw organic trajectory at a higher end of its historical range but that s lower than what we talked to you about target it s a slightly lower organic growth business and our c is business if you exclude securities lending which is heavily capital markets influenced also was in the range that we ve talked about for that business from an organic growth standpoint it s hard to ignore the securities lending and asset management businesses but if you peel those out we were in the organic kind of growth rate from a pure asset servicing business that we ve seen so that was a strength there in terms of the value chain or our positioning what i would say is we don t believe we have to own every piece of the value chain an example is an oms an order management system it s i think it s our goal is to allow our clients to access our technology and allow them to communicate and process their trades in an efficient manner it s a competitive landscape in the oms space and there s some very good providers out there so we think being able to partner and integrate with those vendors is very important we do have a relationship as we highlighted in our press release at the end of march with bloomberg where we re doing just that but that s an example of a very important vendor in the space that we ve struck out a strategic partnership with and can bring there to bear so i would say at the end of the day we believe very much that we don t have to bring every piece of that component of the value chain and own it all the way through that we can partner with some best in class providers in different spaces and make it work brian bedell deutsche bank analyst no that s great color and then just maybe just one on expense growth looking at the year over year basis if i m measuring this right looks like about 3 3 5 which would be tracking below your organic i believe correct me if i m wrong but maybe slightly below your organic growth rate on a year over year basis so is that mostly due to value for spend program coming through because i know you ve tried to match that expense growth i know it can t be on every quarter but would generally sound like you re tracking very well against that goal biff bowman chief financial officer so what i would say is in all transparency and candor that that growth rate is a little higher than that on an organic basis because we have some currency benefits mark bette director of investor relations about 4 5 biff bowman chief financial officer yes so call it 4 5 type of a growth rate which is in the range of where we ve talked about organic fee growth rate so i think they re reasonably well aligned we d like to get that organic growth rate and the expenses down a little lower so we created leverage to what we ve talked about but in full transparency the reported number had some currency benefit in it obviously fees have some currency drag equal and offsetting to that but we would have probably pinned it somewhere in the 4 5 type range from the quarter on an organic expense growth rate brian bedell deutsche bank analyst great thanks so much operator next question will come from jim mitchell with buckingham research jim mitchell buckingham research analyst hey good morning guys maybe just a follow up on wealth management you noted that you re at the high end of the organic growth range i know you ve been investing there to try to accelerate organic growth is that sort of early evidence that you re getting success and maybe just talk a little bit more broadly about what you re doing to drive better organic growth there and what you think the traction is so far biff bowman chief financial officer yes so i would i d pick a couple of components to that one i think the technology that underpins that the goals powered solutions and the approach to the holistic advice so the goals driven wealth management has really resonated with our clients we ve really seen that be a differentiator in the market and we ve been told that consistently by our clients and other setters of influence that influence the wealthy individuals that we have a differentiated technology to bring to bear for people so i think that s been really successful and the other thing i would say is we ve done a good job of attracting clients in what i will call our virtual markets as you know we ve got physical offices and about 60 locations in most of the wealth centers around the country but there are other cities where we don t have necessarily physical presence and we ve been able to create i ll call a virtual team type environment and really penetrate some i don t want to say secondary cities but cities that aren t in the major metropolitan wealth centers but still have significant wealth without having to put physical footprints in it s been a really successful strategy that s two examples of really strong growth that are i think pushing us up toward a pretty significant organic growth rate relative to the industry in wealth management jim mitchell buckingham research analyst ok that s helpful and maybe one other question on deposit betas it seemed like this quarter at least on an aggregate level your deposit beta has actually slowed versus the last three or four quarters i think some of your peers are mentioning accelerating deposit betas and high competition so just trying to get a sense of maybe the difference that you re seeing are you seeing that competitive pressure on deposit rates it doesn t look like it just maybe talk to the deposit beta this quarter and where you think if anything s changed going into 2q biff bowman chief financial officer yes i caution you to look at one quarter s beta we could be catching up slowing down from previous moves that we ve made i think if you go back and look at our beta across the cycle you would start with the right cycles and hikes and go back to 2016 if you want to go back our beta will look much more like you would expect across a longer horizon so i think it s a little bit dangerous to only look at it from one quarter because we like i said we could have slowed because we were comfortable with our positioning in a quarter or we could jim mitchell buckingham research analyst i think i lost you mark bette director of investor relations we d be about 75 ish probably percent beta and then lower than that obviously on the retail jim mitchell buckingham research analyst sorry i think my phone got cut out for half of your response i ll follow up later operator our next question will be from ken usdin with jefferies ken usdin jefferies analyst hey guys just a couple of quick follow ups cleanups i guess biff you mentioned earlier that the second quarter won t have the same stock based compensation that the year ago quarter had can you just tell us then again what was the magnitude of that a year ago and so how much will be absent this year relative to what was in last year mark bette director of investor relations ken it s mark we are having some audio difficulties on our end hopefully what we re saying is coming through but yes you re right so a couple of years you ll remember there was an extra expense that came through in the second quarter from the retirement eligible grants last year there was 11 million in the second quarter so we had 32 million in the first 11 million in the second a year ago this year we had 30 million in the first but there will not be further retirement eligible stock expense that would impact the second quarter because of the changes in the service requirements around the performance shares so 11 million during the second quarter of last year but this year we would not have that ken usdin jefferies analyst got it that s a nice year over year starting point helper and then second one on the deposits biff you mentioned that the customer related deposits should be growing with the growth of the business but obviously the balance sheet has been net shrinking because again of that removal of liquidity and how has the core deposits been growing underneath the surface and how can you help us like understand the inflows versus outflows in terms of trying to unguess and estimate when that total earning asset base starts to bottom and turn the corner upwards mark bette director of investor relations yes yes thanks so the answer is at the core and it s hard to see in any of the financials we put out there but i would say it s a general statement at the core we have seen that core operating balance has sort of flattened out it s hard to see like you said all the liquidity moving on and off the balance sheet so it can be difficult to see the other thing i would say too is when we say that the new business that we win comes with balances some of the wins we ve been having are administration in nature and they don t always come with balances so the mix of business we win matters too over time we tend to win a broad based mix of business some which come with custody balances some which come with administration i would say we had more wins in the large wins in the administrative side that may or may not come with balances it s one of the reasons you may see our auc and auc a a little bit flatter but revenue still going up and fees going up because the mix of that business is different because of the balance itself so you got the dynamic of the win mix matters and then you ve got the dynamic of the underlying balance sheet because that s what i would call the liquidity flows or the excess balances moving around you ve seen that in our competitors underneath the core operating deposits continue to be pretty stable ken usdin jefferies analyst ok thanks operator our next question will be from brian kleinhanzl and he s from brian kleinhanzl keefe bruyette and woods analyst just a couple of questions here you had mentioned you re taking a while a bit more duration in the securities portfolio can you actually give what the securities duration is now and still how much is tied direct repricing on a basis biff bowman chief financial officer so the duration of the portfolio has historically been closer to one and it moved up by 30 or something like that the long end of the securities portfolio is longer than that but of the portfolio has moved up by that 30 or so percent and the second part of your question broke up i apologize can you repeat mark bette director of investor relations i think it may have been the exposure to the 30 day rates within the year brian kleinhanzl keefe bruyette and woods analyst yes how much reprices in the next 30 mark bette director of investor relations yes so on the securities side the short end of the i should say if you split the securities portfolio in half a little bit more than half is the shorter portfolio and there we would say a lot of that would be driven by the one month three month type of libor moves with a little bit more weighted toward the one month side so it does that part of the securities must reprice pretty quickly and when you get to the longer portfolio obviously not all that is going to roll over in one quarter or even one year that s kind of over the course of if for instance if you re sitting with on average two year securities and even book in theory that means that one eighths of it would roll through every quarter that s not to say we re right but that s just an example of what you would have if you were staying with a two year book when you have the longer portfolio does that help we re having some audio problems here brian kleinhanzl keefe bruyette and woods analyst it does and then just a second quick follow up on the deposit runoff i think in the past you said that you ve been able to capture as much as two thirds of those deposits is that still is it now that s still true or is it a lot of that deposit runoff just running away from you in total biff bowman chief financial officer i think we ve said we ve captured about half of it can move into a money fund and then half to some other vehicle and investment vehicle somewhere else or would lead i don t know that i know if that s changed dramatically from what we ve seen so i think it is still we ve seen growth in our cash funds as you can see particularly on the institutional side when we saw growth in our cash funds so there s clearly a part moved in the cash funds from the balance sheet and we continue to look at a range of opportunities for both the balance sheet and cash funds so we ve been able to capture a meaningful portion through the company operator and i d now like to turn the call back over to our presenters for closing remarks mark bette director of investor relations thank you for joining us for the first quarter call and we look forward to talking to you again in july thank you operator duration 60 minutes call participants mark bette director of

expenses pre opening expenses for new hotels comments from mr luis barrios ceo of hoteles city express in an environment in which we observed a delay in the beginning of the business cycle in mexico we present our results for the first quarter of 2019 which are the product of a solid operation linked to the economic and geopolitical volatility and uncertainty of the country during the quarter we experienced two different moments that on average reflected a sub optimal performance in the quarter but with positive trends on the last weeks of it on one side in january and the first fifteen days of february our portfolio was negatively impacted by events such as the fuel shortage the deferment in government travel the number of layoffs at the end of 2018 and the pause in local investments which are the main sources of business in the markets where we are present on the other side in the last 45 days of the quarter we observed recovery dynamics to the point that during the last days of march our portfolio had double digit growth in revpar a trend that continues to date regionally our portfolio is favored by its geographical diversification the good performance of the north region of the country stands out with attractive market dynamics in markets such as tijuana mexicali monterrey and tampico likewise places like mexico city and guadalajara demonstrate the strength of our product to penetrate urban markets and obtain above average returns mainly through the city express plus brand as a counterbalance the bajío region presents operational weakness which we consider is primarily due to short term temporary effects such as the aforementioned fight against fuel theft and certain isolated events of insecurity that being said total income registered a growth of 5 while we reached an adjusted ebitda of approximately 220 million with the beginning of operation of more than 1 500 rooms in the last 12 months we consider that our inventory mainly composed by recently opened hotels is capable of absorbing incremental demand more than in a proportional way to the slowdown experienced at the start of 2019 based on this we continue focused on the fulfillment of our budget for effective rate growth announced in february 2019 with respect to our expansion plans we continue to progress steadily but cautiously to our 2019 development plan targets to date we have reached 151 hotels by opening 3 hotels out of the 17 projects we announced in february and staying in line with the development program we expect the opening of 14 more hotels in the coming months considering a risk return discrimination criteria our objective of openings in 2019 remains firm due to the strength of the markets in which we plan these openings despite this we remain cautious about the economic development in the coming months and we have an action plan in case of requiring cash preservation mechanisms for more than 16 years hoteles city express has profitably sailed several episodes of economic and political stress in mexico from the deep economic and the hospitality industry slowdown in 2008 2009 to the period of volatility derived from the renegotiation of the north american free trade agreement in 2015 to mention a few our company has experienced uncertain economic and geopolitical situations and has been able to capitalize on them we consider that although we are in a challenging but highly different reality from that of those moments the strength of our team our operational flexibility and the power of our product to penetrate new and current markets will be key elements to achieve our goals throughout the year goals that we are keeping intact thank you for your trust conference call details hoteles city express will host a conference call

quarterly reports or other forms filed or furnished with the sec at this time i will turn the call over to jim advertisement advertisement jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer thank you very much steve good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call today the 2019 season is off to a great start with all time high guest spending per cap and a record high active pass base first quarter revenue nearly reached our prior year record level even with the later opening of several of our parks due to the late april easter holiday placing us solidly on track to achieve our 10th consecutive record year story continues i m especially pleased with the tremendous ongoing success we ve achieved in selling our multi tiered membership program and associated membership dining plan we grew active memberships by more than 30 in 2018 and are continuing that strong momentum in 2019 at the beginning of this year we implemented dramatic changes in the operations at our front gate to build out membership sales centers and to expedite guest flow to these locations as a result we experienced significant in park membership growth for those parks that opened in march this program continues to be a key driver of our growth strategy providing a platform of recurring revenue at higher prices and the ability to further grow attendance as we expand our network of parks the power of our membership program was highlighted in the first quarter with our solid revenue performance despite this being our seasonally smallest quarter when most parks are closed you are likely aware that in early march we announced my decision to retire from six flags in the first quarter of 2020 i am extremely proud that our team has achieved nine consecutive years of record financial performance six flags continues to build upon its global leadership position and is strongly situated to continue its growth trajectory for years to come as i shared with you in 2016 it is my belief that many ceos stay in their roles too long i don t want to remain in this position so long that i potentially block opportunity for great leaders with innovative ideas from helping the company achieve its fullest potential i remain one of the company s largest shareholders and it is because of my strong belief that the company is so well positioned to execute our current strategy and continue its growth trajectory that i feel this is the right time for me to step down from what has been the most fun and rewarding role of my career we specifically announced my intention well in advance to ensure transparency to our shareholders and employees and to allow the board to conduct a thorough and deliberative search for a new ceo this should ensure that we find the best possible person to lead six flags following my retirement and to name a successor for my role as chairman of the board in the interim i will continue to deliver 100 of my energy to our company and fully expect us to deliver our 10th consecutive record year in 2019 i will now turn the call over to marshall who will share a few more details about our first quarter financial results marshall marshall barber chief financial officer advertisement advertisement thank you jim and hello to everyone on the call although q1 is difficult to compare to prior year due to easter holiday arriving later this year we had a strong start to 2019 and indicators point to a strong season ahead our active pass base was up 5 and guest spending per capita reached a new all time high due to strong membership unit sales higher prices of memberships and a higher number of members who have stayed with the membership program beyond their initial 12 month compulsory period our active pass base growth would have been stronger of our operating calendar had not shifted due to the easter holiday following three weeks later than last year most people purchase their membership or season pass shortly before visiting our parks so the later start to our operating calendars delayed many purchases into the second quarter despite the decrease in attendance resulted from the easter shift total revenue in the quarter was down less than 1 million primarily as a result of the higher guest spending per capita and an increase in revenue from international agreements which included revenue associated with our park in dubai continuation of the project in dubai has become unlikely so we ve recognized revenue up to the amount of cash received attendance in the quarter was down 8 or 189 000 guests to 2 2 million the easter shift accounted for a loss of approximately 200 000 visits in the quarter and as of today the attendance shift has been recovered total guest spending per capita increased 2 40 or 5 with admissions per capita up 2 34 or 8 from prior year and in park spending per capita up 0 06 the increase in admissions per capita resulted from higher post compulsory revenue from our membership program a higher mix of memberships in the base and ticket price increases at the small number of parks that were open deferred revenue of 178 million as of march 31st 2019 decreased 4 million or 2 from march 31st 2018 the decrease was primarily due to a higher mix of longer tenured members versus last year as well as lower past sales due to the later easter holiday recall that we recognize revenue equal to the monthly membership fee once the membership goes beyond it s initial 12 month compulsory period unlike season passes were the first year of a membership is 13 plus memberships no longer contribute to deferred revenue because of the different accounting per revenue and our increasing success in upselling our guest to memberships the company expects the deferred revenue growth will be immediate going forward as the growing number of members passed their initial commitment period moving to costs cash operating sg a expenses increased 12 million or 9 primarily driven by higher lease and other start up and rebranding costs from the five parts we acquired on june 1st 2018 excluding these extra costs our cash operating and sg a expenses increased less than inflation although we continue to face wage pressures in several markets due to increases in minimum wages and a tightening labor market as you can see from our success in 2018 and in the first quarter of 2019 we are working very hard to offset these increases across our large and diverse cost base as a result of our strong revenue growth and focus cost control we generated an ltm modified ebitda margin of nearly 40 because of that along with our disciplined approach to capital spending our modified ebitda less capex margin remains the best in the theme park industry by several hundred basis points advertisement advertisement net leverage at the end of the first quarter was 4 1 times adjusted ebitda which we expect will soon decline as the company generates higher levels of adjusted ebitda and cash flow given the recent improvement in the debt markets we decided to opportunistically refinance our bank credit facilities including increasing the amount of our term loan b from 584 million to 800 million and increasing our revolving credit facility from 250 million to 350 million we increased the size of our revolver in proportion to the growth of our company as we ve added eight new parts as part of our north american expansion strategy since we last refinanced our bank facilities in 2015 we used the net proceeds to fully pay down the prior revolver balance and held the rest is cash which will be available for general corporate purposes including share repurchases we have 232 million remaining under our board authorization for share repurchases and we ll continue to look for opportunities to repurchase shares using our strong cash flow and balance sheet we are in an excellent financial position with modest leverage high interest coverage and no debt maturities before 2024 together with the proven resilience of the regional theme park industry during an economic downturn we stand by our firm commitment to grow our dividend every year i feel great about our growth prospects and then we are very well positioned for yet another record year and now i ll turn the call back over to jim jim jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer advertisement advertisement thank you very much marshall innovation is in our dna and we continue to be recognized as the global leader in theme park ride attraction and technology innovation in addition to record breaking new rides we are also adding wi fi in every park a supercharge new six flags app online dining ordering and many other new and exciting benefits for our loyal guests in 2019 we will be introducing the best and most innovative lineup of new rides in the company s history including several world record or first of their kind rides max force a triple record breaking launch coaster at six flags great america with the fastest acceleration of any coaster in north america batman the ride a 4d free spin wing coaster and new dc comics themed area at six flags discovery kingdom the joker wild card the world s tallest and fastest pendulum ride at six flags fiesta texas and el diablo the world s largest loop coaster at six flags over texas and of course i can t forget west coast racers the world s first racing launch coaster at six flags magic mountain the undisputed roller coaster capital of the universe we are pleased to welcome our 26 park magic waters a beautiful water park located an hour from six flags great america in rockford the illinois we are already selling memberships and combo passes as we prepare the park to open in may we are also rebranding our acquired theme park in darien lake to six flags and three water parks to hurricane harbor our newly acquired water parks in houston and phoenix and our outdoor water park at our great escape resort in new york as part of the major expansion we are on our way to becoming the biggest water park operator in the world and i can see the day when hurricane harbor is as well known as the six flags brand the drivers of our business in 2019 are a continuation of the strategy we have successfully pursued over the last several years one upselling guests to our high value programs such as memberships while introducing use in every park and expanding our special events to increase capacity and grow attendance two implementing price increases in the mid single digits three growing in park spending especially by increasing penetration of our all season dining passes four actively pursuing our north american expansion strategy to grow our addressable market and realize synergies and five licensing our brands to partners outside of north america who will develop six flags branded parks as i said at the beginning of the call i am most excited about the incredible growth of a large recurring revenue base through our new tiered membership program and our all season dining pass membership program which provides opportunities to increase guest retention rates and spending together with our industry leading loyalty program and our world class marketing research capabilities these programs provide the means for us to build strong relationships with our guests learn what they value most and tailor our messaging and product offerings to their unique preferences we are launching new program and capabilities that allow us to upsell any guest of any ticket type to a membership or any membership to a higher tier this will make it easier than ever for every guest to obtain the best possible experience with a membership advertisement advertisement these membership programs taken together already represent approximately 20 of our guests spending revenues and we believe the upside here is tremendous membership is hot delivers higher pricing and margin and drives long term loyalty our strong momentum should ensure that an even more material percentage of our business comes from recurring revenues over the next decade we are geographically diverse and no one part represents more than 10 of annual attendance the vast majority of our guest live within driving distance of one of our parks and our north american expansion strategy actively supports building that expanding guest base for a very modest sum guests can come to any of our parks as many times as they like thus our membership and season pass offerings will continue to appeal to consumers in any economic environment our strong active pass base provides both a weather hedge and a powerful means to retain our customers through disciplined pricing and our ability to flexibly manage capital spending and expenses especially seasonal labor we can successfully drive shareholder value regardless of the economy our long term international opportunities remains compelling and we are positioning ourselves to participate in emerging markets for decades to come we have only begun to build out our international function expertise and realize the potential of this strategy as international licensing still only represents about 3 of our revenue in the next 10 years up to 1 billion people will enter the middle class and the vast majority of them will be in emerging markets like china and india where there is still very low penetration of theme parks we continue to work with our international partner in china meeting government officials to each of our three part complexes and we believe conditions in china has slowly begun to improve like virtually every theme park project in these markets we have experienced some opening delays but we should not lose sight of the fact that these short term delays and lumpy revenue patterns are not material in the context of the long term opportunity our current stock price in no way reflects the years of growth opportunities we have ahead of us and our strong financial performance over many years we have consistently delivered the highest growth rates and margins in the industry while increasing our dividend every year for the past 8 years and returning all excess cash to shareholders through share buybacks our dividend yield of more than 6 is among the highest in the us market we strongly believe that this price dislocation which has happened to almost every us company at some point is temporary we also believe that the answer from our perspective is to apply a laser focus on what we can control and that is staying true to our successful strategy and consistently delivering superior operations consequently as a team we re working diligently to deliver our 10th consecutive record year and driving the company toward achieving of our aspirational goal of 750 million of modified ebitda by 2021 at this time i m going to ask our operator zatanya to open the call up for any questions questions and answers operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of steve wieczynski with stifel advertisement advertisement steve wieczynski stifel analyst hey guys good morning jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer good morning steve steve wieczynski stifel analyst how are you jim jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer great steve wieczynski stifel analyst so jim can i ask you it s going to be somewhat of a personal question i know you addressed your retirement in your prepared remarks but i guess if i go back and i look at the last time you came out of so called retirement i think it was july of 2017 you mentioned your return was going to be a long term commitment i guess the question is when it s all said and done is it s 2 years to 2 5 years just i guess that doesn t really seem like long term so i guess i m getting at is why now maybe help us think about that a little bit more and then maybe also help us understand how the search process is going for your replacement and maybe some of the what are some of the characteristics you guys are looking for in your next ceo that d be helpful thanks advertisement advertisement jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer i think that s a fair question steve and i m happy to address that head on although there were probably three questions in there i ll tackle them one by one first in terms of my tenure as ceo i do want to reinforce that they really have been the most rewarding years of my career and i still have almost a year left in terms of what i need to do and what the company needs to do to ensure we deliver the 10th record year but when i retired in 2016 i talked then you may remember about about my belief that after a certain time in the ceo position it s important to start step aside and allow for new leadership new perspectives and i do still believe that and so your question then part two is why is it right now to make this announcement i think the most important thing is to ensure transparency and to provide the board with sufficient time to complete a thoughtful deliberative selection process so hence the end of february 2020 it s very important to me to ensure we do deliver that 10th consecutive year and i truly believe that timing is right because momentum at the company is very strong and i feel extremely confident about our long term future you ll remember that i am one of the company s largest shareholders and because of that it s very important to me that the company does well and we are very well positioned right now to execute our current strategy our company is in a strong position we ve had an unprecedented growth trajectory for years and we see a continuation of that growth trajectory into the future and i talked earlier steve about the five key initiatives but those initiatives from ticket yields to membership and season pass penetration in park revenue north american expansion and international all have legs for many years to come i truly believe that for most of those were in the second or third innings of this gain so i feel very good about where we are and the ability to make this transition now is appropriate and we can get someone excellent even better than me is the goal to step up and take over so in terms of the search itself a search firm has been hired it s spencer stuart they are assisting the board in evaluating both internal external candidates and at the same time the board not only will nominate a ceo but also a new chairman of the board that the target date is march 1st but the exact timing obviously will depend on you know exactly what happens with regard to that search we re very early in the process so there s still a long way to go and i promise that we ll give updates when there is material news to report but most important for me i love the company it s in my blood as i said i m one of the biggest shareholders and all investors including myself and by the way pretty much every full time employee at the company knows that i m going to devote 100 of my time my energy to the company to deliver the best results that we can get this year and to set the company up for decades of growth that s my goal and we re going to work very hard to get there so steve i apologize i know that was probably overly long answer to three and sort of individual questions you had but i wanted to make sure i addressed all of them advertisement advertisement steve wieczynski stifel analyst no that was great thank you very much and i apologize for the long winded question the second question will be a little bit shorter and it s around capital allocation and obviously you guys just refinanced your debt but i guess i want to understand why the lack of any share repurchases in the first quarter given where the share price was was that was that a function of having to wait until you ve got the debt refinanced or is it something else and then second maybe give us an update in terms of how you guys view the dividend at this point you addressed it a little bit in your prepared remarks but i think dividend protection right now is probably the biggest concern out there with the investors that we re talking to appreciate it thanks jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer right so let me set up and handover directly to marshall on the first part of the question and i think big picture in the first quarter we moved opportunistically on the refinancing because the market turned in our favor and so you re absolutely right in the way you described that as we re in a position where we knew we were going to do this so we are very cautious about what else we did and then marshall maybe you take part one and then shall i take the dividend marshall barber chief financial officer sure our policy as you know is to return all excess cash flow to shareholders in the form of our healthy growing dividend and also share repurchases since we build most of our cash over the summers the parks open and we do we build most of our rides in the spring we didn t purchase shares in q1 since emerging as a public company even 2010 we ve reduced our share count from 110 million shares to 84 million shares returning about 3 5 billion back to investors so that s the reason we didn t do anything in q1 but we ll continue to look for opportunities to repurchase shares using our strong cash flow and balance sheet as we move forward and start generating cash in 2019 jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer and then marshall you jump in if i miss anything with regard to the dividend but steve you know i think very well but a strong sustainable cash dividend is really an important part of our value proposition to shareholders and it is our goal and that remains unchanged to grow the dividend every year going forward as we have done successfully for the past eight years you may remember that last year we raised the annualized dividend to 3 28 a 17 increase over the same period in 2017 our dividend yield right now is very attractive and we remain committed to growing our dividend every year and to your point around the ability to cover it just as we ve done every single year and we did last year and we will do this year we re in a position to generate cash flow that exceeds our dividend payments and to continue that strongly into the future marshall did i miss anything marshall barber chief financial officer no i think it s maybe speaking a little bit to 2018 we our cash flow exceeded our dividend payments we were able to fully fund our capital spending at 9 of revenues we acquired five new parks and we had money to buy shares as well and if you think about it we are a growing company we grew 7 last year and we ve grown every year since 2010 and last year was a difficult year from a weather perspective so we firmly believe this year we re going to grow and will address the amount of dividend growth as we get to the end of the year jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer i think the other thing marshall maybe talk to this is from a tax perspective in terms of cash taxes the outlook is fairly positive for us going forward for several years right marshall barber chief financial officer yeah actually so this year we ll spend we ll pay about 30 million in cash taxes which is similar to 2018 in 2020 it will probably grow to 45 million to 50 million but again and then from 2021 to 2024 we ll have a tax yield of about 32 5 million of our earnings jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer so net of it is that we expect minimal federal taxes not just in as we had in 2018 but 2019 2020 and then it ramps up a little bit in 2021 so it s we re in a position where overall from a cash perspective we feel pretty comfortable with what we ve got and the commitment is there for the dividend steve wieczynski stifel analyst that s great color appreciate it guys thanks a lot jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer thanks steve marshall barber chief financial officer thank you steve operator your next question comes from the line of david katz with jefferies marshall barber chief financial officer good morning david david katz jefferies analyst hi good morning everyone jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer hi david david katz jefferies analyst i just wanted to follow back up on that matter and make sure that i m receiving information in the right way as it relates to share repurchases and dividends and the capital allocation in a broader perspective obviously we want to avoid looking at a specific quarter and raising the matter that you didn t buy any but in terms of forecasting for the full year for the full year next year which we re obligated to do we should think about dollar for dollar available cash being returned in one form or another is that a fair way for us to go about forecasting it jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer yeah i think i think that s right obviously david you know we don t provide any we get the long term guidance but we don t provide a quarterly or a single year guidance but i think your commentary is accurate that is our goal every year to deliver all excess cash back to shareholders through dividends or share buybacks marshall barber chief financial officer yeah if we there may be a possibility like last year where we have a really compelling investment like we did with the premier parks last year if we do that we ll use our cash for that but i think if you look at our track record we return our excess cash to shareholders and that ll be what we continue to do david katz jefferies analyst right and if i can just go back to one other matter that you touched on a bit and that is really the international opportunity and i hear you that we shouldn t really put it in a short term box i think that that from the discussions we ve had in our processing of it there s two questions behind it number one how would you have us think about those opportunities within the context of the target that you have in other words the project 750 how do we think about those international opportunities which do admittedly have an opportunity or a propensity to slide how much of the 750 really includes that and the second part of the question jim if i may and i appreciate your perspective on the transition what would you consider any risk if there is of any strategic shifts in this transition that may or may not include some of those international opportunities becoming more or less of a priority through the transition jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer right so i think those again two very good questions david in terms of international revenue and how it plays into 750 we ve never broken out specific dollars associated with any of our targets ever but the real difference here is that we have grown to a position where we have five major initiatives that i ve outlined for you that will provide growth opportunities for us for as i said probably decades and that we are in the second or third inning so your question was really how should i think about it with regards to the p 7 project 750 and i would say that it is one part of those five initiatives and if you ask me right now and if you d ask me six months ago where would it sits in terms of the ranking it s exactly as we have listed it i would have it fifth on the list in terms of initiatives and in terms of what s built in for it it represents only 3 of our revenue base right now so it s relatively immaterial overall we are looking to grow it and a decade from now we think it will be it will be material and it will grow but it won t be a straight line and so i can t say to you expect it to be exactly this year and next year it will play a very good part long term but in the near term probably less or so we will work very hard to try and make it a bigger part that s the need the biggest drivers in the near term will be our pricing initiatives our membership initiatives these in park initiatives whether they re culinary or retail or gain base and then adding on these water parks and then fifth the international piece will be strong for us longer term we ve got parks in china and in saudi arabia that are proceeding haiyan in china is proceeding very nicely saudi arabia is proceeding we think the chongqing in terms of approval we re hoping for the second half of the year and then nanjing in the next 12 months approval from the governments we ve met with all of them it s one of those things where i do not want to be in the position of over promising we think we ll make progress but as soon as we have concrete facts to be able to support that we will let you know i would add that we re also working with potential partners across the globe and looking to add other parks and the outlook there i think it s good but we will announce those once we have deals to be able to do that so going to your second question david you asked about what happens with regard to changes or risks associated with the ceo the new ceo coming in strategic shifts i think was the word that you use and i d say first of all the board is exactly the same this is the board that found me is looking for the new ceo the company momentum is very strong as i said earlier pretty much stronger than it s ever been at any point in the 9 years that i ve been here and i m extremely confident about where we are so if i look at risks of course a ceo a new ceo could have a new view with regard to capital allocation i think those are the words that you use but remember that the capital allocation policy is formulated by the board including me as ceo and company management many of those same board members are leading that search they will be on the board post the new ceo coming in while there can be no guarantees that it will be exactly the same there is a very strong view on the board that that s the approach we would take so no one can promise you that the world isn t going to change david but i feel fairly confident that the strategy that we have given that it s working will remain unchanged going forward david katz jefferies analyst okay thank you for taking my questions and i appreciate the answers jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer not at all marshall barber chief financial officer thank you david operator your next question comes from the line of james hardiman with wedbush securities jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer good morning james james hardiman wedbush securities analyst hey good morning guys thanks for taking my call marshall barber chief financial officer hi james james hardiman wedbush securities analyst good morning so i think you mentioned that the easter shift as of today it s been recovered i was just wondering what exactly that meant are you saying that that we re back to sort of flatter or positive attendance or revenues as we sit here today marshall barber chief financial officer yes basically what i meant was it was that that we recover the easter shift we still do have some days ahead of us as part of the shift as the parks in the northeast are on spring break right now and they would have already been on spring break last year so that s really what i meant is that that easter shift has been recovered and we do have a little bit more spring break left james hardiman wedbush securities analyst yeah james so we you know that we re not going to be specific in saying we re up down or whatever what we wanted to make sure is everybody understood that that we have more than offset that basically and we re in a good position given that we still have more days left that s what marshall is saying marshall barber chief financial officer right james hardiman wedbush securities analyst okay understood and then help us understand that the dubai situation a little bit better well i guess first let s take a step back can you give us the international revenue and ebitda numbers i guess would be first and then which parks exactly are contributing to that i think it sounds like just the one chinese park and then what was the it sounds like there was maybe a catch up payment i m sure that s the wrong term but you recognized all of the revenues for dubai in the first quarter i guess how much was that and should we then assume that we re no longer getting a cash from dubai going forward marshall barber chief financial officer yes so i ll start with and just kind of go in the order that you asked the questions the first quarter revenue was 11 4 million of international ebitda was a little over 9 million of ebitda for international in terms of the parts that did that we re in the revenue there was jim mentioned saudi and high end as well as the dubai and what we did with dubai is we had a deferred revenue position that we took to income because of the reasons i said in the prepared comments we re not going to break out individual agreements for obvious reasons other contracts in terms of going forward we re unlikely to recognize more revenue from dubai until we find a resolution but my assumption is that whether we re if we re going to build a theme park in dubai it s unlikely at this point jim would you add jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer i think that s right and i think that we feel very good about q1 with international where we will be measured in our approach we re cautiously optimistic that the situation in china is improving and as i said earlier our partner riverside remains very committed to developing six flags parks that s ongoing building going on but it s just going to take a little while longer to open those parks and we re working very closely with local governments to ensure that happens we ll update you probably on the second quarter on any developments there james hardiman wedbush securities analyst got it and then just one clarification it s still your perspective that your dubai partner actually owes you money for pulling out of that contract but we shouldn t expect to see any resolution in terms of revenues that would be that would show up as some sort of settlement is that how to think about it jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer yeah obviously james we would avoid making any sort of comments with regard to what happens next but in terms of your broad commentary that does make sense james hardiman wedbush securities analyst okay got it thanks guys and good luck jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer thanks james marshall barber chief financial officer thanks james operator your next question comes from the line of michael swartz with suntrust marshall barber chief financial officer good morning michael michael swartz suntrust robinson analyst hey good morning how are you marshall barber chief financial officer great michael swartz suntrust robinson analyst just because membership is a growing part of the business and i think jim you called about 20 of your park revenue now comes from membership holders maybe give us a little context as to where that stood last year maybe where members are as a percentage of actives today maybe where you think that can go marshall barber chief financial officer so i think maybe i think your last question first we think the demand for memberships we know is accelerating or growing week in week out we re upgrading people out of season passes and out of one day tickets in the membership so we think that will continue to grow in terms of where it was last year it was significantly less we ve grown that in the mid double digits in terms of just that particular stat so jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer yeah i d say it was really tiny comparatively because we you may remember we relaunched michael this program in the first quarter of last year and while there was a membership group it was fairly small but since then you know it s been very successful and exploded and so i would tell you you asked where it s going i m not going to try and predict the number but it s 20 right now of the spending of the revenue and so there s a lot of opportunity left in terms of the ability to grow it so 2 2 million members at the end of the year we will continue to grow that we talk to you at the end of the year having an active pass base of 8 million so you could theoretically say we would try to convert all 8 millions memberships and the price points are between 50 higher and almost three times higher than a season pass depending on the tier that we re in so not only is there a big opportunity with regard to converting members but they spend a lot more not just on the tickets but also in the parks so a lot of room still to go there marshall barber chief financial officer yeah the only thing i d add to that is that really the growth came after the first quarter because we just started selling the next level of membership 2 0 as we call it but we just started selling that at the 1st of march so all of that growth really came in april through march of this year michael swartz suntrust robinson analyst okay great that s helpful and maybe marshall just talk about i know with some of the additional parts you have coming online that you ll be operating this year that maybe you weren t last year whether that s this quarter the third quarter maybe just help us understand the operating day benefit are differential from some of those new parks year over year marshall barber chief financial officer yeah great so in terms of incremental operating days in the first quarter just little more broadly fiesta texas was open year round in the first quarter which was new phoenix the phoenix water park was opened some additional days i will tell you that in terms of attendance driven by the new parts in q1 it was de minimis and with most of those days those additional days were offset by lost days due to the easter shift and nearly 10 days that we had to close in california due to weather and maybe it might makes sense to just take up a minute to outline our approach to off days because all off days aren t created equal obviously this quarter we shifted we added some days in san antonio and obviously in phoenix we removed days because of easter that were big days big spring break days so when we look at opportunities for whether or not to open we just want to make sure we if we open we re confident that we can be profitable because we know if we re open we can sell more memberships and season passes so for example in san antonio we open those days we were profitable without the additional passes that we sold but we know with those additional passes that we saw we re going to make money and we re going to basically have future revenues for that so hopefully that sort of gives you an idea of the first quarter and operating days michael swartz suntrust robinson analyst yeah that s helpful and just looking out to the second and third quarter that was more my question just more of a modeling question how many additional days with some of those new parks add marshall barber chief financial officer so year over year we ll have little bit over 100 days additional operating days some of those like i said were in the first quarter the majority of those the overwhelming majority of those are going to be in the second quarter fiesta texas i talked about in q1 mexico is going to we re adding days there i think ultimately will go 365 days there but we ve added some days mostly in q2 and q3 in mexico and but if you look at overall we re really talking about a small percentage about 5 of our operating days were growing year over year and remember these are operating days that we know we can be profitable but you can t really look at them as an average operating day because we know they are marginal we know they are incremental but there days when school kids might be in school or our holidays that are not a holiday that everybody is out does that help michael swartz suntrust robinson analyst yeah that was helpful thanks a lot that s all from me jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer right thanks very much operator your next question comes from the line of tyler batory with janney capital market jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer good morning tyler marshall barber chief financial officer hi tyler tyler batory janney capital market analyst hi good morning everyone thanks for taking my questions so wanted to circle back to the active pass base growth all time high 5 growth there can you talk a little bit more about how that was impacted by easter and it was a little bit of a drag but is there a way to think about that number maybe on an apples to apples basis versus last year and then i know i ve asked this question in the past but do you have any updated thoughts on where that growth rate might trend over the next few quarters jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer marshall can you take this marshall barber chief financial officer sure so obviously 5 growth is another record we ve had actually a record high active pass base every quarter since we started tracking in 2014 the easter shift caused both season passes and memberships to move into the second quarter if you think about it s about 200 000 in attendance and you know most of those were selling season passes and memberships too so i guess what i d say is that that shift now has we ve already recovered those those lost pass sales what was the second part of the question jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer what was the second part of the question tyler tyler batory janney capital market analyst just how that number might trend over the next few quarters i mean you re 5 now i think you were 8 in the fourth quarter of 2018 you re in the double digits a couple of years obviously there s the law of large numbers impacting that but at the same time you guys have made a lot of progress as far as selling membership so i m just wondering how we should think about that number the growth for that number going forward jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer i think tyler you know as we said before we won t give guidance with regard to what the growth is going to be we feel pretty good about what we re seeing right now i would tell you that and are encouraged we ve mentioned the success of membership but in terms of specifics we re not going to point that out to you and obviously we ll publish that as soon as we have the data with q2 tyler batory janney capital market analyst okay great and then probably a question here for marshall how we re looking at the second quarter specifically on the cost side of things again i m not sure how much detail you can give but obviously you re going to have incremental lease expense from some of the parks that you bought i m not sure if there is other incremental start up costs but any color you can give in terms of how to think about modeling costs for the second quarter maybe first half of the year specifically marshall barber chief financial officer yes so the second quarter we picked up the new parts on june 1st we will have lease expense and operating expenses in the second quarter for the first two months those will be new a lot of the rebranding costs that i mentioned in the prepared comments have taken place we ll have a little bit more as these parks open up beyond that i d say in terms of other expense growth it will really be a couple of extra days in mexico and then i think beyond that will be less than inflation just like we have been over the last several years tyler batory janney capital market analyst okay great that s all from me thank you jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer thanks very much operator your next question comes from the line of eric wold with b riley jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer hi eric marshall barber chief financial officer hi eric eric wold b riley analyst hey good morning guys so couple of questions just following up on the memberships kind of strategy i guess you talked about a lot of the strategies in the parks continue to get people to migrate up from single day and season pass to membership but have you seen now that we kind of have this for a year if you seen any trends of members migrating up within the membership program to higher tiers once they re in there and then in general of when members kind of choose the plan have you seen any noticable shifting demand between once year or another over the past year either better tiers or lower tiers depending on where they go jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer that s a really good question and i would say that with regard to the approach we ve taken in my prepared comments i talked about the fact that we have developed these membership centers both at the front gate but also within the parks tyler to be able to address exactly this so when a guest comes up to the gate no matter what ticket they were looking to get whether it was a single day pass or a season pass we will first sell them or attempt to sell them memberships and the membership tiers range from gold plus through to diamond elite and the price points on those vary from 94 for the basic gold plus through to 220 and over for the diamond elite and that excludes dining if you include dining obviously the price is even higher we worked very hard to sell them and the conversion rates are very high we ve been very successful and being able to do that so two things happen one we get pretty much everybody at the front gate and worked very hard to drive conversion to membership we also incent our folks to ensure that they get a benefit from selling membership so there s a double benefit there and then what we do is within that process of selling membership we will work very hard to try and convert people from a gold plus up to a diamond diamond elite to get the highest price point so we have had great success doing that on the initial sale but furthermore within the parks where someone comes up and either they have an existing season pass or a lower level membership we will actively try to shift them up from one level to the other we do that in park and we also do it online in terms of directly targeting guests who may have passes already and the success has been really honestly much better than we anticipate it s not just in terms of the conversions but it s also the split of people who are buying the higher priced higher tiered membership is much more than we originally anticipated we really thought that d be a much larger group that would buy the gold plus and platinum and a relatively small diamond diamond elite and the mix is has really shifted in a way that s very positive for us and very positive for our per caps long term eric wold b riley analyst perfect that s helpful thank you jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer thank you marshall barber chief financial officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of tim conder with wells fargo securities jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer hi tim marshall barber chief financial officer good morning tim timothy conder wells fargo securities analyst good morning gentlemen and thank you for all the color so far and much appreciated on the international if i may return to that any quantification that you can give us of the 11 million marshall how much of that was dubai and then gentlemen just maybe a little more clarification on china given cadence here were you receiving revenue for all three parks or was it just two parks and now is it just one so i guess that s the first part of the china question and then if you hit some other milestones with some government clearances is there a potential for a acceleration or recapture and we saw the bad side of it in q4 but maybe a positive recapture later on this year related to china jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer okay tim so i think your first question was with regard to dubai and i think you know we ve already gone through this question earlier and we i think we gave the answer there we ve never disclosed individual parks tim so we re not going to do that now i can tell you that it wasn t that one park had a dominant percentage of the overall revenue it came across multiple parks and dubai and itself was not a material amount we got a benefit but it s not a massive amount so i hope that helps you in terms of that with regard to china you really had a couple of pieces it s like which parks do we recognize revenue on and maybe marshall you take that and then i ll take part two which is with regard to the ability to accelerate if something changes marshall barber chief financial officer okay yeah so in terms of what parts contributed to q1 it was and we sort of mentioned a little bit it s the high end parks because they re progressing nicely saudi arabia which is also progressing and dubai which we talked about contributed in q1 in terms of going forward i think those the two parks haiyan and saudi arabia will be contributing they ll be progressing nicely in the future and then jim do you want to talk about acceleration maybe from an accounting jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer yeah i ll talk about the accounting first and then marshall barber chief financial officer so chongqing and nanjing as those parts when they do ultimately get approved then there will be depending on when the opening date is and we ve built in the 6 months and 12 months in the opening days that we talked about in the fourth quarter we will be basically taking that cash doing a catch up in the quarter that those get turned back on assuming that the they happen within the opening days stays where it was when we talked about in the fourth quarter jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer yeah and tim just with regard to where we are with those parks i got at this a little bit earlier when we were talking but i want to go over it again first and most importantly issues that we re facing aren t specific to us there being faced by basically all companies especially private companies in china i mentioned the riverside very successfully navigating the political and regulatory environment and we re optimistic that they will continue to do so the dates that we have described on the last call and still hold now really reflects awaiting government approval and that s something we can t define i d love to be able to say this is exactly going to be the date but at least we do know there have been several meetings with the local governments including with our own people there not just our partner and it does feel like conditions are improving but we ll know as time goes on and obviously as i said earlier tim we ll advise you guys and our shareholders as we know timothy conder wells fargo securities analyst okay that s helpful gentlemen marshall when it sounds like you re still accounting for the parks that you had last year under the lease perspective will that have any impact or change due to the new lease accounting rules and how the expenses recognized in 2019 or would that be adopted in for 2020 marshall barber chief financial officer so i think what you were talking about whether any of that expense will go down and interest expense that s really just for financing leases we don t have any of those basically what is in our operating expense and what was in the last year will be in this year from an accounting perspective we will have the additional lease costs that we talked about from january through may but in terms of the accounting didn t really impact our op expenses at all and won t going forward timothy conder wells fargo securities analyst okay great and then last question gentleman anyway you can quantify the q1 benefit as we re starting to see now the benefit of the membership anniversary in that 13 month and smoothing your revenues into the shoulder periods so to speak and then related to that how are the retention rates now within active pass or membership however way you want to comment on it versus maybe a year or two ago jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer let me answer part two and then marshall will take part one our retention rates have improved over the last year so they re actually better so i feel very good about that and the success of membership continues to reinforce that we want to really focus in on this area to make sure that we continue to improve retention because it s key obviously for the long term success of the program marshall do you want to talk about part one marshall barber chief financial officer yeah i m glad you asked that question tim because i noticed on the report there s in your report there s analysis that said if we had increased attendance by the 189 000 we were down and been flat to prior it s been flat on revenue per cap would have been under prior year if we would have had 180 000 people we would have had significantly more revenue this quarter actually is a perfect example of what we ve been saying with respect to members who go faster 12 month compulsory period in quarters with lower attendance we re able to generate revenues regardless of that attendance and so as that base 13 plus members grows our steady revenue from these members will continue to grow as well it s really the reason that the top five per cap quarters in our history have been the first quarter of the last five years as we grow in the membership program it s really one of the great benefits of the program but since you d asked the question i mentioned it on the analysis we did run we just assumed if you adjust for the lost attendance using the current attendance mix that we had in q1 our first quarter would still be a record an all time record per cap so we love the 13 plus members there is going to be a lot of enrolling into the 13th month in april may june july august this year that really show some growth and again it s one of the really great benefits of the program jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer and i think tim building on that further if you think about the company and where it is with such a good position and the industry overall is a great industry and it has not only has a high barriers to entry but also it s very resilient in a downturn and with our membership program and with that recurring revenue we are simply strengthening ourselves even further for the long term in the event that there is any impact recession wise or otherwise timothy conder wells fargo securities analyst okay you know i think the point we were trying to make is just if you just for example take the attendance if it was flat that your admissions only dropped would have dropped a little bit and without factoring in that related to 190 but just playing the math with the denominator that the admissions would barely would have been essentially flat while the in park spend would have been down quite a bit more and then just making the point that you re there is clearly it appears to be some shift from the anniversary of the 13th month that is now smoothing the seasonality of that admissions revenue which is a good thing from a cash flow perspective jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer yeah i think overall it s a very good thing from a cash flow perspective we ve always talked about the fact that you may remember if you went back nine years tim the company lost money in two quarters we ve now turned the fourth quarter into a massive moneymaker and our goal is to take the first quarter and turn that into a massive moneymaker and membership is helping us to do that it s a very good thing under any scenario whatever way we adjust it we would have still had a record per cap and a record quarter so we feel pretty good about it timothy conder wells fargo securities analyst okay thank you gentlemen perfect color jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer thanks tim marshall barber chief financial officer yeah thank you tim operator your next question comes from the line of ian zaffino with oppenheimer jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer hi ian marshall barber chief financial officer good morning ian mark zhang oppenheimer analyst hi hey good morning guys this is mark on for ian so most of our questions have been answered but i just wanted to quickly check it seems like the majority of the like as key parts in china this is on track for approval but is there any i guess like new incremental delays to any other parks that we should be aware of or you foresee coming in the sort of near term thanks jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer no mark there are no delays that that we re aware of on any of the parks the same timing as we outlined on the fourth quarter call and i would also add that we are working hard our team is working very hard to identify other potential new parks and we have discussions on ongoing with various people but obviously the timing of those will depend on when we can reach agreements mark zhang oppenheimer analyst okay perfect that s it for us thank you jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer thank you mark operator and your final question comes from the line of brennan matthews with berenberg marshall barber chief financial officer good morning brennan brennan matthews berenberg capital markets analyst hi good morning thank you very much for taking my question i just wanted to ask i think you mentioned something about kind of launching or relaunching a new app this year maybe even this quarter kind of any detail on what some of those new features maybe and are you thinking maybe about could you ever have kind of maybe members specific features or think about using an app as a way to kind of engage your members in at all jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer you had just you hit a very hot button for me i love what you just asked and it s exactly the approach that we re taking our members are our most valuable and most important guests everything we do in and out of the park is designed to make sure that the members feel special that they re taking care of and so what we re doing overall is making sure that from a technology perspective we ve got a lot going on to the new app will allow multiple things including mobile food ordering we re also deploying point of sale in various parts of the park and allowing access that way so that we can get directly to not just members but all guests and then we ve got new mobile front gate systems to ensure that we reduce wait time and we ve dedicated some parts at the front gate just for members so that they can get in even faster and we ve also worked on a new website that is optimized for phones first in ada and other areas the app itself to your question mark it s redesigned really to make it even easier to use and it has improved home screen messaging we ve updated interactive park map technology which allows for quick map update and styling changes as i said we ve got the mobile food orderings the people can conveniently order ahead we can upsell directly we reduced the wait time for food as a result of that we ve also built in and this was a question that came earlier the ability to purchase memberships and season passes on the app and we re the only company i think that has this membership loyalty program and so that loyalty program is directly on the app and allows you to easily track point balances check information ride shows et cetera it also gives ride wait time accurate very accurate ride wait times so overall it s very positive both from a user perspective as guests enjoy using something that is easier for them but it also allows us to target upsell opportunities both in terms of our passes but also dining and flash pass so there s a lot different in the app and really targeted one to please the guests but two to ensure we can sell them more while they re in the park and even outside of the park brennan matthews berenberg capital markets analyst yeah i d say going forward i think what we ve done in the reason you see all these improvements as we brought the design of the app and programming app in house and so you ll see going forward continuous improvement month in month out you ll see updates to the app that ll add new features so yeah we re very excited about the app and where it is today and where it s headed all right great thank you so much jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer thank you very much marshall barber chief financial officer thank you brennan jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer okay i think that s our last question so in closing i would like to say thank you for joining the call and thank you for all of your ongoing support of the company i m very

expenses pre opening expenses for new hotels comments from mr luis barrios ceo of hoteles city express in an environment in which we observed a delay in the beginning of the business cycle in mexico we present our results for the first quarter of 2019 which are the product of a solid operation linked to the economic and geopolitical volatility and uncertainty of the country during the quarter we experienced two different moments that on average reflected a sub optimal performance in the quarter but with positive trends on the last weeks of it on one side in january and the first fifteen days of february our portfolio was negatively impacted by events such as the fuel shortage the deferment in government travel the number of layoffs at the end of 2018 and the pause in local investments which are the main sources of business in the markets where we are present on the other side in the last 45 days of the quarter we observed recovery dynamics to the point that during the last days of march our portfolio had double digit growth in revpar a trend that continues to date regionally our portfolio is favored by its geographical diversification the good performance of the north region of the country stands out with attractive market dynamics in markets such as tijuana mexicali monterrey and tampico likewise places like mexico city and guadalajara demonstrate the strength of our product to penetrate urban markets and obtain above average returns mainly through the city express plus brand as a counterbalance the bajío region presents operational weakness which we consider is primarily due to short term temporary effects such as the aforementioned fight against fuel theft and certain isolated events of insecurity that being said total income registered a growth of 5 while we reached an adjusted ebitda of approximately 220 million with the beginning of operation of more than 1 500 rooms in the last 12 months we consider that our inventory mainly composed by recently opened hotels is capable of absorbing incremental demand more than in a proportional way to the slowdown experienced at the start of 2019 based on this we continue focused on the fulfillment of our budget for effective rate growth announced in february 2019 with respect to our expansion plans we continue to progress steadily but cautiously to our 2019 development plan targets to date we have reached 151 hotels by opening 3 hotels out of the 17 projects we announced in february and staying in line with the development program we expect the opening of 14 more hotels in the coming months considering a risk return discrimination criteria our objective of openings in 2019 remains firm due to the strength of the markets in which we plan these openings despite this we remain cautious about the economic development in the coming months and we have an action plan in case of requiring cash preservation mechanisms for more than 16 years hoteles city express has profitably sailed several episodes of economic and political stress in mexico from the deep economic and the hospitality industry slowdown in 2008 2009 to the period of volatility derived from the renegotiation of the north american free trade agreement in 2015 to mention a few our company has experienced uncertain economic and geopolitical situations and has been able to capitalize on them we consider that although we are in a challenging but highly different reality from that of those moments the strength of our team our operational flexibility and the power of our product to penetrate new and current markets will be key elements to achieve our goals throughout the year goals that we are keeping intact thank you for your trust conference call details hoteles city express will host a conference call

in constant currencies we have followed a long standing policy of measuring our revenue performance and setting our revenue objectives exclusive of currency in order to measure in a transparent manner the underlying level of improvement in our total revenue and software revenue by type industry region and product lines we believe it is helpful to evaluate our growth exclusive of currency impacts particularly to help understand revenue trends in our business therefore we provide percentage increases or decreases in our revenue and eps in both ifrs as well as non ifrs to eliminate the effect of changes in currency values particularly the u s dollar and the japanese yen relative to the euro when trend information is expressed by us in constant currencies the results of the prior period have first been recalculated using the average exchange rates of the comparable period in the current year and then compared with the results of the comparable period in the current year while constant currency calculations are not considered to be an ifrs measure we do believe these measures are critical to understanding our global revenue results and to compare with many of our competitors who report their financial results in u s dollars therefore we are including this calculation for comparing ifrs revenue figures for comparable periods as well as for comparing non ifrs revenue figures for comparable periods all constant currency information is provided on an approximate basis unless otherwise indicated the impact of exchange rate fluctuations is approximately the same for both the company s ifrs and supplemental non ifrs financial data information on growth excluding acquisitions organic growth in addition to discussing total growth we also provide financial information where we discuss growth excluding acquisitions or growth on an organic basis as used alternatively in both cases growth excluding acquisitions have been calculated using the following restatements of the scope of consolidation for entities entering the consolidation scope in the current year subtracting the contribution of the acquisition from the aggregates of the current year and for entities entering the consolidation scope in the previous year subtracting the contribution of the acquisition from january 1st of the current year until the last day of the month of the current year when the acquisition was made the previous year information on industrial sectors our global customer base includes companies in 11 industrial sectors as of january 1 2019 with core industries comprised of transportation mobility industrial equipment aerospace defense and a portion of business services diversification industries includes companies in high tech life sciences energy materials home lifestyle construction cities territories consumer packaged goods retail marine offshore and a portion of business services 3dexperience licenses and software contribution to measure the progressive penetration of 3dexperience software we utilize the following ratios a for licenses revenue we calculate the percentage contribution by comparing total 3dexperience licenses revenue to licenses

reid anderson chairman president and ceo of six flags and marshall barber our chief financial officer we will begin the call with prepared comments and then open the call to your questions our comments will include forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in such statements and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements in addition on the call we will discuss non gaap financial measures investors can find both a detailed discussion of business risks and reconciliations of non gaap financial measures to gaap financial measures in the company s annual reports quarterly reports or other forms filed or furnished with the sec at this time i will turn the call over to jim jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer thank you very much steve good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call today the 2019 season is off to a great start with all time high guest spending per cap and a record high active pass base first quarter revenue nearly reached our prior year record level even with the later opening of several of our parks due to the late april easter holiday placing us solidly on track to achieve our 10th consecutive record year i m especially pleased with the tremendous ongoing success we ve achieved in selling our multi tiered membership program and associated membership dining plan we grew active memberships by more than 30 in 2018 and are continuing that strong momentum in 2019 at the beginning of this year we implemented dramatic changes in the operations at our front gate to build out membership sales centers and to expedite guest flow to these locations as a result we experienced significant in park membership growth for those parks that opened in march this program continues to be a key driver of our growth strategy providing a platform of recurring revenue at higher prices and the ability to further grow attendance as we expand our network of parks the power of our membership program was highlighted in the first quarter with our solid revenue performance despite this being our seasonally smallest quarter when most parks are closed you are likely aware that in early march we announced my decision to retire from six flags in the first quarter of 2020 i am extremely proud that our team has achieved nine consecutive years of record financial performance six flags continues to build upon its global leadership position and is strongly situated to continue its growth trajectory for years to come as i shared with you in 2016 it is my belief that many ceos stay in their roles too long i don t want to remain in this position so long that i potentially block opportunity for great leaders with innovative ideas from helping the company achieve its fullest potential i remain one of the company s largest shareholders and it is because of my strong belief that the company is so well positioned to execute our current strategy and continue its growth trajectory that i feel this is the right time for me to step down from what has been the most fun and rewarding role of my career we specifically announced my intention well in advance to ensure transparency to our shareholders and employees and to allow the board to conduct a thorough and deliberative search for a new ceo this should ensure that we find the best possible person to lead six flags following my retirement and to name a successor for my role as chairman of the board in the interim i will continue to deliver 100 of my energy to our company and fully expect us to deliver our 10th consecutive record year in 2019 i will now turn the call over to marshall who will share a few more details about our first quarter financial results marshall marshall barber chief financial officer thank you jim and hello to everyone on the call although q1 is difficult to compare to prior year due to easter holiday arriving later this year we had a strong start to 2019 and indicators point to a strong season ahead our active pass base was up 5 and guest spending per capita reached a new all time high due to strong membership unit sales higher prices of memberships and a higher number of members who have stayed with the membership program beyond their initial 12 month compulsory period our active pass base growth would have been stronger of our operating calendar had not shifted due to the easter holiday following three weeks later than last year most people purchase their membership or season pass shortly before visiting our parks so the later start to our operating calendars delayed many purchases into the second quarter despite the decrease in attendance resulted from the easter shift total revenue in the quarter was down less than 1 million primarily as a result of the higher guest spending per capita and an increase in revenue from international agreements which included revenue associated with our park in dubai continuation of the project in dubai has become unlikely so we ve recognized revenue up to the amount of cash received attendance in the quarter was down 8 or 189 000 guests to 2 2 million the easter shift accounted for a loss of approximately 200 000 visits in the quarter and as of today the attendance shift has been recovered total guest spending per capita increased 2 40 or 5 with admissions per capita up 2 34 or 8 from prior year and in park spending per capita up 0 06 the increase in admissions per capita resulted from higher post compulsory revenue from our membership program a higher mix of memberships in the base and ticket price increases at the small number of parks that were open deferred revenue of 178 million as of march 31st 2019 decreased 4 million or 2 from march 31st 2018 the decrease was primarily due to a higher mix of longer tenured members versus last year as well as lower past sales due to the later easter holiday recall that we recognize revenue equal to the monthly membership fee once the membership goes beyond it s initial 12 month compulsory period unlike season passes were the first year of a membership is 13 plus memberships no longer contribute to deferred revenue because of the different accounting per revenue and our increasing success in upselling our guest to memberships the company expects the deferred revenue growth will be immediate going forward as the growing number of members passed their initial commitment period moving to costs cash operating sg a expenses increased 12 million or 9 primarily driven by higher lease and other start up and rebranding costs from the five parts we acquired on june 1st 2018 excluding these extra costs our cash operating and sg a expenses increased less than inflation although we continue to face wage pressures in several markets due to increases in minimum wages and a tightening labor market as you can see from our success in 2018 and in the first quarter of 2019 we are working very hard to offset these increases across our large and diverse cost base as a result of our strong revenue growth and focus cost control we generated an ltm modified ebitda margin of nearly 40 because of that along with our disciplined approach to capital spending our modified ebitda less capex margin remains the best in the theme park industry by several hundred basis points net leverage at the end of the first quarter was 4 1 times adjusted ebitda which we expect will soon decline as the company generates higher levels of adjusted ebitda and cash flow given the recent improvement in the debt markets we decided to opportunistically refinance our bank credit facilities including increasing the amount of our term loan b from 584 million to 800 million and increasing our revolving credit facility from 250 million to 350 million we increased the size of our revolver in proportion to the growth of our company as we ve added eight new parts as part of our north american expansion strategy since we last refinanced our bank facilities in 2015 we used the net proceeds to fully pay down the prior revolver balance and held the rest is cash which will be available for general corporate purposes including share repurchases we have 232 million remaining under our board authorization for share repurchases and we ll continue to look for opportunities to repurchase shares using our strong cash flow and balance sheet we are in an excellent financial position with modest leverage high interest coverage and no debt maturities before 2024 together with the proven resilience of the regional theme park industry during an economic downturn we stand by our firm commitment to grow our dividend every year i feel great about our growth prospects and then we are very well positioned for yet another record year and now i ll turn the call back over to jim jim jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer thank you very much marshall innovation is in our dna and we continue to be recognized as the global leader in theme park ride attraction

park at our great escape resort in new york as part of the major expansion we are on our way to becoming the biggest water park operator in the world and i can see the day when hurricane harbor is as well known as the six flags brand the drivers of our business in 2019 are a continuation of the strategy we have successfully pursued over the last several years one upselling guests to our high value programs such as memberships while introducing use in every park and expanding our special events to increase capacity and grow attendance two implementing price increases in the mid single digits three growing in park spending especially by increasing penetration of our all season dining passes four actively pursuing our north american expansion strategy to grow our addressable market and realize synergies and five licensing our brands to partners outside of north america who will develop six flags branded parks as i said at the beginning of the call i am most excited about the incredible growth of a large recurring revenue base through our new tiered membership program and our all season dining pass membership program which provides opportunities to increase guest retention rates and spending together with our industry leading loyalty program and our world class marketing research capabilities these programs provide the means for us to build strong relationships with our guests learn what they value most and tailor our messaging and product offerings to their unique preferences we are launching new program and capabilities that allow us to upsell any guest of any ticket type to a membership or any membership to a higher tier this will make it easier than ever for every guest to obtain the best possible experience with a membership these membership programs taken together already represent approximately 20 of our guests spending revenues and we believe the upside here is tremendous membership is hot delivers higher pricing and margin and drives long term loyalty our strong momentum should ensure that an even more material percentage of our business comes from recurring revenues over the next decade we are geographically diverse and no one part represents more than 10 of annual attendance the vast majority of our guest live within driving distance of one of our parks and our north american expansion strategy actively supports building that expanding guest base for a very modest sum guests can come to any of our parks as many times as they like thus our membership and season pass offerings will continue to appeal to consumers in any economic environment our strong active pass base provides both a weather hedge and a powerful means to retain our customers through disciplined pricing and our ability to flexibly manage capital spending and expenses especially seasonal labor we can successfully drive shareholder value regardless of the economy our long term international opportunities remains compelling and we are positioning ourselves to participate in emerging markets for decades to come we have only begun to build out our international function expertise and realize the potential of this strategy as international licensing still only represents about 3 of our revenue in the next 10 years up to 1 billion people will enter the middle class and the vast majority of them will be in emerging markets like china and india where there is still very low penetration of theme parks we continue to work with our international partner in china meeting government officials to each of our three part complexes and we believe conditions in china has slowly begun to improve like virtually every theme park project in these markets we have experienced some opening delays but we should not lose sight of the fact that these short term delays and lumpy revenue patterns are not material in the context of the long term opportunity our current stock price in no way reflects the years of growth opportunities we have ahead of us and our strong financial performance over many years we have consistently delivered the highest growth rates and margins in the industry while increasing our dividend every year for the past 8 years and returning all excess cash to shareholders through share buybacks our dividend yield of more than 6 is among the highest in the us market we strongly believe that this price dislocation which has happened to almost every us company at some point is temporary we also believe that the answer from our perspective is to apply a laser focus on what we can control and that is staying true to our successful strategy and consistently delivering superior operations consequently as a team we re working diligently to deliver our 10th consecutive record year and driving the company toward achieving of our aspirational goal of 750 million of modified ebitda by 2021 at this time i m going to ask our operator zatanya to open the call up for any questions questions and answers operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of steve wieczynski with stifel steve wieczynski stifel analyst hey guys good morning jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer good morning steve steve wieczynski stifel analyst how are you jim jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer great steve wieczynski stifel analyst so jim can i ask you it s going to be somewhat of a personal question i know you addressed your retirement in your prepared remarks but i guess if i go back and i look at the last time you came out of so called retirement i think it was july of 2017 you mentioned your return was going to be a long term commitment i guess the question is when it s all said and done is it s 2 years to 2 5 years just i guess that doesn t really seem like long term so i guess i m getting at is why now maybe help us think about that a little bit more and then maybe also help us understand how the search process is going for your replacement and maybe some of the what are some of the characteristics you guys are looking for in your next ceo that d be helpful thanks jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer i think that s a fair question steve and i m happy to address that head on although there were probably three questions in there i ll tackle them one by one first in terms of my tenure as ceo i do want to reinforce that they really have been the most rewarding years of my career and i still have almost a year left in terms of what i need to do and what the company needs to do to ensure we deliver the 10th record year but when i retired in 2016 i talked then you may remember about about my belief that after a certain time in the ceo position it s important to start step aside and allow for new leadership new perspectives and i do still believe that and so your question then part two is why is it right now to make this announcement i think the most important thing is to ensure transparency and to provide the board with sufficient time to complete a thoughtful deliberative selection process so hence the end of february 2020 it s very important to me to ensure we do deliver that 10th consecutive year and i truly believe that timing is right because momentum at the company is very strong and i feel extremely confident about our long term future you ll remember that i am one of the company s largest shareholders and because of that it s very important to me that the company does well and we are very well positioned right now to execute our current strategy our company is in a strong position we ve had an unprecedented growth trajectory for years and we see a continuation of that growth trajectory into the future and i talked earlier steve about the five key initiatives but those initiatives from ticket yields to membership and season pass penetration in park revenue north american expansion and international all have legs for many years to come i truly believe that for most of those were in the second or third innings of this gain so i feel very good about where we are and the ability to make this transition now is appropriate and we can get someone excellent even better than me is the goal to step up and take over so in terms of the search itself a search firm has been hired it s spencer stuart they are assisting the board in evaluating both internal external candidates and at the same time the board not only will nominate a ceo but also a new chairman of the board that the target date is march 1st but the exact timing obviously will depend on you know exactly what happens with regard to that search we re very early in the process so there s still a long way to go and i promise that we ll give updates when there is material news to report but most important for me i love the company it s in my blood as i said i m one of the biggest shareholders and all investors including myself and by the way pretty much every full time employee at the company knows that i m going to devote 100 of my time my energy to the company to deliver the best results that we can get this year and to set the company up for decades of growth that s my goal and we re going to work very hard to get there so steve i apologize i know that was probably overly long answer to three and sort of individual questions you had but i wanted to make sure i addressed all of them steve wieczynski stifel analyst no that was great thank you very much and i apologize for the long winded question the second question will be a little bit shorter and it s around capital allocation and obviously you guys just refinanced your debt but i guess i want to understand why the lack of any share repurchases in the first quarter given where the share price was was that was that a function of having to wait until you ve got the debt refinanced or is it something else and then second maybe give us an update in terms of how you guys view the dividend at this point you addressed it a little bit in your prepared remarks but i think dividend protection right now is probably the biggest concern out there with the investors that we re talking to appreciate it thanks jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer right so let me set up and handover directly to marshall on the first part of the question and i think big picture in the first quarter we moved opportunistically on the refinancing because the market turned in our favor and so you re absolutely right in the way you described that as we re in a position where we knew we were going to do this so we are very cautious about what else we did and then marshall maybe you take part one and then shall i take the dividend marshall barber chief financial officer sure our policy as you know is to return all excess cash flow to shareholders in the form of our healthy growing dividend and also share repurchases since we build most of our cash over the summers the parks open and we do we build most of our rides in the spring we didn t purchase shares in q1 since emerging as a public company even 2010 we ve reduced our share count from 110 million shares to 84 million shares returning about 3 5 billion back to investors so that s the reason we didn t do anything in q1 but we ll continue to look for opportunities to repurchase shares using our strong cash flow and balance sheet as we move forward and start generating cash in 2019 jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer and then marshall you jump in if i miss anything with regard to the dividend but steve you know i think very well but a strong sustainable cash dividend is really an important part of our value proposition to shareholders and it is our goal and that remains unchanged to grow the dividend every year going forward as we have done successfully for the past eight years you may remember that last year we raised the annualized dividend to 3 28 a 17 increase over the same period in 2017 our dividend yield right now is very attractive and we remain committed to growing our dividend every year and to your point around the ability to cover it just as we ve done every single year and we did last year and we will do this year we re in a position to generate cash flow that exceeds our dividend payments and to continue that strongly into the future marshall did i miss anything marshall barber chief financial officer no i think it s maybe speaking a little bit to 2018 we our cash flow exceeded our dividend payments we were able to fully fund our capital spending at 9 of revenues we acquired five new parks and we had money to buy shares as well and if you think about it we are a growing company we grew 7 last year and we ve grown every year since 2010 and last year was a difficult year from a weather perspective so we firmly believe this year we re going to grow and will address the amount of dividend growth as we get to the end of the year jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer i think the other thing marshall maybe talk to this is from a tax perspective in terms of cash taxes the outlook is fairly positive for us going forward for several years right marshall barber chief financial officer yeah actually so this year we ll spend we ll pay about 30 million in cash taxes which is similar to 2018 in 2020 it will probably grow to 45 million to 50 million but again and then from 2021 to 2024 we ll have a tax yield of about 32 5 million of our earnings jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer so net of it is that we expect minimal federal taxes not just in as we had in 2018 but 2019 2020 and then it ramps up a little bit in 2021 so it s we re in a position where overall from a cash perspective we feel pretty comfortable with what we ve got and the commitment is there for the dividend steve wieczynski stifel analyst that s great color appreciate it guys thanks a lot jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer thanks steve marshall barber chief financial officer thank you steve operator your next question comes from the line of david katz with jefferies marshall barber chief financial officer good morning david david katz jefferies analyst hi good morning everyone jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer hi david david katz jefferies analyst i just wanted to follow back up on that matter and make sure that i m receiving information in the right way as it relates to share repurchases and dividends and the capital allocation in a broader perspective obviously we want to avoid looking at a specific quarter and raising the matter that you didn t buy any but in terms of forecasting for the full year for the full year next year which we re obligated to do we should think about dollar for dollar available cash being returned in one form or another is that a fair way for us to go about forecasting it jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer yeah i think i think that s right obviously david you know we don t provide any we get the long term guidance but we don t provide a quarterly or a single year guidance but i think your commentary is accurate that is our goal every year to deliver all excess cash back to shareholders through dividends or share buybacks marshall barber chief financial officer yeah if we there may be a possibility like last year where we have a really compelling investment like we did with the premier parks last year if we do that we ll use our cash for that but i think if you look at our track record we return our excess cash to shareholders and that ll be what we continue to do david katz jefferies analyst right and if i can just go back to one other matter that you touched on a bit and that is really the international opportunity and i hear you that we shouldn t really put it in a short term box i think that that from the discussions we ve had in our processing of it there s two questions behind it number one how would you have us think about those opportunities within the context of the target that you have in other words the project 750 how do we think about those international opportunities which do admittedly have an opportunity or a propensity to slide how much of the 750 really includes that and the second part of the question jim if i may and i appreciate your perspective on the transition what would you consider any risk if there is of any strategic shifts in this transition that may or may not include some of those international opportunities becoming more or less of a priority through the transition jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer right so i think those again two very good questions david in terms of international revenue and how it plays into 750 we ve never broken out specific dollars associated with any of our targets ever but the real difference here is that we have grown to a position where we have five major initiatives that i ve outlined for you that will provide growth opportunities for us for as i said probably decades and that we are in the second or third inning so your question was really how should i think about it with regards to the p 7 project 750 and i would say that it is one part of those five initiatives and if you ask me right now and if you d ask me six months ago where would it sits in terms of the ranking it s exactly as we have listed it i would have it fifth on the list in terms of initiatives and in terms of what s built in for it it represents only 3 of our revenue base right now so it s relatively immaterial overall we are looking to grow it and a decade from now we think it will be it will be material and it will grow but it won t be a straight line and so i can t say to you expect it to be exactly this year and next year it will play a very good part long term but in the near term probably less or so we will work very hard to try and make it a bigger part that s the need the biggest drivers in the near term will be our pricing initiatives our membership initiatives these in park initiatives whether they re culinary or retail or gain base and then adding on these water parks and then fifth the international piece will be strong for us longer term we ve got parks in china and in saudi arabia that are proceeding haiyan in china is proceeding very nicely saudi arabia is proceeding we think the chongqing in terms of approval we re hoping for the second half of the year and then nanjing in the next 12 months approval from the governments we ve met with all of them it s one of those things where i do not want to be in the position of over promising we think we ll make progress but as soon as we have concrete facts to be able to support that we will let you know i would add that we re also working with potential partners across the globe and looking to add other parks and the outlook there i think it s good but we will announce those once we have deals to be able to do that so going to your second question david you asked about what happens with regard to changes or risks associated with the ceo the new ceo coming in strategic shifts i think was the word that you use and i d say first of all the board is exactly the same this is the board that found me is looking for the new ceo the company momentum is very strong as i said earlier pretty much stronger than it s ever been at any point in the 9 years that i ve been here and i m extremely confident about where we are so if i look at risks of course a ceo a new ceo could have a new view with regard to capital allocation i think those are the words that you use but remember that the capital allocation policy is formulated by the board including me as ceo and company management many of those same board members are leading that search they will be on the board post the new ceo coming in while there can be no guarantees that it will be exactly the same there is a very strong view on the board that that s the approach we would take so no one can promise you that the world isn t going to change david but i feel fairly confident that the strategy that we have given that it s working will remain unchanged going forward david katz jefferies analyst okay thank you for taking my questions and i appreciate the answers jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer not at all marshall barber chief financial officer thank you david operator your next question comes from the line of james hardiman with wedbush securities jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer good morning james james hardiman wedbush securities analyst hey good morning guys thanks for taking my call marshall barber chief financial officer hi james james hardiman wedbush securities analyst good morning so i think you mentioned that the easter shift as of today it s been recovered i was just wondering what exactly that meant are you saying that that we re back to sort of flatter or positive attendance or revenues as we sit here today marshall barber chief financial officer yes basically what i meant was it was that that we recover the easter shift we still do have some days ahead of us as part of the shift as the parks in the northeast are on spring break right now and they would have already been on spring break last year so that s really what i meant is that that easter shift has been recovered and we do have a little bit more spring break left james hardiman wedbush securities analyst yeah james so we you know that we re not going to be specific in saying we re up down or whatever what we wanted to make sure is everybody understood that that we have more than offset that basically and we re in a good position given that we still have more days left that s what marshall is saying marshall barber chief financial officer right james hardiman wedbush securities analyst okay understood and then help us understand that the dubai situation a little bit better well i guess first let s take a step back can you give us the international revenue and ebitda numbers i guess would be first and then which parks exactly are contributing to that i think it sounds like just the one chinese park and then what was the it sounds like there was maybe a catch up payment i m sure that s the wrong term but you recognized all of the revenues for dubai in the first quarter i guess how much was that and should we then assume that we re no longer getting a cash from dubai going forward marshall barber chief financial officer yes so i ll start with and just kind of go in the order that you asked the questions the first quarter revenue was 11 4 million of international ebitda was a little over 9 million of ebitda for international in terms of the parts that did that we re in the revenue there was jim mentioned saudi and high end as well as the dubai and what we did with dubai is we had a deferred revenue position that we took to income because of the reasons i said in the prepared comments we re not going to break out individual agreements for obvious reasons other contracts in terms of going forward we re unlikely to recognize more revenue from dubai until we find a resolution but my assumption is that whether we re if we re going to build a theme park in dubai it s unlikely at this point jim would you add jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer i think that s right and i think that we feel very good about q1 with international where we will be measured in our approach we re cautiously optimistic that the situation in china is improving and as i said earlier our partner riverside remains very committed to developing six flags parks that s ongoing building going on but it s just going to take a little while longer to open those parks and we re working very closely with local governments to ensure that happens we ll update you probably on the second quarter on any developments there james hardiman wedbush securities analyst got it and then just one clarification it s still your perspective that your dubai partner actually owes you money for pulling out of that contract but we shouldn t expect to see any resolution in terms of revenues that would be that would show up as some sort of settlement is that how to think about it jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer yeah obviously james we would avoid making any sort of comments with regard to what happens next but in terms of your broad commentary that does make sense james hardiman wedbush securities analyst okay got it thanks guys and good luck jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer thanks james marshall barber chief financial officer thanks james operator your next question comes from the line of michael swartz with suntrust marshall barber chief financial officer good morning michael michael swartz suntrust robinson analyst hey good morning how are you marshall barber chief financial officer great michael swartz suntrust robinson analyst just because membership is a growing part of the business and i think jim you called about 20 of your park revenue now comes from membership holders maybe give us a little context as to where that stood last year maybe where members are as a percentage of actives today maybe where you think that can go marshall barber chief financial officer so i think maybe i think your last question first we think the demand for memberships we know is accelerating or growing week in week out we re upgrading people out of season passes and out of one day tickets in the membership so we think that will continue to grow in terms of where it was last year it was significantly less we ve grown that in the mid double digits in terms of just that particular stat so jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer yeah i d say it was really tiny comparatively because we you may remember we relaunched michael this program in the first quarter of last year and while there was a membership group it was fairly small but since then you know it s been very successful and exploded and so i would tell you you asked where it s going i m not going to try and predict the number but it s 20 right now of the spending of the revenue and so there s a lot of opportunity left in terms of the ability to grow it so 2 2 million members at the end of the year we will continue to grow that we talk to you at the end of the year having an active pass base of 8 million so you could theoretically say we would try to convert all 8 millions memberships and the price points are between 50 higher and almost three times higher than a season pass depending on the tier that we re in so not only is there a big opportunity with regard to converting members but they spend a lot more not just on the tickets but also in the parks so a lot of room still to go there marshall barber chief financial officer yeah the only thing i d add to that is that really the growth came after the first quarter because we just started selling the next level of membership 2 0 as we call it but we just started selling that at the 1st of march so all of that growth really came in april through march of this year michael swartz suntrust robinson analyst okay great that s helpful and maybe marshall just talk about i know with some of the additional parts you have coming online that you ll be operating this year that maybe you weren t last year whether that s this quarter the third quarter maybe just help us understand the operating day benefit are differential from some of those new parks year over year marshall barber chief financial officer yeah great so in terms of incremental operating days in the first quarter just little more broadly fiesta texas was open year round in the first quarter which was new phoenix the phoenix water park was opened some additional days i will tell you that in terms of attendance driven by the new parts in q1 it was de minimis and with most of those days those additional days were offset by lost days due to the easter shift and nearly 10 days that we had to close in california due to weather and maybe it might makes sense to just take up a minute to outline our approach to off days because all off days aren t created equal obviously this quarter we shifted we added some days in san antonio and obviously in phoenix we removed days because of easter that were big days big spring break days so when we look at opportunities for whether or not to open we just want to make sure we if we open we re confident that we can be profitable because we know if we re open we can sell more memberships and season passes so for example in san antonio we open those days we were profitable without the additional passes that we sold but we know with those additional passes that we saw we re going to make money and we re going to basically have future revenues for that so hopefully that sort of gives you an idea of the first quarter and operating days michael swartz suntrust robinson analyst yeah that s helpful and just looking out to the second and third quarter that was more my question just more of a modeling question how many additional days with some of those new parks add marshall barber chief financial officer so year over year we ll have little bit over 100 days additional operating days some of those like i said were in the first quarter the majority of those the overwhelming majority of those are going to be in the second quarter fiesta texas i talked about in q1 mexico is going to we re adding days there i think ultimately will go 365 days there but we ve added some days mostly in q2 and q3 in mexico and but if you look at overall we re really talking about a small percentage about 5 of our operating days were growing year over year and remember these are operating days that we know we can be profitable but you can t really look at them as an average operating day because we know they are marginal we know they are incremental but there days when school kids might be in school or our holidays that are not a holiday that everybody is out does that help michael swartz suntrust robinson analyst yeah that was helpful thanks a lot that s all from me jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer right thanks very much operator your next question comes from the line of tyler batory with janney capital market jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer good morning tyler marshall barber chief financial officer hi tyler tyler batory janney capital market analyst hi good morning everyone thanks for taking my questions so wanted to circle back to the active pass base growth all time high 5 growth there can you talk a little bit more about how that was impacted by easter and it was a little bit of a drag but is there a way to think about that number maybe on an apples to apples basis versus last year and then i know i ve asked this question in the past but do you have any updated thoughts on where that growth rate might trend over the next few quarters jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer marshall can you take this marshall barber chief financial officer sure so obviously 5 growth is another record we ve had actually a record high active pass base every quarter since we started tracking in 2014 the easter shift caused both season passes and memberships to move into the second quarter if you think about it s about 200 000 in attendance and you know most of those were selling season passes and memberships too so i guess what i d say is that that shift now has we ve already recovered those those lost pass sales what was the second part of the question jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer what was the second part of the question tyler tyler batory janney capital market analyst just how that number might trend over the next few quarters i mean you re 5 now i think you were 8 in the fourth quarter of 2018 you re in the double digits a couple of years obviously there s the law of large numbers impacting that but at the same time you guys have made a lot of progress as far as selling membership so i m just wondering how we should think about that number the growth for that number going forward jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer i think tyler you know as we said before we won t give guidance with regard to what the growth is going to be we feel pretty good about what we re seeing right now i would tell you that and are encouraged we ve mentioned the success of membership but in terms of specifics we re not going to point that out to you and obviously we ll publish that as soon as we have the data with q2 tyler batory janney capital market analyst okay great and then probably a question here for marshall how we re looking at the second quarter specifically on the cost side of things again i m not sure how much detail you can give but obviously you re going to have incremental lease expense from some of the parks that you bought i m not sure if there is other incremental start up costs but any color you can give in terms of how to think about modeling costs for the second quarter maybe first half of the year specifically marshall barber chief financial officer yes so the second quarter we picked up the new parts on june 1st we will have lease expense and operating expenses in the second quarter for the first two months those will be new a lot of the rebranding costs that i mentioned in the prepared comments have taken place we ll have a little bit more as these parks open up beyond that i d say in terms of other expense growth it will really be a couple of extra days in mexico and then i think beyond that will be less than inflation just like we have been over the last several years tyler batory janney capital market analyst okay great that s all from me thank you jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer thanks very much operator your next question comes from the line of eric wold with b riley jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer hi eric marshall barber chief financial officer hi eric eric wold b riley analyst hey good morning guys so couple of questions just following up on the memberships kind of strategy i guess you talked about a lot of the strategies in the parks continue to get people to migrate up from single day and season pass to membership but have you seen now that we kind of have this for a year if you seen any trends of members migrating up within the membership program to higher tiers once they re in there and then in general of when members kind of choose the plan have you seen any noticable shifting demand between once year or another over the past year either better tiers or lower tiers depending on where they go jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer that s a really good question and i would say that with regard to the approach we ve taken in my prepared comments i talked about the fact that we have developed these membership centers both at the front gate but also within the parks tyler to be able to address exactly this so when a guest comes up to the gate no matter what ticket they were looking to get whether it was a single day pass or a season pass we will first sell them or attempt to sell them memberships and the membership tiers range from gold plus through to diamond elite and the price points on those vary from 94 for the basic gold plus through to 220 and over for the diamond elite and that excludes dining if you include dining obviously the price is even higher we worked very hard to sell them and the conversion rates are very high we ve been very successful and being able to do that so two things happen one we get pretty much everybody at the front gate and worked very hard to drive conversion to membership we also incent our folks to ensure that they get a benefit from selling membership so there s a double benefit there and then what we do is within that process of selling membership we will work very hard to try and convert people from a gold plus up to a diamond diamond elite to get the highest price point so we have had great success doing that on the initial sale but furthermore within the parks where someone comes up and either they have an existing season pass or a lower level membership we will actively try to shift them up from one level to the other we do that in park and we also do it online in terms of directly targeting guests who may have passes already and the success has been really honestly much better than we anticipate it s not just in terms of the conversions but it s also the split of people who are buying the higher priced higher tiered membership is much more than we originally anticipated we really thought that d be a much larger group that would buy the gold plus and platinum and a relatively small diamond diamond elite and the mix is has really shifted in a way that s very positive for us and very positive for our per caps long term eric wold b riley analyst perfect that s helpful thank you jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer thank you marshall barber chief financial officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of tim conder with wells fargo securities jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer hi tim marshall barber chief financial officer good morning tim timothy conder wells fargo securities analyst good morning gentlemen and thank you for all the color so far and much appreciated on the international if i may return to that any quantification that you can give us of the 11 million marshall how much of that was dubai and then gentlemen just maybe a little more clarification on china given cadence here were you receiving revenue for all three parks or was it just two parks and now is it just one so i guess that s the first part of the china question and then if you hit some other milestones with some government clearances is there a potential for a acceleration or recapture and we saw the bad side of it in q4 but maybe a positive recapture later on this year related to china jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer okay tim so i think your first question was with regard to dubai and i think you know we ve already gone through this question earlier and we i think we gave the answer there we ve never disclosed individual parks tim so we re not going to do that now i can tell you that it wasn t that one park had a dominant percentage of the overall revenue it came across multiple parks and dubai and itself was not a material amount we got a benefit but it s not a massive amount so i hope that helps you in terms of that with regard to china you really had a couple of pieces it s like which parks do we recognize revenue on and maybe marshall you take that and then i ll take part two which is with regard to the ability to accelerate if something changes marshall barber chief financial officer okay yeah so in terms of what parts contributed to q1 it was and we sort of mentioned a little bit it s the high end parks because they re progressing nicely saudi arabia which is also progressing and dubai which we talked about contributed in q1 in terms of going forward i think those the two parks haiyan and saudi arabia will be contributing they ll be progressing nicely in the future and then jim do you want to talk about acceleration maybe from an accounting jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer yeah i ll talk about the accounting first and then marshall barber chief financial officer so chongqing and nanjing as those parts when they do ultimately get approved then there will be depending on when the opening date is and we ve built in the 6 months and 12 months in the opening days that we talked about in the fourth quarter we will be basically taking that cash doing a catch up in the quarter that those get turned back on assuming that the they happen within the opening days stays where it was when we talked about in the fourth quarter jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer yeah and tim just with regard to where we are with those parks i got at this a little bit earlier when we were talking but i want to go over it again first and most importantly issues that we re facing aren t specific to us there being faced by basically all companies especially private companies in china i mentioned the riverside very successfully navigating the political and regulatory environment and we re optimistic that they will continue to do so the dates that we have described on the last call and still hold now really reflects awaiting government approval and that s something we can t define i d love to be able to say this is exactly going to be the date but at least we do know there have been several meetings with the local governments including with our own people there not just our partner and it does feel like conditions are improving but we ll know as time goes on and obviously as i said earlier tim we ll advise you guys and our shareholders as we know timothy conder wells fargo securities analyst okay that s helpful gentlemen marshall when it sounds like you re still accounting for the parks that you had last year under the lease perspective will that have any impact or change due to the new lease accounting rules and how the expenses recognized in 2019 or would that be adopted in for 2020 marshall barber chief financial officer so i think what you were talking about whether any of that expense will go down and interest expense that s really just for financing leases we don t have any of those basically what is in our operating expense and what was in the last year will be in this year from an accounting perspective we will have the additional lease costs that we talked about from january through may but in terms of the accounting didn t really impact our op expenses at all and won t going forward timothy conder wells fargo securities analyst okay great and then last question gentleman anyway you can quantify the q1 benefit as we re starting to see now the benefit of the membership anniversary in that 13 month and smoothing your revenues into the shoulder periods so to speak and then related to that how are the retention rates now within active pass or membership however way you want to comment on it versus maybe a year or two ago jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer let me answer part two and then marshall will take part one our retention rates have improved over the last year so they re actually better so i feel very good about that and the success of membership continues to reinforce that we want to really focus in on this area to make sure that we continue to improve retention because it s key obviously for the long term success of the program marshall do you want to talk about part one marshall barber chief financial officer yeah i m glad you asked that question tim because i noticed on the report there s in your report there s analysis that said if we had increased attendance by the 189 000 we were down and been flat to prior it s been flat on revenue per cap would have been under prior year if we would have had 180 000 people we would have had significantly more revenue this quarter actually is a perfect example of what we ve been saying with respect to members who go faster 12 month compulsory period in quarters with lower attendance we re able to generate revenues regardless of that attendance and so as that base 13 plus members grows our steady revenue from these members will continue to grow as well it s really the reason that the top five per cap quarters in our history have been the first quarter of the last five years as we grow in the membership program it s really one of the great benefits of the program but since you d asked the question i mentioned it on the analysis we did run we just assumed if you adjust for the lost attendance using the current attendance mix that we had in q1 our first quarter would still be a record an all time record per cap so we love the 13 plus members there is going to be a lot of enrolling into the 13th month in april may june july august this year that really show some growth and again it s one of the really great benefits of the program jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer and i think tim building on that further if you think about the company and where it is with such a good position and the industry overall is a great industry and it has not only has a high barriers to entry but also it s very resilient in a downturn and with our membership program and with that recurring revenue we are simply strengthening ourselves even further for the long term in the event that there is any impact recession wise or otherwise timothy conder wells fargo securities analyst okay you know i think the point we were trying to make is just if you just for example take the attendance if it was flat that your admissions only dropped would have dropped a little bit and without factoring in that related to 190 but just playing the math with the denominator that the admissions would barely would have been essentially flat while the in park spend would have been down quite a bit more and then just making the point that you re there is clearly it appears to be some shift from the anniversary of the 13th month that is now smoothing the seasonality of that admissions revenue which is a good thing from a cash flow perspective jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer yeah i think overall it s a very good thing from a cash flow perspective we ve always talked about the fact that you may remember if you went back nine years tim the company lost money in two quarters we ve now turned the fourth quarter into a massive moneymaker and our goal is to take the first quarter and turn that into a massive moneymaker and membership is helping us to do that it s a very good thing under any scenario whatever way we adjust it we would have still had a record per cap and a record quarter so we feel pretty good about it timothy conder wells fargo securities analyst okay thank you gentlemen perfect color jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer thanks tim marshall barber chief financial officer yeah thank you tim operator your next question comes from the line of ian zaffino with oppenheimer jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer hi ian marshall barber chief financial officer good morning ian mark zhang oppenheimer analyst hi hey good morning guys this is mark on for ian so most of our questions have been answered but i just wanted to quickly check it seems like the majority of the like as key parts in china this is on track for approval but is there any i guess like new incremental delays to any other parks that we should be aware of or you foresee coming in the sort of near term thanks jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer no mark there are no delays that that we re aware of on any of the parks the same timing as we outlined on the fourth quarter call and i would also add that we are working hard our team is working very hard to identify other potential new parks and we have discussions on ongoing with various people but obviously the timing of those will depend on when we can reach agreements mark zhang oppenheimer analyst okay perfect that s it for us thank you jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer thank you mark operator and your final question comes from the line of brennan matthews with berenberg marshall barber chief financial officer good morning brennan brennan matthews berenberg capital markets analyst hi good morning thank you very much for taking my question i just wanted to ask i think you mentioned something about kind of launching or relaunching a new app this year maybe even this quarter kind of any detail on what some of those new features maybe and are you thinking maybe about could you ever have kind of maybe members specific features or think about using an app as a way to kind of engage your members in at all jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer you had just you hit a very hot button for me i love what you just asked and it s exactly the approach that we re taking our members are our most valuable and most important guests everything we do in and out of the park is designed to make sure that the members feel special that they re taking care of and so what we re doing overall is making sure that from a technology perspective we ve got a lot going on to the new app will allow multiple things including mobile food ordering we re also deploying point of sale in various parts of the park and allowing access that way so that we can get directly to not just members but all guests and then we ve got new mobile front gate systems to ensure that we reduce wait time and we ve dedicated some parts at the front gate just for members so that they can get in even faster and we ve also worked on a new website that is optimized for phones first in ada and other areas the app itself to your question mark it s redesigned really to make it even easier to use and it has improved home screen messaging we ve updated interactive park map technology which allows for quick map update and styling changes as i said we ve got the mobile food orderings the people can conveniently order ahead we can upsell directly we reduced the wait time for food as a result of that we ve also built in and this was a question that came earlier the ability to purchase memberships and season passes on the app and we re the only company i think that has this membership loyalty program and so that loyalty program is directly on the app and allows you to easily track point balances check information ride shows et cetera it also gives ride wait time accurate very accurate ride wait times so overall it s very positive both from a user perspective as guests enjoy using something that is easier for them but it also allows us to target upsell opportunities both in terms of our passes but also dining and flash pass so there s a lot different in the app and really targeted one to please the guests but two to ensure we can sell them more while they re in the park and even outside of the park brennan matthews berenberg capital markets analyst yeah i d say going forward i think what we ve done in the reason you see all these improvements as we brought the design of the app and programming app in house and so you ll see going forward continuous improvement month in month out you ll see updates to the app that ll add new features so yeah we re very excited about the app and where it is today and where it s headed all right great thank you so much jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer thank you very much marshall barber chief financial officer thank you brennan jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer okay i think that s our last question so in closing i would like to say thank you for joining the call and thank you for all of your ongoing support of the company i m very optimistic about the future of our company as our growth strategies continue to build momentum for the short medium and long term i truly believe we have the best employees in the industry and it s the hard work and dedication of the talented team members who ve delivered time and time again to give me so much confidence in the future please come out and visit one of our parks soon to see our amazing lineup of new rides and attractions better yet join our

discussion of business risks and reconciliations of non gaap financial measures to gaap financial measures in the company s annual reports quarterly reports or other forms filed or furnished with the sec at this time i will turn the call over to jim jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer thank you very much steve good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call today the 2019 season is off to a great start with all time high guest spending per cap and a record high active pass base first quarter revenue nearly reached our prior year record level even with the later opening of several of our parks due to the late april easter holiday placing us solidly on track to achieve our 10th consecutive record year i m especially pleased with the tremendous ongoing success we ve achieved in selling our multi tiered membership program and associated membership dining plan we grew active memberships by more than 30 in 2018 and are continuing that strong momentum in 2019 at the beginning of this year we implemented dramatic changes in the operations at our front gate to build out membership sales centers and to expedite guest flow to these locations as a result we experienced significant in park membership growth for those parks that opened in march this program continues to be a key driver of our growth strategy providing a platform of recurring revenue at higher prices and the ability to further grow attendance as we expand our network of parks the power of our membership program was highlighted in the first quarter with our solid revenue performance despite this being our seasonally smallest quarter when most parks are closed you are likely aware that in early march we announced my decision to retire from six flags in the first quarter of 2020 i am extremely proud that our team has achieved nine consecutive years of record financial performance six flags continues to build upon its global leadership position and is strongly situated to continue its growth trajectory for years to come as i shared with you in 2016 it is my belief that many ceos stay in their roles too long i don t want to remain in this position so long that i potentially block opportunity for great leaders with innovative ideas from helping the company achieve its fullest potential i remain one of the company s largest shareholders and it is because of my strong belief that the company is so well positioned to execute our current strategy and continue its growth trajectory that i feel this is the right time for me to step down from what has been the most fun and rewarding role of my career we specifically announced my intention well in advance to ensure transparency to our shareholders and employees and to allow the board to conduct a thorough and deliberative search for a new ceo this should ensure that we find the best possible person to lead six flags following my retirement and to name a successor for my role as chairman of the board in the interim i will continue to deliver 100 of my energy to our company and fully expect us to deliver our 10th consecutive record year in 2019 i will now turn the call over to marshall who will share a few more details about our first quarter financial results marshall marshall barber chief financial officer thank you jim and hello to everyone on the call although q1 is difficult to compare to prior year due to easter holiday arriving later this year we had a strong start to 2019 and indicators point to a strong season ahead our active pass base was up 5 and guest spending per capita reached a new all time high due to strong membership unit sales higher prices of memberships and a higher number of members who have stayed with the membership program beyond their initial 12 month compulsory period our active pass base growth would have been stronger of our operating calendar had not shifted due to the easter holiday following three weeks later than last year most people purchase their membership or season pass shortly before visiting our parks so the later start to our operating calendars delayed many purchases into the second quarter despite the decrease in attendance resulted from the easter shift total revenue in the quarter was down less than 1 million primarily as a result of the higher guest spending per capita and an increase in revenue from international agreements which included revenue associated with our park in dubai continuation of the project in dubai has become unlikely so we ve recognized revenue up to the amount of cash received attendance in the quarter was down 8 or 189 000 guests to 2 2 million the easter shift accounted for a loss of approximately 200 000 visits in the quarter and as of today the attendance shift has been recovered total guest spending per capita increased 2 40 or 5 with admissions per capita up 2 34 or 8 from prior year and in park spending per capita up 0 06 the increase in admissions per capita resulted from higher post compulsory revenue from our membership program a higher mix of memberships in the base and ticket price increases at the small number of parks that were open deferred revenue of 178 million as of march 31st 2019 decreased 4 million or 2 from march 31st 2018 the decrease was primarily due to a higher mix of longer tenured members versus last year as well as lower past sales due to the later easter holiday recall that we recognize revenue equal to the monthly membership fee once the membership goes beyond it s initial 12 month compulsory period unlike season passes were the first year of a membership is 13 plus memberships no longer contribute to deferred revenue because of the different accounting per revenue and our increasing success in upselling our guest to memberships the company expects the deferred revenue growth will be immediate going forward as the growing number of members passed their initial commitment period moving to costs cash operating sg a expenses increased 12 million or 9 primarily driven by higher lease and other start up and rebranding costs from the five parts we acquired on june 1st 2018 excluding these extra costs our cash operating and sg a expenses increased less than inflation although we continue to face wage pressures in several markets due to increases in minimum wages and a tightening labor market as you can see from our success in 2018 and in the first quarter of 2019 we are working very hard to offset these increases across our large and diverse cost base as a result of our strong revenue growth and focus cost control we generated an ltm modified ebitda margin of nearly 40 because of that along with our disciplined approach to capital spending our modified ebitda less capex margin remains the best in the theme park industry by several hundred basis points net leverage at the end of the first quarter was 4 1 times adjusted ebitda which we expect will soon decline as the company generates higher levels of adjusted ebitda and cash flow given the recent improvement in the debt markets we decided to opportunistically refinance our bank credit facilities including increasing the amount of our term loan b from 584 million to 800 million and increasing our revolving credit facility from 250 million to 350 million we increased the size of our revolver in proportion to the growth of our company as we ve added eight new parts as part of our north american expansion strategy since we last refinanced our bank facilities in 2015 we used the net proceeds to fully pay down the prior revolver balance and held the rest is cash which will be available for general corporate purposes including share repurchases we have 232 million remaining under our board authorization for share repurchases and we ll continue to look for opportunities to repurchase shares using our strong cash flow and balance sheet we are in an excellent financial position with modest leverage high interest coverage and no debt maturities before 2024 together with the proven resilience of the regional theme park industry during an economic downturn we stand by our firm commitment to grow our dividend every year i feel great about our growth prospects and then we are very well positioned for yet another record year and now i ll turn the call back over to jim jim jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer thank you very much marshall innovation is in our dna and we continue to be recognized as the global leader in theme park ride attraction and technology innovation in addition to record breaking new rides we are also adding wi fi in every park a supercharge new six flags app online dining ordering and many other new and exciting benefits for our loyal guests in 2019 we will be introducing the best and most innovative lineup of new rides in the company s history including several world record or first of their kind rides max force a triple record breaking launch coaster at six flags great america with the fastest acceleration of any coaster in north america batman the ride a 4d free spin wing coaster and new dc comics themed area at six flags discovery kingdom the joker wild card the world s tallest and fastest pendulum ride at six flags fiesta texas and el diablo the world s largest loop coaster at six flags over texas and of course i can t forget west coast racers the world s first racing launch coaster at six flags magic mountain the undisputed roller coaster capital of the universe we are pleased to welcome our 26 park magic waters a beautiful water park located an hour from six flags great america in rockford the illinois we are already selling memberships and combo passes as we prepare the park to open in may we are also rebranding our acquired theme park in darien lake to six flags and three water parks to hurricane harbor our newly acquired water parks in houston and phoenix and our outdoor water park at our great escape resort in new york as part of the major expansion we are on our way to becoming the biggest water park operator in the world and i can see the day when hurricane harbor is as well known as the six flags brand the drivers of our business in 2019 are a continuation of the strategy we have successfully pursued over the last several years one upselling guests to our high value programs such as memberships while introducing use in every park and expanding our special events to increase capacity and grow attendance two implementing price increases in the mid single digits three growing in park spending especially by increasing penetration of our all season dining passes four actively pursuing our north american expansion strategy to grow our addressable market and realize synergies and five licensing our brands to partners outside of north america who will develop six flags branded parks as i said at the beginning of the call i am most excited about the incredible growth of a large recurring revenue base through our new tiered membership program and our all season dining pass membership program which provides opportunities to increase guest retention rates and spending together with our industry leading loyalty program and our world class marketing research capabilities these programs provide the means for us to build strong relationships with our guests learn what they value most and tailor our messaging and product offerings to their unique preferences we are launching new program and capabilities that allow us to upsell any guest of any ticket type to a membership or any membership to a higher tier this will make it easier than ever for every guest to obtain the best possible experience with a membership these membership programs taken together already represent approximately 20 of our guests spending revenues and we believe the upside here is tremendous membership is hot delivers higher pricing and margin and drives long term loyalty our strong momentum should ensure that an even more material percentage of our business comes from recurring revenues over the next decade we are geographically diverse and no one part represents more than 10 of annual attendance the vast majority of our guest live within driving distance of one of our parks and our north american expansion strategy actively supports building that expanding guest base for a very modest sum guests can come to any of our parks as many times as they like thus our membership and season pass offerings will continue to appeal to consumers in any economic environment our strong active pass base provides both a weather hedge and a powerful means to retain our customers through disciplined pricing and our ability to flexibly manage capital spending and expenses especially seasonal labor we can successfully drive shareholder value regardless of the economy our long term international opportunities remains compelling and we are positioning ourselves to participate in emerging markets for decades to come we have only begun to build out our international function expertise and realize the potential of this strategy as international licensing still only represents about 3 of our revenue in the next 10 years up to 1 billion people will enter the middle class and the vast majority of them will be in emerging markets like china and india where there is still very low penetration of theme parks we continue to work with our international partner in china meeting government officials to each of our three part complexes and we believe conditions in china has slowly begun to improve like virtually every theme park project in these markets we have experienced some opening delays but we should not lose sight of the fact that these short term delays and lumpy revenue patterns are not material in the context of the long term opportunity our current stock price in no way reflects the years of growth opportunities we have ahead of us and our strong financial performance over many years we have consistently delivered the highest growth rates and margins in the industry while increasing our dividend every year for the past 8 years and returning all excess cash to shareholders through share buybacks our dividend yield of more than 6 is among the highest in the us market we strongly believe that this price dislocation which has happened to almost every us company at some point is temporary we also believe that the answer from our perspective is to apply a laser focus on what we can control and that is staying true to our successful strategy and consistently delivering superior operations consequently as a team we re working diligently to deliver our 10th consecutive record year and driving the company toward achieving of our aspirational goal of 750 million of modified ebitda by 2021 at this time i m going to ask our operator zatanya to open the call up for any questions questions and answers operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of steve wieczynski with stifel steve wieczynski stifel analyst hey guys good morning jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer good morning steve steve wieczynski stifel analyst how are you jim jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer great steve wieczynski stifel analyst so jim can i ask you it s going to be somewhat of a personal question i know you addressed your retirement in your prepared remarks but i guess if i go back and i look at the last time you came out of so called retirement i think it was july of 2017 you mentioned your return was going to be a long term commitment i guess the question is when it s all said and done is it s 2 years to 2 5 years just i guess that doesn t really seem like long term so i guess i m getting at is why now maybe help us think about that a little bit more and then maybe also help us understand how the search process is going for your replacement and maybe some of the what are some of the characteristics you guys are looking for in your next ceo that d be helpful thanks jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer i think that s a fair question steve and i m happy to address that head on although there were probably three questions in there i ll tackle them one by one first in terms of my tenure as ceo i do want to reinforce that they really have been the most rewarding years of my career and i still have almost a year left in terms of what i need to do and what the company needs to do to ensure we deliver the 10th record year but when i retired in 2016 i talked then you may remember about about my belief that after a certain time in the ceo position it s important to start step aside and allow for new leadership new perspectives and i do still believe that and so your question then part two is why is it right now to make this announcement i think the most important thing is to ensure transparency and to provide the board with sufficient time to complete a thoughtful deliberative selection process so hence the end of february 2020 it s very important to me to ensure we do deliver that 10th consecutive year and i truly believe that timing is right because momentum at the company is very strong and i feel extremely confident about our long term future you ll remember that i am one of the company s largest shareholders and because of that it s very important to me that the company does well and we are very well positioned right now to execute our current strategy our company is in a strong position we ve had an unprecedented growth trajectory for years and we see a continuation of that growth trajectory into the future and i talked earlier steve about the five key initiatives but those initiatives from ticket yields to membership and season pass penetration in park revenue north american expansion and international all have legs for many years to come i truly believe that for most of those were in the second or third innings of this gain so i feel very good about where we are and the ability to make this transition now is appropriate and we can get someone excellent even better than me is the goal to step up and take over so in terms of the search itself a search firm has been hired it s spencer stuart they are assisting the board in evaluating both internal external candidates and at the same time the board not only will nominate a ceo but also a new chairman of the board that the target date is march 1st but the exact timing obviously will depend on you know exactly what happens with regard to that search we re very early in the process so there s still a long way to go and i promise that we ll give updates when there is material news to report but most important for me i love the company it s in my blood as i said i m one of the biggest shareholders and all investors including myself and by the way pretty much every full time employee at the company knows that i m going to devote 100 of my time my energy to the company to deliver the best results that we can get this year and to set the company up for decades of growth that s my goal and we re going to work very hard to get there so steve i apologize i know that was probably overly long answer to three and sort of individual questions you had but i wanted to make sure i addressed all of them steve wieczynski stifel analyst no that was great thank you very much and i apologize for the long winded question the second question will be a little bit shorter and it s around capital allocation and obviously you guys just refinanced your debt but i guess i want to understand why the lack of any share repurchases in the first quarter given where the share price was was that was that a function of having to wait until you ve got the debt refinanced or is it something else and then second maybe give us an update in terms of how you guys view the dividend at this point you addressed it a little bit in your prepared remarks but i think dividend protection right now is probably the biggest concern out there with the investors that we re talking to appreciate it thanks jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer right so let me set up and handover directly to marshall on the first part of the question and i think big picture in the first quarter we moved opportunistically on the refinancing because the market turned in our favor and so you re absolutely right in the way you described that as we re in a position where we knew we were going to do this so we are very cautious about what else we did and then marshall maybe you take part one and then shall i take the dividend marshall barber chief financial officer sure our policy as you know is to return all excess cash flow to shareholders in the form of our healthy growing dividend and also share repurchases since we build most of our cash over the summers the parks open and we do we build most of our rides in the spring we didn t purchase shares in q1 since emerging as a public company even 2010 we ve reduced our share count from 110 million shares to 84 million shares returning about 3 5 billion back to investors so that s the reason we didn t do anything in q1 but we ll continue to look for opportunities to repurchase shares using our strong cash flow and balance sheet as we move forward and start generating cash in 2019 jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer and then marshall you jump in if i miss anything with regard to the dividend but steve you know i think very well but a strong sustainable cash dividend is really an important part of our value proposition to shareholders and it is our goal and that remains unchanged to grow the dividend every year going forward as we have done successfully for the past eight years you may remember that last year we raised the annualized dividend to 3 28 a 17 increase over the same period in 2017 our dividend yield right now is very attractive and we remain committed to growing our dividend every year and to your point around the ability to cover it just as we ve done every single year and we did last year and we will do this year we re in a position to generate cash flow that exceeds our dividend payments and to continue that strongly into the future marshall did i miss anything marshall barber chief financial officer no i think it s maybe speaking a little bit to 2018 we our cash flow exceeded our dividend payments we were able to fully fund our capital spending at 9 of revenues we acquired five new parks and we had money to buy shares as well and if you think about it we are a growing company we grew 7 last year and we ve grown every year since 2010 and last year was a difficult year from a weather perspective so we firmly believe this year we re going to grow and will address the amount of dividend growth as we get to the end of the year jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer i think the other thing marshall maybe talk to this is from a tax perspective in terms of cash taxes the outlook is fairly positive for us going forward for several years right marshall barber chief financial officer yeah actually so this year we ll spend we ll pay about 30 million in cash taxes which is similar to 2018 in 2020 it will probably grow to 45 million to 50 million but again and then from 2021 to 2024 we ll have a tax yield of about 32 5 million of our earnings jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer so net of it is that we expect minimal federal taxes not just in as we had in 2018 but 2019 2020 and then it ramps up a little bit in 2021 so it s we re in a position where overall from a cash perspective we feel pretty comfortable with what we ve got and the commitment is there for the dividend steve wieczynski stifel analyst that s great color appreciate it guys thanks a lot jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer thanks steve marshall barber chief financial officer thank you steve operator your next question comes from the line of david katz with jefferies marshall barber chief financial officer good morning david david katz jefferies analyst hi good morning everyone jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer hi david david katz jefferies analyst i just wanted to follow back up on that matter and make sure that i m receiving information in the right way as it relates to share repurchases and dividends and the capital allocation in a broader perspective obviously we want to avoid looking at a specific quarter and raising the matter that you didn t buy any but in terms of forecasting for the full year for the full year next year which we re obligated to do we should think about dollar for dollar available cash being returned in one form or another is that a fair way for us to go about forecasting it jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer yeah i think i think that s right obviously david you know we don t provide any we get the long term guidance but we don t provide a quarterly or a single year guidance but i think your commentary is accurate that is our goal every year to deliver all excess cash back to shareholders through dividends or share buybacks marshall barber chief financial officer yeah if we there may be a possibility like last year where we have a really compelling investment like we did with the premier parks last year if we do that we ll use our cash for that but i think if you look at our track record we return our excess cash to shareholders and that ll be what we continue to do david katz jefferies analyst right and if i can just go back to one other matter that you touched on a bit and that is really the international opportunity and i hear you that we shouldn t really put it in a short term box i think that that from the discussions we ve had in our processing of it there s two questions behind it number one how would you have us think about those opportunities within the context of the target that you have in other words the project 750 how do we think about those international opportunities which do admittedly have an opportunity or a propensity to slide how much of the 750 really includes that and the second part of the question jim if i may and i appreciate your perspective on the transition what would you consider any risk if there is of any strategic shifts in this transition that may or may not include some of those international opportunities becoming more or less of a priority through the transition jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer right so i think those again two very good questions david in terms of international revenue and how it plays into 750 we ve never broken out specific dollars associated with any of our targets ever but the real difference here is that we have grown to a position where we have five major initiatives that i ve outlined for you that will provide growth opportunities for us for as i said probably decades and that we are in the second or third inning so your question was really how should i think about it with regards to the p 7 project 750 and i would say that it is one part of those five initiatives and if you ask me right now and if you d ask me six months ago where would it sits in terms of the ranking it s exactly as we have listed it i would have it fifth on the list in terms of initiatives and in terms of what s built in for it it represents only 3 of our revenue base right now so it s relatively immaterial overall we are looking to grow it and a decade from now we think it will be it will be material and it will grow but it won t be a straight line and so i can t say to you expect it to be exactly this year and next year it will play a very good part long term but in the near term probably less or so we will work very hard to try and make it a bigger part that s the need the biggest drivers in the near term will be our pricing initiatives our membership initiatives these in park initiatives whether they re culinary or retail or gain base and then adding on these water parks and then fifth the international piece will be strong for us longer term we ve got parks in china and in saudi arabia that are proceeding haiyan in china is proceeding very nicely saudi arabia is proceeding we think the chongqing in terms of approval we re hoping for the second half of the year and then nanjing in the next 12 months approval from the governments we ve met with all of them it s one of those things where i do not want to be in the position of over promising we think we ll make progress but as soon as we have concrete facts to be able to support that we will let you know i would add that we re also working with potential partners across the globe and looking to add other parks and the outlook there i think it s good but we will announce those once we have deals to be able to do that so going to your second question david you asked about what happens with regard to changes or risks associated with the ceo the new ceo coming in strategic shifts i think was the word that you use and i d say first of all the board is exactly the same this is the board that found me is looking for the new ceo the company momentum is very strong as i said earlier pretty much stronger than it s ever been at any point in the 9 years that i ve been here and i m extremely confident about where we are so if i look at risks of course a ceo a new ceo could have a new view with regard to capital allocation i think those are the words that you use but remember that the capital allocation policy is formulated by the board including me as ceo and company management many of those same board members are leading that search they will be on the board post the new ceo coming in while there can be no guarantees that it will be exactly the same there is a very strong view on the board that that s the approach we would take so no one can promise you that the world isn t going to change david but i feel fairly confident that the strategy that we have given that it s working will remain unchanged going forward david katz jefferies analyst okay thank you for taking my questions and i appreciate the answers jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer not at all marshall barber chief financial officer thank you david operator your next question comes from the line of james hardiman with wedbush securities jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer good morning james james hardiman wedbush securities analyst hey good morning guys thanks for taking my call marshall barber chief financial officer hi james james hardiman wedbush securities analyst good morning so i think you mentioned that the easter shift as of today it s been recovered i was just wondering what exactly that meant are you saying that that we re back to sort of flatter or positive attendance or revenues as we sit here today marshall barber chief financial officer yes basically what i meant was it was that that we recover the easter shift we still do have some days ahead of us as part of the shift as the parks in the northeast are on spring break right now and they would have already been on spring break last year so that s really what i meant is that that easter shift has been recovered and we do have a little bit more spring break left james hardiman wedbush securities analyst yeah james so we you know that we re not going to be specific in saying we re up down or whatever what we wanted to make sure is everybody understood that that we have more than offset that basically and we re in a good position given that we still have more days left that s what marshall is saying marshall barber chief financial officer right james hardiman wedbush securities analyst okay understood and then help us understand that the dubai situation a little bit better well i guess first let s take a step back can you give us the international revenue and ebitda numbers i guess would be first and then which parks exactly are contributing to that i think it sounds like just the one chinese park and then what was the it sounds like there was maybe a catch up payment i m sure that s the wrong term but you recognized all of the revenues for dubai in the first quarter i guess how much was that and should we then assume that we re no longer getting a cash from dubai going forward marshall barber chief financial officer yes so i ll start with and just kind of go in the order that you asked the questions the first quarter revenue was 11 4 million of international ebitda was a little over 9 million of ebitda for international in terms of the parts that did that we re in the revenue there was jim mentioned saudi and high end as well as the dubai and what we did with dubai is we had a deferred revenue position that we took to income because of the reasons i said in the prepared comments we re not going to break out individual agreements for obvious reasons other contracts in terms of going forward we re unlikely to recognize more revenue from dubai until we find a resolution but my assumption is that whether we re if we re going to build a theme park in dubai it s unlikely at this point jim would you add jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer i think that s right and i think that we feel very good about q1 with international where we will be measured in our approach we re cautiously optimistic that the situation in china is improving and as i said earlier our partner riverside remains very committed to developing six flags parks that s ongoing building going on but it s just going to take a little while longer to open those parks and we re working very closely with local governments to ensure that happens we ll update you probably on the second quarter on any developments there james hardiman wedbush securities analyst got it and then just one clarification it s still your perspective that your dubai partner actually owes you money for pulling out of that contract but we shouldn t expect to see any resolution in terms of revenues that would be that would show up as some sort of settlement is that how to think about it jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer yeah obviously james we would avoid making any sort of comments with regard to what happens next but in terms of your broad commentary that does make sense james hardiman wedbush securities analyst okay got it thanks guys and good luck jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer thanks james marshall barber chief financial officer thanks james operator your next question comes from the line of michael swartz with suntrust marshall barber chief financial officer good morning michael michael swartz suntrust robinson analyst hey good morning how are you marshall barber chief financial officer great michael swartz suntrust robinson analyst just because membership is a growing part of the business and i think jim you called about 20 of your park revenue now comes from membership holders maybe give us a little context as to where that stood last year maybe where members are as a percentage of actives today maybe where you think that can go marshall barber chief financial officer so i think maybe i think your last question first we think the demand for memberships we know is accelerating or growing week in week out we re upgrading people out of season passes and out of one day tickets in the membership so we think that will continue to grow in terms of where it was last year it was significantly less we ve grown that in the mid double digits in terms of just that particular stat so jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer yeah i d say it was really tiny comparatively because we you may remember we relaunched michael this program in the first quarter of last year and while there was a membership group it was fairly small but since then you know it s been very successful and exploded and so i would tell you you asked where it s going i m not going to try and predict the number but it s 20 right now of the spending of the revenue and so there s a lot of opportunity left in terms of the ability to grow it so 2 2 million members at the end of the year we will continue to grow that we talk to you at the end of the year having an active pass base of 8 million so you could theoretically say we would try to convert all 8 millions memberships and the price points are between 50 higher and almost three times higher than a season pass depending on the tier that we re in so not only is there a big opportunity with regard to converting members but they spend a lot more not just on the tickets but also in the parks so a lot of room still to go there marshall barber chief financial officer yeah the only thing i d add to that is that really the growth came after the first quarter because we just started selling the next level of membership 2 0 as we call it but we just started selling that at the 1st of march so all of that growth really came in april through march of this year michael swartz suntrust robinson analyst okay great that s helpful and maybe marshall just talk about i know with some of the additional parts you have coming online that you ll be operating this year that maybe you weren t last year whether that s this quarter the third quarter maybe just help us understand the operating day benefit are differential from some of those new parks year over year marshall barber chief financial officer yeah great so in terms of incremental operating days in the first quarter just little more broadly fiesta texas was open year round in the first quarter which was new phoenix the phoenix water park was opened some additional days i will tell you that in terms of attendance driven by the new parts in q1 it was de minimis and with most of those days those additional days were offset by lost days due to the easter shift and nearly 10 days that we had to close in california due to weather and maybe it might makes sense to just take up a minute to outline our approach to off days because all off days aren t created equal obviously this quarter we shifted we added some days in san antonio and obviously in phoenix we removed days because of easter that were big days big spring break days so when we look at opportunities for whether or not to open we just want to make sure we if we open we re confident that we can be profitable because we know if we re open we can sell more memberships and season passes so for example in san antonio we open those days we were profitable without the additional passes that we sold but we know with those additional passes that we saw we re going to make money and we re going to basically have future revenues for that so hopefully that sort of gives you an idea of the first quarter and operating days michael swartz suntrust robinson analyst yeah that s helpful and just looking out to the second and third quarter that was more my question just more of a modeling question how many additional days with some of those new parks add marshall barber chief financial officer so year over year we ll have little bit over 100 days additional operating days some of those like i said were in the first quarter the majority of those the overwhelming majority of those are going to be in the second quarter fiesta texas i talked about in q1 mexico is going to we re adding days there i think ultimately will go 365 days there but we ve added some days mostly in q2 and q3 in mexico and but if you look at overall we re really talking about a small percentage about 5 of our operating days were growing year over year and remember these are operating days that we know we can be profitable but you can t really look at them as an average operating day because we know they are marginal we know they are incremental but there days when school kids might be in school or our holidays that are not a holiday that everybody is out does that help michael swartz suntrust robinson analyst yeah that was helpful thanks a lot that s all from me jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer right thanks very much operator your next question comes from the line of tyler batory with janney capital market jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer good morning tyler marshall barber chief financial officer hi tyler tyler batory janney capital market analyst hi good morning everyone thanks for taking my questions so wanted to circle back to the active pass base growth all time high 5 growth there can you talk a little bit more about how that was impacted by easter and it was a little bit of a drag but is there a way to think about that number maybe on an apples to apples basis versus last year and then i know i ve asked this question in the past but do you have any updated thoughts on where that growth rate might trend over the next few quarters jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer marshall can you take this marshall barber chief financial officer sure so obviously 5 growth is another record we ve had actually a record high active pass base every quarter since we started tracking in 2014 the easter shift caused both season passes and memberships to move into the second quarter if you think about it s about 200 000 in attendance and you know most of those were selling season passes and memberships too so i guess what i d say is that that shift now has we ve already recovered those those lost pass sales what was the second part of the question jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer what was the second part of the question tyler tyler batory janney capital market analyst just how that number might trend over the next few quarters i mean you re 5 now i think you were 8 in the fourth quarter of 2018 you re in the double digits a couple of years obviously there s the law of large numbers impacting that but at the same time you guys have made a lot of progress as far as selling membership so i m just wondering how we should think about that number the growth for that number going forward jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer i think tyler you know as we said before we won t give guidance with regard to what the growth is going to be we feel pretty good about what we re seeing right now i would tell you that and are encouraged we ve mentioned the success of membership but in terms of specifics we re not going to point that out to you and obviously we ll publish that as soon as we have the data with q2 tyler batory janney capital market analyst okay great and then probably a question here for marshall how we re looking at the second quarter specifically on the cost side of things again i m not sure how much detail you can give but obviously you re going to have incremental lease expense from some of the parks that you bought i m not sure if there is other incremental start up costs but any color you can give in terms of how to think about modeling costs for the second quarter maybe first half of the year specifically marshall barber chief financial officer yes so the second quarter we picked up the new parts on june 1st we will have lease expense and operating expenses in the second quarter for the first two months those will be new a lot of the rebranding costs that i mentioned in the prepared comments have taken place we ll have a little bit more as these parks open up beyond that i d say in terms of other expense growth it will really be a couple of extra days in mexico and then i think beyond that will be less than inflation just like we have been over the last several years tyler batory janney capital market analyst okay great that s all from me thank you jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer thanks very much operator your next question comes from the line of eric wold with b riley jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer hi eric marshall barber chief financial officer hi eric eric wold b riley analyst hey good morning guys so couple of questions just following up on the memberships kind of strategy i guess you talked about a lot of the strategies in the parks continue to get people to migrate up from single day and season pass to membership but have you seen now that we kind of have this for a year if you seen any trends of members migrating up within the membership program to higher tiers once they re in there and then in general of when members kind of choose the plan have you seen any noticable shifting demand between once year or another over the past year either better tiers or lower tiers depending on where they go jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer that s a really good question and i would say that with regard to the approach we ve taken in my prepared comments i talked about the fact that we have developed these membership centers both at the front gate but also within the parks tyler to be able to address exactly this so when a guest comes up to the gate no matter what ticket they were looking to get whether it was a single day pass or a season pass we will first sell them or attempt to sell them memberships and the membership tiers range from gold plus through to diamond elite and the price points on those vary from 94 for the basic gold plus through to 220 and over for the diamond elite and that excludes dining if you include dining obviously the price is even higher we worked very hard to sell them and the conversion rates are very high we ve been very successful and being able to do that so two things happen one we get pretty much everybody at the front gate and worked very hard to drive conversion to membership we also incent our folks to ensure that they get a benefit from selling membership so there s a double benefit there and then what we do is within that process of selling membership we will work very hard to try and convert people from a gold plus up to a diamond diamond elite to get the highest price point so we have had great success doing that on the initial sale but furthermore within the parks where someone comes up and either they have an existing season pass or a lower level membership we will actively try to shift them up from one level to the other we do that in park and we also do it online in terms of directly targeting guests who may have passes already and the success has been really honestly much better than we anticipate it s not just in terms of the conversions but it s also the split of people who are buying the higher priced higher tiered membership is much more than we originally anticipated we really thought that d be a much larger group that would buy the gold plus and platinum and a relatively small diamond diamond elite and the mix is has really shifted in a way that s very positive for us and very positive for our per caps long term eric wold b riley analyst perfect that s helpful thank you jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer thank you marshall barber chief financial officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of tim conder with wells fargo securities jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer hi tim marshall barber chief financial officer good morning tim timothy conder wells fargo securities analyst good morning gentlemen and thank you for all the color so far and much appreciated on the international if i may return to that any quantification that you can give us of the 11 million marshall how much of that was dubai and then gentlemen just maybe a little more clarification on china given cadence here were you receiving revenue for all three parks or was it just two parks and now is it just one so i guess that s the first part of the china question and then if you hit some other milestones with some government clearances is there a potential for a acceleration or recapture and we saw the bad side of it in q4 but maybe a positive recapture later on this year related to china jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer okay tim so i think your first question was with regard to dubai and i think you know we ve already gone through this question earlier and we i think we gave the answer there we ve never disclosed individual parks tim so we re not going to do that now i can tell you that it wasn t that one park had a dominant percentage of the overall revenue it came across multiple parks and dubai and itself was not a material amount we got a benefit but it s not a massive amount so i hope that helps you in terms of that with regard to china you really had a couple of pieces it s like which parks do we recognize revenue on and maybe marshall you take that and then i ll take part two which is with regard to the ability to accelerate if something changes marshall barber chief financial officer okay yeah so in terms of what parts contributed to q1 it was and we sort of mentioned a little bit it s the high end parks because they re progressing nicely saudi arabia which is also progressing and dubai which we talked about contributed in q1 in terms of going forward i think those the two parks haiyan and saudi arabia will be contributing they ll be progressing nicely in the future and then jim do you want to talk about acceleration maybe from an accounting jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer yeah i ll talk about the accounting first and then marshall barber chief financial officer so chongqing and nanjing as those parts when they do ultimately get approved then there will be depending on when the opening date is and we ve built in the 6 months and 12 months in the opening days that we talked about in the fourth quarter we will be basically taking that cash doing a catch up in the quarter that those get turned back on assuming that the they happen within the opening days stays where it was when we talked about in the fourth quarter jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer yeah and tim just with regard to where we are with those parks i got at this a little bit earlier when we were talking but i want to go over it again first and most importantly issues that we re facing aren t specific to us there being faced by basically all companies especially private companies in china i mentioned the riverside very successfully navigating the political and regulatory environment and we re optimistic that they will continue to do so the dates that we have described on the last call and still hold now really reflects awaiting government approval and that s something we can t define i d love to be able to say this is exactly going to be the date but at least we do know there have been several meetings with the local governments including with our own people there not just our partner and it does feel like conditions are improving but we ll know as time goes on and obviously as i said earlier tim we ll advise you guys and our shareholders as we know timothy conder wells fargo securities analyst okay that s helpful gentlemen marshall when it sounds like you re still accounting for the parks that you had last year under the lease perspective will that have any impact or change due to the new lease accounting rules and how the expenses recognized in 2019 or would that be adopted in for 2020 marshall barber chief financial officer so i think what you were talking about whether any of that expense will go down and interest expense that s really just for financing leases we don t have any of those basically what is in our operating expense and what was in the last year will be in this year from an accounting perspective we will have the additional lease costs that we talked about from january through may but in terms of the accounting didn t really impact our op expenses at all and won t going forward timothy conder wells fargo securities analyst okay great and then last question gentleman anyway you can quantify the q1 benefit as we re starting to see now the benefit of the membership anniversary in that 13 month and smoothing your revenues into the shoulder periods so to speak and then related to that how are the retention rates now within active pass or membership however way you want to comment on it versus maybe a year or two ago jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer let me answer part two and then marshall will take part one our retention rates have improved over the last year so they re actually better so i feel very good about that and the success of membership continues to reinforce that we want to really focus in on this area to make sure that we continue to improve retention because it s key obviously for the long term success of the program marshall do you want to talk about part one marshall barber chief financial officer yeah i m glad you asked that question tim because i noticed on the report there s in your report there s analysis that said if we had increased attendance by the 189 000 we were down and been flat to prior it s been flat on revenue per cap would have been under prior year if we would have had 180 000 people we would have had significantly more revenue this quarter actually is a perfect example of what we ve been saying with respect to members who go faster 12 month compulsory period in quarters with lower attendance we re able to generate revenues regardless of that attendance and so as that base 13 plus members grows our steady revenue from these members will continue to grow as well it s really the reason that the top five per cap quarters in our history have been the first quarter of the last five years as we grow in the membership program it s really one of the great benefits of the program but since you d asked the question i mentioned it on the analysis we did run we just assumed if you adjust for the lost attendance using the current attendance mix that we had in q1 our first quarter would still be a record an all time record per cap so we love the 13 plus members there is going to be a lot of enrolling into the 13th month in april may june july august this year that really show some growth and again it s one of the really great benefits of the program jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer and i think tim building on that further if you think about the company and where it is with such a good position and the industry overall is a great industry and it has not only has a high barriers to entry but also it s very resilient in a downturn and with our membership program and with that recurring revenue we are simply strengthening ourselves even further for the long term in the event that there is any impact recession wise or otherwise timothy conder wells fargo securities analyst okay you know i think the point we were trying to make is just if you just for example take the attendance if it was flat that your admissions only dropped would have dropped a little bit and without factoring in that related to 190 but just playing the math with the denominator that the admissions would barely would have been essentially flat while the in park spend would have been down quite a bit more and then just making the point that you re there is clearly it appears to be some shift from the anniversary of the 13th month that is now smoothing the seasonality of that admissions revenue which is a good thing from a cash flow perspective jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer yeah i think overall it s a very good thing from a cash flow perspective we ve always talked about the fact that you may remember if you went back nine years tim the company lost money in two quarters we ve now turned the fourth quarter into a massive moneymaker and our goal is to take the first quarter and turn that into a massive moneymaker and membership is helping us to do that it s a very good thing under any scenario whatever way we adjust it we would have still had a record per cap and a record quarter so we feel pretty good about it timothy conder wells fargo securities analyst okay thank you gentlemen perfect color jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer thanks tim marshall barber chief financial officer yeah thank you tim operator your next question comes from the line of ian zaffino with oppenheimer jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer hi ian marshall barber chief financial officer good morning ian mark zhang oppenheimer analyst hi hey good morning guys this is mark on for ian so most of our questions have been answered but i just wanted to quickly check it seems like the majority of the like as key parts in china this is on track for approval but is there any i guess like new incremental delays to any other parks that we should be aware of or you foresee coming in the sort of near term thanks jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer no mark there are no delays that that we re aware of on any of the parks the same timing as we outlined on the fourth quarter call and i would also add that we are working hard our team is working very hard to identify other potential new parks and we have discussions on ongoing with various people but obviously the timing of those will depend on when we can reach agreements mark zhang oppenheimer analyst okay perfect that s it for us thank you jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer thank you mark operator and your final question comes from the line of brennan matthews with berenberg marshall barber chief financial officer good morning brennan brennan matthews berenberg capital markets analyst hi good morning thank you very much for taking my question i just wanted to ask i think you mentioned something about kind of launching or relaunching a new app this year maybe even this quarter kind of any detail on what some of those new features maybe and are you thinking maybe about could you ever have kind of maybe members specific features or think about using an app as a way to kind of engage your members in at all jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer you had just you hit a very hot button for me i love what you just asked and it s exactly the approach that we re taking our members are our most valuable and most important guests everything we do in and out of the park is designed to make sure that the members feel special that they re taking care of and so what we re doing overall is making sure that from a technology perspective we ve got a lot going on to the new app will allow multiple things including mobile food ordering we re also deploying point of sale in various parts of the park and allowing access that way so that we can get directly to not just members but all guests and then we ve got new mobile front gate systems to ensure that we reduce wait time and we ve dedicated some parts at the front gate just for members so that they can get in even faster and we ve also worked on a new website that is optimized for phones first in ada and other areas the app itself to your question mark it s redesigned really to make it even easier to use and it has improved home screen messaging we ve updated interactive park map technology which allows for quick map update and styling changes as i said we ve got the mobile food orderings the people can conveniently order ahead we can upsell directly we reduced the wait time for food as a result of that we ve also built in and this was a question that came earlier the ability to purchase memberships and season passes on the app and we re the only company i think that has this membership loyalty program and so that loyalty program is directly on the app and allows you to easily track point balances check information ride shows et cetera it also gives ride wait time accurate very accurate ride wait times so overall it s very positive both from a user perspective as guests enjoy using something that is easier for them but it also allows us to target upsell opportunities both in terms of our passes but also dining and flash pass so there s a lot different in the app and really targeted one to please the guests but two to ensure we can sell them more while they re in the park and even outside of the park brennan matthews berenberg capital markets analyst yeah i d say going forward i think what we ve done in the reason you see all these improvements as we brought the design of the app and programming app in house and so you ll see going forward continuous improvement month in month out you ll see updates to the app that ll add new features so yeah we re very excited about the app and where it is today and where it s headed all right great thank you so much jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer thank you very much marshall barber chief financial officer thank you brennan jim reid anderson chairman president and chief executive officer okay i think that s our last question so in closing i would like to say thank you for joining the call and thank you for all of your ongoing support of the company i m very optimistic about the future of our company as our growth strategies continue to build momentum for the short medium and long term i truly believe we have the best employees in the industry and it s the hard work and dedication of the talented team members who ve delivered time and time again to give me so much confidence in the future please come out and visit one of our parks soon to see our amazing lineup of new rides and attractions better yet join our

gaap financial measures net interest income fte which is used in computing net interest margin fte and operating efficiency ratio fte provides valuable additional insight into the net interest margin and the efficiency ratio by adjusting for differences in tax treatment of interest income sources the entire fte adjustment is attributable to interest income on earning assets which is used in computing yield on earning assets interest expense and the related cost of interest bearing liabilities and cost of funds ratios are not affected by the fte components 2 these are non gaap financial measures tangible common equity is used in the calculation of certain profitability capital and per share ratios the company believes tangible common equity and the related ratios are meaningful measures of capital adequacy because they provide a meaningful base for period to period and company to company comparisons which the company believes will assist investors in assessing the capital of the company and its ability to absorb potential losses 3 these are non gaap financial measures the company believes that rotce is a meaningful supplement to gaap financial measures and useful to investors because it measures the performance of a business consistently across time without regard to whether components of the business were acquired or developed internally in periods prior to december 31 2018 the company has not added amortization of intangibles tax effected to net income gaap and operating net income non gaap when calculating rotce and operating rotce respectively the company has adjusted its presentation for all periods in this release 4 these are non gaap financial measures operating measures exclude merger related costs unrelated to the company s normal operations the company believes these measures are useful to investors as they exclude certain costs resulting from acquisition activity and allow investors to more clearly see the combined economic results of the organization s operations 5 all ratios at march 31 2019 are estimates and subject to change pending the company s filing of its fr y9 c all other periods are presented as filed 6 the operating efficiency ratio fte excludes the amortization of intangible assets and merger related costs this measure is similar to the measure utilized by the company when analyzing corporate performance and is also similar to the measure utilized for incentive compensation the company believes this measure is useful to investors as it excludes certain costs resulting from acquisition activity allowing for greater comparability with others in the industry and allowing investors to more clearly see the combined economic results of the organization s operations in prior periods the company has not excluded the amortization of intangibles from noninterest expense when calculating the operating efficiency ratio fte the company has adjusted its presentation for all periods in this

gaap financial measures net interest income fte which is used in computing net interest margin fte and operating efficiency ratio fte provides valuable additional insight into the net interest margin and the efficiency ratio by adjusting for differences in tax treatment of interest income sources the entire fte adjustment is attributable to interest income on earning assets which is used in computing yield on earning assets interest expense and the related cost of interest bearing liabilities and cost of funds ratios are not affected by the fte components 2 these are non gaap financial measures tangible common equity is used in the calculation of certain profitability capital and per share ratios the company believes tangible common equity and the related ratios are meaningful measures of capital adequacy because they provide a meaningful base for period to period and company to company comparisons which the company believes will assist investors in assessing the capital of the company and its ability to absorb potential losses 3 these are non gaap financial measures the company believes that rotce is a meaningful supplement to gaap financial measures and useful to investors because it measures the performance of a business consistently across time without regard to whether components of the business were acquired or developed internally in periods prior to

results of the organization s operations 5 all ratios at march 31 2019 are estimates and subject to change pending the company s filing of its fr y9 c all other periods are presented as filed 6 the

activity allowing for greater comparability with others in the industry and allowing investors to more clearly see the combined economic results of the organization s operations in prior periods the

feature article 24 04 2019 listen history of the struggle for land the former colonisers robbed our parents looted our cattle displaced our parents exploited our mineral resources and overused our fertile lands from 1890 to 2000 they unjustly enriched themselves with over ninety years of colonialism subjugation and crimes against humanity zimbabwe was supposed to get restitution from white rhodesians upon attainment of independence the struggle for independence was based on land a compromise was reached which would allow white farmers to continue occupying land and allow a system of willing buyer and willing seller 2 of the white population owned 70 of the arable land between 1890 and 1896 the british south african company bsac granted almost 16 million acres of the indigenous land to the european settlers who had volunteered to take up arms and defend the colony during the 2nd chimurenga war when our fathers and mothers rose up against settler colonialism this was the land of our ancestors which gave the whites superior political and economic status brought about from proceeds of plunder and theft of our land after the second world war ww2 the king of england flew the british war veterans to rhodesia now zimbabwe to give them farms as thank you for fighting for britain on the land that was occupied by blacks this armed struggle culminated in the lancaster house talks lancaster house agreement constitution the british government reneged on lancaster house agreement so the farmers don t deserve a dime from zimbabwe under the lancaster house agreement the british government pledged technical and financial assistance for land redistribution an obligation that was later reneged on at lancaster conference there was a deadlock on land and americans promised verbally to provide funds for the new zimbabwean government to acquire land on a willing buyer willing seller basis us government never provided those funds the lancaster house constitution was a defective document designed by the british to ensure that white settler privileges were prolonged the united kingdom broke the financial commitments it made in 1979 it was a betrayal of the promises it made to ensure a settlement margaret thatcher s government was largely interested in protecting the property rights of the white minority land revolution in zimbabwe agitation for the land restitution started as early as 1990s with the svosve farm invasions by the land hungry war veterans and peasants who were frustrated at the slow or no pace with regards to land in 2000 pervasive and widespread farm occupations by the landless indigenous people took place over 5000 farms occupied by 4500 white farmers were taken over today zimbabwe masses are proud owners of their land as hundreds of thousand families have been resettled on millions of hectares of arable land colonialists seized some of the best agricultural land and much of it remained in the hands of white farmers after independence in 1980 while many blacks were landless during the land revolution the impact on the agricultural sector was immediately felt the economy relied mostly on tobacco and horticulture for foreign currency the agro processors that dominate the industry suffered beyond the direct impact of the land revolution a major casualty were property rights which became a by word of critics of the land reform in zimbabwe by taking away white privately owned land and turning it into state property zimbabwe was widely accused of going against a key tenet of capitalism the right to private property among the land taken over during the land revolution were farms under the bilateral investment promotion and protection agreements bippas which are deals between countries protecting each other s investments from takeover illegal economic sanctions in response to the land revolution the western governments imposed illegal economic sanctions on zimbabwe outside the united nations framework the sanctions have collapsed the healthcare system education is now beyond the reach of many and the economy is comatose and moribund the few remaining working class are desperately in need of a living wage in 2001 us imposed sanctions on zimbabwe demanding respect for ownership and title to property through the zimbabwe democracy and recovery act zidera when washington renewed its sanctions on zimbabwe last year 2018 it made white compensation one of the key reforms as a precondition to end sanctions this act says zimbabwe administration must enforce the southern african development committee sadc tribunal rulings from 2007 to 2010 including 18 disputes involving employment commercial and human rights cases surrounding disposed zimbabwe commercial farmers and agricultural companies the tribunal ruled that land reform in zimbabwe was racially discriminatory all farmers must be given back their land and that they must be compensated for the land without this reform sanctions will remain in place the government is being dictated to by washington london and eu using eo13469 and zidera sanctions usa uk and eu must unconditionally remove sanctions not a condition of first compensating their kith and kin on development made on our land our forefathers lost cattle land and suffered dehumanization and dispossession at the hands of these colonial vipers our economy has no foreign currency no fuel and no cash in banks and in the market no jobs or empowerment projects yet we want to pay white people whose hostility to our economy and country is the reason for this quagmire compensating white farmers is part of the zimbabwe reform agenda compensation and neo liberal capitulation in an attempt by the zimbabwe administration to re engage with the international capital the issue of white farmer compensation is persistently coming up the zimbabwe administration wants to prove that progress is being made towards compensation ahead of the just ended 2019 spring meeting at imf in washington raising funds to compensate invaders is the reason why there is impoverishing austerity measures by the finance ministry white farmer compensation is a reality and our country will be stuck with a debt between us 9 to us 30 billion zimbabwe government is giving compensation to white farmers who never paid reparations these millions of dollars could be used on black famers to be productive on the farmers which they benefited during the land revolution this money can be used to resuscitate the ailing industry the imperialists are putting pressure on the zimbabwean government to compensate white farmers the zimbabwean government should call for a referendum for people to decide on this emotive issue of land or to get parliamentary approval the land issue it s a national interest issue which people must decide about 3 5 million citizens are living outside the borders of zimbabwe as migrants prostitutes refugees and being subjected to afro phobia attacks and precarious labour zimbabwe government says compensation will not be for land but for improvements on the farms which include dams dip tanks farm houses and other infrastructure constructed on the farms over the years whatever developments they now claim are because they exploited our parents through forced labour they forced our parents to pay hut tax dog tax and cattle tax we are the victims and must be the ones to be compensated instead of directing the scarce resources towards looters robbers and enslaver s instead lets direct that money to address socio economic problems affecting our citizens before considering compensating white farmers zimbabwe government is still paying a us 480 million loan for the kariba dam at 5 a year interest since 1968 it took out another bond for us 114 million to pay the remainder two years ago now how is it going to take zimbabwe to pay 3 billion 9 billion to 30 billion at 10 to compensate white farmers in the current zimbabwe constitution it mandates them to pay for compensation on improvements but paradoxically the same constitution mandates the government to give its people shelter housing free quality education social services economic progress equality and dignity in section 27 of the constitution that must be fulfilled first as people are suffering zimbabwe has reached an agreement with the international monetary fund imf on a programme of economic policies and structural reforms as a condition to re engage with international financial institutions currently zimbabwe has arrears of about us 2 2 billion with world bank the african development bank and european investment bank by 2018 the government claims to have paid out some 200 million to 240 white farmers as compensation there are some extreme voices among former white farmers who have drawn attention to the clause in zidera act that stipulates respect for ownership and title to property as a condition for the lifting of sanctions that means a reversal to the land reform with white farmers backed by western banks being able to buy back the land some have been talking to the us congress the government needs to be very careful they could be wasting billions on compensation and still demands of the most bitter elements among former white farmers will not be satisfied and they will still lobby for sanctions to remain this what happened in haiti haiti zimbabwe similarity and lessons in 1804 haiti became the first independent republic in latin america the second in the western hemisphere after the united states haiti was also the first modern state founded by blacks the first to abolish slavery and remains the only state founded and sustained by slaves who won their freedom by force of arms haiti found itself alone isolated no foreign nation granted haiti recognition haiti history has similarities with what zimbabwe is facing today haiti succumbed to pressure for it to get haiti french diplomatic recognition it had to compensate the french and the colonial famers in cash for their lost property land and slaves haitian president boyer signed the agreement under more than pressure of diplomatic isolation haiti was compelled to borrow from a french bank the impact of debt burden immediately impacted ordinary haitians president boyer imposed a series of tax policies to generate revenue to pay the indemnity this compensation did not improve the economy of haiti in anyway the debt drained the haitian treasury of its capital it took haiti 122 years to repay its independence debt it did so 140 years after the abolition of the slave trade and 85 years after the emancipation proclamation in the same year the nazis paid for their crimes including slavery at nuremberg haiti still laboured to repay in cash the freedom its founding fathers had won with their lives this one is a lesson which the zimbabwe government must take a leaf from the poverty of modern haiti is inextricably linked to the independence debt today haiti is by far the poorest nation in the americas 80 of haitians live below the poverty line life expectancy is 51 years the united nations ranks haiti number 153 out of 177 on its human development index which measures poverty literacy education life expectancy child birth and other health factors the white farmers demand for compensation is comically outrageous zimbabwe colonial debt zimbabwe s finance minister said zimbabwe s total debt stands at us 16 9 billion with domestic debt at us 9 5 billion and foreign debt at us 7 4 billion zimbabwe is working to clear a us 2 5 billion debt with african development bank and restructure a us 2 8 billion debt owed to paris club members zimbabwe is still suffering from having to pay off loans accrued by a pre independence white supremacist government some eight years ago jubilee debt campaign investigated the history of zimbabwe s debt that debt is unpayable by a county that is in intensive care zimbabwe debt has its genesis from loans which were used to prop the military of the white minority racist government of rhodesia now zimbabwe in violation of the united nations declared sanctions this debt worth us 700 million at that time was inherited by the newly independent administration it inherited high levels of poverty and inequality as a consequence of policies that exploited the black majority the new administration had imminent security threat from apartheid south africa and accrued loans to prevent destabilisation from hostile south africa at that time the british were supporting apartheid south africa these debts are being continuously recycled by the international monetary fund and the world bank as they respond to droughts and natural disasters in zimbabwe zimbabwe has since appealed to the imf for an intervention in the wake of the destruction and displacement of people by the cyclone idai imf has already shown keen interest to extend the loan on the condition of implementing structural adjustment reforms in modern economic language this entail austerity cutting down on government spending trade liberalization freezing of wages and removals of subsidies and business control by government the long term consequences of these reformist policies are devastating even to a well meaning government these policies have destroyed many least developing countries zimbabwe continues to be weighed down by this colonial debt 39 years after independence and also by policies which were promoted by the west zimbabwe must instead demand the immediate cancellation of that debt as well as demand genuine aid and investment not attached to free market reforms western governments and international financial institutions must apologise for their previous crimes implications on african liberation the move to compensate white farmers will collapse land expropriation agenda in southern africa and africa as a whole the rest of africa was looking to zimbabwe as a beacon and leadership for african total liberation and self determination what happens in zimbabwe with regards to compensation shall have precedence for south africa namibia or any other african country that seeks to take land from colonisers compensating white farmers will be reversing the gains made so far in the continental land movement it is against what our freedom fighters died for and totally against the spirit of the african liberation struggle zimbabwe people are dying from poverty and economic strangulation at the behest of these former white farmers

financial measures these non gaap financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by u s gaap and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to the calculation of similar measures for other companies management does not intend these items to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related gaap measures adjusted profit per share the company believes it is important to separately quantify the profit impact of two significant items in order for the company s results to be meaningful to readers these items consist of a discrete tax benefit related to u s tax reform in the first quarter of 2019 and 2018 restructuring costs which were incurred to generate longer term benefits the company does not consider these items indicative of earnings from ongoing business activities and believes the non gaap measure provides investors with useful perspective on underlying business results and trends and aids with assessing the company s period over period results the company intends to discuss adjusted profit per share for the fourth quarter and full year 2019 excluding a mark to market gain or loss for remeasurement of pension and other postemployment benefit

for the first quarter of 2019 amounted to 140 2 million an increase of 2 5 million when compared to net interest income of 137 7 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 the increase in net interest income was mainly due to a 2 7 million increase in interest income on commercial and construction loans reflecting the effect of the upward repricing of variable rate commercial loans higher collections of interest payments on nonaccrual loans and the growth in the balance of the performing commercial loan portfolio the aggregate average balance of the commercial and construction loan portfolios increased by 74 7 million net of the effect of reductions in non performing commercial and construction loans these increases were partially offset by the adverse effect of two fewer days in the first quarter which resulted in a decrease of approximately 1 2 million in interest income on commercial and construction loans a 1 4 million increase in interest income on consumer loans primarily due to an increase of 86 2 million in the average balance of this portfolio partially offset by the adverse effect of two fewer days in the first quarter that resulted in a decrease of approximately 1 1 million in interest income on consumer loans the aggregate average balance of auto loans and finance leases grew by 67 9 million and the average balance of personal loans increased by 14 9 million a 0 5 million increase in interest income from interest bearing cash balances reflecting both an increase of 53 1 million in the average balance primarily deposits maintained at the federal reserve bank of new york and an increase in the federal funds target rate partially offset by a 1 6 million increase in interest expense primarily reflecting an increase of approximately 0 8 million related to the increase in the average balances of federal home loan bank fhlb advances and repurchase agreements and an increase of approximately 1 1 million related to the effect of higher market interest rates in the average cost of retail cds and savings deposits the increase in the average balances of these borrowings reflects i the full quarter effect of 120 0 million of 3 year fhlb advances average cost of 2 65 obtained in the latter part of the fourth quarter of 2018 which more than offset the effect of the 70 0 million fhlb advances that matured late in 2018 which carried an average cost of 1 58 and ii the full quarter effect of the 50 1 million short term repurchase agreement entered into in mid december 2018 and repaid in march 2019 these increases were partially offset by a reduction of approximately 0 6 million in interest expense associated with two fewer days in the first quarter a 0 4 million decrease in interest income on investment securities primarily due to an 80 1 million decrease in the average balance of u s agency mortgage backed securities mbs net interest margin was 4 92 up 15 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2018 primarily reflecting the upward repricing of variable rate commercial loans and higher interest collections on nonaccrual loans as mentioned above provision for loan and lease losses the provision for loan and lease losses for the first quarter of 2019 was 11 8 million compared to 7 6 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 as mentioned above a loan loss reserve release of approximately 6 4 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2019 in connection with revised estimates of the hurricane related qualitative reserves for consumer and commercial and construction loans associated with the effects of hurricanes irma and maria compared to a 5 7 million loan loss reserve release recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018 approximately 3 0 million of the 6 4 million reserve release recorded in the first quarter was attributable to the updated payment patterns and credit risk analyses applied to consumer borrowers subject to payment deferral programs that expired early in 2018 in addition relationship officers continued to closely monitor the performance of hurricane affected commercial loan customers this monitoring activity resulted in a 3 4 million reserve release associated with the resolution of uncertainties surrounding the repayment prospects of a hurricane affected commercial customer the significant overall uncertainties that complicated management s early assessments of hurricane related credit losses have been largely addressed in the 18 month period since the hurricanes and the hurricanes effect on credit quality in future periods will be reflected in the normal process for determining the allowance for loan losses and not through a separate hurricane related qualitative reserve some uncertainties remain however including the resolution of insurance claims for certain individual customers the 4 2 million increase in the provision for loan and lease losses as compared to the 2018 fourth quarter provision was driven by the following factors a 5 0 million net loan loss reserve release for commercial and construction loans in the first quarter of 2019 including the aforementioned 3 4 million release associated with revised estimates of the hurricane related qualitative reserve for commercial loans compared to an 8 9 million net reserve release in the fourth quarter of 2018 including a 1 5 million release associated with revised estimates of the hurricane related qualitative reserve for commercial loans the negative variance of 3 9 million primarily reflects i a 6 7 million decrease in loan loss recoveries primarily due to the effect in the previous quarter of a 7 4 million loan loss recovery on the repayment of a commercial mortgage troubled debt restructured loan ii a 3 2 million charge recorded in the first quarter of 2019 to increase the specific reserve of a commercial mortgage loan in the florida region and iii a 2 1 million charge off taken in the first quarter of 2019 on the aforementioned restructuring of a commercial mortgage loan in puerto rico these variances were partially offset by commercial loans reserve releases of approximately 6 4 million in the first quarter of 2019 related to improvements in historical loss rates used for the determination of general reserves and a 1 9 million increase in releases associated with revised estimates of the hurricane related qualitative reserve for commercial loans a 2 4 million increase in the provision for consumer loans reflecting the effect of a 1 3 million increase in net charge offs and a 1 2 million decrease in releases associated with the hurricane related qualitative reserves for consumer loans partially offset by a 2 2 million decrease in the provision for residential mortgage loans mainly related to the effect in the fourth quarter of 2018 of changes in the housing price index considered as part of the determination of the general reserve for residential mortgages see credit quality allowance for loan and lease losses below for additional

included as part of other operating income in the table above reflecting the effect of seasonal contingent commissions of 2 7 million recorded in the first quarter of 2019 based on the prior year s production of insurance policies partially offset by the effect of a 0 3 million adjustment recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018 to decrease the unearned insurance commissions reserve based on

after the date of such statements except as required by the federal securities laws basis of presentation use of non gaap financial measures this press release contains non gaap financial measures non gaap financial measures are used when management believes they will be helpful to an investor s understanding of the corporation s results of operations or financial position where non gaap financial measures are used the comparable gaap financial measure as well as the reconciliation of the non gaap financial measure to the comparable gaap financial measure can be found in the text or in the tables in or attached to this earnings release any analysis of these non gaap financial measures should be used only in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share the tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share are non gaap financial measures generally used by the financial community to evaluate capital adequacy tangible common equity is total equity less preferred equity goodwill core deposit intangibles and other intangibles such as the purchased credit card relationship intangible and the insurance customer relationship intangible tangible assets are total assets less goodwill core deposit intangibles and other intangibles such as the purchased credit card relationship intangible and the insurance customer relationship intangible management and many stock analysts use the tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share in conjunction with more traditional bank capital ratios to compare the capital adequacy of banking organizations with significant amounts of goodwill or other intangible assets typically stemming from the use of the purchase method of accounting for mergers and acquisitions accordingly the corporation believes that disclosure of these financial measures may be useful to investors neither tangible common equity nor tangible assets or the related measures should be considered in isolation or as a substitute for stockholders equity total assets or any other measure calculated in accordance with gaap moreover the manner in which the corporation calculates its tangible common equity tangible assets and any other related measures may differ from that of other companies reporting measures with similar names adjusted pre tax pre provision income adjusted pre tax pre provision income is a non gaap performance metric that management uses and believes that investors may find useful in analyzing underlying performance trends particularly in times of economic stress including as a result of natural catastrophes such as the hurricanes that affected the corporation s service areas in 2017 adjusted pre tax pre provision income as defined by management represents net income excluding income tax expense benefit and the provision for loan and lease losses as well as special items that management believes are not reflective of core operating performance are not expected to reoccur with any regularity or may reoccur at uncertain times and in uncertain amounts net interest income excluding valuations and on a tax equivalent basis net interest income interest rate spread and net interest margin are reported excluding the changes in the fair value of derivative instruments and on a tax equivalent basis in order to provide to investors additional information about the corporation s net interest income that management uses and believes should facilitate comparability and analysis the changes in the fair value of derivative instruments have no effect on interest due or interest earned on interest bearing liabilities or interest earning assets respectively the tax equivalent adjustment to net interest income recognizes the income tax savings when comparing taxable and tax exempt assets and assumes a marginal income tax rate income from tax exempt earning assets is increased by an amount equivalent to the taxes that would have been paid if this income had been taxable at statutory rates management believes that it is a standard practice in the banking industry to present net interest income interest rate spread and net interest margin on a fully tax equivalent basis this adjustment puts all earning assets most notably tax exempt securities and tax exempt loans on a common basis that facilitates comparison of results to the results of peers financial measures adjusted to exclude the effect of special items that management believes are not reflective of core operating performance are not expected to reoccur with any regularity or may reoccur at uncertain times and in uncertain amounts to supplement the corporation s financial statements presented in accordance with gaap the corporation uses and believes that investors would benefit from disclosure of non gaap financial measures that reflect adjustments to net income to exclude items that management identifies as special items because management believes they are not reflective of core operating performance are not expected to reoccur with any regularity or may reoccur at uncertain times and in uncertain amounts this press release includes the following non gaap financial measures for the first quarter of 2019 and the fourth and first quarters of 2018 that reflect the described items that were excluded for one of those reasons adjusted net income for the first quarter of 2019 and the fourth and first quarters of 2018 reflect the following exclusions reserve

saudi arabia and the united arab emirates announced on sunday 3 billion of financial support in the form of 500 million in central bank deposits and a promised 2 5 billion in humanitarian support including oil and gas transfers in the delicate context of transition from 30 years of dictatorship under omar al bashir some of those protesting for a full transfer of authority to a civilian government did not respond with gratitude to the announcement reportedly chanting keep your money their fear is that the influence of saudi arabia and the united arab emirates will entrench support for the military at a moment that democratic politics are opening but there are few countries in the developing world or elsewhere that can turn away such a substantial offer of direct support with so few strings attached the phenomenon of gulf arab state support to a widening sphere of influence in the horn of africa middle east and pakistan is only growing in intensity and since 2011 the exercise of economic statecraft whether through direct commitments of financial support promises of foreign direct investment or in kind oil and gas transfers have been plentiful and from sources on both sides of the gcc political divide in the last 12 months saudi arabia and the united arab emirates have committed 6 billion each to pakistan 3 billion to ethiopia 10 billion to bahrain 2 5 billion to jordan 830 million to tunisia 1 billion to iraq while the focus here is on the uae and saudi arabia kuwait is a frequent donor and provider of cash deposits and qatar provided ample support to egypt between 2011 and 2013 made inroads to financially support sudan and somalia and has made commitments to buy lebanese debt just this year sometimes these promises remain just that words the leverage that commitments create can be as useful as actual delivery of support but what is certain is that there is a shift in sources of direct financial support to emerging markets as balance of payments support or cash deposits to central banks to shore up currency value favorable loans or extensions of credit through debt purchases the shift is away from international financial institutions like the imf and world bank and from aid from the united states and the european union as i argued here the new masters of development finance are china and the gulf arab states in the middle east horn of africa and south asia these two forces are often working in synergy and as i have written this trifecta of aid investment and direct financial intervention is a form of economic statecraft its rationale is the security and prosperity of the donor investor because the gulf arab states have recognized a vital nexus between development and security in their surrounding geography the logic of supporting friendly neighboring governments to secure political allies combined with investing for their own food security real estate ventures and state linked energy projects is strategic their methods are often highly personalistic and can create ripple effects and instability in domestic politics of the recipient state especially in states in the midst of political transition it can also be wasteful when one relationship fails or the recipient leader interlocutor is out of power the process begins again why is the delivery and source of development assistance shifting now the logic of development assistance after world war ii has been based on a consensus that open markets are best able to deliver growth and that leverage from international financial institutions to encourage liberalization and rule of law can nudge or force governments to make better economic choices that advice has been largely successful as the world bank reports at creating remarkable and unprecedented progress in reducing extreme poverty over the past quarter century in 2015 more than a billion fewer people were living in extreme poverty than in 1990 the progress has been driven by strong global growth and the rising wealth of many developing countries particularly in the world s most populous regions of east asia and paciﬁc and south asia the opening of china and the ignition of economies in south asia driven by a global consensus on the power of liberalization and access to finance has changed the world in fact china s access to world bank loans and more broadly the advice of institutions of a global liberal economic order have facilitated its growth that advice has served the united states well over the last 70 years american financial institutions have been providers of capital facilitated foreign direct investment and created new markets for their own products and culture and now that consensus is experiencing a profound disruption most visible in the middle east and africa the united states has failed to provide a leadership role advocating in defense of liberal economic institutions and rule of law as a basis for economic development and political order since the beginning of the arab uprisings in 2011 and in the eight years since not only is the perception of american disengagement becoming a reality on the ground in the gulf there is a real vacuum of financial resources and the ideals to stand behind them in transitions across the arab world multilateral lenders and aid providers are simply outclassed and out bargained whereas international financial institutions have used their leverage in providing access to finance to encourage prudent fiscal policy transparency and rule of law to support a liberal economic order gulf arab aid investment and financial support has only one string attached access and not even loyalty development aid and finance as we have known it since the bretton woods system formed is now in danger in a panel discussion i participated in last week at the brookings institution alex rondos the eu special representative to the horn of africa gave an interesting analogy we provide nutrition they give cocaine to describe how gulf states offer a quick and easy fix to financial vulnerability this is compared to official development assistance by traditional donors like the eu and united states the problem is that the bretton woods institutions the united states and the european union are in no position to compete with the amount of financial support or the speed of its delivery that the gulf arab states can offer the best scenario is partnership and engagement and a strong advocacy for institutional support rather than head of state relationships what has enabled the gulf arab states to project this financial power and influence four key changes in the regional political economy have allowed this policy shift the enormous growth of resources in a magic decade of high oil prices from 2003 to 2014 and accumulated savings and sovereign wealth which can now be deployed a new generation of leadership in the uae under mohammed bin zayed that is security and expansion minded with a vision for uae leadership in the region and which has been accompanied by a stronger security state and consolidation of federal power at the center of the government saudi arabia s generational shift came in 2015 with king salman s rocket empowerment of mohamed bin salman and even in qatar with the 2013 shift from emir hamad to emir tamim consolidated the qatari penchant for regional foreign policy aid and interventionism post 2011 politics which have justified this interventionist and expansionist vision as a counter to the arab spring s direct threat to regime stability paired with a sense of shifting geopolitical alliances in which america is less present less reliable and less understanding of the demands of gulf leaders the war in yemen which began in late 2014 with the uae and saudi arabia engaging in march 2015 changed the calculus of independent defensive and offensive behavior the war has only exacerbated a saudi and emirati perception of us disengagement from the region heightened the threat from iran and justified shifts in both domestic and foreign security posture what do gulf arab states expect in return there is absolutely an expectation of return on investment from state projects in energy infrastructure including massive investment in ports development and real estate but there are also less expectations of policy shifts in recipient states because patterns of delivery tend to be rapid negotiated on behalf of heads of state and without institutional follow up there is a vulnerability in the sustainability of financial support there is also a willingness on the part of gulf arab states to take a loss take for example in april 2018 when the uae abruptly canceled a training agreement with the somali military and closed a humanitarian operation in the country removing staff and shutting a hospital with little notice the decision was based on a dispute over aid delivery at the mogadishu airport and the treatment of emirati military personnel the sensitivity to slights and the general lack of bureaucratic integration between donor and recipient is a vulnerability for this new style of development and humanitarian assistance why does it matter developing countries from africa to the middle east to asia now have some interesting choices in development finance partners where the money comes from matters first sources of development finance create institutional consequences in the recipient state second the deal making of development finance creates political alliances that transcend the development transaction and in many cases can reinforce patronage networks and personalistic politics third the efficacy of project delivery and its long term viability whether infrastructure investment in utilities or social infrastructure in health and education depends on governance competition and the mutual benefits of rule based markets sudan s windfall today will be tomorrow s institutional challenge to build open and rule based markets that create jobs and provide food for its citizens

morning everyone thank you for joining us as you saw in our press release we delivered a strong start to 2019 the company posted solid quarterly revenue growth and overcame the carryover impact of commodity currency and tariff related headwinds to deliver modest earnings expansion first quarter revenues were 3 3 billion up 4 versus prior year this included a robust 5 organic growth and 3 from acquisitions which were partially offset by a 4 point currency headwind and price continues to materialize with 2 points of growth attributable to prices in the quarter and tools storage continued its impressive performance delivering 7 organic growth with all regions and business units contributing the tools team is leveraging a powerful set of catalyst complemented by an intense focus on commercial execution to consistently deliver above market growth and once again craftsman e commerce new product innovation and irwin lenox helped propel the tools storage performance you ll hear more from jeff ansell on this during his remarks industrial total revenues grew 10 as the nelson and ies attachments acquisitions were partially offset by automotive market pressure and currency and security demonstrated forward progress delivering both operating margin dollar and rate improvement versus 1q 18 and a year into our 2 year strategic review process the security team has a strategy along with a detailed plan and is in full execution mode on the business transformation don allan will provide some more color during his remarks and we will cover it in depth at our may 16th investor day adjusted eps for the quarter was 1 42 up 2 with a sharp focus on cost control our business teams delivered a strong operational performance and overcame approximately 160 million of carryover headwinds in the first quarter our outperformance was very encouraging as we contemplate prospects for the remainder of the year coupled with strong organic growth we expect modest margin rate accretion for the total year with the return to near 15 levels in the back half assuming a stable input cost and tariff environment this is a simple function of price cost timing as the year unfolds moving to m a we also closed two strategic transactions in the quarter completing our acquisition of the pengo and paladin businesses from ies as well as our 20 equity invest investment in mtd a large supplier of craftsman outdoor power equipment as well as owner of the cub cadet and troy bilt brands with ies attachments in combination with our hydraulic tools business we now have a large portfolio of high quality performance driven attachment solutions that will that creates a well defined path for continued profitable growth we expect ies to contribute approximately 300 million in revenue and be accretive to earnings in 2019 this asset has strong brands deep customer relationships and its independent dealer network has approximately 60 of its revenue related to aftermarket applications our focus is now on integration and achieving the cost and revenue synergies from the deal our minority investment in mtd represents a strategic bet on long term growth in the 20 billion lawn and garden market structured in a financially prudent manner the transaction includes an option for us to purchase the remaining 80 in 2021 and beyond and we re excited to partner with mtd a leading outdoor gas powered equipment manufacturer with a great history and a great team and finally based on our strong first quarter performance we are raising our 2019 full year adjusted eps guidance by a nickel to a range of 8 50 to 8 70 so in summary 2019 is off to a good start and our first quarter results provide us with good momentum and additional flexibility to execute and deliver the year leveraging our growth catalysts and sfs 2 0 operating system we are continuing to lean into the external environment as the headwinds begin to dissipate we remain focused on strong free cash flow generation and the return to operating margin expansion through productivity cost control and pricing and additionally we are undertaking an extensive array of exciting new margin focused initiatives to ensure rate expansion in 2019 and beyond more to come on these initiatives at our investor day in a few weeks and with that i ll hand it over to don allan for a more detailed discussion on first quarter results and 2019 guidance don donald allan jr executive vice president chief financial officer thank you jim and good morning everyone i will now take a deeper dive into our business segment results for the first quarter tools storage revenue increased 3 as 7 organic growth was offset by 4 points of currency pressure organic growth included 5 points of volume and 2 points of price we continue to see the benefits from the price actions we executed in the back half of 2018 as well as the additional price increases implemented this year in response to the list 3 tariff the operating margin rate for the segment was 12 1 down from the prior year as the benefits of volume leverage pricing and cost control were more than offset by the 2018 carryover impacts of currency commodity inflation and tariffs these carryover headwinds amounted to 160 million for stanley black decker in the first quarter with much of this impacting the tools storage segment the strong organic growth and related share gains were experienced across each region and sbu so looking at the results on a geographic basis north america once again led the way up 11 driven by the us retail channel which posted high teens growth north america s growth continued to be fueled by the craftsman brand rollout new product innovations and price realization we continue to see great momentum with the craftsman rollout at our major retail partners and have seen a strong end user reception as the product has hit the shelves we couldn t be more pleased with the progress so far more color to come on that as well as our stanley and stanley fatmax rollouts from jeff later europe delivered 3 organic growth in the quarter despite a continuation of slower market conditions across several countries within the region the team continue to leverage our strong portfolio of brands new product innovation and commercial actions to produce above market growth and then finally emerging markets delivered low single digit growth driven by price new products and e commerce expansion these actions were largely offset by continued market contractions in argentina and turkey which presented an organic growth headwind of three points within the quarter we continue to see broad based share gains across the region brazil ecuador and mexico posted high single to low double digit growth while russia korea taiwan and india all posted strong double digit performances now let s take a look at the tools storage sbus both had solid contributions to the overall performance power tools and equipment delivered 6 organic growth which benefited from strong commercial execution and new product introductions in particular we had a solid contribution from the new products launched on the craftsman dewalt and flexvolt brands hand tools accessories and storage delivered 9 organic growth as new product introductions the craftsman rollout and of course contributions from the lenox and irwin revenue synergies all contributed to this growth so in summary an outstanding quarter and a strong start to the year for the tools storage organization as they continue to demonstrate above market organic growth tight cost control and strong price actions to overcome significant external headwinds related to commodities currency and tariffs let s turn to industrial this segment delivered 10 revenue growth which included 16 points from the nelson fastener and ies attachments acquisitions a 3 organic decline and a negative 2 points from currency offset this this significant growth from these acquisitions operating margin rate was down year over year to 13 9 as productivity gains and cost control actions were more than offset by the impact from lower engineered fastening automotive volume commodity inflation and the modestly dilutive impact from these acquisitions engineered fastening organic revenues were down 4 due to the declines in automotive light vehicle production and lower system shipments which were partially offset by continued fastener penetration gains we continue to see declines in underlying global automotive production which impacts fastener volumes however it is also impacting the scope of automotive system projects that our customers are executing the infrastructure businesses delivered 5 organic growth primarily driven by stronger north american onshore pipeline project activity in oil and gas this was partially offset by lower hydraulic demolition tool volumes whose underlying market has been modestly impacted by the recent retraction in scrap steel pricing and finally let s turn to security the security segment revenue declined 1 with bolt on acquisitions contributing two points and price delivering 1 which was more than offset by unfavorable currency of four points north america organic growth was up 2 as higher volumes in automatic doors and healthcare were partially offset by lower installation revenues in commercial electronic security europe was down 1 organically france was a bright spot for the quarter as the team was able to leverage new commercial actions in the small to medium enterprise market which is associated with our transformation plan that jim mentioned however this was more than offset by unfavorable market conditions in sweden and the uk two larger markets for our security european team in terms of profitability the segment operating margin expanded 70 basis points to 10 3 the security team continues to demonstrate progress with its business transformation plan they successfully executed on their first quarter objectives delivering margin rate and dollar expansion through cost control and they are focused on minimizing recurring revenue attrition so we achieved modest organic growth additionally the team continues to make investments in hiring and onboarding new commercial and field technician resources we believe these actions coupled with the new tech technology forward customer solutions we have developed and are developing will begin to translated to consistent growth as we move forward in the year this is the third quarter in a row our security team has achieved their financial expectations nice progress so far so now let s briefly look at the quarter s free cash flow performance on the next page we were down approximately 65 million year over year mainly attributed to increased working capital tools storage continues to carry high levels of inventory to support the ongoing craftsman rollout and other brand transitions that we are currently executing across the channels as mentioned at january s earnings call we believe the working capital levels will moderate throughout the year and we will achieve working capital turns relatively flat to the prior year by the end of 2019 this will position us well for driving significant working capital improvement in 2020 so we can achieve approximately 100 free cash flow conversion in 2020 so turning back to 2019 please keep in mind that a free cash outflow in the first quarter is in line with normal seasonality we remain confident that we will deliver strong cash flow generation for the year given our core sfs processes and principles combined with reducing working capital levels in line with normal season seasonal activity as i just discussed therefore we are reiterating our commitment to deliver a free cash flow conversion rate of approximately 85 to 90 in 2019 so now let s turn to 2019 earnings guidance as jim mentioned earlier we are raising our adjusted eps outlook for 2019 to a range of 8 50 to 8 70 which is a 0 05 increase versus our prior guidance on a gaap basis this results in a range of 7 50 to 7 70 per share diving into a little more detail on our 2019 adjusted eps you can see on the left hand side of the chart the increase is supported by the strong organic growth and cost control which drove approximately 0 15 of operational outperformance in the first quarter this is partially offset by an incremental 20 million of currency headwinds which primarily consist of adverse movements in the brazilian real argentinean peso and chinese rmb as it relates to recent acquisitions and divestiture activity the impact from the acquisition of the paladin and pengo businesses from ies and the divestiture of sargent greenleaf net to a relatively neutral impact to our full year 2019 eps outlook these ies assets will create solid eps accretion in the later years through cost and revenue synergies one other item of note i would like to highlight is that we expect second quarter earnings per share to approximate 29 5 of the full year performance this is generally consistent with prior year performance turning to the segment outlook on the right side of the page organic growth within tools storage is still expected to be mid single digits in 2019 we continue to execute on multiple catalysts including the continued brand transitions with craftsman stanley and stanley fatmax new product innovation including flexvolt lenox and irwin revenue synergies e commerce and other emerging market opportunities the margin rates are expected to be positive year over year the team will continue to leverage price cost actions margin initiatives and volume to offset the carryover headwinds we previously mentioned previously mentioned we believe the business is well positioned for return to margin expansion in 2019 and anticipate a meaningful expansion in the second half in the industrial segment we expect organic revenue to be down modestly with total revenue growth positive from the contributions of our recent acquisitions in infrastructure we expect oil and gas to be positive organically and hydraulic tools to be relatively flat on an organic basis engineered fastening organic revenue is expected to be down modestly with growth in automotive and industrial fasteners being offset by a decline in the system side of the business we do believe the pressure we we are experiencing in the automotive systems during q1 will begin to subside in the later stages of 2019 we expect operating margins to be down year over year driven by the modestly dilutive impact from acquisitions and the impacts of negative product mix specifically lower automotive system sales in engineered fastening and then finally in our security segment we re expecting organic growth of low single digits and growth in operating margin dollars and rate year over year as the team continues to execute on its transformation strategy so in summary the company s organic revenue will grow approximately 4 and we expect 4 to 7 adjusted eps expansion which is overcoming approximately 340 million of commodity currency and tariff headwinds which is primarily related to the carryover from 2018 we are encouraged by the collective performances across the portfolio in the first quarter which gives us confidence to increase our 2019 eps guidance range we remain focused on leveraging the positive impacts from our continued strong organic growth the previously executed pricing actions and the recently completed 250 million cost reduction program to ensure we achieve our 2019 guidance these factors along with the beginning impacts of certain margin enhancement initiatives will result in operating margin and rate expansion in 2019 and we expect meaningful expansion in the second half of the year with that i d like to turn the call over to jeff to provide a few comments on the progress with the ongoing craftsman stanley and stanley fatmax brand transitions as well as some of the new innovations we are currently launching within the tools business jeff jeffery d ansell executive vice president president global tools storage thank you don i d like to share a few updates on our latest innovations and brand initiatives including our recent launch of a new dewalt 20 volt compact series called atomic as well as the incredible progress of craftsman our global tools storage business had strong first quarter performance with high single digit organic growth led by north america a key component of this success was our continued focus on innovation led growth for example our dewalt flexvolt platform was up double digits in the quarter as we continue to grow in the system core products as well as expanding into the outdoor category with flexvolt we are also pleased to announce the global launch of the 20 volt atomic series a range of tools that combines performance and durability in a compact format the atomic series augments our existing dewalt 20 volt line which is now the largest professional cordless system in the world with well over 200 products with this global program just beginning to ship we expect to see incremental growth in the pro power tool space within the year during our may investor day we will detail this and other breakthrough innovations regarding craftsman the momentum and success from 2018 carried into 2019 with growth across all categories in craftsman our craftsman expansion plan remains on track and we are well on our way to delivering our 1 billion target by 2021 now i ll turn it back over to jim to wrap today s presentation james m loree president chief executive officer thanks jeff and as you heard it was a solid start to the year as we delivered above market organic growth leveraging that array of growth catalysts i m proud of the team s efforts and execution which have positioned us to achieve decent ltm financial results amid a host of macro challenges as these challenges anniversary we are looking forward to a resumption of margin accretion in combination with our excellent growth and lastly i want to remind everyone that we will be hosting an investor day on the morning of may 16th in new york city this will be a great opportunity for us to communicate our strategic and financial objectives and discuss how we are pursuing growth margin expansion and transformation at stanley black decker as you can tell we are passionate about delivering growth with margin expansion and this will be prominently featured we will also showcase members of our business unit and other key functional management teams so please reach out to dennis if you re interested in attending and we look forward to seeing you there and we are now ready for q a dennis dennis lange vice president investor relations great thanks jim shannon we can now open the call to q a please thank you questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from jeffrey sprague with vertical research your line is open jeffrey sprague vertical research analyst thank you good morning everyone james m loree president chief executive officer good morning jeff jeffrey sprague vertical research analyst jim i was wondering if you could address a little bit more as you said in your opening monologue that the headwinds are dissipating and i think we we all kind of understand the comp issue and how it was front loaded here in q1 but can you provide a little bit more color on how you see that playing out in the back half and i guess part and parcel to my question is it does look like we might be getting close to trade tariff resolution and how do you think about maintaining price if we do get tariff relief thank you james m loree president chief executive officer sure well first of all the massive hit that we took in the first quarter from the carryover headwinds goes down sequentially in the second quarter but it s still over 100 million sorry just below 100 million right around 85 million and then in the back half of the year the price actually more or less offsets the remaining headwinds the remaining carryover and whatever new modest headwinds that we have this year so in general that s just how the math works and so we as i said assume a stable cost and tariff environment if the tariffs go away that s a pretty significant reduction in headwinds i think the total amount of tariffs in for the for the year is just under 100 million or thereabout so most of the tariff impact is list three and from what we hear the way the trade negotiations are going that would be the most likely tariffs to be removed list three and keeping in mind to the last part of your question that a lot of the a lot of the pricing activity was not tariff related but also inflation related and so i think that when you finally add it all up i mean the price recovery against the tariffs only amounted to about 40 between 40 and 50 and so there was a big chunk of inflation related cost that was not covered by the price as well as some of the tariff so i think that we ll see how that all plays out but i think there is sufficient inflation and headwinds to justify a fairly stable price environment going forward donald allan jr executive vice president chief financial officer let me just clarify the that the number that jim gave in 2q is net of price just want to make sure that it s not people understand it s not gross headwinds and the other thing to keep in mind is this if you did if all the tariffs went away we ve communicated this previously the impact net of price on an annualized basis would probably be somewhere around 40 million to 50 million net but that s all tariff and if list 3 happens it probably a third to 50 of that number operator thank you our next question comes from josh pokrzywinski with morgan stanley your line is open josh pokrzywinski morgan stanley analyst hi good morning guys james m loree president chief executive officer good morning josh pokrzywinski morgan stanley analyst yeah i guess just a follow up on on jeff s question there with with the margin expansion that you guys talked about in tools i think don you mentioned a few times strong margin expansion in the second half should we still expect to see something in 2q and how has that changed just given maybe some of the timing of headwinds or price increases or the competitive dynamic out there with respect to price donald allan jr executive vice president chief financial officer yeah we were saying over the last couple of months we we are anticipating a kind of modest improvement in margin rate in the second quarter and we and we still believe that will be the case and as we get into the third and the fourth quarter both jim and i a indicated we expect the the incremental accretion rate for tools to become quite meaningful and that s still the expectation at this stage operator thank you our next question comes from michael rehaut with jpmorgan your line is open michael rehaut jp morgan analyst thanks good morning everyone james m loree president chief executive officer good morning mike michael rehaut jp morgan analyst congrats on the quarter question i have is relates to the tools storage performance obviously you continued great execution on the top line given some of the new initiatives that you launched or jeff referred to i was hoping to get a sense of when you think about the mid single digit growth for this segment for 2019 if you can kind of break that down by looking at also the break it down by some of the growth initiatives technical difficulty such as craftsman such as flexvolt as opposed to the the core market growth and if that changed at all particularly given the first quarter performance james m loree president chief executive officer yeah as we ve indicated previously we think craftsman is about 3 points of growth for the full year the first quarter was fairly representative of that and we don t see any different view at this stage we ve indicated mid single digits we ve also said that that probably means we re our view is we are floating around 6 approximately 7 and we still feel like that s the right estimate at this stage what we don t know is just how impactful craftsman is going to be it s been very positive and if those trends continue those numbers can be a little bit better as the year goes on but i look at the core underlying markets they re performing well and the we had some weak markets in europe as we talked about where we don t have a lot of market growth right now in many of the countries but we are demonstrating growth as we had 3 organic growth in the first quarter so we re outpacing there and that really has more to do with just strong commercial activities product innovation et cetera like the european team has done for several years now in north america you saw the magnitude of the growth of double digits and the impact of craftsman being in there but even if you exclude that impact that s really it s still pretty significant performance which would include things like flexvolt and other matters as well so we still feel like that s a reasonable estimate at this stage we all have to keep in mind that it is the first quarter and as we get to the second quarter and we complete the rollout of craftsman and lowe s through all the ph stores we ll have a good sense of where we are in and a read in the back half of the year and what that means but i think at this stage we feel good about an organic growth number about 6 to 7 for tools operator thank you our next question comes from tim wojs with baird your line is open tim wojs baird analyst hey guys good good morning good start to the year james m loree president chief executive officer good morning thank you tim wojs baird analyst i guess just just maybe on back on on tools and growth in the quarter relative to your expectations a couple of months ago where do you think you saw the the outperformance internally was it better sell through at retail was it was it the types of products that consumers are buying just a little bit more color on maybe what was better relative to your expectations in the quarter james m loree president chief executive officer i guess kind of all of the above the sell through has been fantastic and the product introductions have been really well received and so it s a combination of all those factors and i i think also the market is more stable than i think we were thinking a quarter ago although there is some choppiness in housing and so on i think in general it s more stable than we would have expected at this point and time and the interest rate reductions have helped a lot operator thank you our next question comes from julian mitchell with barclays your line is open julian mitchell barclays analyst thanks good morning you ve given some very good color on your updated sort of macro thoughts around north america demand i just wondered if you could give us an update around expectations for organic growth firm wide in europe and the emerging markets those were sort of flattish both in q1 just wondered how you think the rest of the year will play out for europe and em donald allan jr executive vice president chief financial officer i think what we experienced in q1 is not going to be dramatically different other than i would say probably emerging markets might demonstrate more growth as we get to the back half they clearly are dealing with some difficult circumstances in two countries that i mentioned of turkey and argentina but we do start to kind of lap that in the middle of the year and so the comp gets a little little easier from that perspective to demonstrate organic growth so i think we ll see a little bit of an improvement in the organic growth profile in the back half for emerging markets betting europe will continue to be kind of a low single digit growth performance for a good part of the year and north america will continue to be strong operator thank you our next question comes from nigel coe with wolfe research your line is open nigel coe wolfe research analyst thanks good morning guys james m loree president chief executive officer hi hi nigel nigel coe wolfe research analyst i m sure you re glad to get one key behind you so it s obviously great news on sg a big big reduction there and i m assuming that s where the the bulk of the cost action is coming through in that line i know you re going to address this more on the the upcoming may conference but maybe you could talk about the the margin transformation initiatives under way and is that more of a capacity and gross margin initiative and how how does that differ from there some of the regular way restructuring ph you re currently doing thanks james m loree president chief executive officer sure so the margin resiliency initiative we like to call it gets us back to kind of our historical margin accretion of about 50 basis points a year after we get back to our prior levels which we will accomplish pretty much this year start to have margin accretion again and so with this really the intent of this is it may have a modest 19 impact but the real impact will be 2021 and we ll be driving that 50 basis point and possibly even more margin accretion going forward and like we ll get into a fair amount of detail about about this in on may 16th but the general thrust is utilizing technology and technological advancements to enhance value creation initiatives that already exists so it could be as it relates to price it could be as it relates to procurement and so on so there s different categories and or buckets if you will where we re taking technology and utilizing kind of leading edge practices to data analytics artificial intelligence cobotics those types of things to actually enhance our margins and create value that s the basic idea operator thank you our next question comes from nicole deblase with deutsche bank your line is open nicole deblase deutsche bank analyst yeah thanks good morning guys james m loree president chief executive officer good morning donald allan jr executive vice president chief financial officer good morning nicole deblase deutsche bank analyst so i just want to dig into 2q a little bit it seems like that the thing that the investors are asking about most or grappling with since i mean it seems like it s not a whole lot different than normal seasonality for me but essentially consensus is doubling versus 1q excluding the tax benefit so have you guys to kind of talk through the big puts and takes i know we talked about the 85 million net headwind what s the gross headwind expected if you could talk through organic growth since i think the comp gets a bit tougher year on year tax rate and anything else that we need to consider when we re thinking about bridging from 1q to 2q donald allan jr executive vice president chief financial officer i mean clearly the the volume overall is the biggest driver where the volume of the whole company will probably be up 400 million to 450 million sequentially from q1 to q2 so that s clearly a big driver you also have the gross headwinds go down on an absolute basis by about 30 million to 35 million from q1 and q2 while the price benefit stays relatively consistent so you get a benefit there as well and then some of our cost actions we re not completed until q1 so you get a full quarter benefit of that in q2 those are really the three main drivers that are that are driving that there was a there is a little little bit of a modest impact from a lower tax rate in q2 versus q1 as well as many of the tax benefits we re expecting in the first half versus the back half of the year those are the main those are the four main drivers that would get you to that number operator thank you our next question comes from joe ritchie with goldman sachs your line is open joe ritchie goldman sachs analyst thanks good morning everyone james m loree president chief executive officer good morning donald allan jr executive vice president chief financial officer good morning joe ritchie goldman sachs analyst maybe just just touching on the the focus at the analyst day i know we re going to talk a lot about the the margin expansion but maybe just a broader question around like is this a pivot you guys have been focused very much so on the growth initiatives historically the 22 22 and now we re now it seems like this analyst day is going to be a little bit more focused on on the margin expansion opportunities and so maybe maybe discuss a little bit just kind of the shift in philosophy there james m loree president chief executive officer it s not really a huge shift in philosophy it s really kind of back to the future we we ve always in the last i d say 5 years to 7 years we have always been focused on growth and margin expansion and if you go back and look at the years preceding last year there was a pretty strong track record of strong organic growth acquisitive growth plus margin expansion and that formula has been very lucrative for the for shareholders and we intend to get back to that so the reason we obviously got off that track for one year is has everything to do with the headwinds that we ve talked about ad nauseam so this is something that we are fixated on doing in this company is doing both and i know a lot of companies it s either either or but we don t think of it that way and we have the capability and the track record to expand margins while growing and we intend to get back to that in beginning in 2019 but really in earnest in 20 and 21 operator thank you our next question comes from deepa raghavan with wells fargo your line is open deepa raghavan wells fargo analyst good morning good quarter there jim and don james m loree president chief executive officer thank you donald allan jr executive vice president chief financial officer thank you deepa raghavan wells fargo analyst your outlooks for q2 just a little bit touching on that given that it s an outdoors season heavy season i mean outlooks looks like it s 250ish at midpoint can you talk about momentum into q2 including possibly any point of sales at ph north america and what are some of the upside and downside case in q2 we know it s an outdoor season it s meaningful to craftsman mtd just the weather in there but on a year on year basis is there anything else that other than what you ve addressed earlier that would be helpful thank you donald allan jr executive vice president chief financial officer yeah so i ll pass it over to jeff in a minute and he will give us some commentary on the outdoor season view for us but i as i mentioned and jim mentioned the pos was strong in the first quarter we do think that trend will continue into the second quarter and likely for the remainder of the year the other drivers are the the reason for why we think the business will continue to improve around margin rate in the second quarter so we can achieve what i described but let me give jeff a chance to give a little more color on our view of the outdoor season jeffery d ansell executive vice president president global tools storage so to reiterate what don just said pos was was robust as where the organic growth numbers in north america in q1 there is not a great deal of outdoor activity in that quarter it more often ph starts in the second quarter runs through the third but but what we did see was a slow start to the outdoor season as much of the the us market was under water if you remember early days of this of the spring that changed quite significantly in the last four weeks so season that started out negative has turned positive at this point certainly from for us and we re comping relatively sluggish outdoor numbers from last year if you remember last year s outdoor season wasn t a really robust one so it s it s been really positive for the last four weeks and we have every reason to believe that will continue to be positive through the second quarter one given the kind of sluggish comps from last year but also the new product development that we put into the market this year in the dewalt brand as well as the black decker brand and most recently the craftsman brand so quite positive operator thank you our next question comes from rob wertheimer with melius research your line is open rob wertheimer melius research analyst hi good morning i just wonder if you could give any kind of an update on craftsman production us production just progress and then any thoughts on evolutions at mtd and if you re able to to achieve better results through aiding ph them thanks donald allan jr executive vice president chief financial officer i ll start with the first part of the question then turn it over to jim for the second part craftsman domestic manufacturing is in really good place where we essentially began the process with almost no domestic manufacturing for craftsman and what we procured to this point over the course of about 12 months we ve gone from what was almost 0 to about a third of the product line manufactured domestically today on our plan to double that going forward which we ll give you more detail around that at the may investor day but the inertia created by craftsman and then combining that with domestic manufacturing the combination of those two things has led us to growth in every category that is craftsman today so we re quite pleased with where we are but i would say we are we have yet a lot to do jeffery d ansell executive vice president president global tools storage great so on mtd really excited about the transaction including the option but as excited about the people that we get to work with because frankly the transaction has got this got us all set up with a confluence of interests in the sense that any ebitda growth that occurs we ll kind of share the benefits post closing of the 20 we ll share the benefits 50 50 in terms of the ultimate determination of the option price and that structure has put us in a position where we are working together in earnest on value creation opportunities for mtd that include everything from growth to cost reduction to margin expansion and so on and it s it s going to be a multi year program and since we re running it like an acquisition integration while subscribing to all the principles of antitrust that we have to subscribe to and we re very very confident that we will get mtd s profitability up to a point where it will be able to slot it into our portfolio in 2021 or 2022 in a in a way that is really accretive for for us and is a great deal for the folks at mtd operator thank you our next question comes from justin speer with zelman associates your line is open justin speer zelman associates analyst hi guys thank you very much just i just wanted to further unpack the tools storage growth and i mean what you re looking for for underlying market growth for this business and how that kind of sequences as the year progresses and then dovetailing that question with is the reality that if we do get trade resolution do you think you ll be able to hold on to that price do you think you ll be able to hold on to the potential savings from tariffs going away james m loree president chief executive officer yeah as i mentioned on growth earlier for tools storage we have a view of 6 to 7 for the full year we expect craftsman to be about 3 points of that which would demonstrate some modest growth over gdp if you look at it globally not assume being a point or point and a half so that s pretty significant in some in some camps around the world but that s our view and we think that will continue to be the case and we re very hopeful that craftsman outperforms expectations and maybe some other product innovations and other growth catalysts do as well and we ll see as the year progresses we talked about how we have a lot of work to do on craftsman to complete the rollout in the second quarter and then we have to focus on the rollout of other brands and some of our other customers so we have a lot of work to do over the year to make this happen but we re positive at this stage and we ll continue to provide updates along the way in particularly in july and october operator thank you our next question comes from robert barry with buckingham research your line is open robert barry buckingham research analyst hey guys good morning james m loree president chief executive officer good morning donald allan jr executive vice president chief financial officer good morning robert barry buckingham research analyst congrats on the solid start james m loree president chief executive officer thanks robert barry buckingham research analyst i just wanted to actually clarify a couple of things one is just why the industrial outlook is weaker and how much of that weakness happened in 1q and then just on a couple p l p l items that price and commodities are still kind of plus 150 ph minus 150 ph and if there is any kind of potential upside or downside to those values especially what we re seeing with commodities donald allan jr executive vice president chief financial officer yeah i think for industrial our view is a little bit worse than it was in january as we as we saw the automotive light vehicle production was down almost 5 in the first quarter which was worse than projection it s supposed to be down a little bit smaller number in the second quarter and then begin to moderate in the back half of the year we do think systems will will start to return in the back half of the year that s the feedback we re getting from a lot of our key customers and so that s clearly a pressure point although it s a modest pressure point versus expectations i think we were thinking relatively flat back in january now we re just down modestly as a result of that i mean i think the engineered fastening team is doing a great job managing through this cycle with the auto industry and looking for opportunities in some of the and the nelson acquisition that they ve done as well as the other aspects of the industrial fastener business within their world so they continue to be focused on that the headwinds as we mentioned are have gone up a little bit overall 20 million due to fx and at this stage commodities are not changing dramatically although we think as we go through the year there could be an opportunity that we see emerge as the year goes on but right now it s not it s not flowing through as an opportunity for us to capture in our p l at this stage and then tariffs are bit of an open wild card at this stage as to what happens do we have a deal with china in the future and if we do do all the tariffs go away or as jim said do they partially go away is a factor that we see but you know we feel good about where we re positioned as a company to deal with these headwinds even though we saw modest increase in them it feels like as we go throughout the year the ones in commodities and tariff feel like there is a possibility for an opportunity technical difficulty to get smaller however we could potentially see a little bit more pressure in currency as we go throughout the year we certainly saw the volatility of that last year but i think that currency tends to be something that s easier for us to manage if that s the only major headwind we are dealing with operator thank you our next question comes from michael wood with nomura instinet your line is open michael wood nomura instinet analyst hi good morning i was hoping you could provide some color in terms of the you gave a very explicit 1q guidance which you beat operationally you said by about 0 25 sorry 0 15 or so excluding that the timing of the tax curious if there is some other pull forward in 1q that didn t allow you to flow that 0 15 beat into your 2019 guidance donald allan jr executive vice president chief financial officer as i mentioned in my my commentary is that yes we did have an operational outperformance of 0 15 in the first quarter but we did see a 20 million increase in currency or 0 10 of an impact related to that so the net the net benefit is about 0 05 and we thought at this stage the prudent thing to do to let that flow through let s see if we get resolution on china trade let s see if some of the trends that i mentioned emerge in the volume of tools as well as the headwinds associated with commodity and tariffs and so it s a it s a prudent first step and we ll see how things progress in the next quarter operator thank you our next question comes from david macgregor with longbow research your line is open david macgregor longbow research analyst yes good morning james m loree president chief executive officer good morning david macgregor longbow research analyst congratulations on the quarter james m loree president chief executive officer thanks david macgregor longbow research analyst just on craftsman thinking about second quarter and the dynamics around the craftsman brand can you update us on the timing of the load in i think you mentioned earlier that lowe s you expected that to be complete in the second quarter but if you started the amazon loading yet and if so how far into that process are you and finally can you update us on the timing of load in home depot on the stanley and fatmax and how long that will take to complete thanks jeffery d ansell executive vice president president global tools storage hi yeah this is jeff i ll take the the question the i ll give you the status first of stanley stanley and fatmax then i ll migrate to craftsman we ve just begun the process of rolling out the stanley and stanley fatmax products that we highlighted last earnings call so they are just flowing through the supply chain into into stores you will see those product set the first phase of that set this coming month so in the month of may you ll see those things set at store level so no no underlying pos or any of that at this point but the rollout is going quite well and so we re we re very positive on that regarding craftsman probably similarly we ve had greater demand for the product than we anticipated and as such we ve expanded our view of the size of craftsman and the timing of craftsman previously in order to make certain that we can accommodate that increased demand via supply we have elected to to move the rollout of new customers on craftsman to the early parts of the second half of of this year so in an in an attempt to make sure we can satisfy the customers that we do have today and the demand that the end user has created we pushed those back just a bit but they will begin very early second half and and we ll roll those things out in the in the cadence we described but starting at that point and time so so all positive underlying reasons to do those things and again we re quite positive with both the rollout of stanley stanley fatmax and craftsman across all categories operator thank you our next question comes from ken zener with keybanc your line is open ken zener keybanc analyst good morning everybody james m loree president chief executive officer hey ken donald allan jr executive vice president chief financial officer good morning ken zener keybanc analyst jeff can you talk to the outdoor category given mtd and craftsman specifically kind a bigger picture that what constraints the expansion of cordless applications into gas i mean is it your guys internal r d is it just the market price or you don t want to be the bleeding edge thank you very much jeffery d ansell executive vice president president global tools storage well it it has advanced quite significantly in the last you d say two years right so it s there have been cordless non gas cordless outdoor products for from us for almost three decades but the cost curve has enabled us to beat us and others to get electric products competitively priced with with petrol really for the first time in the last 12 months and at that point then the consumer has the decision to make they would either choose petrol which they are accustomed to today or or migrate to electric and and that s the process that s beginning as we speak so i d say the technology enables that today so you see this in categories like string tremors hedge trimmers blowers chainsaw things that have historically been gas driven and that migration has happened relatively rapidly and you ll see if you survey retail today you ll see examples under the craftsman brand where we have inaudible registration that says you choose your power source so it will be gas product or the electric equivalent at the same price allowing the user to make the decision which has been the first time in history we ve ever been able to to make that claim we do that and it s going really well so i don t think there s any technological hurdles with it for in that sense as you get into higher and higher output products walk behinds ride on mowers that s still there is still a gap between the value proposition of petrol or gas and electric and we and others are working to close that gap but there s probably a little more work to be done there but the early read is very positive and electrification of outdoor products being led really by us across brands like black decker dewalt and craftsman so donald allan jr executive vice president chief financial officer one of the one of the things that we re doing to take advantage of this this period where we own 20 of mtd and have not yet exercised the option is to collaborate on r d because it s an application challenge it s not just a battery challenge it s a system challenge so their expertise in the actual unit of outdoor power equipment as we go up the power curve and our expertise in battery technology and application to lower power output type products it s a great combination best combination in the industry to tackle this and we re going to be out in front on that one operator thank you our next question comes from susan maklari with credit suisse your line is open susan maklari credit suisse analyst good morning james m loree president chief executive officer good morning donald allan jr executive vice president chief financial officer good morning susan maklari credit suisse analyst i wanted to focus a little bit on the cash flows and the balance sheet on the last call you talked to taking a defensive approach to cash flows this year with a focus on deleveraging and with the operating environment coming in a bit more stable relative to your initial expectations are there any changes to your capital allocation plans for this year donald allan jr executive vice president chief financial officer there really isn t any significant changes to our capital allocation strategy as we thought about january we are preparing the company for a slow growth environment and we were concerned about housing in particular what was happening as interest rates for have been rising in the previous year and there was talk about continued increases in that area and what that could mean for housing as jim mentioned that s changed a lot in the last three months we re now the fed has has a different kind of position on interest rates and actually we ve seen a little bit of a reversal in that trend and that s had a bit of a positive impact on housing but we re still dealing with a relatively a little bit of a slow growth environment in certain pockets we have a slow automotive industry housing is doing ok but it s not robust at this stage and so we re not overly concerned about the economy at this at this view we we feel good about how we ve set up the company and to be prepared for as we mentioned various different environments and this was one of them and the importance of our capital allocation is we have to keep in mind that in the previous couple of years we ve done some significant capital allocation transactions including buying back stock acquisitions of ies mtd nelson fasteners and and then before that we had craftsman and we had the newell tools acquisition so we ve we ve allocated a fair amount of capital to these different areas so a couple of things are happening this year one we want to get our our debt to ebitda ratio down closer to two times and we will achieve that with the current cash flow view and projection of the business and that will really position us to be able to look at other allocation strategies in the m a world as we go into 2020 and frankly we need to absorb a lot of those transactions that we ve completed in that timeframe as well james m loree president chief executive officer i mean there is a massive amount of execution going on as you can glean from the conversations that we ve had in the last hour and it s all going really well but as don said we we kind of want to get our debt to ebitda down to right around two and digest some of these things and exploit some of the growth opportunities that we have and then we ll look in as we go into 2020 and beyond is does more repurchase makes sense or or do we have some acquisition opportunities that might be very attractive to help us continue to drive growth operator thank you our last question comes from justin bergner with g research your line is open justin bergner g research analyst good morning and thank you for taking my question james m loree president chief executive officer good morning donald allan jr executive vice president chief financial officer good morning jeffery d ansell executive vice president president global tools storage good morning justin bergner g research analyst you made a comment earlier in the call that you re hoping to reach 100 or close to a 100 free cash flow conversion in 2020 i m not sure but it seems like that s a pull forward of your earlier comment that that was more of a mid term goal could you clarify that s the case and sort of maybe indicate what drivers will allow you to get that free cash flow conversion up to 100 2020 donald allan jr executive vice president chief financial officer yeah i think one of the things that we ve talked about in the last year or so is that we ve had to really take some pressure on in our working capital as we deal dealt with these brand transitions which are fantastic opportunities for us to develop organic growth and you ve seen that track record in the tools storage business and and therefore we haven t seen significant progress in working capital turns in the last previous year as well as this year we ll probably be relatively flat year over year so as we go into 2020 we see opportunity once those transitions has kind of gotten to a more stable state on a go forward basis and they are really embedded in our existing business and then we re dealing more with just new product introductions and new innovations et cetera that gives us an opportunity for us to make some significant improvement in working capital turns where will ph we ll end this year probably somewhere between 8 5 and 8 8 for working capital turns of the company and and therefore we ve been over 10 and so there s no reason why we can t see that opportunity going into 2020 and 2021 which means that significant benefit will flow through free cash flow which will allow our conversion to get back up to 100 operator thank you this concludes the question and answer session i would now like to turn the conference back

available on our website under the investors tab or you can access it using the sec s edgar system please note that we ll be referencing certain non gaap measures on today s call our press release provides reconciliations of these to the most comparable gaap figures advertisement advertisement more from the motley fool for additional information we ve posted supplemental tables on our website assist in the calculation of ebitdax cash margins and other non gaap measures with that let me turn the call over to jeff jeff ventura chief executive officer thanks laith and thanks to everyone for joining us on this morning s call range is off to a great start in 2019 delivering on the operational and financial objectives to drive our five year outlook in the first quarter range generated 53 million of free cash flow and reduce debt by 48 million we achieved this result through a commitment to capital discipline in a focus on driving higher margins through prudent cost management advertisement advertisement this strong start to 2019 builds upon 2018 results is range s transition to generating free cash flow in the second half of last year and completed our 2018 drilling program for 31 million less than our original budget this compares favorably to our industry peers as the majority of e ps outspent their original capital budgets in 2018 range s commitment to capital discipline is unwavering so we reiterate range will not outspend our 756 million capital budget for 2019 i also want to reiterate range s commitment to generating free cash flow if strip pricing improves over the course of the five year outlook we will not increase growth but will instead look to generate additional free cash flow and reduce debt faster which could position us to return cash to shareholders sooner in the form of buybacks and or increased dividends speaking of the balance sheet our commitment to organic free cash flow and asset sales have strengthened our financial position considerably and allowed us to reduce debt by 419 million over the past 3 quarters a reduction that represents approximately 10 of total debt we intend to build on this momentum through the remainder of 2019 and beyond translating our high quality asset base into being full free cash flow generation while further accelerating our financial targets through asset sales we believe this will narrow the disconnect we see between our share price and the intrinsic value of our assets that disconnect is in part demonstrated by our year end 2018 proved reserve value in strip pricing net of debt which is over 24 per share and does not account for the large high quality inventory of core marcellus wells that will remain beyond the five years of development included in proved reserves accelerating our financial targets remains a top priority for evidence of management and the board s commitment to balance sheet improvement you can reference the 2019 compensation incentives in the proxy that we filed earlier this month the 2019 targets for both debt reduction and leverage improvement reflect our focus on derisking the balance sheet and the near term like we ve talked about for the last few quarters range has completed what we call our commissioning phase of the marcellus which now positions us to deliver free cash flow and improve returns going forward we have the vast block up acreage position that is largely held by production this allows for highly efficient development of our assets with the ability to drill long laterals utilize existing pads in infrastructure and effectively source and recycle water these efficiencies are evidenced in our peer leading f d costs and low maintenance capital requirements our processing and transportation capacity is rightsized for our production while providing diversified market access for various products advertisement advertisement we see opportunities to improve margins going forward by marketing incremental production in basin thereby limiting additional transportation expense and supplying growing southwest appalachia demand for both natural gas and ngls given the massive infrastructure buildout that s occurred in the marcellus and utica over the last 10 years we expect it will be ample takeaway to other markets allowing us to optimize sales without incremental commitments or take advantage of the narrow southwest pa basis in several years importantly we re not pressured to grow in order to meet current transportation agreements or satisfy the competing interests of a midstream affiliate this provides range with the flexibility to develop a capital program going forward that optimally balances an efficient development cadence free cash flow generation and unit cost improvement range s ability to generate sustainable free cash flow and current strip prices is underpinned by our high quality assets which drive our low corporate base decline and low maintenance capital requirements range s base decline entering 2019 was below 20 this relatively flat base decline supports low d c maintenance capital of only 525 million and differentiates range versus peers when we look at the dollars it takes to add or replace an mcf of production we couple that analysis with the underlying base decline we see range as the only producer in southwest appalachia capable of generating free cash flow and modest exit average growth in 2019 as true maintenance capital for peer companies chews up a significant percentage of the cash flow not only does this analysis demonstrate range s high quality asset position i believe it s one of the many indicators that strip prices do not reflect fundamentals from that perspective there s going to be a significant call on southwest appalachia to help supply the coming increase in demand for north american natural gas both for domestic use and for export if most companies in southwest appalachia can t grow within cash flow with current strip pricing we see this as a positive sign for the macro range s ability to generate free cash flow in this commodity price environment is driven by capital discipline and efficiency asset quality and cost control the team s performance on cost controls in the first quarter was outstanding as nearly every category came in at the low end of or below our expectations mark will spend some time discussing this trend in more detail but we re thrilled to see unit cost headed down for the first time in six quarters and like we discussed for some time this is a trend we expect to continue over the course of the five year outlook and beyond in addition i want to make everyone aware of range s corporate sustainability report we plan to release in the next couple of weeks and this report will detail range s efforts and commitment to responsible natural gas development and doing what is right for all stakeholders advertisement advertisement some highlights in this report include a 6 reduction and total emissions in 2018 while growing production approximately 10 year over year additionally range achieved a 153 water recycle ratio as range recycles effectively all of our produced water and utilizes recycled water from over a dozen operators in the surrounding area we encourage everyone to read this report when it s published and in the meantime i will emphasize range s commitment to sustainable business practices and developing positive long lasting relationships with all stakeholders this commitment is not only the right thing to do but also represents a win win as we believe it generates enhanced shareholder returns over time in summary range will continue to focus on responsible capital and cost efficient development to drive sustainable organic free cash flow generation that free cash flow will be used to reduce debt and begin to position the company to return cash to shareholders we will strive to accelerate organic balance sheet improvement with asset sales in the near term and given our peer leading inventory of high quality marcellus locations we believe we re in a great position to extend this program and deliver investor returns far beyond the five year outlook into a market that will see other producers exhausting their core inventories and looking for their next act i ll now turn it over to dennis to discuss operations dennis degner senior vice president of operations advertisement advertisement thank you jeff our operating teams are off to a strong start for the year with first quarter production on track and capital spending projected at or below our 2019 plant first capital spend came in at 214 million or approximately 30 of our 2019 budget production for the quarter came in at 2 256 bcf equivalent per day as a result of strong well results and quarter as we discussed on the prior call our capital spending program is front end loaded for the year as we look forward and similar to past years we expect our second and third quarter capital spending to each be approximately 25 of the annual budget this year first let s talk about the well results similar to prior quarters q1 generated some exceptional well performance which played a key role in exceeding guidance one example is in our appalachia dry gas acreage where we turned to sales 14 wells on two different pads with average ip s exceeding 30 million cubic feet per day from an average lateral length of over 13 000 feet both pads have produced at or above 100 million cubic feet per day for 60 days and continue to produce at this level as of this morning on the other side of our acreage position in the last week of the quarter we turned to sales three wells in the heart of our super rich acreage the average initial production from these wells was over 20 million cubic feet equivalent per day from an average lateral length of just under 7 000 feet despite the shorter lateral lengths on this pad the first three wells produced peak condensate production that exceeded 3 000 barrels per day solidly pointing to the quality of the acreage and results from the team s technical work flow back operations in this site will continue into the second quarter as we clean up the remaining four wells on the pad we expect the performance of this pad and other near term activity in the liquids rich area to increase condensate production back to a level above 11 000 barrels per day during the second quarter now let s look at field run time advertisement advertisement for the past several years our production team has conducted a thorough look back on the winter season with a focus on improving run time for the year ahead especially the winter this process coupled with our ability to monitor production realtime has allowed the team to hone in our freeze prevention solutions such as heat trace and focus our lease operating team on sites requiring their support ensuring production volumes flow as planned with downtime remaining low similar to the team s approach on zero vapor protocol this extensive effort between both the operations and technical teams translates into an improved run time and played a key role in our production performance in q1 the first quarter closed out with 26 total wells turned in line consisting of 20 wells in our dry acreage three super rich wells and three wells in north louisiana as we look ahead we are setting our second quarter production guidance at 2 27 to 2 2 bcf equivalent per day which aligns with our 2019 production plan to deliver approximately 6 production growth while delivering meaningful free cash flow within our capital budget of 756 million now let s turn to some of the team s operational highlights the past year has showcased several accomplishments by the appalachia drilling team as they drilled our longest fastest and most capital efficient wells the team s first quarter results continued this trend as they successfully drilled three of range s top five longest marcellus laterals with all three laterals exceeding 18 000 feet as discussed on prior calls range has been able to reduce drilling cost per foot during extended lateral operations by as much as 30 a contributing factor to our underspend last year and an important component in allowing us to deliver on this year s financial objectives as we deliver peer leading normalized well cost we look forward to sharing the production results from these long laterals in the upcoming quarters on the completion front the team pumped over 1 300 frac stages in the quarter while seeing a 20 efficiency increase in frac stages per day compared to the same time just one year ago both operational accomplishments point to the quality of our team coupled with the strength of our service partner relationships especially considering this was accomplished during winter conditions as jeff mentioned earlier water recycling continues to play a significant role in our sustainability efforts as we execute on our 2019 program as efficiently as possible you ve heard us talk about how we recycle 100 of range s water in southwest pennsylvania but through the team s creative efforts we have partnered with other operators to recycle their produced waters as well in the first quarter third party water comprised over 20 of our water usage advertisement advertisement range s water management program not only contributed to an efficient first quarter capital spend but it also contributed to range s first quarter corporate loe of 0 16 per mcfe which is approximately 16 below our loe when compared to the same time last year i think this is a great example of the team working tirelessly to find the next incremental step and efficiency gains cost reduction and overall improved program results and it s a great example of the team working collaboratively with other operators to be thoughtful stewards of the environment and pushing the standards for the industry shifting over to our liquids marketing efforts as we ve shared on a prior call the mariner east 1 pipeline was temporarily taken out of service in late january following a subsidence appearance along the pipeline route since that time the marketing team has worked diligently pursuing options to secure our production flows for propane we have utilized available capacity on mariner east 2 and other outlets to move our barrels to the marcus hook terminal and other markets in the case of ethane we have utilized various options for marketing our production to the quarter including both normal extraction and selling ethane as natural gas overall despite the temporary disruption on the mariner east i pipeline range has successfully engaged transportation and market alternatives to keep its natural gas liquids otherwise transported on me1 flowing to both domestic and international markets through the utilization of rail and other infrastructure in the region based upon the latest update from energy transfer start up procedures are under way with the mariner east i pipeline returning to service over the balance of next few days during the first quarter range resumed its waterborne butane export program that began last year this was enabled by the newly operational mariner east 2 pipeline in associated infrastructure at marcus hook going forward range has also positioned a portion of its butane volumes for export using an additional east coast terminal giving our products another outlet for accessing premium markets including hedges range s first quarter ngl realization was 23 17 per barrel an increase of 15 year over year based on recent strip pricing range expects pre hedge ngl pricing for 2019 to average 34 to 38 of wti on an absolute basis expected realizations are now slightly better than our original 2019 pricing guidance of february there has been some market confusion around ngl prices recently advertisement advertisement so i want to repeat that while the relationship to oil prices temporarily weakened our forward strip based on ngl price per barrel expectations are now slightly higher than when we had our year end earnings call propane and heavier products which represent over 75 of the ngl barrel s value continue to be well supported by international export demand currently u s export terminal capacity is tight and the u s propane and butane market is seeing the strongest international export orders in the past five years with prompt spot cargoes loading at over 0 10 per gallon net of shipping costs we expect this to cause max possible export of ngl products over the course of 2019 and ultimately support range s decision to gain access to marcus hook or other east coast export capabilities in the future on the gas marketing side the first quarter saw the full utilization of the recently commissioned mark west harmon creek i gas processing plant this facility along with the restart of the houston gas processing plant following fourth quarter outages saw strong run times for the first quarter and supported processing for first quarter wells focused in our liquids rich acreage as discussed on the prior call the new plan allows us to maximize the utilization of newly available long haul infrastructure with a significant amount of downstream takeaway capacity that has come online over the last couple of years local appalachia pricing has improved additionally with the slowdown in southwest pennsylvania production growth for the industry we believe this local pricing trend will continue further with the combination of additional downstream takeaway capacity and local generation demand growth we expect this will provide additional in basin liquidity and market growth opportunities with less transportation cost associated with incremental natural gas production range remains actively engaged in developing in basin markets and optimizing our infrastructure to existing in basin points of liquidity evidence of the team s work in optimizing the portfolio can be found in the 6 million net gain from the brokered gas marketing activities in the quarter i ll close out the operation section with this the team has done a great job with our first quarter results highlighting exceptional well performance capital discipline and operational efficiencies from long lateral development this really helps set the stage for delivering our capital budget and production targets in the year ahead i will now turn it over to mark to discuss the financials mark scucchi chief financial officer thank you dennis during the first quarter of 2019 range continues to execute on a free cash flow generating plan through efficient operations diligent capital deployment and stringent cost management from capital to production revenues to expenses range has met or beat guidance and has made early progress on the 2019 business plan on the back of solid operational performance range generated cash flow from operations of 261 million compared to capital spending of 214 million resulting in free cash flow of 53 million before dividend and corresponding debt reduction of 48 million as discussed on the last earnings call we made the transition to free cash flow mid year 2018 we ve continued that trend and expect to generate meaningful free cash flow for the full year 2019 focusing on the range s cost structure for a minute i d like to discuss trends and specific components of our unit costs our focus on expanding margins includes efforts to consistently realize competitive pricing for our production and to strategically manage costs such that our margins maximize full cycle returns over time starting with our largest cost line item gathering processing and transport expense was 1 49 per mcfe in the first quarter this cost consists of in field gathering processing plant expenses and long haul transport for natural gas and natural gas liquids long haul transport is largely a fixed cost with all of our contracted gas capacity online in field gathering has both fixed and variable elements much of the gathering system is fully utilized and as cost recovery hurdles are met the fixed rate component will decline over time on the processing side this is predominately structured as a percent of proceeds from ngl sales and will vary with our pre hedge ngl realizations for context per mcfe gathering represents roughly 0 50 transport roughly 0 50 and processing around 0 45 over the next few years we anticipate per unit gp t expense will decline driven by incremental in basin sales declines in gathering costs due to reuse of existing facility and the roll off of capital recovery range s lease operating cost per unit of production has declined 16 from the first quarter last year our competitive with liquids producing peers and on a more granular level our cost in dry gas areas are also competitive with best in class dry gas only producers g a is an item of particular focus as we continue to adapt the company to current business environment and our anticipated activity levels cash g a per unit has improved 22 since the first quarter last year as disclosed in the proxy statement 2019 estimated senior executive compensation is expected to decline approximately 30 compared to 2016 additional savings have been identified in areas such as consultants data subscriptions insurance brokers and software among others on the matter of equity compensation expense it should be noted that even though potential stock grants specifically performance shares are expensed that does not mean the shares were issued in fact significant forfeitures have been experienced which is evident in the one half of 1 change in diluted shares outstanding over the last year while steps have been taken to optimize spending we continue to focus on all expenditures to enhance profitability and resiliency turning to the balance sheet free cash flow from the first quarter resulted in a 48 million reduction in revolver borrowings while the business is seasonal we expect to generate material free cash flow over the balance of the year in addition divestiture processes continue on multiple fronts as we look at our debt profile we have balances readily repayable under the revolver without early redemption costs we remain focused on reducing debt maintaining a comfortable maturity layer and strengthening our balance sheet over time as it relates to asset sales we are currently marketing several opportunities these processes are in various stages from data rooms to active negotiations to diligence we re working conscientiously and we ll continue to evaluate opportunities to prudently monetize inventory as evidence of this goal absolute debt reduction was added as the incentive performance metric detailed in the proxy as we look forward to the balance of 2019 and beyond the framework through which we allocate capital remains a daily focus the focus on creating economic value we evaluate each reinvestment decision weighing relative returns and optimizing for total free cash flow absolute debt reduction leverage ratios capital efficiency unit cost margins and base decline rate and balancing objectives to maximize the value from the 2019 capital program we developed a 756 million capital plan this budget is a 20 reduction from prior year and we are on track to remain within this target in summary we remain focused on converting consistently efficient operations on top tier acreage into tangible shareholder returns through the application of a disciplined capital allocation framework coupled with continued cost management efforts jeff back to you jeff ventura chief executive officer operator let s open it up for q a questions and answers operator thank you mr ventura the first question comes from the line of marshall carver with heikkinen energy advisors marshall carver heikkinen energy advisors analyst yes thank you on the year end call you discussed spending approximately 35 of full year capex budget in 1q but spending came in below that was that due to well timing or well cost trending below your forecast do you have any color on that why the 1q spend came in lower dennis degner senior vice president of operations yes good morning marshall this is dennis i ll start of by saying we tried to highlight this morning a couple of key themes on what helped us basically have the capital spend results that we did in the first quarter and a big portion of it clearly is our operational efficiencies the drilling team continues to really do a great job of advancing the ball on our ability to drill long laterals and we see that translate into a significant reduction in our drilling cost per foot the other part is as we saw some efficiency gains this quarter versus last year through our fracturing operations 20 is a pretty strong move among our operating team that helped us harvest some capital savings as well and then thirdly the waterside i mean it s an area that we continue to see good cooperation between other operators on top of the 100 recycling effort that we have and it translates into significant savings as you look across the quarters and the balance of the year could translate into more savings on what we re seeing today so pretty encouraged by that the one pad that we had at the end of the quarter that we referenced in the super rich that we turned in line the three wells there are some wells that moved into the first weeks of q2 but the majority of those dollars are already spent so we re going to get the advantage of seeing those volumes show up in q2 which we re encouraged to see but there will be a few capital dollars that also show up in q2 marshall carver heikkinen energy advisors analyst all right thank you jeff ventura chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from the line of ron mills with johnson rice ron mills johnson rice analyst good morning jeff ventura chief executive officer good morning ron ron mills johnson rice analyst dennis you referenced ngl prices and i know relative given the move up in wti it looks like you brought down the low end of the range but your comments are pretty telling that even when using the strip the absolute prices are higher than are actually looking for trend higher any additional color whether it is about strip or your thoughts on ngl markets as we look through the rest of the year particularly fourth quarter when the seasonality starts to benefit ngls even more alan engberg vice president of liquids marketing team good morning ron thanks for the question this is alan engberg i m the vice president of our liquids marketing team so i ll see if i can give you some color around liquids absolute prices are actually similar to what we guided back in february there are up for the quarter actually roughly about 3 per barrel now as you know and as you pointed out crude was up quite a bit more crude is up about 15 a barrel for the quarter typically ngls will always lag crude on the way up and on the way down however this quarter there are a couple of one off events that caused it lag more than usual so if i start with lpg or starting with propane and butane exports in particular were one of the big drivers they were negatively impacted by an unusual amount of fog this year along with houston ship channel added to that there was a big fire at itc s tank farm that caused contamination of the water way and that further slowed down all traffic on the houston ship channel and by our estimates there was approximately 20 000 barrels per day that were impacted over a 45 day period so 9 million barrels that didn t ship so that was just a big kind of change to the market that the market wasn t expecting and note that the rest of the world has really come to depend on u s exports and those delays actually caused a spike in overseas prices both in europe and in asia that have resulted in right know what we re seeing is the highest lpg arms in roughly four years going forward we expect things improve this was a one off event it s over with the ship channel is pretty much cleared but on top of that we ve got new export capacity coming on so as we mentioned in the call me 1 is backup but also up in the northeast you have me 2 running and that s transporting roughly 150 000 to 165 000 barrels per day to marcus hook for export last year at this time those barrels were going into local storage this year they re going overseas so it s a big impact of supply demand balance up in the northeast shifting down the u s gulf targa is debottlenecking their capacity most of that will be next year but some of that has actually already happened they ve added a butane pipeline that adds roughly 30 a day of new capacity and then enterprise is debottlenecking their capacity they re adding 175 000 barrels per day with new export capacity that will be starting up in the third quarter so if you add up just that new export capacity we ve got 355 000 barrels per day that s going to be going into international markets that are actually hungry for the product and for just for reference 355 000 barrels per day u s produces gas plant production of propane and butane is roughly 2 2 million barrels per day i m just citing eia data for the most recent month that was published which is january of 19 so 355 000 out of 2 2 million a day is 16 of supply that s going to be additional increment that s going to be going offshore so for those reasons we expect things to improve as we continue on through the year for ethane things were a little bit different there we had ethane prices come off during the second half of the first quarter a big part of it is a story that we are already familiar with there s this big new crackers coming online that have been delayed so they were delays from last year and then in the first quarter we learned leaned of further delays so we have five new crackers that are coming on but they re coming on later in quarter sorry later in this year the fog also impacted ethane ethylene prices so ethane is the main feedstock for making ethylene ethylene prices dropped down quite a bit down to 0 13 per pound that put some pressure on ethane prices on top of that on the supply side cooler weather allowed more pipeline flow from various locations to mont belvieu it also allowed more fractionation capacity we ve got a little bit of new infrastructure new pipeline came on in february chinook s pipeline from the permian and lone star added new fractionator and then finally on the permian natural gas has been painful to watch actually we ve had waha index trading at negative values and when it s trading at negative values the permian producers have every incentive to recover as much ethane as the pipelines can take so we ve seen that happening as well but going forward on ethane the story does improve there as well so out of those five new crackers two of them are starting as we speak and then that s roughly 90 000 or sorry yes 90 000 barrels per day and then we ve got the other three are starting during the third quarter and that will add 215 000 barrels per day of demand added to that there will be more ethane exports with me1 backup as well as some of the capacity that s freed up on me1 due to me2 starting up there ll be more ethane moving on that pipeline and then our friends at ineos actually are bringing online a new vlec it will be the world s largest ethane carrier it s actually moving toward the houston ship channel now that thing will be able to hold 850 000 barrels per load and that will add roughly 15 000 barrels per day of demand that product will be going to new steam cracker that s starting up in china later on this year so overall with roughly 320 000 barrels a day of new ethane demand coming on during the next three to four months we expect to see some improvements in ethane prices and for the reasons i mentioned earlier in propane and butane prices ron mills johnson rice analyst great thank you for that and then one quick one in terms of completion timing is there any seasonality in terms of driving so many of the completions being weighted to the dry gas area in the first quarter or is it just a function of just moving through your acreage position given the shift in gas in super rich over the remainder of the year dennis degner senior vice president of operations yes ron the planning team looks not only at the next 12 months but they ll be looking at the next couple of years and based upon our type curves and our internal production forecast we ll be looking at where we have available capacity in our infrastructure and gathering system the goal will be to maximize utilization of that so when we see a change in well mix most of the time it s going to be tied directly to those drivers i think an example of that i d point to would be toward the end of last year as we brought on some compression in the northern part of washington county to support harmon creek 1 you saw us then of course through q4 bringing on several wet gas wells that was then going to utilize that infrastructure that then ties to our long haul takeaway at rover so you ll see some fluctuations at time but it tends to be tied to the infrastructure at how we can best utilize it and keep costs low ron mills johnson rice analyst great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of rehan rashid with b riley fbr rehan rashid b riley fbr analyst good morning thank you for taking my question jeff ventura chief executive officer good morning rehan rashid b riley fbr analyst two quick questions one the 20 improvement in frac efficiency i think that was mentioned earlier kind of what changed and kind of how does that drive capex per well if i could get some color on that that s one and two maybe a little bit more color around kind of the divestiture time line and any particular area that s focus in terms of divesting jeff ventura chief executive officer thanks for joining us on the call this morning i ll start with the frac efficiencies and hand over to mark on the frac efficiencies we had exactly quantified how all that savings will be translated into our cost per foot as of this morning but we know that as you look between winter and i ll just say non winter operations they re substantial savings and mainly because of some of the supporting hardware that goes along with our operations during the winter whether it s supporting equipment etc when you look at our cost of completing and drilling wells what we see is that over the balance of time it translates into reduced cost per foot for us so when you look a year ago efficiencies were starting to kind of stabilize at that point this year we re seeing through the balance of continuous operations with some of our crews and also increase in our knowledge base on location we re seeing that performance translate into really improved performance on location so we really like what we see and expect that this should continue throughout the balance of the year now with some seasonal differences you might see little bit of a fluctuation but the crews have performed extremely well pointing back to our service partner relationships mark scucchi chief financial officer good morning rehan this is mark on the divestiture front as we ve talked about before we have a number of processes under way and again they re in various stages from negotiations there s the data rooms to diligence with a variety of efforts under way we re not good to pin down the timing but what i can point to is a few facts that hopefully gives us some comfort and some guidance into what we re striving to achieve so obviously we were successful last year in closing on the royalty sale and closing october of last year we will consider royalties again we ve mentioned northeast pa we mentioned noncore acreage as potential candidates all those dialogues are ongoing another read on the sense of urgency not just kind of our alignment of interest but the importance of the factor as well as the timing is the addition of an absolute debt reduction target in the management performance measurements and incentive program as you can see in the proxy so there are specific targets there for us to strive to achieve at the high end to maximize that metric that would be a 700 million reduction in debt for 2019 so while we re not going to give specific guidance on timing or dollar amounts of specific transactions those are in broad strokes how we re thinking about it and what we re striving to achieve rehan rashid b riley fbr analyst ok and just maybe a different way to ask the same question on the divestiture thought process your cost of debt is so much more lower than implied by your cost of equity when you re thinking of kind of acceptable pricing what would you expect to be more closer to your cost of debt as you kind of divest these assets and the cash flow limits or kind of how much deeper would you have to go away from your cost of debt and closer to cost of equity think about kind of what multiples you would get on your cash flows or anything else associated with it does that question makes sense i m not sure if i asked it properly mark scucchi chief financial officer sure i think i understand where you re headed so the answer would depend on what type of asset you re talking about for example some of the acreage is non producing so there is no cash flow so we re talking about a portion of our asset base or inventory that s not reflected clearly and no value in our equity so that type of valuation metric might not be the most applicable as it relates to others you can look at that asset value full blown just kind of cash flow valuation and of course we will look at cash flow in multiples as well so based on the markets and the interested investors in each of these or acquirers in each of these packages i would say that these are all we fully expect to be deleveraging type transactions and very reasonable relative to our corporate cost of capital rehan rashid b riley fbr analyst ok got it thank you mark scucchi chief financial officer thank you rehan operator your next question comes from the line of brian singer with goldman sachs brian singer goldman sachs analyst thank you good morning jeff ventura chief executive officer good morning brian brian singer goldman sachs analyst you mentioned that your ability to continue to push out lateral lengths with some of the 18 000 feet lateral test can you remind us year base expectations for how you see well cost per foot and eurs per foot evolving and then how long do you think you can push out those laterals until you would either see sufficient operational risk or acreage limitations dennis degner senior vice president of operations yes good morning brian at this point we re really confident in the 18 000 foot lateral length that we ve been able to drill i think on the prior call we referenced that we certainly had a substantial number of laterals that were in excess of 15 000 feet when you look at and we ve been able to do this across as we think about our acreage position both in the core of washington county where we had historical wells but we ve also been able to do it in areas where maybe we have a cleaner sheet of paper and fewer wells that we re drilling around so by having a blocky acreage position the way we do and it being continuous it really affords us an opportunity coupled with the gathering system to really to maximize that lateral length opportunity we ve typically been a incrementing type operating team so rarely will you see us go from 5 000 feet to say 20 000 feet in any kind of operation because we understand that we want to manage the risk and part of being us part of us being successful in an unconventional resource play is being repeatable so getting to that 18 000 feet point that we ve gotten today we really like the results we re seeing as we look back on the performance of these wells i ll shift there for a quick second the wells that we reported toward the end of last year that we drilled one it was at 17 800 and the other one as at 18 100 both of those wells are at or above the tight curve the super rich type curve still today we looked at those results just over the last few days so we really like what we see on a normalized basis out of the wells the drilling team continues to push down cost per foot we ve seen as we ve mentioned earlier as much as a 30 increase so we really like the direction we re headed average drilling length this year i believe we reported was going to be about 13 000 feet for the program but when you look at a lot of our references it s not uncommon again for us to point to 10 000 feet we feel like that s a good spot as well but we will have those cases like a few of the super rich wells we ve pointed out that ip ed at 7 000 feet so we will have some filling space but our goal will always be to maximize on the lateral length because we see that is the most capital efficient approach brian singer goldman sachs analyst great thank you and then to follow up on the divestiture question given that this has been an area of focus for some time can you just broadly discuss how the market environment and marketing interest in appalachia upstream assets either directly or via royalty compares today relative to 12 to 18 months ago jeff ventura chief executive officer sure so i d say depending on area the evolution of investor interest and the bid ask spread has evolved so for example in north east pennsylvania with atlantic sunrise coming online seeing actual sales occur basis tightening not just in the forward curves but in the spot market and the actual physical transactions that gives potential buyers greater confidence in the economics that they re forecasting so that i would say is an improvement the variety of interested parties and types of investors remains pretty diverse and strong there are multiple potential parties in each data room in southwest pennsylvania i would say that those discussions continue to evolve just as an example after we announced last fall successful royalty sale we actually received several inbound phone calls of party saying hey i wish we had known that that something that you would consider so in general i would say that the a d market is alive and functioning brian singer goldman sachs analyst great thank you very much jeff ventura chief executive officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of jane trotsenko with stifel please go ahead jane trotsenko stifel financial corp analyst good morning in the press release you mentioned that range is actually engaged in developing in basin demand to support the use of natural gas in local markets could you please expand a little bit on that dennis degner senior vice president of operations yes good morning one of the things that we see as you can imagine with the kind of let s just say resource certainty that you have in a place like southwest pa you re now starting to see more and more discussions around industry development an easy example to point to would be that would utilize demand an easy example to point to would be the shell cracker as an example we re seeing more and more inquiries now come in for industry development that could be right there on top of our acreage footprint or at least in a very very close proximity that would allow for us to have some in basin liquidity as we move forward whether that s power generation again or other industries that have a strong interest in moving to the region we re going to continue to look at those opportunities and make sure that they have a good thorough scrubbing and how they can potentially fit with reducing our cost and be a part of our portfolio going forward jane trotsenko stifel financial corp analyst perfect thanks and my second one is on northeast pennsylvania i m curious which pricing point that gas is priced at jeff ventura chief executive officer much of our gas sold out of northeast pennsylvania is priced length a leidy jane trotsenko stifel financial corp analyst leidy ok got it and maybe the last question is on terryville maybe you can update your current thoughts update us on your current thoughts on terryville how we should be thinking about activity levels going forward and if you are marketing this asset as well dennis degner senior vice president of operations yes on the go forward i ll try to take a step back and see from a terryville activity standpoint in the beginning of the year we ve kind of laid the groundwork that it s an area where we re going to spend around 10 of the capital this year with the 90 going to appalachia we have some technical thoughts that we re continuing to explore throughout the year and continuing to test we ve got a drilling rig that s been operating there for the past few months and we ll most likely start to wrap up sometime mid year pending our results we see over the months ahead the asset really has to be at the place where it competes on a risk adjusted basis and we ve got to find repeatability in the results that we see there as you would imagine as we look over the balance of 2018 and 19 there are things that we really like and are still excited about from the asset standpoint but it still has to compete with the marcellus and that s what we re trying to work through here in the months ahead jane trotsenko stifel financial corp analyst but just to clarify you are not marketing those assets as of right now right mark scucchi chief financial officer this is mark no it is not being actively marketed right now but to dennis point you can see the strengthening capital allocation the approach the science that s being done there and just assuming out as we evaluate the inventory and think about it and think about the purpose of the almost 10 of the capital budget allocated to that property this year it was around managing that client profit and managing the cash flow from that asset so just in terms of how we manage the portfolio overall we ll continue to optimize and do everything we can to maximize the value jane trotsenko stifel financial corp analyst ok got it thanks a lot operator your next question comes from the line of sameer panjwani with tudor pickering holt sameer panjwani tudor pickering holt and company analyst hey guys good morning jeff ventura chief executive officer good morning mark scucchi chief financial officer good morning sameer panjwani tudor pickering holt and company analyst i was hoping you could reconcile the debt reduction target with the leverage targets for 2019 and i think you mentioned earlier that 700 million was your top level target for debt reduction which i believe implies about 600 million of asset sale proceeds given your organic free cash flow expectations for the year but on the leverage side of the proxy it looks like you have 2 5 times as your top level target and my math would imply over 1 billion of assets of proceeds to kind of hit that without assuming any ebitda loss so couldyou just reconcile the difference between the two or provide some context of that how we should think about those two metrics mark scucchi chief financial officer so the two are conceptually linked of course in producing absolute debt but they re not mathematically hardwired because the leverage ratio can change based on commodity prices and other outside factors frankly beyond our control we re well hedged at over 80 on the cash side this year so that certainly helps add certainty to the trajectory but the idea there is we evaluate credit holistically the debt to ebitda ratio was certainly one measure of improving and strengthening the balance sheet but just an example of why it s important to look at it from an absolute debt perspective as well you could improve the leverage ratio as debt to ebitda by growing faster and having no absolute debt reduction so the concept behind pairing those two is to demonstrate the fact that we are talking about debt reduction in the absolute as well as improving an entire host of credit metrics among them debt to ebitda so they re intended to function together as the holistic evaluation of the balance sheet is considered sameer panjwani tudor pickering holt and company analyst ok yes i guess my read into it was that the leverage target was implying that there could be additional asset sales beyond what s kind of implied in the absolute debt reduction target is that not the right way to think about it mark scucchi chief financial officer we haven t given any hard dollar amount associated with either individually or any aggregate the asset sales processes we have under way so i ll defer that to you to assign whatever evaluations you d like to the packages but suffice it to say again it s about crystallizing the value of non core assets or assets where that capital can be better deployed elsewhere in range sameer panjwani tudor pickering holt and company analyst ok thank you mark scucchi chief financial officer thank you operator we are nearing the end of today s conference we will go to kashy harrison of simmons energy for our final question kashy harrison simmons energy analyst good morning everyone and thanks for taking my question so i had a quick follow up for alan he you gave some really great color on incoming ethane demand i was just wondering in your opinion and just your global experience in the field do you find the forward market trend sales to be more to be fairly efficient and do you think there is properly pricing in that demand or do you find the forward market could be or maybe perhaps a bit more volatile and then kind of tagging onto that does the 36 of ti assumption bake in your expectation for improving ethane demand or is that just based on whatever you are seeing in the forward market alan engberg vice president of liquids marketing team thanks kashy this is alan yes that s a good question forward curves for natural gas liquids speculating on natural gas liquids aren t quite as liquid as let s say natural gas or crude oil and similar to natural gas though the activity down the curve is largely producer driven activity the chemical players in the market those that are naturally short and that are physical buyers of the products aren t active hedgers maybe because they have a spread that they would need to hedge and the polymer markets are even less liquid let s say than the ngl markets so for that reason the shape of the curve often is dictated by the trading activity in people s view of the market but to a large extent also by hedging activity of producers so to answer your question no i don t believe it s always a good guide of what forward prices are actually going to be it shifts what today s value is that you can get the market for that forward strip so our guide is based on the strip and i would say with reference to the numbers that we ve published we believe that there s upside to that guide for all the reasons that i mentioned in my in answering that previous question around ethane propane and butane does that answer your question kashy harrison simmons energy analyst that does thank you operator thank you this concludes today s question and answer session i d like to turn the call back over to mr ventura for his concluding remarks jeff ventura chief executive officer yes i just want to thank everybody for participating on the call this morning and feel free to follow up for any questions that you might have

to conduct cultural and academic exchanges carry out human resources and media cooperation and increase youth and women engagement in the initiative why is the bri so popular the bri has been the most popular global public good and most promising platform for international cooperation so what makes it so important behind its growing popularity on the one hand the bri has opened a new area for international cooperation the world today is experiencing profound changes unseen in a century protectionism and unilateralism are rising and so are uncertainties and destabilizing factors the bri is a significant move china has taken to fully open itself under the new conditions and it embodies china s commitment to sharing development opportunities and outcomes with more countries in the world as such the bri will help move economic globalization toward greater openness inclusiveness balance and win win outcomes on the other the bri has created new impetus and opportunities for global growth since the outbreak of the international financial crisis in 2008 creating new growth drivers has become a task for the international community the bri aims to address the fundamental issue of promoting development by enhancing all round connectivity the latest studies by the world bank and other international institutions suggest that the bri cooperation will cut the costs of global trade by 1 1 to 2 2 percent what is more it will contribute at least 0 1 percent of global growth in 2019 what has been achieved since its inception six years ago the bri has received strong endorsement and warm support of the international community its achievements are there to be seen china has signed 174 bri cooperation documents with 126 countries and 29 international organizations so far china s trade with and investment in the bri participating countries exceed 6 trillion u s dollars and 80 billion u s dollars respectively the 82 cooperation industrial parks built by china and the countries along the belt and road have created around 300 000 local jobs through belt and road cooperation some countries now have their first motorways or modern railways some has developed its own car industry and some have seen an end to their longstanding power shortages abundant opportunities have been brought to those countries and people derive a sense of engagement gain and happiness from the initiative latin america and the caribbean natural extension of the bri the bri was never meant to be limited to certain countries along certain routes as the idea was for participation and prosperity on a global scale ever since it was born that makes the initiative open to all countries as well as international and regional organizations starting from 2017 when chinese president xi jinping called latin america the natural extension of the belt and road during his meeting with president of argentina macri an increasing number of countries in latin america and the caribbean lac have joined the bri on january 22 2018 the 2nd ministerial meeting of the china celac forum issued the special statement on the belt and road initiative signaling that the bri has formally extended to the americas on july 13 2018 china and dominica signed mou on belt and road cooperation more recently barbados and jamaica signed mou with china in february and april respectively this year bringing the number of

over 200 billion u s dollars in 2017 the two sides are complementary in their economic development and there is so much potential for their future cooperation the bri will bring this sound economic cooperation to a new level bri the road to a community with a shared future for mankind over 2000 years ago when chinese envoy and diplomat zhang qian traveled westward three times on what was later known as the silk road to as far as the roman empire a seed of connection was sown this route has witnessed trade cultural exchanges and prosperity since then entering the 21st century it is especially meaningful to rethink connectivity to figure out ways to link each one of us so we can work together to achieve prosperity this is a globalized world where global perspectives are valuable assets isolation leads to nowhere while openness and cooperation are the mainstream of our times the belt and road initiative is such a product that china provides as a solution to meeting global challenges in development this seed of connection will continue to grow as more countries join this initiative and play their part with all our efforts the bri will move the world towards peace

in this release information is presented on an adjusted basis formerly called adjusted pro forma which is a non generally accepted accounting principles non gaap measure adjusted results begin with information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america u s gaap adjusted to exclude certain items and reflect the conversion of vested and certain unvested evercore lp units and interests as well as acquisition related share issuances and unvested restricted stock units granted to isi employees into class a shares evercore believes that the disclosed adjusted measures and any adjustments thereto when presented in conjunction with comparable u s gaap measures are useful to investors to compare evercore s results across several periods and facilitate an understanding of evercore s operating results the company uses these measures to evaluate its operating performance as well as the performance of individual employees these measures should not be considered a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with u s gaap these adjusted amounts are allocated to the company s two business segments investment banking and investment management the differences between the adjusted and u s gaap results are as follows 1 assumed vesting of evercore lp units and exchange into class a shares the company incurred expenses in employee compensation and benefits resulting from the vesting of class e lp units issued in conjunction with the acquisition of isi as well as the class h lp interests and class j lp units the amount of expense for the class h lp interests was based on the determination if it was probable that evercore isi would achieve certain earnings and margin targets in 2017 and in future periods the adjusted results assume these lp units and certain class h lp interests have vested and have been exchanged for class a shares accordingly any expense associated with these units and interests and related awards is excluded from the adjusted results and the noncontrolling interest related to these units is converted to a controlling interest the company s management believes that it is useful to provide the per share effect associated with the assumed conversion of these previously granted equity interests and thus the adjusted results reflect the exchange of certain vested and unvested evercore lp partnership units and interests and ipo related restricted stock unit awards into class a shares 2 adjustments associated with business combinations and divestitures the following charges resulting from business combinations and divestitures have been excluded from the adjusted results because the company s management believes that operating performance is more comparable across periods excluding the effects of these acquisition related charges a amortization of intangible assets and other purchase accounting related amortization amortization of intangible assets and other purchase accounting related amortization from the acquisition of isi and certain other acquisitions b acquisition and transition costs primarily professional fees incurred and costs related to transitioning acquisitions or divestitures c gain on sale of institutional trust and independent fiduciary business of etc the gain resulting from the sale of the institutional trust and independent fiduciary business of etc in the fourth quarter of 2017 d foreign exchange gains losses release of cumulative foreign exchange losses resulting from the restructuring of our equity method investment in g5 in the fourth quarter of 2017 3 special charges expenses during 2019 that are excluded from the adjusted presentation relate to the acceleration of depreciation expense for leasehold improvements in conjunction with the previously announced expansion of our headquarters in new york expenses during 2018 that are excluded from the adjusted presentation relate to separation benefits and costs of terminating certain contracts associated with closing the agency trading platform in the u k 4 income taxes evercore is organized as a series of limited liability companies partnerships c corporations and a public corporation and therefore not all of the company s income is subject to corporate level taxes as a result adjustments have been made to the adjusted earnings to assume that the company is subject to the statutory tax rates of a c corporation under a conventional corporate tax structure in the u s at the prevailing corporate rates and that all deferred tax assets relating to foreign operations are fully realizable within the structure on a consolidated basis this assumption is consistent with the assumption that certain evercore lp units are vested and exchanged into class a shares as discussed in item 1 above as the assumed exchange would change the tax structure of the company a 2 excluded from the company s adjusted results are adjustments related to the impact of the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act that was signed into law on december 22 2017 which resulted in a reduction in income tax rates in the u s in 2018 and future years the tax reform resulted in an estimated adjustment to other revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 of 77 5 million related to the re measurement of amounts due pursuant to our tax receivable agreement which was reduced due to the lower enacted income tax rates in the u s in 2018 and future years 5 presentation of interest expense the adjusted results present interest expense on short term repurchase agreements within the investment management segment in other revenues net as the company s management believes it is more meaningful to present the spread on net interest resulting from the matched financial assets and liabilities in addition adjusted investment banking and investment management operating income are presented before interest expense on debt which is included in interest expense on a u s gaap basis 6 presentation of income from equity method investments the adjusted results present income from equity method investments within revenue

before capitalism there was work before markets before even money there was work our remotest ancestors hunting and gathering almost certainly did not see work as a separate compartmentalized part of life in the way we do today but we have always had to work to live even in the 21st century we strive through work for the means to live hence the campaign for a living wage as a species we like to define ourselves through our thoughts and wisdom as homo sapiens but we could as easily do so through the way we consciously apply effort towards certain goals by our work as homo laborans it nonetheless took two revolutions one agricultural one industrial to turn work into its own category industrial capitalism sliced and diced human time into clearly demarcated chunks of work and leisure work was then bundled and packaged into one of the most important inventions of the modern era a job from this point on the workers fight was for a job that delivered maximum benefits especially in terms of wages in return for minimum costs imposed on the worker especially in terms of time for karl marx the whole capitalist system was ineluctably rigged against workers whatever the short run victories of the trade unions the capitalist retained the power the ultimate control over workers time and the worker would remain forever alienated from their work the goal was to assert sovereignty over our own time free of the temporal control of the capitalist able to hunt in the morning fish in the afternoon rear cattle in the evening criticise after dinner the problem of alienation is far from solved only one in three american workers say they feel engaged with their work but in terms of material conditions of life across the broad sweep of economic history capitalism has delivered pretty well for most workers wages rose hours fell life mostly got better global poverty halved as an economic system socialism fell from grace and by and large and in spite of recent rhetoric on the american political left continues to fall there are many variants of capitalism of course from welfarist scandinavia through anglo saxon laissez faire to chinese market statism but the trend seemed pretty clear capitalism works and it works most importantly for workers but now over the last decade the logic of markets and the workings of capitalism have been intensely questioned and challenged both from the populist right and the socialist left young americans and supporters of the democratic party are now more enthusiastic about socialism than capitalism by 6 and 10 margins respectively leading candidates now proudly describe themselves as socialists unthinkable just a few years ago whether they are in fact socialists by any sensible definition of the term is of course another matter future history books may begin the chapter on the current era with the events of 15 september 2008 when lehman brothers filed for the biggest bankruptcy in history with 639bn in assets and 619bn in debt or perhaps the starting date will be three years later when on 17 september 2011 two years after the official end of the recession hundreds of protesters gathered in manhattan s zuccoti park to occupy wall street or 8 november 2016 when donald trump ascended to the highest office in the land it all depends whether in hindsight our crisis comes to be seen as economic or political in nature certainly the great recession was a massive economic shock nine million jobs were lost and 4m homes foreclosed on average household income dropped by 7 black families saw their already limited wealth stock cut almost in half and the recovery has been painfully slow in what some economists have labeled a zombie economy but the great recession also shone a light on trends long predating the downturn not least in terms of stagnant wage growth for so many workers by comparison with the postwar years economic growth has been slow for the last few decades at the same time the transmission mechanism linking economic growth to the wages of workers appears to have broken the share of income going to workers has dropped sharply from 65 in 1974 to 57 in 2017 in the last few years as the zombie gradually wakes up household incomes and wages have begun to nudge upwards but families are still having to work more hours to get the income they need women are working more and earning more though the pay gap remains but as men work less and earn less many families are simply standing still in economic terms since 1979 the median male wage in the us has dropped by 1 4 for white men and by 9 and 8 for black and hispanic men respectively workers at the top of the earnings and education distribution have seen their paychecks continue to fatten not so on the middle and bottom rungs of the labor market wage growth remains torpid in the middle of the distribution at the same time the volatility of incomes at the bottom of the distribution has grown in part because of shifts towards the so called gig economy intrinsically episodic and in part because of the rise of unpredictable schedules most american workers are still paid by the hour and half of them have no formal control over their schedules two in five hourly paid workers aged between 26 and 32 know their schedules less than a week in advance hard to arrange childcare on that notice many american workers are fighting like the trade unions of old on two fronts for money and for time why why for so many for middle class and working class americans has economic growth become a spectator sport as the liberal economist jared bernstein memorably put it there are two competing explanations for what happened to tear the connective tissue between growth and wages the productivity story and the power story the productivity story goes as follows wages reflect the productivity of the worker the modern economy rewards skills more than in the past and lots of people have not upskilled quickly enough under the wonky label skills biased technological change this view prevailed across most of the political spectrum well into this century free markets could deliver fair enough outcomes so long as everyone got the education and training they needed lifelong learning became the mantra of all and the cliched answer from politicians and scholars to the deepening problem of inequality there are two problems with this story first the necessary investments in education and training were never actually made community colleges the most common post secondary destination for students from families in the bottom 80 of the income distribution are underfunded overstretched and largely ignored by the policy elite lifelong learning never made it from the thinktank policy briefs and davos panels to the real lives of real people the second problem is that productivity turns out to be only part of the story and perhaps not even the most important part it is certainly wrong to claim that there is no relationship at all between productivity growth and wage growth but the connection has certainly become less clear over time and harder to square with the trends in wage inequality even the strongest and most thoughtful proponents of the productivity story such as michael strain director of economic policy studies at the american enterprise institute concede that it is but one element as strain writes it is most useful to think of wages as being determined by a combination of competitive market forces bargaining power and institutions the power story is that wages do not reflect the productivity of the worker but their power lower wages are a reflection of growing powerlessness the result of four intersecting trends first unions have become almost mythical creatures unicorns of the labor market just one in 20 workers in the us private sector are members of a trade union down from more than one in four in the 1950s sometime around 1980 us businesses declared war on unions and won second the wage gap between similarly qualified workers in different companies has widened one widely cited study finds that one third of the increase in the earnings gap from 1978 to 2013 occurred within firms while two thirds of the rise occurred between firms it is the market power of one firm versus another that determines wages rather than the power of a particular employer versus its workers even if workers can get organized they cannot force a completely different employer to share more of their surplus with them now that would be socialism third market power has become increasingly concentrated into fewer larger companies especially in terms of power in the labor market the dangers of monopoly power in market economies are well known and the push for strong anti trust laws has historically united the pro market right and the progressive left in recent years the threat of monopsony power ie a dominant single buyer not least in employment has risen amazon is the poster child of monopsony power but in many towns a single hospital might be the biggest employer and the sole employer of nurses for example hard in these circumstances for workers to negotiate better pay and conditions fourth the labor market is not as tight as it looks there is a still a large reserve army of workers serving to hold wages down this may not be what the headline unemployment rate now down to 4 is telling us but the headline rate tells us less than in the past because millions of workers have dropped out altogether and so are not counted in the unemployment statistics the chances of a prime age man being in paid work has dropped by eight percentage points in the postwar decades for most of this period women s employment rates were increasing but in the us at least that rise stopped abruptly around the turn of the century and has actually edged down slightly black hispanic and less educated adults have all seen the sharpest drops in participation this powerlessness of workers in specific companies has fuelled calls for higher minimum wages at a federal level the value of the wage floor has dropped by 46 since 1968 seminal scholarship from david card and the late great alan krueger helped to allay fears about negative economic consequences of a higher minimum wage but a big challenge here is that the gap between richer and poorer places has also grown a 15 minimum wage may make perfect sense in boston median wage 24 16 an hour but perhaps not in brownsville texas median wage 11 59 half of us workers earn less than 18 58 per hour a worker without power is one with a lighter paycheck they may also suffer greater indignities or disrespect in the course of daily working life james bloodworth s hired six months undercover in low wage britain describes the loss of dignity faced by amazon warehouse employees and uber drivers horror stories abound of workers under constant surveillance unable to take bathroom breaks and so resorting to adult diapers or bullied or harassed by bosses or other workers in 2011 the morning call of allentown pennsylvania reported that managers at the local amazon warehouse refused to open the doors for ventilation despite soaring temperatures they put ambulances outside instead for the workers who collapsed vivid stuff and no doubt true in the particular but it is important to note that it is not the general experience of most workers the proportion of americans reporting that they were treated with respect at work has held steady at around 92 since 2002 according to the general social survey for some critics of capitalism workers lost the power struggle right at the outset as marx groucho this time not karl once put it what makes wage slaves wages whatever material gains workers managed to achieve came at the price of a profound loss of sovereignty in her book private government how employers rule our lives and why we don t talk about it philosopher elizabeth anderson argues that ceos are the new totalitarians who think of themselves as libertarian individualists while acting in practice as dictators of little communist governments we imagine ourselves free but effectively barter our freedom away in exchange for pay effectively handing over our passports as we punch in what most people want is a job that pays a decent wage and offers both some satisfaction and security the harsher critics of the system like anderson believe that these goals are incompatible at a deep level with capitalist dynamics but at least for some especially for white men market capitalism delivered pretty well for at least a generation this is why it was so important to fight to crowbar the doors open for women and people of color the progressive goal was not to curtail the market but to open it in very recent historical time the general direction of history seemed to be towards capitalism of one kind or another in the sliver of time between the fall of the berlin wall and the fall of lehman brothers it seemed like markets embedded in liberal democracies were the preordained future fukuyama declared the end of history scholars adopted the term late capitalism to describe the the trends towards service led economies and increasingly flexible working arrangements flexible that is for the employer but with the dislocation insecurity and inequality witnessed over the last decade it is hard to disagree with the narrator of adam thirlwell s novel lurid and cute who exclaims of capitalism late it had only just got started

items not allocated to segments venezuela operations prior to the deconsolidation of our venezuelan subsidiaries effective june 30 2018 we excluded from our segment results all of our venezuela operating results due to the venezuelan government s restrictions that prevented us from repatriating funds as a result the chief executive officer the company s chief operating decision maker codm assessed segment performance and made resource decisions by segment excluding venezuela operating results reorganization and restructuring 2016 restructuring in the fourth quarter of 2016 management implemented restructuring actions across our global business operations and our corporate functions as a result of these actions we recognized 18 1 million in related 2016 costs and an additional 17 3 million in 2017 we recognized additional charges of 2 7 million in the first three months of 2018 under this restructuring the actions under this program were substantially completed in 2018 other restructurings management periodically implements restructuring actions in targeted sections of our business as a result of these actions we recognized charges of 1 0 million in the first three months of 2018 and 3 5 million in the first three months of 2019 primarily severance costs for the current restructuring actions we expect to incur additional costs between 4 million and 6 million in future periods due to the unique circumstances around these charges these management directed items have not been allocated to segment results and are excluded from non gaap results acquisitions and dispositions certain acquisition and disposition items that are not considered part of the ongoing activities of the business and are special in nature are consistently excluded from non gaap results these items are described below 2019 acquisitions and dispositions amortization expense for acquisition related intangible assets was 6 4 million in the first three months of 2019 we incurred 4 6 million in integration costs related to dunbar in the first three months of 2019 restructuring costs related to our dunbar and rodoban acquisitions were 2 5 million in the first three months of 2019

brazil of 5 0 million compensation expense related to the retention of key dunbar employees was 4 1 million in 2018 we recognized a net gain in 2018 2 6 million net of statutory employee benefit on the sale of real estate in mexico argentina highly inflationary impact beginning in the third quarter of 2018 we designated argentina s economy as highly inflationary for accounting purposes as a result argentine peso denominated monetary assets and liabilities are now remeasured at each balance sheet date to the currency exchange rate then in effect with currency remeasurement gains and losses recognized in earnings in addition nonmonetary assets retain a higher historical basis when the currency is devalued the higher historical basis results in incremental expense being recognized when the nonmonetary assets are consumed in the first quarter of 2019 we recognized 4 3 million in pretax charges related to highly inflationary accounting including currency remeasurement losses of 3 9 million reporting compliance certain third party compliance costs incurred are excluded from first quarter 2019 non gaap results the costs excluded relate to the implementation and january 1 2019

millions except for percentages and per share amounts non gaap results described in this press release are financial measures that are not required by or presented in accordance with u s generally accepted accounting principles gaap the purpose of the non gaap results is to report financial information from the primary operations of our business by excluding the effects of certain income and expenses that do not reflect the ordinary earnings of our operations the specific items excluded have not been allocated to segments are described on page 8 and in more detail in our form 10 q and are reconciled to comparable gaap measures below in addition we refer to non gaap constant currency amounts which represent current period results and forecasts at prior period exchange rates non gaap results adjust the quarterly non gaap tax rates so that the non gaap tax rate in each of the quarters is equal to the full year estimated non gaap tax rate the full year non gaap tax rate in both years excludes certain pretax and income tax amounts amounts reported for prior periods have been updated in this report to present information consistently for all periods presented the 2019 non gaap outlook amounts for provision for income taxes income loss from continuing operations eps from continuing operations effective income tax rate and adjusted ebitda cannot be reconciled to gaap without unreasonable effort we cannot reconcile these amounts to gaap because we are unable to accurately forecast the impact of highly inflationary accounting on our argentina operations or other potential non gaap adjusting items for which the timing and amounts are currently under review such as future restructuring actions the impact of highly inflationary accounting and other potential non gaap adjusting items could be significant to our gaap results the non gaap financial measures are intended to provide investors with a supplemental comparison of our operating results and trends for the periods presented our management believes these measures are also useful to investors as such measures allow investors to evaluate our performance using the same metrics that our management uses to evaluate past performance and prospects for future performance we do not consider these items to be reflective of our core operating performance due to the variability of such items from period to period in terms of size nature and significance additionally non gaap results are utilized as performance measures in certain management incentive compensation plans non gaap results reconciled to

gaap effective tax rate is estimated at 33 0 for 2019 and was 34 2 for 2018 our u s retirement plans are frozen and costs related to these plans are excluded from non gaap results certain non u s operations also have retirement plans settlement charges related to these non u s plans are also excluded from non gaap results represents the estimated impact of tax legislation enacted into law in the fourth quarter of 2017 this primarily relates to the u s tax reform expense from the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets the non gaap tax rate excludes the 2018 and 2017 foreign tax benefits that resulted from the transaction that accelerated u s tax in 2015 effective june 30 2018 we deconsolidated our investment in venezuelan subsidiaries and recognized a pretax charge of 126 7

and full year of 2018 there is no difference between gaap and non gaap share based compensation amounts for the other periods presented adjusted ebitda is defined as non gaap income from continuing operations excluding the impact of non gaap interest expense non gaap income tax provision non gaap depreciation and amortization and non gaap share based compensation because we reported a loss from continuing operations on a gaap basis in the second quarter of 2018 and full year 2018 gaap eps was calculated using basic shares however as we reported income from continuing operations on a non gaap basis in the second quarter of 2018 and full year 2018 non gaap eps was calculated using diluted shares post deconsolidation funding of ongoing costs related to our venezuelan operations was 0 5 million in the first three months of 2019 0 6 million in the second half of 2018 and was expensed as incurred and reported in interest and other nonoperating income expense we do not expect future

gaap 36 million profit growth more than offset negative currency translation of 22 million total u s revenue up 53 profit tripled to 24 million margin doubled to 8 1 doug pertz president and chief executive officer said today we reported strong first quarter non gaap results including a 19 increase in operating profit and a 16 increase in eps as continued profit momentum in the u s and mexico more than offset the reported 10 million profit decline that we expected in argentina due to currency translation in constant currency non gaap operating profit and eps were up 50 and 59 respectively our first quarter results support our full year non gaap guidance which targets operating profit growth of 20 despite the expected persistence of currency headwinds our non gaap guidance also includes

items not allocated to segments venezuela operations prior to the deconsolidation of our venezuelan subsidiaries effective june 30 2018 we excluded from our segment results all of our venezuela operating results due to the venezuelan government s restrictions that prevented us from repatriating funds as a result the chief executive officer the company s chief operating decision maker codm assessed segment performance and made resource decisions by segment excluding venezuela operating results reorganization and restructuring 2016 restructuring in the fourth quarter of 2016 management implemented restructuring actions across our global business operations and our corporate functions as a result of these actions we recognized 18 1 million in related 2016 costs and an additional 17 3

restructurings management periodically implements restructuring actions in targeted sections of our business as a result of these actions we recognized charges of 1 0 million in the first three months of 2018 and 3 5 million in the first three months of 2019 primarily severance costs for the current restructuring actions we expect to incur additional costs between 4 million and 6 million in future periods due to the unique circumstances around these charges these management directed items have not been allocated to segment results and are excluded from non gaap results acquisitions and dispositions certain acquisition and disposition items that are not considered part of the ongoing activities of the business and are special in nature are consistently excluded from non gaap results these items are described below 2019 acquisitions and dispositions amortization expense for acquisition related intangible assets was 6 4 million in the first three months of 2019 we incurred 4 6

result argentine peso denominated monetary assets and liabilities are now remeasured at each balance sheet date to the currency exchange rate then in effect with currency remeasurement gains and losses recognized in earnings in addition nonmonetary assets retain a higher historical basis when the currency is devalued the higher historical basis results in incremental expense being recognized when the nonmonetary assets are consumed in the first quarter of 2019 we recognized 4 3 million in pretax charges related to highly inflationary accounting including currency remeasurement losses of 3

expenses that do not reflect the ordinary earnings of our operations the specific items excluded have not been allocated to segments are described on page 8 and in more detail in our form 10 q and are reconciled to comparable gaap measures below in addition we refer to non gaap constant currency amounts which represent current period results and forecasts at prior period exchange rates non gaap results adjust the quarterly non gaap tax rates so that the non gaap tax rate in each of the quarters is equal to the full year estimated non gaap tax rate the full year non gaap tax rate in both

unreasonable effort we cannot reconcile these amounts to gaap because we are unable to accurately forecast the impact of highly inflationary accounting on our argentina operations or other potential non gaap adjusting items for which the timing and amounts are currently under review such as future restructuring actions the impact of highly inflationary accounting and other potential non gaap adjusting items could be significant to our gaap results the non gaap financial measures are intended to provide investors with a supplemental comparison of our operating results and trends for the periods presented our management believes these measures are also useful to investors as such measures allow investors to evaluate our performance using the same metrics that our management uses to evaluate past performance and prospects for future performance we do not consider these items to be reflective of our core operating performance due to the variability of such items from period to

benefits that resulted from the transaction that accelerated u s tax in 2015 effective june 30 2018 we deconsolidated our investment in venezuelan subsidiaries and recognized a pretax charge of 126 7

operations excluding the impact of non gaap interest expense non gaap income tax provision non gaap depreciation and amortization and non gaap share based compensation because we reported a loss from

2 10 1 includes interest expense on long term debt and interest expense on short term repurchase agreements a 1 adjusted results throughout the discussion of evercore s business segments and elsewhere in this release information is presented on an adjusted basis formerly called adjusted pro forma which is a non generally accepted accounting principles non gaap measure adjusted results begin with information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america u s gaap adjusted to exclude certain items and reflect the conversion of vested and certain unvested evercore lp units and interests as well as acquisition related share issuances and unvested restricted stock units granted to isi employees into class a shares evercore believes that the disclosed adjusted measures and any adjustments thereto when presented in conjunction with comparable u s gaap measures are useful to investors to compare evercore s results across several periods and facilitate an understanding of evercore s operating results the company uses these measures to evaluate its operating performance as well as the performance of individual employees these measures should not be considered a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with u s gaap these adjusted amounts are allocated to the company s two business segments investment banking and investment management the differences between the adjusted and u s gaap results are as follows 1 assumed vesting of evercore lp units and exchange into class a shares the company incurred expenses in employee compensation and benefits resulting from the vesting of class e lp units issued in conjunction with the acquisition of isi as well as the class h lp interests and class j lp units the amount of expense for the class h lp interests was based on the determination if it was probable that evercore isi would achieve certain earnings and margin targets in 2017 and in future periods the adjusted results assume these lp units and certain class h lp interests have vested and have been exchanged for class a shares accordingly any expense associated with these units and interests and related awards is excluded from the adjusted results and the noncontrolling interest related to these units is converted to a controlling interest the company s management believes that it is useful to provide the per share effect associated with the assumed conversion of these previously granted equity interests and thus the adjusted results reflect the exchange of certain vested and unvested evercore lp partnership units and interests and ipo related restricted stock unit awards into class a shares 2 adjustments associated with business combinations and divestitures the following charges resulting from business combinations and divestitures have been excluded from the adjusted results because the company s management believes that operating performance is more comparable across periods excluding the effects of these acquisition related charges a amortization of intangible assets and other purchase accounting related amortization amortization of intangible assets and other purchase accounting related amortization from the acquisition of isi and certain other acquisitions b acquisition and transition costs primarily professional fees incurred and costs related to transitioning acquisitions or divestitures c gain on sale of institutional trust and independent fiduciary business of etc the gain resulting from the sale of the institutional trust and independent fiduciary business of etc in the fourth quarter of 2017 d foreign exchange gains losses release of cumulative foreign exchange losses resulting from the restructuring of our equity method investment in g5 in the fourth quarter of 2017 3 special charges expenses during 2019 that are excluded from the adjusted presentation relate to the acceleration of depreciation expense for leasehold improvements in conjunction with the previously announced expansion of our headquarters in new york expenses during 2018 that are excluded from the adjusted presentation relate to separation benefits and costs of terminating certain contracts associated with closing the agency trading platform in the u k 4 income taxes evercore is organized as a series of limited liability companies partnerships c corporations and a public corporation and therefore not all of the company s income is subject to corporate level taxes as a result adjustments have been made to the adjusted earnings to assume that the company is subject to the statutory tax rates of a c corporation under a conventional corporate tax structure in the u s at the prevailing corporate rates and that all deferred tax assets relating to foreign operations are fully realizable within the structure on a consolidated basis this assumption is consistent with the assumption that certain evercore lp units are vested and exchanged into class a shares as discussed in item 1 above as the assumed exchange would change the tax structure of the company a 2 excluded from the company s adjusted results are adjustments related to the impact of the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act that was signed into law on december 22 2017 which resulted in a reduction in income tax rates in the u s in 2018 and future years the tax reform resulted in an estimated adjustment to other revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 of 77 5 million related to the re measurement of amounts due pursuant to our tax receivable agreement which was reduced due to the lower enacted income tax rates in the u s in 2018 and future years 5 presentation of interest expense the adjusted results present interest expense on short term repurchase agreements within the investment management segment in other revenues net as the company s management believes it is more meaningful to present the spread on net interest resulting from the matched financial assets and liabilities in addition adjusted investment banking and investment management operating income are presented before interest expense on debt which is included in interest expense on a u s gaap basis 6 presentation of income from equity method investments the adjusted results present income from equity method investments within revenue

items not allocated to segments venezuela operations prior to the deconsolidation of our venezuelan subsidiaries effective june 30 2018 we excluded from our segment results all of our venezuela operating results due to the venezuelan government s restrictions that prevented us from repatriating funds as a result the chief executive officer the company s chief operating decision maker codm assessed segment performance and made resource decisions by segment excluding venezuela operating results reorganization and restructuring 2016 restructuring in the fourth quarter of 2016 management implemented restructuring actions across our global business operations and our corporate functions as a result of these actions we recognized 18 1 million in related 2016 costs and an additional 17 3

restructurings management periodically implements restructuring actions in targeted sections of our business as a result of these actions we recognized charges of 1 0 million in the first three months of 2018 and 3 5 million in the first three months of 2019 primarily severance costs for the current restructuring actions we expect to incur additional costs between 4 million and 6 million in future periods due to the unique circumstances around these charges these management directed items have not been allocated to segment results and are excluded from non gaap results acquisitions and dispositions certain acquisition and disposition items that are not considered part of the ongoing activities of the business and are special in nature are consistently excluded from non gaap results these items are described below 2019 acquisitions and dispositions amortization expense for acquisition related intangible assets was 6 4 million in the first three months of 2019 we incurred 4 6

the sale of real estate in mexico argentina highly inflationary impact beginning in the third quarter of 2018 we designated argentina s economy as highly inflationary for accounting purposes as a result argentine peso denominated monetary assets and liabilities are now remeasured at each balance sheet date to the currency exchange rate then in effect with currency remeasurement gains and losses recognized in earnings in addition nonmonetary assets retain a higher historical basis when the currency is devalued the higher historical basis results in incremental expense being recognized when the nonmonetary assets are consumed in the first quarter of 2019 we recognized 4 3 million in pretax charges related to highly inflationary accounting including currency remeasurement losses of 3

millions except for percentages and per share amounts non gaap results described in this press release are financial measures that are not required by or presented in accordance with u s generally accepted accounting principles gaap the purpose of the non gaap results is to report financial information from the primary operations of our business by excluding the effects of certain income and expenses that do not reflect the ordinary earnings of our operations the specific items excluded have not been allocated to segments are described on page 8 and in more detail in our form 10 q and are reconciled to comparable gaap measures below in addition we refer to non gaap constant currency amounts which represent current period results and forecasts at prior period exchange rates non gaap results adjust the quarterly non gaap tax rates so that the non gaap tax rate in each of the quarters is equal to the full year estimated non gaap tax rate the full year non gaap tax rate in both

unreasonable effort we cannot reconcile these amounts to gaap because we are unable to accurately forecast the impact of highly inflationary accounting on our argentina operations or other potential non gaap adjusting items for which the timing and amounts are currently under review such as future restructuring actions the impact of highly inflationary accounting and other potential non gaap adjusting items could be significant to our gaap results the non gaap financial measures are intended to provide investors with a supplemental comparison of our operating results and trends for the periods presented our management believes these measures are also useful to investors as such measures allow investors to evaluate our performance using the same metrics that our management uses to evaluate past performance and prospects for future performance we do not consider these items to be reflective of our core operating performance due to the variability of such items from period to

benefits that resulted from the transaction that accelerated u s tax in 2015 effective june 30 2018 we deconsolidated our investment in venezuelan subsidiaries and recognized a pretax charge of 126 7

and full year of 2018 there is no difference between gaap and non gaap share based compensation amounts for the other periods presented adjusted ebitda is defined as non gaap income from continuing operations excluding the impact of non gaap interest expense non gaap income tax provision non gaap depreciation and amortization and non gaap share based compensation because we reported a loss from continuing operations on a gaap basis in the second quarter of 2018 and full year 2018 gaap eps was calculated using basic shares however as we reported income from continuing operations on a non gaap

leading global financial centre the chancellor also paid tribute to mr carney s leadership he said his steady hand has helped steer the uk economy through a challenging period and we are now seeing stable low inflation and the fastest wage growth in over a decade and under mark s leadership the bank of england has been at the forefront of reforms to make our financial system safer and more accountable candidates must be able to commit to an eight year term rather then the five years that mr carney had agreed the governor chairs the bank of england s three central committees the monetary policy committee which sets interest rates the financial policy committee which monitors risks in the financial system and the prudential regulation authority which regulates the biggest financial

most recent 34 act filing i ll now turn the call over to our president and ceo jim loree james m loree president chief executive officer okay thank you dennis and good morning everyone thank you for joining us as you saw in our press release we delivered a strong start to 2019 the company posted solid quarterly revenue growth and overcame the carryover impact of commodity currency and tariff related headwinds to deliver modest earnings expansion first quarter revenues were 3 3 billion up 4 versus prior year this included a robust 5 organic growth and 3 from acquisitions which were partially offset by a 4 point currency headwind and price continues to materialize with 2 points of growth attributable to prices in the quarter and tools storage continued its impressive performance delivering 7 organic growth with all regions and business units contributing the tools team is leveraging a powerful set of catalyst complemented by an intense focus on commercial execution to consistently deliver above market growth and once again craftsman e commerce new product innovation and irwin lenox helped propel the tools storage performance you ll hear more from jeff ansell on this during his remarks industrial total revenues grew 10 as the nelson and ies attachments acquisitions were partially offset by automotive market pressure and currency and security demonstrated forward progress delivering both operating margin dollar and rate improvement versus 1q 18 and a year into our 2 year strategic review process the security team has a strategy along with a detailed plan and is in full execution mode on the business transformation don allan will provide some more color during his remarks and we will cover it in depth at our may 16th investor day adjusted eps for the quarter was 1 42 up 2 with a sharp focus on cost control our business teams delivered a strong operational performance and overcame approximately 160 million of carryover headwinds in the first quarter our outperformance was very encouraging as we contemplate prospects for the remainder of the year coupled with strong organic growth we expect modest margin rate accretion for the total year with the return to near 15 levels in the back half assuming a stable input cost and tariff environment this is a simple function of price cost timing as the year unfolds moving to m a we also closed two strategic transactions in the quarter completing our acquisition of the pengo and paladin businesses from ies as well as our 20 equity invest investment in mtd a large supplier of craftsman outdoor power equipment as well as owner of the cub cadet and troy bilt brands with ies attachments in combination with our hydraulic tools business we now have a large portfolio of high quality performance driven attachment solutions that will that creates a well defined path for continued profitable growth we expect ies to contribute approximately 300 million in revenue and be accretive to earnings in 2019 this asset has strong brands deep customer relationships and its independent dealer network has approximately 60 of its revenue related to aftermarket applications our focus is now on integration and achieving the cost and revenue synergies from the deal our minority investment in mtd represents a strategic bet on long term growth in the 20 billion lawn and garden market structured in a financially prudent manner the transaction includes an option for us to purchase the remaining 80 in 2021 and beyond and we re excited to partner with mtd a leading outdoor gas powered equipment manufacturer with a great history and a great team and finally based on our strong first quarter performance we are raising our 2019 full year adjusted eps guidance by a nickel to a range of 8 50 to 8 70 so in summary 2019 is off to a good start and our first quarter results provide us with good momentum and additional flexibility to execute and deliver the year leveraging our growth catalysts and sfs 2 0 operating system we are continuing to lean into the external environment as the headwinds begin to dissipate we remain focused on strong free cash flow generation and the return to operating margin expansion through productivity cost control and pricing and additionally we are undertaking an extensive array of exciting new margin focused initiatives to ensure rate expansion in 2019 and beyond more to come on these initiatives at our investor day in a few weeks and with that i ll hand it over to don allan for a more detailed discussion on first quarter results and 2019 guidance don donald allan jr executive vice president chief financial officer thank you jim and good morning everyone i will now take a deeper dive into our business segment results for the first quarter tools storage revenue increased 3 as 7 organic growth was offset by 4 points of currency pressure organic growth included 5 points of volume and 2 points of price we continue to see the benefits from the price actions we executed in the back half of 2018 as well as the additional price increases implemented this year in response to the list 3 tariff the operating margin rate for the segment was 12 1 down from the prior year as the benefits of volume leverage pricing and cost control were more than offset by the 2018 carryover impacts of currency commodity inflation and tariffs these carryover headwinds amounted to 160 million for stanley black decker in the first quarter with much of this impacting the tools storage segment the strong organic growth and related share gains were experienced across each region and sbu so looking at the results on a geographic basis north america once again led the way up 11 driven by the us retail channel which posted high teens growth north america s growth continued to be fueled by the craftsman brand rollout new product innovations and price realization we continue to see great momentum with the craftsman rollout at our major retail partners and have seen a strong end user reception as the product has hit the shelves we couldn t be more pleased with the progress so far more color to come on that as well as our stanley and stanley fatmax rollouts from jeff later europe delivered 3 organic growth in the quarter despite a continuation of slower market conditions across several countries within the region the team continue to leverage our strong portfolio of brands new product innovation and commercial actions to produce above market growth and then finally emerging markets delivered low single digit growth driven by price new products and e commerce expansion these actions were largely offset by continued market contractions in argentina and turkey which presented an organic growth headwind of three points within the quarter we continue to see broad based share gains across the region brazil ecuador and mexico posted high single to low double digit growth while russia korea taiwan and india all posted strong double digit performances now let s take a look at the tools storage sbus both had solid contributions to the overall performance power tools and equipment delivered 6 organic growth which benefited from strong commercial execution and new product introductions in particular we had a solid contribution from the new products launched on the craftsman dewalt and flexvolt brands hand tools accessories and storage delivered 9 organic growth as new product introductions the craftsman rollout and of course contributions from the lenox and irwin revenue synergies all contributed to this growth so in summary an outstanding quarter and a strong start to the year for the tools storage organization as they continue to demonstrate above market organic growth tight cost control and strong price actions to overcome significant external headwinds related to commodities currency and tariffs let s turn to industrial this segment delivered 10 revenue growth which included 16 points from the nelson fastener and ies attachments acquisitions a 3 organic decline and a negative 2 points from currency offset this this significant growth from these acquisitions operating margin rate was down year over year to 13 9 as productivity gains and cost control actions were more than offset by the impact from lower engineered fastening automotive volume commodity inflation and the modestly dilutive impact from these acquisitions engineered fastening organic revenues were down 4 due to the declines in automotive light vehicle production and lower system shipments which were partially offset by continued fastener penetration gains we continue to see declines in underlying global automotive production which impacts fastener volumes however it is also impacting the scope of automotive system projects that our customers are executing the infrastructure businesses delivered 5 organic growth primarily driven by stronger north american onshore pipeline project activity in oil and gas this was partially offset by lower hydraulic demolition tool volumes whose underlying market has been modestly impacted by the recent retraction in scrap steel pricing and finally let s turn to security the security segment revenue declined 1 with bolt on acquisitions contributing two points and price delivering 1 which was more than offset by unfavorable currency of four points north america organic growth was up 2 as higher volumes in automatic doors and healthcare were partially offset by lower installation revenues in commercial electronic security europe was down 1 organically france was a bright spot for the quarter as the team was able to leverage new commercial actions in the small to medium enterprise market which is associated with our transformation plan that jim mentioned however this was more than offset by unfavorable market conditions in sweden and the uk two larger markets for our security european team in terms of profitability the segment operating margin expanded 70 basis points to 10 3 the security team continues to demonstrate progress with its business transformation plan they successfully executed on their first quarter objectives delivering margin rate and dollar expansion through cost control and they are focused on minimizing recurring revenue attrition so we achieved modest organic growth additionally the team continues to make investments in hiring and onboarding new commercial and field technician resources we believe these actions coupled with the new tech technology forward customer solutions we have developed and are developing will begin to translated to consistent growth as we move forward in the year this is the third quarter in a row our security team has achieved their financial expectations nice progress so far so now let s briefly look at the quarter s free cash flow performance on the next page we were down approximately 65 million year over year mainly attributed to increased working capital tools storage continues to carry high levels of inventory to support the ongoing craftsman rollout and other brand transitions that we are currently executing across the channels as mentioned at january s earnings call we believe the working capital levels will moderate throughout the year and we will achieve working capital turns relatively flat to the prior year by the end of 2019 this will position us well for driving significant working capital improvement in 2020 so we can achieve approximately 100 free cash flow conversion in 2020 so turning back to 2019 please keep in mind that a free cash outflow in the first quarter is in line with normal seasonality we remain confident that we will deliver strong cash flow generation for the year given our core sfs processes and principles combined with reducing working capital levels in line with normal season seasonal activity as i just discussed therefore we are reiterating our commitment to deliver a free cash flow conversion rate of approximately 85 to 90 in 2019 so now let s turn to 2019 earnings guidance as jim mentioned earlier we are raising our adjusted eps outlook for 2019 to a range of 8 50 to 8 70 which is a 0 05 increase versus our prior guidance on a gaap basis this results in a range of 7 50 to 7 70 per share diving into a little more detail on our 2019 adjusted eps you can see on the left hand side of the chart the increase is supported by the strong organic growth and cost control which drove approximately 0 15 of operational outperformance in the first quarter this is partially offset by an incremental 20 million of currency headwinds which primarily consist of adverse movements in the brazilian real argentinean peso and chinese rmb as it relates to recent acquisitions and divestiture activity the impact from the acquisition of the paladin and pengo businesses from ies and the divestiture of sargent greenleaf net to a relatively neutral impact to our full year 2019 eps outlook these ies assets will create solid eps accretion in the later years through cost and revenue synergies one other item of note i would like to highlight is that we expect second quarter earnings per share to approximate 29 5 of the full year performance this is generally consistent with prior year performance turning to the segment outlook on the right side of the page organic growth within tools storage is still expected to be mid single digits in 2019 we continue to execute on multiple catalysts including the continued brand transitions with craftsman stanley and stanley fatmax new product innovation including flexvolt lenox and irwin revenue synergies e commerce and other emerging market opportunities the margin rates are expected to be positive year over year the team will continue to leverage price cost actions margin initiatives and volume to offset the carryover headwinds we previously mentioned previously mentioned we believe the business is well positioned for return to margin expansion in 2019 and anticipate a meaningful expansion in the second half in the industrial segment we expect organic revenue to be down modestly with total revenue growth positive from the contributions of our recent acquisitions in infrastructure we expect oil and gas to be positive organically and hydraulic tools to be relatively flat on an organic basis engineered fastening organic revenue is expected to be down modestly with growth in automotive and industrial fasteners being offset by a decline in the system side of the business we do believe the pressure we we are experiencing in the automotive systems during q1 will begin to subside in the later stages of 2019 we expect operating margins to be down year over year driven by the modestly dilutive impact from acquisitions and the impacts of negative product mix specifically lower automotive system sales in engineered fastening and then finally in our security segment we re expecting organic growth of low single digits and growth in operating margin dollars and rate year over year as the team continues to execute on its transformation strategy so in summary the company s organic revenue will grow approximately 4 and we expect 4 to 7 adjusted eps expansion which is overcoming approximately 340 million of commodity currency and tariff headwinds which is primarily related to the carryover from 2018 we are encouraged by the collective performances across the portfolio in the first quarter which gives us confidence to increase our 2019 eps guidance range we remain focused on leveraging the positive impacts from our continued strong organic growth the previously executed pricing actions and the recently completed 250 million cost reduction program to ensure we achieve our 2019 guidance these factors along with the beginning impacts of certain margin enhancement initiatives will result in operating margin and rate expansion in 2019 and we expect meaningful expansion in the second half of the year with that i d like to turn the call over to jeff to provide a few comments on the progress with the ongoing craftsman stanley and stanley fatmax brand transitions as well as some of the new innovations we are currently launching within the tools business jeff jeffery d ansell executive vice president president global tools storage thank you don i d like to share a few updates on our latest innovations and brand initiatives including our recent launch of a new dewalt 20 volt compact series called atomic as well as the incredible progress of craftsman our global tools storage business had strong first quarter performance with high single digit organic growth led by north america a key component of this success was our continued focus on innovation led growth for example our dewalt flexvolt platform was up double digits in the quarter as we continue to grow in the system core products as well as expanding into the outdoor category with flexvolt we are also pleased to announce the global launch of the 20 volt atomic series a range of tools that combines performance and durability in a compact format the atomic series augments our existing dewalt 20 volt line which is now the largest professional cordless system in the world with well over 200 products with this global program just beginning to ship we expect to see incremental growth in the pro power tool space within the year during our may investor day we will detail this and other breakthrough innovations regarding craftsman the momentum and success from 2018 carried into 2019 with growth across all categories in craftsman our craftsman expansion plan remains on track and we are well on our way to delivering our 1 billion target by 2021 now i ll turn it back over to jim to wrap today s presentation james m loree president chief executive officer thanks jeff and as you heard it was a solid start to the year as we delivered above market organic growth leveraging that array of growth catalysts i m proud of the team s efforts and execution which have positioned us to achieve decent ltm financial results amid a host of macro challenges as these challenges anniversary we are looking forward to a resumption of margin accretion in combination with our excellent growth and lastly i want to remind everyone that we will be hosting an investor day on the morning of may 16th in new york city this will be a great opportunity for us to communicate our strategic and financial objectives and discuss how we are pursuing growth margin expansion and transformation at stanley black decker as you can tell we are passionate about delivering growth with margin expansion and this will be prominently featured we will also showcase members of our business unit and other key functional management teams so please reach out to dennis if you re interested in attending and we look forward to seeing you there and we are now ready for q a dennis dennis lange vice president investor relations great thanks jim shannon we can now open the call to q a please thank you questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from jeffrey sprague with vertical research your line is open jeffrey sprague vertical research analyst thank you good morning everyone james m loree president chief executive officer good morning jeff jeffrey sprague vertical research analyst jim i was wondering if you could address a little bit more as you said in your opening monologue that the headwinds are dissipating and i think we we all kind of understand the comp issue and how it was front loaded here in q1 but can you provide a little bit more color on how you see that playing out in the back half and i guess part and parcel to my question is it does look like we might be getting close to trade tariff resolution and how do you think about maintaining price if we do get tariff relief thank you james m loree president chief executive officer sure well first of all the massive hit that we took in the first quarter from the carryover headwinds goes down sequentially in the second quarter but it s still over 100 million sorry just below 100 million right around 85 million and then in the back half of the year the price actually more or less offsets the remaining headwinds the remaining carryover and whatever new modest headwinds that we have this year so in general that s just how the math works and so we as i said assume a stable cost and tariff environment if the tariffs go away that s a pretty significant reduction in headwinds i think the total amount of tariffs in for the for the year is just under 100 million or thereabout so most of the tariff impact is list three and from what we hear the way the trade negotiations are going that would be the most likely tariffs to be removed list three and keeping in mind to the last part of your question that a lot of the a lot of the pricing activity was not tariff related but also inflation related and so i think that when you finally add it all up i mean the price recovery against the tariffs only amounted to about 40 between 40 and 50 and so there was a big chunk of inflation related cost that was not covered by the price as well as some of the tariff so i think that we ll see how that all plays out but i think there is sufficient inflation and headwinds to justify a fairly stable price environment going forward donald allan jr executive vice president chief financial officer let me just clarify the that the number that jim gave in 2q is net of price just want to make sure that it s not people understand it s not gross headwinds and the other thing to keep in mind is this if you did if all the tariffs went away we ve communicated this previously the impact net of price on an annualized basis would probably be somewhere around 40 million to 50 million net but that s all tariff and if list 3 happens it probably a third to 50 of that number operator thank you our next question comes from josh pokrzywinski with morgan stanley your line is open josh pokrzywinski morgan stanley analyst hi good morning guys james m loree president chief executive officer good morning josh pokrzywinski morgan stanley analyst yeah i guess just a follow up on on jeff s question there with with the margin expansion that you guys talked about in tools i think don you mentioned a few times strong margin expansion in the second half should we still expect to see something in 2q and how has that changed just given maybe some of the timing of headwinds or price increases or the competitive dynamic out there with respect to price donald allan jr executive vice president chief financial officer yeah we were saying over the last couple of months we we are anticipating a kind of modest improvement in margin rate in the second quarter and we and we still believe that will be the case and as we get into the third and the fourth quarter both jim and i a indicated we expect the the incremental accretion rate for tools to become quite meaningful and that s still the expectation at this stage operator thank you our next question comes from michael rehaut with jpmorgan your line is open michael rehaut jp morgan analyst thanks good morning everyone james m loree president chief executive officer good morning mike michael rehaut jp morgan analyst congrats on the quarter question i have is relates to the tools storage performance obviously you continued great execution on the top line given some of the new initiatives that you launched or jeff referred to i was hoping to get a sense of when you think about the mid single digit growth for this segment for 2019 if you can kind of break that down by looking at also the break it down by some of the growth initiatives technical difficulty such as craftsman such as flexvolt as opposed to the the core market growth and if that changed at all particularly given the first quarter performance james m loree president chief executive officer yeah as we ve indicated previously we think craftsman is about 3 points of growth for the full year the first quarter was fairly representative of that and we don t see any different view at this stage we ve indicated mid single digits we ve also said that that probably means we re our view is we are floating around 6 approximately 7 and we still feel like that s the right estimate at this stage what we don t know is just how impactful craftsman is going to be it s been very positive and if those trends continue those numbers can be a little bit better as the year goes on but i look at the core underlying markets they re performing well and the we had some weak markets in europe as we talked about where we don t have a lot of market growth right now in many of the countries but we are demonstrating growth as we had 3 organic growth in the first quarter so we re outpacing there and that really has more to do with just strong commercial activities product innovation et cetera like the european team has done for several years now in north america you saw the magnitude of the growth of double digits and the impact of craftsman being in there but even if you exclude that impact that s really it s still pretty significant performance which would include things like flexvolt and other matters as well so we still feel like that s a reasonable estimate at this stage we all have to keep in mind that it is the first quarter and as we get to the second quarter and we complete the rollout of craftsman and lowe s through all the ph stores we ll have a good sense of where we are in and a read in the back half of the year and what that means but i think at this stage we feel good about an organic growth number about 6 to 7 for tools operator thank you our next question comes from tim wojs with baird your line is open tim wojs baird analyst hey guys good good morning good start to the year james m loree president chief executive officer good morning thank you tim wojs baird analyst i guess just just maybe on back on on tools and growth in the quarter relative to your expectations a couple of months ago where do you think you saw the the outperformance internally was it better sell through at retail was it was it the types of products that consumers are buying just a little bit more color on maybe what was better relative to your expectations in the quarter james m loree president chief executive officer i guess kind of all of the above the sell through has been fantastic and the product introductions have been really well received and so it s a combination of all those factors and i i think also the market is more stable than i think we were thinking a quarter ago although there is some choppiness in housing and so on i think in general it s more stable than we would have expected at this point and time and the interest rate reductions have helped a lot operator thank you our next question comes from julian mitchell with barclays your line is open julian mitchell barclays analyst thanks good morning you ve given some very good color on your updated sort of macro thoughts around north america demand i just wondered if you could give us an update around expectations for organic growth firm wide in europe and the emerging markets those were sort of flattish both in q1 just wondered how you think the rest of the year will play out for europe and em donald allan jr executive vice president chief financial officer i think what we experienced in q1 is not going to be dramatically different other than i would say probably emerging markets might demonstrate more growth as we get to the back half they clearly are dealing with some difficult circumstances in two countries that i mentioned of turkey and argentina but we do start to kind of lap that in the middle of the year and so the comp gets a little little easier from that perspective to demonstrate organic growth so i think we ll see a little bit of an improvement in the organic growth profile in the back half for emerging markets betting europe will continue to be kind of a low single digit growth performance for a good part of the year and north america will continue to be strong operator thank you our next question comes from nigel coe with wolfe research your line is open nigel coe wolfe research analyst thanks good morning guys james m loree president chief executive officer hi hi nigel nigel coe wolfe research analyst i m sure you re glad to get one key behind you so it s obviously great news on sg a big big reduction there and i m assuming that s where the the bulk of the cost action is coming through in that line i know you re going to address this more on the the upcoming may conference but maybe you could talk about the the margin transformation initiatives under way and is that more of a capacity and gross margin initiative and how how does that differ from there some of the regular way restructuring ph you re currently doing thanks james m loree president chief executive officer sure so the margin resiliency initiative we like to call it gets us back to kind of our historical margin accretion of about 50 basis points a year after we get back to our prior levels which we will accomplish pretty much this year start to have margin accretion again and so with this really the intent of this is it may have a modest 19 impact but the real impact will be 2021 and we ll be driving that 50 basis point and possibly even more margin accretion going forward and like we ll get into a fair amount of detail about about this in on may 16th but the general thrust is utilizing technology and technological advancements to enhance value creation initiatives that already exists so it could be as it relates to price it could be as it relates to procurement and so on so there s different categories and or buckets if you will where we re taking technology and utilizing kind of leading edge practices to data analytics artificial intelligence cobotics those types of things to actually enhance our margins and create value that s the basic idea operator thank you our next question comes from nicole deblase with deutsche bank your line is open nicole deblase deutsche bank analyst yeah thanks good morning guys james m loree president chief executive officer good morning donald allan jr executive vice president chief financial officer good morning nicole deblase deutsche bank analyst so i just want to dig into 2q a little bit it seems like that the thing that the investors are asking about most or grappling with since i mean it seems like it s not a whole lot different than normal seasonality for me but essentially consensus is doubling versus 1q excluding the tax benefit so have you guys to kind of talk through the big puts and takes i know we talked about the 85 million net headwind what s the gross headwind expected if you could talk through organic growth since i think the comp gets a bit tougher year on year tax rate and anything else that we need to consider when we re thinking about bridging from 1q to 2q donald allan jr executive vice president chief financial officer i mean clearly the the volume overall is the biggest driver where the volume of the whole company will probably be up 400 million to 450 million sequentially from q1 to q2 so that s clearly a big driver you also have the gross headwinds go down on an absolute basis by about 30 million to 35 million from q1 and q2 while the price benefit stays relatively consistent so you get a benefit there as well and then some of our cost actions we re not completed until q1 so you get a full quarter benefit of that in q2 those are really the three main drivers that are that are driving that there was a there is a little little bit of a modest impact from a lower tax rate in q2 versus q1 as well as many of the tax benefits we re expecting in the first half versus the back half of the year those are the main those are the four main drivers that would get you to that number operator thank you our next question comes from joe ritchie with goldman sachs your line is open joe ritchie goldman sachs analyst thanks good morning everyone james m loree president chief executive officer good morning donald allan jr executive vice president chief financial officer good morning joe ritchie goldman sachs analyst maybe just just touching on the the focus at the analyst day i know we re going to talk a lot about the the margin expansion but maybe just a broader question around like is this a pivot you guys have been focused very much so on the growth initiatives historically the 22 22 and now we re now it seems like this analyst day is going to be a little bit more focused on on the margin expansion opportunities and so maybe maybe discuss a little bit just kind of the shift in philosophy there james m loree president chief executive officer it s not really a huge shift in philosophy it s really kind of back to the future we we ve always in the last i d say 5 years to 7 years we have always been focused on growth and margin expansion and if you go back and look at the years preceding last year there was a pretty strong track record of strong organic growth acquisitive growth plus margin expansion and that formula has been very lucrative for the for shareholders and we intend to get back to that so the reason we obviously got off that track for one year is has everything to do with the headwinds that we ve talked about ad nauseam so this is something that we are fixated on doing in this company is doing both and i know a lot of companies it s either either or but we don t think of it that way and we have the capability and the track record to expand margins while growing and we intend to get back to that in beginning in 2019 but really in earnest in 20 and 21 operator thank you our next question comes from deepa raghavan with wells fargo your line is open deepa raghavan wells fargo analyst good morning good quarter there jim and don james m loree president chief executive officer thank you donald allan jr executive vice president chief financial officer thank you deepa raghavan wells fargo analyst your outlooks for q2 just a little bit touching on that given that it s an outdoors season heavy season i mean outlooks looks like it s 250ish at midpoint can you talk about momentum into q2 including possibly any point of sales at ph north america and what are some of the upside and downside case in q2 we know it s an outdoor season it s meaningful to craftsman mtd just the weather in there but on a year on year basis is there anything else that other than what you ve addressed earlier that would be helpful thank you donald allan jr executive vice president chief financial officer yeah so i ll pass it over to jeff in a minute and he will give us some commentary on the outdoor season view for us but i as i mentioned and jim mentioned the pos was strong in the first quarter we do think that trend will continue into the second quarter and likely for the remainder of the year the other drivers are the the reason for why we think the business will continue to improve around margin rate in the second quarter so we can achieve what i described but let me give jeff a chance to give a little more color on our view of the outdoor season jeffery d ansell executive vice president president global tools storage so to reiterate what don just said pos was was robust as where the organic growth numbers in north america in q1 there is not a great deal of outdoor activity in that quarter it more often ph starts in the second quarter runs through the third but but what we did see was a slow start to the outdoor season as much of the the us market was under water if you remember early days of this of the spring that changed quite significantly in the last four weeks so season that started out negative has turned positive at this point certainly from for us and we re comping relatively sluggish outdoor numbers from last year if you remember last year s outdoor season wasn t a really robust one so it s it s been really positive for the last four weeks and we have every reason to believe that will continue to be positive through the second quarter one given the kind of sluggish comps from last year but also the new product development that we put into the market this year in the dewalt brand as well as the black decker brand and most recently the craftsman brand so quite positive operator thank you our next question comes from rob wertheimer with melius research your line is open rob wertheimer melius research analyst hi good morning i just wonder if you could give any kind of an update on craftsman production us production just progress and then any thoughts on evolutions at mtd and if you re able to to achieve better results through aiding ph them thanks donald allan jr executive vice president chief financial officer i ll start with the first part of the question then turn it over to jim for the second part craftsman domestic manufacturing is in really good place where we essentially began the process with almost no domestic manufacturing for craftsman and what we procured to this point over the course of about 12 months we ve gone from what was almost 0 to about a third of the product line manufactured domestically today on our plan to double that going forward which we ll give you more detail around that at the may investor day but the inertia created by craftsman and then combining that with domestic manufacturing the combination of those two things has led us to growth in every category that is craftsman today so we re quite pleased with where we are but i would say we are we have yet a lot to do jeffery d ansell executive vice president president global tools storage great so on mtd really excited about the transaction including the option but as excited about the people that we get to work with because frankly the transaction has got this got us all set up with a confluence of interests in the sense that any ebitda growth that occurs we ll kind of share the benefits post closing of the 20 we ll share the benefits 50 50 in terms of the ultimate determination of the option price and that structure has put us in a position where we are working together in earnest on value creation opportunities for mtd that include everything from growth to cost reduction to margin expansion and so on and it s it s going to be a multi year program and since we re running it like an acquisition integration while subscribing to all the principles of antitrust that we have to subscribe to and we re very very confident that we will get mtd s profitability up to a point where it will be able to slot it into our portfolio in 2021 or 2022 in a in a way that is really accretive for for us and is a great deal for the folks at mtd operator thank you our next question comes from justin speer with zelman associates your line is open justin speer zelman associates analyst hi guys thank you very much just i just wanted to further unpack the tools storage growth and i mean what you re looking for for underlying market growth for this business and how that kind of sequences as the year progresses and then dovetailing that question with is the reality that if we do get trade resolution do you think you ll be able to hold on to that price do you think you ll be able to hold on to the potential savings from tariffs going away james m loree president chief executive officer yeah as i mentioned on growth earlier for tools storage we have a view of 6 to 7 for the full year we expect craftsman to be about 3 points of that which would demonstrate some modest growth over gdp if you look at it globally not assume being a point or point and a half so that s pretty significant in some in some camps around the world but that s our view and we think that will continue to be the case and we re very hopeful that craftsman outperforms expectations and maybe some other product innovations and other growth catalysts do as well and we ll see as the year progresses we talked about how we have a lot of work to do on craftsman to complete the rollout in the second quarter and then we have to focus on the rollout of other brands and some of our other customers so we have a lot of work to do over the year to make this happen but we re positive at this stage and we ll continue to provide updates along the way in particularly in july and october operator thank you our next question comes from robert barry with buckingham research your line is open robert barry buckingham research analyst hey guys good morning james m loree president chief executive officer good morning donald allan jr executive vice president chief financial officer good morning robert barry buckingham research analyst congrats on the solid start james m loree president chief executive officer thanks robert barry buckingham research analyst i just wanted to actually clarify a couple of things one is just why the industrial outlook is weaker and how much of that weakness happened in 1q and then just on a couple p l p l items that price and commodities are still kind of plus 150 ph minus 150 ph and if there is any kind of potential upside or downside to those values especially what we re seeing with commodities donald allan jr executive vice president chief financial officer yeah i think for industrial our view is a little bit worse than it was in january as we as we saw the automotive light vehicle production was down almost 5 in the first quarter which was worse than projection it s supposed to be down a little bit smaller number in the second quarter and then begin to moderate in the back half of the year we do think systems will will start to return in the back half of the year that s the feedback we re getting from a lot of our key customers and so that s clearly a pressure point although it s a modest pressure point versus expectations i think we were thinking relatively flat back in january now we re just down modestly as a result of that i mean i think the engineered fastening team is doing a great job managing through this cycle with the auto industry and looking for opportunities in some of the and the nelson acquisition that they ve done as well as the other aspects of the industrial fastener business within their world so they continue to be focused on that the headwinds as we mentioned are have gone up a little bit overall 20 million due to fx and at this stage commodities are not changing dramatically although we think as we go through the year there could be an opportunity that we see emerge as the year goes on but right now it s not it s not flowing through as an opportunity for us to capture in our p l at this stage and then tariffs are bit of an open wild card at this stage as to what happens do we have a deal with china in the future and if we do do all the tariffs go away or as jim said do they partially go away is a factor that we see but you know we feel good about where we re positioned as a company to deal with these headwinds even though we saw modest increase in them it feels like as we go throughout the year the ones in commodities and tariff feel like there is a possibility for an opportunity technical difficulty to get smaller however we could potentially see a little bit more pressure in currency as we go throughout the year we certainly saw the volatility of that last year but i think that currency tends to be something that s easier for us to manage if that s the only major headwind we are dealing with operator thank you our next question comes from michael wood with nomura instinet your line is open michael wood nomura instinet analyst hi good morning i was hoping you could provide some color in terms of the you gave a very explicit 1q guidance which you beat operationally you said by about 0 25 sorry 0 15 or so excluding that the timing of the tax curious if there is some other pull forward in 1q that didn t allow you to flow that 0 15 beat into your 2019 guidance donald allan jr executive vice president chief financial officer as i mentioned in my my commentary is that yes we did have an operational outperformance of 0 15 in the first quarter but we did see a 20 million increase in currency or 0 10 of an impact related to that so the net the net benefit is about 0 05 and we thought at this stage the prudent thing to do to let that flow through let s see if we get resolution on china trade let s see if some of the trends that i mentioned emerge in the volume of tools as well as the headwinds associated with commodity and tariffs and so it s a it s a prudent first step and we ll see how things progress in the next quarter operator thank you our next question comes from david macgregor with longbow research your line is open david macgregor longbow research analyst yes good morning james m loree president chief executive officer good morning david macgregor longbow research analyst congratulations on the quarter james m loree president chief executive officer thanks david macgregor longbow research analyst just on craftsman thinking about second quarter and the dynamics around the craftsman brand can you update us on the timing of the load in i think you mentioned earlier that lowe s you expected that to be complete in the second quarter but if you started the amazon loading yet and if so how far into that process are you and finally can you update us on the timing of load in home depot on the stanley and fatmax and how long that will take to complete thanks jeffery d ansell executive vice president president global tools storage hi yeah this is jeff i ll take the the question the i ll give you the status first of stanley stanley and fatmax then i ll migrate to craftsman we ve just begun the process of rolling out the stanley and stanley fatmax products that we highlighted last earnings call so they are just flowing through the supply chain into into stores you will see those product set the first phase of that set this coming month so in the month of may you ll see those things set at store level so no no underlying pos or any of that at this point but the rollout is going quite well and so we re we re very positive on that regarding craftsman probably similarly we ve had greater demand for the product than we anticipated and as such we ve expanded our view of the size of craftsman and the timing of craftsman previously in order to make certain that we can accommodate that increased demand via supply we have elected to to move the rollout of new customers on craftsman to the early parts of the second half of of this year so in an in an attempt to make sure we can satisfy the customers that we do have today and the demand that the end user has created we pushed those back just a bit but they will begin very early second half and and we ll roll those things out in the in the cadence we described but starting at that point and time so so all positive underlying reasons to do those things and again we re quite positive with both the rollout of stanley stanley fatmax and craftsman across all categories operator thank you our next question comes from ken zener with keybanc your line is open ken zener keybanc analyst good morning everybody james m loree president chief executive officer hey ken donald allan jr executive vice president chief financial officer good morning ken zener keybanc analyst jeff can you talk to the outdoor category given mtd and craftsman specifically kind a bigger picture that what constraints the expansion of cordless applications into gas i mean is it your guys internal r d is it just the market price or you don t want to be the bleeding edge thank you very much jeffery d ansell executive vice president president global tools storage well it it has advanced quite significantly in the last you d say two years right so it s there have been cordless non gas cordless outdoor products for from us for almost three decades but the cost curve has enabled us to beat us and others to get electric products competitively priced with with petrol really for the first time in the last 12 months and at that point then the consumer has the decision to make they would either choose petrol which they are accustomed to today or or migrate to electric and and that s the process that s beginning as we speak so i d say the technology enables that today so you see this in categories like string tremors hedge trimmers blowers chainsaw things that have historically been gas driven and that migration has happened relatively rapidly and you ll see if you survey retail today you ll see examples under the craftsman brand where we have inaudible registration that says you choose your power source so it will be gas product or the electric equivalent at the same price allowing the user to make the decision which has been the first time in history we ve ever been able to to make that claim we do that and it s going really well so i don t think there s any technological hurdles with it for in that sense as you get into higher and higher output products walk behinds ride on mowers that s still there is still a gap between the value proposition of petrol or gas and electric and we and others are working to close that gap but there s probably a little more work to be done there but the early read is very positive and electrification of outdoor products being led really by us across brands like black decker dewalt and craftsman so donald allan jr executive vice president chief financial officer one of the one of the things that we re doing to take advantage of this this period where we own 20 of mtd and have not yet exercised the option is to collaborate on r d because it s an application challenge it s not just a battery challenge it s a system challenge so their expertise in the actual unit of outdoor power equipment as we go up the power curve and our expertise in battery technology and application to lower power output type products it s a great combination best combination in the industry to tackle this and we re going to be out in front on that one operator thank you our next question comes from susan maklari with credit suisse your line is open susan maklari credit suisse analyst good morning james m loree president chief executive officer good morning donald allan jr executive vice president chief financial officer good morning susan maklari credit suisse analyst i wanted to focus a little bit on the cash flows and the balance sheet on the last call you talked to taking a defensive approach to cash flows this year with a focus on deleveraging and with the operating environment coming in a bit more stable relative to your initial expectations are there any changes to your capital allocation plans for this year donald allan jr executive vice president chief financial officer there really isn t any significant changes to our capital allocation strategy as we thought about january we are preparing the company for a slow growth environment and we were concerned about housing in particular what was happening as interest rates for have been rising in the previous year and there was talk about continued increases in that area and what that could mean for housing as jim mentioned that s changed a lot in the last three months we re now the fed has has a different kind of position on interest rates and actually we ve seen a little bit of a reversal in that trend and that s had a bit of a positive impact on housing but we re still dealing with a relatively a little bit of a slow growth environment in certain pockets we have a slow automotive industry housing is doing ok but it s not robust at this stage and so we re not overly concerned about the economy at this at this view we we feel good about how we ve set up the company and to be prepared for as we mentioned various different environments and this was one of them and the importance of our capital allocation is we have to keep in mind that in the previous couple of years we ve done some significant capital allocation transactions including buying back stock acquisitions of ies mtd nelson fasteners and and then before that we had craftsman and we had the newell tools acquisition so we ve we ve allocated a fair amount of capital to these different areas so a couple of things are happening this year one we want to get our our debt to ebitda ratio down closer to two times and we will achieve that with the current cash flow view and projection of the business and that will really position us to be able to look at other allocation strategies in the m a world as we go into 2020 and frankly we need to absorb a lot of those transactions that we ve completed in that timeframe as well james m loree president chief executive officer i mean there is a massive amount of execution going on as you can glean from the conversations that we ve had in the last hour and it s all going really well but as don said we we kind of want to get our debt to ebitda down to right around two and digest some of these things and exploit some of the growth opportunities that we have and then we ll look in as we go into 2020 and beyond is does more repurchase makes sense or or do we have some acquisition opportunities that might be very attractive to help us continue to drive growth operator thank you our last question comes from justin bergner with g research your line is open justin bergner g research analyst good morning and thank you for taking my question james m loree president chief executive officer good morning donald allan jr executive vice president chief financial officer good morning jeffery d ansell executive vice president president global tools storage good morning justin bergner g research analyst you made a comment earlier in the call that you re hoping to reach 100 or close to a 100 free cash flow conversion in 2020 i m not sure but it seems like that s a pull forward of your earlier comment that that was more of a mid term goal could you clarify that s the case and sort of maybe indicate what drivers will allow you to get that free cash flow conversion up to 100 2020 donald allan jr executive vice president chief financial officer yeah i think one of the things that we ve talked about in the last year or so is that we ve had to really take some pressure on in our working capital as we deal dealt with these brand transitions which are fantastic opportunities for us to develop organic growth and you ve seen that track record in the tools storage business and and therefore we haven t seen significant progress in working capital turns in the last previous year as well as this year we ll probably be relatively flat year over year so as we go into 2020 we see opportunity once those transitions has kind of gotten to a more stable state on a go forward basis and they are really embedded in our existing business and then we re dealing more with just new product introductions and new innovations et cetera that gives us an opportunity for us to make some significant improvement in working capital turns where will ph we ll end this year probably somewhere between 8 5 and 8 8 for working capital turns of the company and and therefore we ve been over 10 and so there s no reason why we can t see that opportunity going into 2020 and 2021 which means that significant benefit will flow through free cash flow which will allow our conversion to get back up to 100 operator thank you this concludes the question and answer session i would now like to turn the conference back

0 8 degrees celsius 1 4 degrees fahrenheit since 1880 according to an ongoing temperature analysis conducted by scientists at nasa s goddard institute for space studies two thirds of this temperature increase has occurred since 1975 a one degree rise in temperature might seem like no big deal as the nasa scientists point out however a one degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all the oceans atmosphere and land by that much we know that carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels is at the heart of the problem for many centuries the proportion of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere ranged between 200 and 300 parts per million by the 1950s the growth of industrial capitalism since the 1800s had pushed this to the top of this range 310 parts per million since then the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has risen very rapidly to more than 410 parts per million by 2018 this is the result of the vast rise in the burning of fossil fuels in the era since world war ii coal petroleum natural gas shifting the cost of disaster the problem is rooted in the very structure of capitalism itself cost shifting is an essential feature of the capitalist mode of production an electric power company burns coal to generate electricity because the price per kilowatt hour from coal fired electricity has long been cheaper than alternatives but the emissions from burning coal travel downwind and cause damage to the respiratory systems of thousands of people including preventable deaths to people with respiratory ailments this is in addition to the powerful contribution to global warming from the carbon dioxide emissions but the power firm doesn t have to pay money for these human costs if the firm had to pay fees that would be equivalent to the human cost in death respiratory damage and contribution to global warming and its effects burning coal would not be profitable for the power company firms also externalize costs onto workers such as the health effects of stress or chemical exposures the free market pundit or hack economist might deny that companies externalize costs onto workers they might say that wages and benefits paid to workers for each hour of work measure the cost of labor but the human cost of work can be increased without an increase in the compensation paid to workers if a company speeds up the pace of work if people are working harder if they are more tightly controlled by supervisors paced by machines or software this increases the cost in human terms toxic chemicals used in manufacturing in agriculture and other industries pose a threat to both the workers and to people who live in nearby areas usually working class people live in neighborhoods near polluting industries and often these are communities of color this is another form of capitalist cost shifting state regulation of pesticides or air pollution often ends up acting as a cover for the profit making firms despite the existence of pollutants generated by leaky oil refineries and pollutants emitted by other industries in industrial areas in california such as the cancer alley of oil refineries in the contra costa county area or the similar refinery zone in wilmington the government agencies set up to deal with air pollution in the bay area and los angeles county protected polluters for years by focusing almost exclusively on pollution generated by vehicle exhaust in this way the south coast air quality management district and the bay area air quality management district have been an example of regulatory capture by corporate capital power firms that generate vast amounts of carbon dioxide emissions and firms that make profits from building fossil fuel burning cars and trucks or from the sale of gasoline and diesel and jet fuel have not had to pay fees or penalties for the growing build up of the carbon dioxide layer in the atmosphere the global warming crisis thus has its explanation in cost shifting and the search for short term profits and ever growing markets features that are at the heart of the capitalist system if global capitalism continues with business as usual the warming will have major impacts killer heat waves more ocean heat pumping energy into hurricanes and cyclones rising ocean levels from melting of ice in the polar regions and melting of glaciers destruction of corals in the oceans and a greater danger to the survival of many species of living things previous attempts to get global agreement to cut back burning of fossil fuels have been ineffective the paris accords merely proposed voluntary targets nasa scientist james hansen described it as a fraud there is no action just promises according to the un intergovernmental panel on climate change the dire situation calls for rapid and far reaching transitions unprecedented in terms of scale the ipcc warns that there needs to be a 45 percent world wide reduction in the production of heat trapping gases mainly carbon dioxide by 2030 if humanity is to avoid dangerous levels of global warming the origins and goals of the green new deal clearly a global change is needed but how to bring this about the concept of a green new deal has been proposed by green party activists climate justice groups and various radicals for some time the slogan is based on a comparison with the statist planning used by president roosevelt to respond to the economic crisis of the 1930s as well as the vast and rapid transition of american industry to war production at the beginning of world war ii the idea is that the crisis of global warming should be treated with equal urgency as the mass unemployment of 1933 or the fascist military threat of the early 1940s after the election to congress of alexandria ocasio cortez a member of democratic socialists of america the green new deal resolution was introduced into the us congress by ocasio cortez and senator ed markey this lays out a set of ambitious goals such as 100 percent electric power generation in the usa from clean renewable and zero emission energy sources other goals include removing pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from manufacturing as much as is technologically feasible and overhauling the transport sector to eliminate pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from transport through investment in zero emission vehicles accessible public transportation and high speed rail along with this resolution a letter was sent to the us congress from 626 environmental organizations backing the green new deal proposal these environmental groups made it quite clear they oppose any market based tinkering reforms that we know won t work such as cap and trade trading in pollution rights many have proposed public private partnerships and public subsidies to private corporations robert pollin writing in new left review talks about preferential tax treatment for clean energy investments and market arrangements through government procurement contracts all part of a so called green industrial policy a green capitalism in other words but workers are often skeptical of these promises companies will simply lay people off under pay them or engage in speed up and dangerous work practices if they can profit by doing so for example low pay work intensification and injuries have been a problem at the tesla electric car factory which has received 5 billion dollars in government subsidies tesla recently laid off 7 percent of its workforce over three thousand workers in pursuit of profitability an alternative approach that looks to statist central planning has been proposed by richard smith an eco socialist who is also a member of democratic socialists of america smith characterizes the proposal by alexandria ocasio cortez this way ocasio cortez is a bold feminist anti racist and socialist inspired successor to fdr she s taking the global warming discussion to a new level she s not calling for cap and trade or carbon taxes or divestment or other market solutions she s issuing a full throated call for de carbonization in effect throwing the gauntlet down to capitalism and challenging the system smith believes the goals of the green new deal can t be realized through things like incentives and he s right about that he points out that the green new deal resolution lacks specifics about how the goals will be reached to realize the goal of de carbonizing the economy he proposes a three part program declare a state of emergency to suppress fossil fuel use ban all new extraction nationalize the fossil fuel industry to phase it out create a federal program in the style of the 1930s works progress administration to shift the workforce of the shut down industries to useful but low emissions areas of the economy at equivalent pay and benefits launch a state directed crash program to phase in renewable electric power production electric transport vehicles and other methods of transport not based on burning fossil fuels develop programs to shift from petro chemical intensive industrial agriculture to organic farming even though aoc explicitly makes a powerful case for state planning smith says a weakness of the green new deal resolution from his perspective is the failure to call for a national planning board to reorganize reprioritize and restructure the economy when he talks about nationalization he notes we do not call for expropriation he s talking about buying out the shareholders at fair market value this is essentially a proposal for a largely state directed form of capitalist economy a form of state capitalism smith s proposal is wildly unrealistic are we to believe that the corporate media influenced american electoral scheme can be used to elect politicians through the business controlled democratic party to enact a multi trillion dollar program of seizures of the fossil fuel industry auto manufacturers and chemical firms and set up a planning board to direct the economy romanticizing the 1930s new deal the american working class did make important gains in the thirties such as the fair labor standards act minimum wage unemployment insurance and aid to families with dependent children these concessions were only won due to an uprising of the american working class in a context of vast struggles around the world a working class revolution in spain plant occupations in france a communist insurgency in china the communists holding on in russia in that moment capitalism faced a threat to its very existence the usa saw a huge working class rebellion between 1933 and 1937 millions of workers on strike hundreds of thousands of workers creating new unions from scratch rising influence for revolutionary organizations a thousand workplace seizures sit down strikes challenges to jim crow in the south and in 1936 this angry and militant mood also pushed very close to the formation of a national farmer labor party that would have been a major threat to the democrats many formerly intransigent corporations were forced to negotiate agreements with unions the democrats chose to move left in that moment it s also a mistake to romanticize the new deal people talk of the 1930s wpa as the model for job guarantees that is government as employer of last resort but there was still 17 percent unemployment in usa as late as 1940 workers in the wpa often had beefs such as low pay communists socialists and syndicalists organized unions and strikes among wpa workers the gains that working class people were able to win in the thirties did not simply come about through electoral politics nor were the conservative bureaucratic international unions of the american federal of labor the vehicle either they were more of a road block exactly why several hundred thousand workers had created new grassroots unions from scratch by late 1934 smith is not alone in pushing statist central planning as a solution this concept is being talked up lately by various state socialists including people associated with jacobin magazine and dsa these advocates often assume the state is simply a class neutral institution that could be taken hold of by the working class and wielded for its purposes in reality the state is not class neutral but has class oppression built into its very structure for example public sector workers are subordinate to managerialist bureaucracies just as workers are in the private corporations the day to day workings of state institutions are controlled by the cadres of the bureaucratic control class state managers high end professionals employed as experts prosecutors and judges military and police brass this is in addition to the professionals of representation the politicians who are typically drawn from either the business or bureaucratic control classes that is classes to which working class people are subordinate as a top down approach to planning statist central planning has no way to gain accurate information about either public preferences for public goods and services or individual consumer preferences statist central planning is also inherently authoritarian this is because it is based on a denial of self management to people who would be primarily affected by its decisions consumers and residents of communities on the one hand and workers in the various industries who would continue to be subject to managerialist autocracy self managed solutions to the crisis self management means that people who are affected by decisions have control over those decisions to the extent they are affected there are many decisions in the running of workplaces where the group who are primarily affected are the workers whose activity makes up the production process taking self management seriously would require a form of distributed control in planning where groups who are primarily affected over certain decisions such as residents of local communities or workers in industries have an independent sphere of decision making control this is the basis of the syndicalist alternative of distributed planning discussed below state socialists will sometimes make noises about worker control as an element of central planning but real collective power of workers over the production process is inconsistent with the concept of central planning if planning is to be the activity of an elite group at a center they will want to have their own managers on site in workplaces to make sure their plans are carried out any talk of worker control always loses out to this logic statist central planning can t overcome either the exploitative or cost shifting logic of capitalism which lies at the heart of the ecological crisis various populations are directly impacted by pollution in various forms such as the impact of pesticide pollution on farm workers and rural communities or the impact on air and water in various communities the only way to overcome the cost shifting logic is for the affected populations workers and communities to gain direct power to prevent being polluted on for global warming this means the population in general needs a direct form of popular power that would enable the people to directly control the allowable emissions into the atmosphere as difficult as it may be we need a transition to a self managed worker controlled socialist political economy if we re going to have a solution to the ecological crisis of the present era but this transition can only really come out of the building up of a powerful participatory movement of the oppressed majority in the course of struggles against the present regime tom wetzel is active with worker s solidarity alliance wsa in the san francisco bay area and has organized around housing and transit issues in san francisco this piece was originally published in ideas action the online publication of the wsa for more writings by tom wetzel we recommend a review of the classic work for workers power by maurice brinton or workers power and the spanish revolution for more writings related to ecology issues we recommend a green new deal vs revolutionary ecosocialism and the state against climate change response to christian parenti

financial measures derived from our condensed consolidated statements of earnings non gaap operating earnings non gaap net earnings and non gaap net earnings per diluted share we define non gaap operating earnings as operating earnings excluding amortization of intangible assets acquisition and integration related expenses and benefits impairment charges and significant litigation charges or benefits and legal costs these measures are not presented in accordance with nor are they a substitute for u s generally accepted accounting principles or gaap in addition these measures may be different from non gaap measures used by other companies limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes the non gaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non gaap financial measures as an analytical tool we have provided a reconciliation of each non gaap financial measure used in this earnings release to the most directly comparable gaap financial measure we have not provided a reconciliation of non gaap guidance measures to the corresponding gaap measures on a forward looking basis due to the potential significant variability and limited visibility of the excluded items discussed below we utilize a number of different financial measures both gaap and non gaap in analyzing and assessing the overall performance of our business in making operating decisions forecasting and planning for future periods and determining payments under compensation programs we consider the use of the non gaap measures to be helpful in assessing the performance of the ongoing operation of our business we believe that disclosing non gaap financial measures provides useful supplemental data that while not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap allows for greater transparency in the review of our financial and operational performance we also believe that disclosing non gaap financial measures provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management and in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies non gaap operating earnings and non gaap net earnings exclude the following items except for gain or losses on equity investments loss on hedges related to acquisition related activities and significant non recurring tax expense or benefit which are only excluded from non gaap net earnings amortization of intangible assets we do not acquire businesses and assets on a predictable cycle the amount of purchase price allocated to intangible assets and the term of amortization can vary significantly and are unique to each acquisition or purchase we believe that excluding amortization of intangible assets allows the users of our financial statements to better review and understand the historic and current results of our operations and also facilitates comparisons to peer companies acquisition and integration related expenses and benefits we incur expenses or benefits with respect to certain items associated with our acquisitions such as transaction costs hedging gains and losses changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities gain or expense on settlement of pre existing relationships integration costs breakup fees etc we exclude such expenses or benefits as they are related to acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the operation of our on going business impairment charges we incur impairment charges that result from events which arise from unforeseen circumstances and or often occur outside of the ordinary course of our on going business although these events are reflected in our gaap financials these unique transactions may limit the comparability of our on going operations with prior and future periods significant litigation charges or benefits and legal costs we may incur charges or benefits as well as legal costs from time to time related to litigation and other contingencies we exclude these charges or benefits when significant as well as legal costs associated with significant legal matters because we do not believe they are reflective of on going business and operating results gains or losses on equity investments we may incur gains or losses from the sale of our equity investments in privately held companies we do not trade equity investments and we

financial measures derived from our condensed consolidated statements of earnings non gaap operating earnings non gaap net earnings and non gaap net earnings per diluted share we define non gaap operating earnings as operating earnings excluding amortization of intangible assets acquisition and integration related expenses and benefits impairment charges and significant litigation charges or benefits and legal costs these measures are not presented in accordance with nor are they a substitute for u s generally accepted accounting principles or gaap in addition these measures may be different from non gaap measures used by other companies limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes the non gaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non gaap financial measures as an analytical tool we have provided a reconciliation of each non gaap financial measure used in this earnings release to the most directly comparable gaap financial measure we have not provided a reconciliation of non gaap guidance measures to the corresponding gaap measures on a forward looking basis due to the potential significant variability and limited visibility of the excluded items discussed below we utilize a number of different financial measures both gaap and non gaap in analyzing and assessing the overall performance of our business in making operating decisions forecasting and planning for future periods and determining payments under compensation programs we consider the use of the non gaap measures to be helpful in assessing the performance of the ongoing operation of our business we believe that disclosing non gaap financial measures provides useful supplemental data that while not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap allows for greater transparency in the review of our financial and operational performance we also believe that disclosing non gaap financial measures provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management and in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies non gaap operating earnings and non gaap net earnings exclude the following items except for gain or losses on equity investments loss on hedges related to acquisition related activities and significant non recurring tax expense or benefit which are only excluded from non gaap net earnings amortization of intangible assets we do not acquire businesses and assets on a predictable cycle the amount of purchase price allocated to intangible assets and the term of amortization can vary significantly and are unique to each acquisition or purchase we believe that excluding amortization of intangible assets allows the users of our financial statements to better review and understand the historic and current results of our operations and also facilitates comparisons to peer companies acquisition and integration related expenses and benefits we incur expenses or benefits with respect to certain items associated with our acquisitions such as transaction costs hedging gains and losses changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities gain or expense on settlement of pre existing relationships integration costs breakup fees etc we exclude such expenses or benefits as they are related to acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the operation of our on going business impairment charges we incur impairment charges that result from events which arise from unforeseen circumstances and or often occur outside of the ordinary course of our on going business although these events are reflected in our gaap financials these unique transactions may limit the comparability of our on going operations with prior and future periods significant litigation charges or benefits and legal costs we may incur charges or benefits as well as legal costs from time to time related to litigation and other contingencies we exclude these charges or benefits when significant as well as legal costs associated with significant legal matters because we do not believe they are reflective of on going business and operating results gains or losses on equity investments we may incur gains or losses from the sale of our equity investments in privately held companies we do not trade equity investments and we do not plan on these investments for funding of ongoing operations we exclude such gains or losses because we do not believe they are reflective of our core business significant non recurring tax expense or benefit we may incur significant tax expense or benefit as a result of tax legislation and or a change in judgment about the need for a valuation allowance that are generally unrelated to the level of business activity in the period in which these tax effects are reported we exclude such expenses or benefits from our non gaap net earnings because we believe they do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of our continuing business operations we apply our gaap consolidated effective tax rate to our non gaap financial measures other than when the underlying item has a

strong company guidance and a number of big earnings beats helped push the s p 500 index to an all time high close yesterday but today might see a slight headwind from boeing co ba after the aircraft maker s earnings came up short boeing missed third party estimates pulled its earnings guidance and stopped its share buyback program in the wake of the march crash of its 737 max the second max crash in six months ba said it would wait to post new guidance until it has more clarity on the aircraft s fate you don t often see a company withdraw its estimates but this is a pretty unusual situation the question that hangs over ba ahead of its earnings call is how future orders might be affected by the situation that call could be one of the most listened to earnings calls in a while earnings of 3 16 a share fell several cents shy of consensus views while revenue of 22 9 billion also came up short the company said it s committed to safety and getting the 737 max back into service but the earnings report was about as weak as many had expected if not more shares rose a bit in pre market trading however maybe because some of the bad news was built in with the stock down 15 over the last month boeing wasn t the only company reporting on a busy earnings morning at t inc t came up shy of the street s revenue estimate and saw shares get hit while caterpillar inc cat beat analysts estimates on earnings and revenue and raised guidance cat shares rose just slightly and then fell back sometimes when you see a stock fall despite an earnings beat it could mean a whisper number was out there that was even higher than the results or some investors might be discounting the better guidance because part of it is based on a tax benefit herding cat with cat holding its quarterly earnings call today some things to consider listening for include anything its executives might say about demand from chinese customers cat is often seen as a bellwether for the chinese economy since it sells so much heavy equipment there there s also the strong dollar and its possible impact other companies haven t really been talking about that but the equipment cat sells tends to be big ticket and pricey so cat might be one of the first companies to feel the chill the dollar index rose to 97 58 on tuesday near its yearly high more importantly from an earnings perspective the dollar spent much of q1 above 96 vs close to 90 in q1 of 2018 before this morning s earnings potpourri a couple major firms reported following yesterday s closing bell ebay inc ebay became the latest to beat third party consensus on earnings and revenue helping the stock to 3 gains in the pre market hours texas instruments incorporated txn delivered some positive news from the chip space where it s often seen as a bellwether txn earnings and revenue both surpassed street projections raising hopes for other chip makers who saw demand for some products slow down late last year due in part to china s economic weakness though the company s q1 results came in below year ago levels it offered guidance that appeared to please investors shares were down a bit early wednesday looking ahead to this afternoon microsoft corporation msft earnings loom its azure cloud offering which saw 76 growth in the company s fiscal q2 is likely to be under a microscope one question is whether cloud growth in the company s fiscal q2 got hurt by the slowing global economy and may have bounced back in fiscal q3 shares of msft are up sharply so far this year perhaps a sign that investors are optimistic that s the case we ve met the catalyst and it is earnings entering earnings season it seemed like the market needed a catalyst to launch itself back toward last autumn s all time highs that catalyst turned out to be earnings themselves as well as company forecasts we re getting a nice forward looking picture from many companies twitter inc s twtr results yesterday were potentially a good sign for social media companies that have been struggling lockheed martin corporation s lmt results and forecast might mean other industrial companies are also thriving stronger than expected corporate results arguably played the biggest role in sending the s p 500 index spx to tuesday s new all time closing high the spx is up about 25 from its dec 24 low but back to about even with where it was late last september the all time intraday high is just a few points away at a little under 2941 that could be a technical resistance area so we ll see if the market challenges that level today though we re revisiting the september highs this is a different sort of rally than we had back in the summer instead of being led by four or five stocks namely the faangs this one looks much more broad based and healthy the faangs are doing well but none are really leading the charge semiconductor stocks are carrying more of the load but they re not alone home builder energy and some of the industrial companies have steadily climbed much of the year though info tech continues to be the top performer even financials which were a laggard much of last year even when the market was in rally mode have put on a little run in 2019 though the sector s 14 gains year to date trail the 17 gains of the spx earnings for the five biggest banks in q1 were a mixed bag but a positive move in the yield curve over the last week or two might have countered that a bit still financials were among the weaker performing sectors tuesday along with consumer staples and utilities cyclicals have led the way most of the year and it s not necessarily a bad thing that faangs aren t in front of the pack people tend to forget that it s good to have different names take leadership and we ve seen companies like qualcomm inc qcom and western digital corporation wdc play that role in 2019 the walt disney co dis and microsoft corporation msft are two other big companies having good years in the market another potential positive factor compared to the last time the spx reached this level is the treasury market where 10 year yields sit below 2 6 back in late september when the spx hit all time highs the 10 year was well above 3 amid concerns about inflation and fed rate hikes those concerns have basically melted away for the most part yet here we are back at all time stock market highs again top heavy not necessarily one of the rubs some people are talking about is that the rally so far has mostly been a big name rally with multinationals and major tech firms getting lots of love but small caps getting left behind that s a bit hard to take too seriously however when you consider that the russell 2000 index rut of small caps is up 17 5 this year slightly outpacing the spx that said the rut is still about 9 from its all time high posted last summer back when it became the first major index to start catching a flu that rapidly spread to the rest of the market one thing being forgotten here could be some of the dangers still facing stocks including the lack of a china tariff resolution rising gasoline prices tensions between the u s and iran and a brexit process that s stuck in neutral also while u s treasury yields have moved higher lately amid talk of possible improved u s economic growth they remain well under 2 6 for the 10 year note one sign maybe that at least some investors remain cautious figure 1 well hello dollar one possible factor that might help put the brakes on this stock market rally is a u s dollar candelstick that s been steadily marching higher as enthusiasm about the u s economy grows as the dollar strengthens gold purple line has descended to new 2019 lows below 1 275 an ounce data sources ice cme group chart source the thinkorswim platform from td ameritrade for illustrative purposes only past performance does not guarantee future results back to the drawing board on earnings it might be interesting to see if earnings estimates for q1 start to change in the days ahead after tuesday s rush of better than expected resuslts from key companies of course there s a long way to go until the end of earnings season but we ll be about 50 of the way there by the end of the week upside earnings surprises have seemed like the rule so far not the exception in a season when many analysts had predicted a moderate overall decline in year over year s p 500 earnings results earnings are down year over year but how much they ll ultimately fall remains a moving target early this week factset predicted that assuming earnings surprises are at average levels this season overall s p 500 earnings would be down slightly in q1 but slightly is a lot better than a 4 or worse decline that many analysts had predicted before the season started hopes that the patient might be among the walking wounded rather than in a hospital bed could help explain the s p 500 index s spx rise to near record highs tuesday home brew speaking of wounded that might still be the best description for the u s existing home market following downbeat data early this week the headline number in march fell short of analysts expectations even though mortgage rates fell during the month and might suggest that rising home prices and a lack of affordable homes might be keeping buyers in check briefing com said the news on march new home sales was far sunnier though new homes are a much smaller market catering to a generally wealthy group of buyers new home sales rose 4 5 month over month and 3 year over year last month that might have been helped by the median new home price falling nearly 10 compared to a nearly 4 rise in existing home prices new home prices had the smallest margin over existing home prices since last june and existing home prices have now risen 85 months in a row tomorrow brings earnings from home builder d r horton inc dhi and it might be worth listening to what executives have to say about how lower mortgage rates are affecting the market pass the healthy fries trying to eat healthier it seems like a lot of people are and u s farmers have apparently started to take note over the last five years farmers have devoted more acres to crops like sweet potatoes romaine lettuce kale and spinach the u s department of agriculture reported this month acreage planted with kale for instance rose nearly 150 between 2012 and 2017 sweet potato acreage grew almost 50 losing ground literally were crops like sweet corn peas and potatoes the shift might reflect dietary trends the washington post reported why sweet potatoes white flour white potatoes and white rice have been vilified over the past decade for their easy digestion and high glycemic load the post said sweet potatoes have fewer carbs and calories as well as higher levels of vitamins a

first quarter of 2019 organically we grew spot commercial loan balances by 392 5 million since december 31 2018 which was offset by substantial run off of residential mortgage loans of 155 9 million

to the first quarter of 2018 this was mainly due to an increase in average loans outstanding originated through our commercial banking teams and acquisitions which was partially offset by an increase in interest expense paid to depositors and on borrowings other key components of the changes in net interest income and net interest margin were the following the yield on loans was 5 17 compared to 4 85 for the three months ended march 31 2018 the increase in yield on loans was mainly due to the change in portfolio composition as we continued to add commercial loans while the proportion of lower yielding residential mortgage and multi family loans decreased due to run off and sales accretion income on acquired loans was 25 6 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 30 3 million in the first quarter of 2018 average commercial loans which includes all commercial and industrial loans commercial real estate loans including multi family and acquisition development and construction loans were 16 2 billion compared to 14 3 billion in the first quarter of 2018 an increase of 1 9 billion or 13 6 the tax equivalent yield on investment securities was 2 99 compared to 2 85 for the three months ended march 31 2018 average investment securities were 6 3 billion or 23 1 of average total interest earning assets for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 6 6 billion or 24 6 of average earning assets for the first quarter of 2018 in the first quarter of 2019 we sold lower yielding securities as part of our balance sheet transition strategy the tax equivalent yield on interest earning assets increased 33 basis points between the periods to 4 64 the cost of total deposits was 88 basis points and the cost of borrowings was 2 53 compared to 47 basis points and 2 01 respectively for the same period a year ago the increase was mainly due to increases in market rates of interest the cost of total deposits has also been impacted by the competitive environment in the greater new york metropolitan area as higher interest rates have been required to attract and retain higher balance commercial and consumer deposits the total cost of interest bearing liabilities increased 50 basis points to 1 39 for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 0 89 for the first quarter of 2018 which was mainly due to the increase in market interest rates and the competitive factors discussed above average interest bearing deposits increased by 351 7 million and average borrowings decreased 131 7 million compared to the first quarter of 2018 total interest expense increased by 26 9 million compared to the first quarter of 2018 the tax equivalent net interest margin was 3 54 for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 3 60 for the first quarter of 2018 the decrease in tax equivalent net interest margin was mainly due to the increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities and the decrease in accretion income on acquired loans excluding accretion income tax equivalent net interest margin was 3 16 for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 3 15 in the first quarter of 2018 first quarter 2019 compared with linked quarter ended december 31 2018 net interest income declined 7 4 million compared to the linked quarter the decrease in net interest income was mainly due to the loss of two days between the periods a decline of 296 4 million in the average balance of interest earning assets higher interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities and lower accretion income on acquired loans other key components of the changes in net interest income compared to the linked quarter were the following the yield on loans was 5 17 compared to 5 07 for the linked quarter the increase in the yield on loans was mainly driven by the change in composition of the loan portfolio as average residential loans declined by 457 1 million while average commercial loans increased by 496 2 million the average balance of total portfolio loans increased by 23 1 million accretion income on acquired loans was 25 6 million a decrease of 1 4 million relative to the linked quarter the tax equivalent yield on investment securities was 2 99 compared to 2 92 for the linked quarter the increase in yield was related to the decline in average investment securities balances of 351 3 million as we sold lower yielding securities the tax equivalent yield on interest earning assets was 4 64 compared to 4 54 in the linked quarter the cost of total deposits increased 11 basis points to 88 basis points and the total cost of borrowings increased 10 basis points to 2 53 for the same reasons as discussed above average interest bearing deposits increased by 40 6 million and average borrowings decreased by 250 4 million relative to the linked quarter total interest expense increased by 3 6 million over the linked quarter the tax equivalent net interest margin was 3 54 compared to 3 53 in the linked quarter excluding accretion income on acquired loans tax equivalent net interest margin was 3 16 compared to 3 15 in the liked quarter we anticipate that our loan portfolio transition lower fhlb borrowing balances and improving deposit market dynamics will

the first quarter of 2019 to 24 5 million compared to 24 1 million in the same quarter last year the change was mainly due to higher loan commissions and fees and higher loan swap fees which are included in other non interest income these increases were partially offset by a decline of 791 thousand in deposit service charges which was mainly due to a client retention strategy executed for six months following the astoria deposit systems conversion in august 2018 in the first quarter of 2019 we sold 738 8 million of available for sale securities and realized a loss of 13 2 million the securities were sold as we execute our strategy of repositioning our balance sheet and interest earning assets to a more optimal mix in the first quarter of 2019 we sold 1 3 billion of residential mortgage loans and realized a gain of 8 3 million first quarter 2019 compared with linked quarter ended december 31 2018 excluding net loss on sale of securities and net gain on sale of residential mortgage loans adjusted non interest income decreased approximately 2 9 million from 27 4 million in the linked quarter to 24 5 million in the first quarter of 2019 the decrease was mainly due to a seasonal decline in accounts receivable management factoring commissions and other related fees of 1 1 million as these businesses typically have peak volumes in the fourth quarter and a decrease in loan swap fees which are included in other non interest income of 1 0 million loan swap fees are usually connected to new loan originations which may result in fluctuations in swap fee volume on a

in non interest expense between the periods were the following 5 compensation and benefits increased 1 3 million as the composition of our employees has shifted to a higher proportion of commercial banking and relationship management personnel total ftes declined to 1 855 from 2 016 which was mainly due to the completion of the astoria merger integration and ongoing financial center consolidation strategy and was partially offset by additions in ftes from acquisitions commercial bankers and risk management personnel occupancy and office operations decreased 925 thousand mainly

the much coveted yellow metal has been losing its lure of late gold prices have been stagnating around 1 260 per ounce since 2016 pushing away investment demand from exchange traded funds and buyers of gold coin and bars changing cultural preferences has reduced sale of heavy gold jewellery in markets such as india even as the mine output has been increasing exerting further pressure on prices in these challenging times gold has received support from an unexpected quarter global central banks it was largely due to the purchase of 651 tonnes of gold by global central banks and other institutions in 2018 that the surplus in gold reduced to 75 tonnes helping support prices additions to central bank reserves spiked 74 per cent last year of particular interest is the fact that the reserve bank of india too has joined the gold buying bandwagon since december 2017 anti americanism there is a definite pattern apparent in the countries that are leading this central bank gold hunt countries with a strong anti american sentiment that wish to reduce their dependence on the us dollar top the list of nations that have been adding gold to their forex reserves in the last few years this buying spree has in fact been led by russia and its allies russia has been steadily adding to its gold stock pile since 2006 but the additions accelerated after 2014 while average annual gold purchase by russia averaged 81 tonnes between 2006 and 2013 this number spiked to 215 tonnes after 2014 when russia s incursion into ukraine flared its conflict with the us with these purchases russia now possesses the fifth largest gold reserves with 2 113 tonnes almost one fifth of russia s forex reserves are now held in the form of gold another country that seems intent to add to its gold reserves is turkey relations between turkey and the us have been steadily deteriorating since 2016 when turkey demanded that the us extradite a cleric who was suspected of being involved in the failed coup in turkey that year with counter moves by turkey and us sanctions that followed further roiling the relations it is not surprising that turkey decided to bolster its war chest by purchasing 85 9 and 51 5 tonnes of gold in 2017 and 2018 respectively according to world gold council china too has shown a growing penchant for gold in recent years with purchase of 454 tonnes of gold between 2003 and 2009 and another 604 tonnes between 2009 and 2015 the country has been adding gold over the past three years as well allies of russia such as kazakhstan uzbekistan tajikistan and kyrgyz republic are other nations that have been adding gold to their reserves over the last decade these countries are also making a conscious effort to reduce their dependence on dollar by reducing their investments in us government securities and trying to settle bi lateral trade in local currencies why is rbi buying gold besides the above countries that want the world to move towards de dollarisation few other central banks in emerging economies such as poland hungary and india too seem to have decided to add to the gold reserves since late 2017 there has been a long hiatus since the last time the rbi added gold to its reserves in 2009 when 200 tonnes was bought from the imf but there appears to have been a change in the central bank s line of thought since 2017 a small quantity 0 3 tonnes were added in december 2017 but since march 2018 the rbi has been buying gold consistently averaging 4 2 tonnes every month between march 2018 and december 2018 these purchases have continued in 2019 with purchases of 8 2 tonnes in the first two months this year with these purchases the country s gold reserves have risen to 606 tonnes towards the end of february 2019 it is obvious that the trade war unleashed by the us has made emerging economies including india nervous about future policies of the us government the clear anti globalisation stand taken by the current us government and the scant respect displayed for policies that promote peace and inclusive growth have made it imperative to reduce dependence on the us currency that can turn volatile in tandem with the policies of the government the mounting debt in the us and unbridled printing of notes for successive quantitative easing programmes since 2009 have also eroded the intrinsic worth of the dollar significantly unfortunately there is no viable alternative to dollar yet among the currencies of other major economies the euro has not really lived up to its promise due to the problems in the weaker economies in the euro zone and yuan s aspiration to de throne the greenback is still a couple of decades away that leaves gold as the only alternative avenue for global central banks that wish to divert part of their reserves away from the dollar lessons for you and me global central banks turning champions of gold in one its worst years in recent times will be sweet music to the ears of those who have stashed a large portion of their savings in the form of gold for it signals that gold retains its position as a premier store of value an asset that is a store of value is one which is expected to retain its purchasing power in the future gold has retained this position as a store of value for thousands of years due to its key features durability divisibility portability and scarcity due to this position gold has been accumulated by the wealthy and the not so wealthy too over centuries and passed down from one generation to the next these accumulated wealth of households in the form of gold is unlikely to be depreciate significantly as the consumption demand while slowing in countries such as india is increasing in the us china hong kong thailand and some countries in the middle east also gold supplies are likely to diminish if its price declines below 1 200 which is the average cost of mining for top gold miners the central bank buying further emphasises that gold will continue to be viewed as a reliable diversifier and a hedge against volatility in other currencies but if you think that the money you park in gold is going to grow your wealth as it did in the past think again that appears difficult at least at this juncture

class a warning of the trend s sustainability came this month from europe where middle class expansion has stalled the organization for economic co operation and development oecd a paris based club that includes most of the world s wealthiest nations reported that many of its member states have seen their standard of living stagnate or decline while higher income groups have continued to accumulate income and wealth the middle class crisis in the west means disappointment for those who hoped that standards of living would continue to improve as was the case for their forbears during the four or five decades after world ii but more recent times have seen the top 10 of earners share of total wealth rocket to nearly half the national average findings contained in a new oecd report under pressure the squeezed middle class that in turn paints a grim picture for the third of member state populations described as economically vulnerable emerging asia has been the world s economic growth dynamo in recent decades with average incomes rising across the region unlike in the west asia s the one part of the world economy that has been doing best in raising living standards said gareth leather senior asia economist at capital economics but just as western economies are struggling to improve living standards for their smaller wealthier populations asia s developing economies must cater for vast populations with 47 of workers across the asia pacific region working informally according to world bank estimates hopes that india will lead the next big wave into asia s middle class after china are constrained by the lack of salaried employment world bank statistics show over the past 30 years middle income households have experienced dismal income growth or even stagnation in some countries this has fueled perceptions that the current socio economic system is unfair and that the middle class has not benefited from economic growth in proportion to its contribution the oecd reported they are vulnerabilities and resentments that are likely to worsen given estimates that one in five middle income jobs could soon be jeopardized by automation according to the same research social and political unrest has ensued in some western countries as the increasingly wealthy elites are blamed for a succession of economic crises for outsourcing jobs to lower cost asia for what many in europe and north america believe to be insufficient curbs on migration and for overseeing the angst inducing combination of rising living costs and stagnating wages low wages in emerging asian economies helped drive inward foreign investment in manufacturing and services from companies headquartered in oecd member states but that middle class creating investment is also in jeopardy as western leaders such as us president donald trump demand businesses repatriate assets the gilets jaunes protests across france are but the latest manifestation of a globalization backlash that underpinned trump s 2016 election win on a nationalistic america first platform and the shock vote by a majority of british citizens that same year to leave the european union asia s oecd member states japan and south korea have so far escaped the turmoil and polarization affecting western countries but japan s economy has been stagnant for almost two decades and its middle class is smaller than the oecd average with only 54 of japanese fitting the oecd s classification of households that earn between 75 and 200 of the median national income it is difficult to make a generalization for asia said michael forster an economist at the oecd secretariat and co author of the report who spoke to asia times the picture is more gloomy than you would think however countries such as china and india which feature briefly in the oecd report have smaller middle classes as a proportion of their populations compared to the wealthier oecd members led by china most of asia has enjoyed heady economic growth over the past two decades particularly since the dark days of the late 1990 s asian financial crisis indeed driven by asia the world reached a tipping point last year according to the brookings institution a us think tank which estimated that just over 50 of the world s population now live in households with enough disposable income to be considered either middle class or rich in 2009 the world s middle classes numbered 1 8 billion people according to the oecd s calculations 664 million europeans 525 million asians and 338 north americans if current economic trends hold a big if by 2030 the world s middle classes will number 4 9 billion 66 of them asia more than double 2009 s 28 according to the oecd and for consumer oriented businesses that thrive when the middle classes grow the bet is on asia s rise continuing and more of its people having more money to spend as for south east countries generally speaking they have been showing rapid economic growth and will keep their pace in future too said a spokesperson for japanese retail giant aeon in a recent email the united nations conference on trade and development last year described asia and southeast asia in particular as the world s foreign investment growth point pointing to some major investment deals made in sectors geared towards consumers people with disposable income or the middle classes in other words in november 2018 the association of southeast asian nations secretariat and unctad reported an all time high of 137 billion in 2017 but asia s relatively low incomes per capita and huge populations mean that sustained high growth will be required to expand and ensconce the region s middle classes with even relatively wealthy countries such as malaysia struggling to escape the so called middle income trap you need economic growth first if you are to have sustainable and inclusive growth of middle income classes said michael forster who warned against benefits tricking down in an unequal way as seen in the oecd member states in recent years although most emerging economies in asia are expected to continue to grow over the next 20 years or so that growth could be slower than over the previous two decades and thus stunt middle class expansion uk based consultancy capital economics predicted earlier this year that economic growth in china could to slow to 2 a year within a decade and suggested that though poorer countries such as india are likely to enjoy sustained high growth of up to 7 growth in the rest of emerging asia is likely to slow we expect growth to slow as many countries have already undergone the relatively easy catch up phase of economic development said leather the capital economics economist and just as economic stresses are increasingly prompting political fallout in the west asia where countries such as the philippines indonesia and thailand feature extremes of income inequality will feel social and political pressures of its own unequal growth if asia does undergo a continent wide transition to european or japanese living standards it at least can take on board how the problems faced by those advanced albeit stagnant economies came to be not to mention avoid any social unrest due to vast numbers of people dissatisfied at not making the leaps from subsistence to relative poverty to the consumer class but even then increased wealth could bring about other challenges though the new middle classes have functioned as ancien régime guardians in some parts of asia where there has been several reversals for democratization in recent years more often the expansion of middle classes leads to pressures to govern in a more open manner to be more democratic to abolish corruption according to the oecd s forster follow us on

effective income tax rate declined to 10 5 primarily due to the recognition of a state deferred tax asset related to the repeal of the kentucky franchise tax as of 2021 the effect of which added 0 06 to net income per diluted share for the first quarter 2019 stock yards bancorp registered another strong quarter with the opening of 2019 said james a ja hillebrand chief executive officer key elements supporting the company s results included near record loan production during the quarter paired with solid year over year growth in average loans and deposits the continuation of very sound credit quality metrics and an ongoing improvement in net interest margin these positive factors not only helped us again achieve record earnings both before and after income tax expense they also underscored the substantial and fundamental strength of our business model the company s history of success and consistent performance owes much to a diversified revenue stream that emanates from the broad range of products and services we offer along with the geographic diversification we have achieved by expansion to two major metro markets these strategies and our successful implementation of them continue to differentiate stock yards bancorp among community bank peers and provide us with a solid platform from which to grow loan production in the first quarter of 2019 was very strong among the best quarterly performances in our company s history yet we also encountered a record level of loan payoffs mainly related to collateral sales that offset that progress hillebrand continued a familiar trend over the past few years and a natural aspect of a buoyant economy high loan payoffs reflect attractive opportunities for our customers to monetize assets through opportunistic asset sales additionally we are seeing aggressive permanent financing competition from non traditional lending institutions however we remain focused on the formation of lasting customer relationships building one relationship at a time that frequently span multiple generations considering our historic focus on these core areas we recognize the pattern of payoffs that come with this territory and know the opportunities as well we value the chance to develop long lasting client associations that entail both lending and deposits which helps us retain customers across economic cycles like we see now hillebrand noted that while the company has achieved exceptional loan production in pursuit of prudent growth in a competitive environment it also remains committed to a conservative credit quality culture as evidenced by key metrics that remain at historically strong levels as to revenue diversity hillebrand pointed out that the wm t group which has 3 0 billion of assets under management provided 49 of the company s non interest income for the first quarter of 2019 against a strong first quarter of 2018 wm t again posted solid results and enjoyed ongoing new business acquisition also revenue from debit and credit cards along with treasury management fees combined to account for 26 of first quarter non interest income these diverse sources remain key to long term stability in revenue growth by offsetting soft conditions that occur in other areas like those currently experienced in mortgage banking which faces a continued industry wide slowdown due to higher rates and a tight housing market hillebrand also noted that the company remains on track to complete the acquisition of king bancorp and its subsidiary king southern bank on the close of business april 30 2019 the transaction which will add customers in the louisville market and extend the company s reach to neighboring nelson county has received regulatory approval and remains subject only to customary closing conditions as we have previously disclosed executive vice president and chief financial officer nancy davis will retire from the company on april 30 2019 on behalf of the board of directors and everyone at stock yards bancorp i would like to thank nancy for the significant contributions she has made to the company over her 27 year tenure helping us grow from 222 million in assets in 1991 to 3 3 billion in assets today nancy has played a vital role in our growth and success positioning us among the strongest and highest performing community banks in the nation we wish nancy nothing but the best in her retirement in closing hillebrand said our outstanding results for the first quarter reflect both the vibrant economies within our footprint and our solid execution of long term strategies equally important are the hard work and dedication put forth by our team in delivering an unrivaled banking experience for our customers and for this i am grateful we look toward the remainder of the year with a sense of confidence and optimism supported by attractive business fundamentals a strong loan production pipeline and the opportunity to welcome new customers from king southern bank with a broader range of services considering these factors we remain well positioned to extend our track record of top and bottom line growth in 2019 first quarter 2019 compared with first quarter 2018 total assets remained level at 3 3 billion this was primarily due to a 0 5 increase in the company s loan portfolio which rose 13 3 million total deposits increased 179 2 million or 7 to 2 8 billion this primarily reflected an increase in time deposits and demand deposits core deposits which exclude brokered deposits and time deposits greater than 250 000 represented 97 of total deposits asset quality which has remained exceptional and has trended within a narrow range over the past several years remains strong while the company is pleased with this performance management recognizes the cyclical nature of banking and believes asset quality metrics will normalize over the long term which will eventually result in higher provisioning for loan and lease losses non performing loans npls were 3 8 million or 0 15 of total loans outstanding versus 12 3 million or 0 49 of total loans outstanding non performing assets npas which include npls along with other real estate owned and repossessed assets were 4 6 million or 0 14 of total assets versus 12 6 million or 0 38 of total assets based on a net loan loss recovery of 330 thousand versus net charge offs of 1 4 million in the first quarter of 2018 combined with other considerations including the overall level of risk in the portfolio the company provided 600 thousand for loan and lease losses in the first quarter of 2019 versus 735 thousand in the first quarter of 2018 the allowance for loan and lease losses relative to total end of period loans increased nine basis points to 1 05 from 0 96 the company remained well capitalized the highest capital rating for financial institutions total equity to assets was 11 52 and tangible common equity ratio was 11 47 both improving from 10 28 and 10 23 respectively tangible common equity is a non gaap financial measure 2 even with its strong capital position the company continues to consistently achieve industry leading returns on equity due to its superior earnings performance stock yards bancorp continues to pursue and consider strategies to enhance stockholder value including a substantial and sustained dividend payout ratio in february 2019 the company s board of directors continued the higher rate of 0 25 per common share initially set in august 2018 with the august increase stock yards bancorp has raised its quarterly dividend rate a total of 11 times since 2013 including two increases during 2018 and each of the previous four years the company also opportunistically pursues strategic fill in or adjacent market acquisitions to augment organic growth and its capital allocation strategies in december 2018 the company announced its planned acquisition of king bancorp the holding company for king southern bank net interest income the company s largest source of revenue increased approximately 2 3 million or 9 to 29 7 million interest income rose 5 3 million or 18 this increase was primarily driven by higher market interest rates and average loan volumes as anticipated interest expense increased 121 during the first quarter due to growth of deposits primarily time deposits resulting from a deposit gathering campaign last year along with higher costs on those deposits that campaign together with ongoing competition for deposits could cause funding costs to increase further in 2019 net interest margin increased 10 basis points to 3 89 this primarily reflected the positive impact of increases in the prime rate which was 75 basis points higher in the first quarter of 2019 versus the same period of 2018 and higher loan prepayment penalties approximately 40 of the company s current loan portfolio is priced at variable rates so any future rate increases will benefit this part of the portfolio the remainder of the portfolio is priced at fixed rates as these loans renew and the bank originates new fixed rate loans pricing could be higher but pricing will be subject to competitive conditions prevailing interest rates and a flattening or inverted yield curve non interest income increased 153 thousand or 1 4 to 11 1 million increases in fees from debit and credit cards treasury management fees as well as other non interest income were partially offset by lower deposit service charges mortgage banking income as well as a slight decrease in wm t service fees non interest expenses increased 1 6 million or 8 to 22 6 million the increase primarily reflected an increase in compensation expenses resulting from the addition of new employees to support growth and regular annual salary increases technology and communication expenses increased due to ongoing investments in hardware and software as well as higher processing fees for debit and credit cards that mirror growing fee income from debit and credit cards other non interest expense increased primarily because of a gain on the sale of other real estate owned that was included in the first quarter of 2018 the company s effective tax rate declined to 10 5 from 18 5 primarily because of the recognition of a state deferred tax asset following legislative action to repeal of the kentucky franchise tax in 2021 beginning in 2021 kentucky franchise tax will be replaced with an income based tax at a rate of 5 which is expected to result in higher state taxes to the company compared with the former capital based franchise tax that has been historically included in non interest expenses first quarter 2019 compared with fourth quarter 2018 total loans declined 22 million or 1 strong loan production in the first quarter of 2019 was more than offset by a historic level of loan payoffs total deposits decreased 42 million or 2 this primarily was due to a seasonal decrease in interest bearing and non interest bearing demand deposits asset quality remained at historically strong levels npls were 3 8 million or 0 15 of total loans outstanding versus 3 4 million or 0 13 of total loans outstanding npas were 4 6 million or 0 14 of total assets versus 4 4 million or 0 13 of total assets net loan loss recoveries were 330 thousand versus 312 thousand the second consecutive quarter of net recoveries the company recorded a provision for loan and lease losses of 600 thousand there was no provision in the fourth quarter of 2018 the allowance for loan and lease losses relative to total end of period loans was 1 05 an increase of five basis points from the fourth quarter of 2018 net interest income declined 1 interest income rose 25 thousand or 0 1 interest expense rose 280 thousand or 6 primarily due to higher funding costs net interest margin increased five basis points to 3 89 non interest income decreased 4 increases in wm t service fees and other non interest income were offset by declines in deposit service charges treasury management fees and bank owned life insurance with the prior quarter reflecting the rare receipt of life insurance proceeds non interest expenses declined 8 this decrease reflected primarily lower amortization impairment of investments in tax credit partnerships caused by the irregular timing of such opportunities which causes corresponding expenses and tax

comparison in a regulation g reconciliation table at the end of our press release let me take a few minutes to break down our performance by segment sales for the americas group in the first quarter increased 74 4 million or 3 6 to 2 15 billion unfavorable currency translation reduced sales in the quarter by 1 5 comparable store sales in the us and canada increased 3 6 in the quarter regionally

operating margin increased to 12 4 in the first quarter 2019 compared to 12 1 in the first quarter last year that concludes our review of operating results for the first quarter so let me turn the call over to john morikis who will make some general comments on the first quarter and provide our outlook for second quarter and full year 2019 john john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer advertisement advertisement thank you good morning everyone thanks for joining us i d like to make a just a few additional comments on our first quarter before moving on to our outlook first quarter volumes were a bit lighter than anticipated across all three segments driving consolidated results to the lower end of our expectations range we commented in our press release issued this morning that the north american architectural painting season got off to a slow start compared to last year but it s important to keep this in perspective it is traditionally the smallest revenue quarter of the year and it is volatile year to year so it s often not very representative of underlying demand trends robust feedback from our professional painting contractor customers has long been our most reliable indicator of north american architectural paint demand these customers almost universally remained optimistic about 2019 and continue to report unseasonably high project backlogs in a very healthy pipeline of new projects this consistent feedback underpins our confidence in our full year outlook in spite of the slow start to the season our sales results in the quarter highlighted the geographic variability in demand we have seen since mid year last year volume growth in north america ranged from stable to strong with a few exceptions while the softness in asia and europe was fairly broad based but also with a few noteworthy exceptions pricing was favorable across all of our businesses in the quarter while the impact of currency translation on all three segments was a bit more of a headwind than expected while we re not satisfied with our top line performance consolidated gross margin on an adjusted basis improved 60 basis points sequentially and was flat year over year at 43 this is encouraging given our expectation that the rate of raw material inflation year over year will be highest in the first quarter we expect to see more gross margin improvement over the balance of the year as volumes pick up the rate of raw material inflation moderates and we continue to benefit from pricing actions announced over the past year sg a in the quarter came in largely as expected and we ll continue to maintain appropriate discipline on spending as the year unfolds within the americas group sales increased 3 6 against the prior year comparison of 6 6 sales volume growth in our north america stores fell short of our expectations sales to protective and marine and residential repaint contractors were our strongest customer segments in the quarter both up high single digits over last year all other customer segments were positive our business in latin america went from positive double digit growth last year to a high single digit decline this year due to high teens unfavorable currency translation advertisement advertisement segment profit dollars and margins for the group were negatively impacted by lower than anticipated volume which in north america was likely the result of projects being postponed during the quarter we opened 15 net new stores finishing the quarter with 4 711 stores in operation compared to 4 624 last year our plan calls for this team to add approximately 90 to 100 net new stores in the americas by the end of this year in the consumer segment first quarter sales were positive in north america even if we include the negative impact of the guardsman divestiture demand was considerably softer in non domestic regions during the quarter most notably asia pacific we made pretty good progress on improving the profitability of this business as segment margin excluding purchase accounting impacts increased both sequentially and year over year this is the highest quarterly operating margin reported by this segment since the acquisition of valspar we are successfully executing our strategy in this business and we are well positioned with our retail partners heading into this spring paint selling season performance coatings group sales in the quarter grew modestly against a challenging prior year comparison of 9 8 on a pro forma basis revenue and volume growth in packaging and coil was offset by flat to down sales results in the segment s other businesses geographically sales increased in north america but these gains were offset by declines in asia pacific and europe where sales were down high single and mid single digits respectively we continue to see some benefit from our pricing actions across these businesses and regions as adjusted segment margin improved by 30 basis points year over year to 12 4 ebitda in the quarter was 533 million or 575 million on an adjusted basis to exclude the pension plan settlement expense and acquisition related costs working capital was a higher use of cash in the quarter as we built additional inventory through our fourth and first quarters to ensure our ability to respond to anticipated strong seasonal order volumes in our stores and retail customers at the end of the quarter we had 94 million of cash on hand that will be utilized to fund operations and reduce debt the balance sheet reflects total debt of approximately 9 8 billion we intend to reduce our net debt by approximately 600 million during the year which will result in a net debt to ebitda ratio below 3 1 by the end of 2019 advertisement advertisement after prioritizing debt reduction over other uses of cash during the past two years we are resuming our historical capital allocation philosophy in 2019 we returned approximately 410 million to shareholders during the quarter including 105 million in cash dividends and 305 million to purchase 750 000 shares of common stock during the quarter we increased our quarterly dividend by 31 to 1 13 per share at quarter end our share repurchase authorization stood at 9 38 million shares capital expenditures were 51 million in the quarter depreciation was 65 million and amortization was 79 million as we move into the second quarter 2019 we expect consolidated net sales to increase 2 to 5 compared to the second quarter of 2018 with the americas group at or above the high end of that range as a reminder second quarter revenue comparisons to 2018 in the americas group and the performance coatings group are the most challenging of the year and consumer brands group faces comparisons to early load in volume from the lowe s program and the divested guardsman business our full year 2019 revenue guidance remains unchanged with net sales increasing 4 to 7 compared to full year 2018 on an earnings per share basis we believe the most meaningful way to provide guidance is to exclude valspar acquisition related costs and non operating items on this basis and given our sales outlook we are confirming our adjusted 2019 full year diluted net income per common share to be in the range of 20 40 to 21 40 per share an increase of approximately 13 at the midpoint compared to the 18 53 reported last year on a comparable basis we ve included a regulation g reconciliation table with this morning s press release to better illustrate all the moving parts we expect our 2019 effective tax rate to be in the low 20 range a few additional data points for the full year may be helpful for modeling purposes these data points have not changed from the guidance we provided in january we expect raw material inflation from full year 2019 will be in the low single digits compared to 2018 the rate of year over year inflation assuming stable petrochemical feedstocks and no supply disruptions should diminish from the level we saw in the first quarter as we progress through the year we expect incremental synergies of approximately 70 million to 80 million in 2019 and a total annual run rate of approximately 415 million at year end advertisement advertisement we expect full year capital expenditures to be approximately 320 million depreciation to be about 257 million and amortization to be about 315 million with that i d like to thank you for joining us this morning and we ll be happy to take your questions questions and answers operator thank you at this time we will be conducting a question and answer session operator instructions our first question is from the line of christopher parkinson with credit suisse please proceed with your question christopher s parkinson credit suisse analyst great thank you as it relates to your intermediate term outlook for us housing can you just hit on the key ongoing trends by sub region just any updated views on rates affordability single versus multi family and just any preliminary views on sales ph would be greatly appreciated thank you advertisement advertisement robert j wells senior vice president corporate communications and public affairs yeah chris and we re going to sound a little like a broken record on this subject because we continue to believe that the sharp declines in starts year to date particularly in single family is not a reflection of a decline in demand and in fact march new home sales were pretty strong so that kind of underpins our view that the rate of new home construction is unsustainably low at the current rate given continued strength in household formation household formations are going to continue in the range of call at 1 2 million to 1 3 million annually for the next five plus years and historically if you look at the rate of new home starts they ve run at approximately a rate of approximately 1 3 times the rate of household formations and that s just to account for housing units that are taken out of stock over time either by natural disaster or demolition whatever the case may be but over the past four years housing starts have run roughly in line with household formations and as a result what we ve seen is inhabitable vacancies have largely been absorbed and single family rental stock is being converted to owner occupied stock and we don t think that that is going to be able to sustain demand for housing long term so it s a broader answer to a little more granular question that you asked but we think the challenge for builders continues to be building affordable entry level units given high land cost high land development costs labor costs et cetera and while we think that the starts in the first quarter were abnormally low we expect to see a pickup in starts as we go through the year we agree with the outlook that home building should be up over 2018 and 19 it s likely going to be up modestly low single digits in terms of any regional variation the southeast continues to be very strong southwest has had some challenges but should pick up as well and that s where you re going to see most of the activity advertisement advertisement christopher s parkinson credit suisse analyst got it and just a quick follow up just within it kind of the ongoing multi year integration in performance coatings and it seems like you guys are back on the track on the pricing front can you just comment on your updated long term views by sub segment with just an emphasis on general industrial packaging and wood just what have been the biggest surprises both positive and negative thank you allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer hey chris this is allen mistysyn i m going to talk about the consolidated segment and then i ll let john comment about the individual pieces but as we saw in our first quarter a nice year over year margin improvement and that s really the team is doing a great job working with their customers to get the pricing through to offset the persistent raw material inflation that we saw and also seeing a nice synergy realization and controlling their sg a so we have talked about targeting high teens to low 20 operating margin and we feel like we re on that track here in 19 and more to come as the year progresses john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yeah the only thing i d add to that is this continues to be something that we re very focused on we believe that as the two companies came together we found ourselves in an inflationary period and felt that it was important to work with our customers through that process of implementing these prices i don t know we are going to break down every segment to tell you the ground that we re gaining in each one but i will tell you that we are gaining ground in each one and while we ve accepted some compression over the elevating raw material basket we also believe that the solutions that we re bringing our customers and the services that we re providing is part of those solutions are opportunities for us to work with our customers in pushing through those price increases and we re determined to do just that christopher s parkinson credit suisse analyst okay thank you robert j wells senior vice president corporate communications and public affairs thanks chris operator thank you our next question is from the line of jeff zekauskas with jp morgan please proceed with your question jeffrey john zekauskas jp morgan analyst thanks very much are the raw material trends in the united states different than they are in the offshore markets and how would you compare raw material price inflation us versus the rest of the world robert j wells senior vice president corporate communications and public affairs jeff i think there are some differences in certain commodities like titanium dioxide i don t necessarily believe that the petrochemical side of the basket is vastly different as you look around the world tio2 has been stable in the us and i think it s been moving a bit more in asia pacific and europe the petrochemicals kind of surprisingly given the move in crude oil have been somewhat stable with as you know with propylene and ethylene actually trading down you re trading lower year over year we have not seen much benefit from that in our raw material basket yet but we expect to as we move through the balance of the year jeffrey john zekauskas jp morgan analyst okay i mean you said in your press release that your same store sales growth was 3 6 the quarter in the americas group like order of magnitude are prices up 2 5 and the volumes up 1 for the first quarter robert j wells senior vice president corporate communications and public affairs yeah jeff that sounds about right we talked about the realization coming out of our year end call about 2 5 and we might be a little bit better than that but i think you re directionally correct jeffrey john zekauskas jp morgan analyst okay great thank you so much robert j wells senior vice president corporate communications and public affairs thank you operator thank you our next question is from the line of john roberts with ubs please proceed with your questions john ezekiel e roberts ubs investment bank analyst thank you well nippon s deal for dulux in australia change your strategy at all in australia john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer no it shouldn t john ezekiel e roberts ubs investment bank analyst right and then in the packaging coatings area are we still seeing penetration from non bpa or is that now largely over with john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer no we re having very good success in our non bpa or v70 product in fact packaging was the exception of all our industrial businesses it was up globally and it was up in all regions so we continue to see a nice performance in our packaging business john ezekiel e roberts ubs investment bank analyst okay thank you robert j wells senior vice president corporate communications and public affairs thanks john operator thank you the next question is from the line of truman patterson with wells fargo please proceed with your question truman andrew patterson wells fargo securities analyst hey good morning guys just wanted to touch on the americas group s margins in the first quarter they saw about 80 bps year over year could you just explain why this was and how much of it would you say was due to the lack of volume and leverage versus raw material inflation may be coming in a bit heavier than what you expected robert j wells senior vice president corporate communications and public affairs yeah truman as john mentioned in his opening remarks the first quarter in north america is our smallest quarter and most volatile and it truly is all about the volume and it s a little lower than anticipated in our north american paint stores group and to your point we also saw higher year over year raw material inflation in the quarter so those are driving that margin but that being said we continue to invest in 87 net new stores over the past year with a corresponding increase in sales reps to support those stores that s a continuation of our consistent long term approach to north american architectural market and we have not slowed our cadence down on the store openings just because of the last two quarters we ve had and we believe this is going to continue to allow us to grow market share 1 5 times to 2 times the market and it s historically allowed us to gain the larger share of the market when the cycle turns so we talked about the price increases and i feel pretty good about those and with the price increase and the demand outlook that john talked about in his opening comments i am confident that our tag organization is going to expand margins this year truman andrew patterson wells fargo securities analyst okay thank you and to follow up on that with the raw material inflation you guys could you guys just give an update to your prior i think low single digit raw material inflation guidance and i m just trying to understand your confidence in this in your guidance considering 2018 kind of caught everybody off guard especially with your guys comment that 1q is going to be the high watermark for raw material inflation considering that oil seems like it s ticked up quite a bit here lately robert j wells senior vice president corporate communications and public affairs yeah truman at this point i think our outlook for first quarter being the peak appears to be at least correct so far your point on oil moving it s certainly moved quite a way but probably in ethylene have not and propylene in particular which is the primary feedstock still is down year over year it s barely moved off a 0 32 bottom so those being the primary drivers of the petrochemical side of our basket still look very favorable i m not saying they couldn t move with crude oil but they haven t thus far our outlook for low single digit inflation for full year presume that the highest year over year increase as you said was in the first quarter and i think it s safe to assume that the market average price for the broad basket of materials we buy was probably up in the low to mid single digits in the first quarter we expect to see that moderate as we go into the second quarter not to say second quarter couldn t be inflationary but it will be lower inflation than we saw in the first by the time we get in the back half it should be deflationary truman andrew patterson wells fargo securities analyst okay ok thank you and just a follow up real quick if i m reading you correctly with propylene and ethylene still being down year over year are you saying that there might be a chance that your oil derived resins might be down in the back half of the year robert j wells senior vice president corporate communications and public affairs there s a chance they stepped up sharply mid year last year and while we are not back to below the level they were prior to june last year after as we annualized that move up in mid year there s a chance they ll be down year over year in the back half truman andrew patterson wells fargo securities analyst yeah okay thank you robert j wells senior vice president corporate communications and public affairs thank you operator thank you the next question is from the line of ghansham panjabi with baird please proceed with your question ghansham panjabi robert w baird analyst hi guys good morning john in your prepared comments you referenced strong backlogs to the customer level for the americas group can you give us some more color on that which vertical in particular had a stronger backlog what feedback specifically are customers giving you in current market conditions especially as interest progress lower throughout the quarter john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yeah ghansham i d say that we re really excited about the balance of the year because of the feedback that we re getting across all the verticals all the segments we ve obviously have a terrific model in this controlled distribution where we re able to really keep our fingers on the pulse of the customer and the feedback that we re getting has been pretty universal as i mentioned earlier it s solid across the geographies and the segments so we re feeling very good about the balance of the year obviously get into a little bit of a slower start than we would like to have seen but still feeling really good about where we re headed ghansham panjabi robert w baird analyst okay and then just on consumer brands you mentioned that you re very well positioned across all the north american retail channels can you also expand on that do you think that channel itself will improve in 2019 versus the past couple of years or is that your specific positioning post the share shift that you are particularly excited about thanks john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer well i think our customers should hold us accountable to help them improve their results we want to work with our customers and help them reach their goals so we continue to work with those partners working to drive their success and we do that by helping to ensure that our products are consistent and the high quality the brands are strong that we have the right relationships in the right channels with the right assortment allows us to bring that value to the customers that we have and the consumers that they serve and each one of those customers offer a unique opportunity growth and we re making sure that we re aligning our people our resources everything that we have to help them reach their goals so we want to help those customers outpace the market ghansham panjabi robert w baird analyst thank you robert j wells senior vice president corporate communications and public affairs thanks ghansham operator thank you our next question is from the line of robert koort with goldman sachs please proceed with your question robert andrew koort goldman sachs group inc analyst thanks john or al when you guys talked initially about your synergies from integrating valspar you mentioned that some of those manufacturing maybe would be a little longer tail can you give us an update on the progress there and what s left to come allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah bob we re still working through it by region as we talked about the longer tail on those is predominantly in the industrial space which are more complicated and take longer to get done i would say there are amounts in our 415 million run rate that we talked about coming out of this year but we ll get those fine tuned here in the next quarter or two and try to give more color around those as we go forward this year john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer and bob i know you and i have talked about this to some degree our goal is certainly to attack those synergies but we re not going to do it at the cost of a customer the goal is not to get just the cost out we want to become more efficient no question about it but we re taking our time to make sure that we re taking the right steps and as these synergies roll in we want to make sure that it s a more favorable experience for our customers and put our salespeople in a better position to serve those customers robert andrew koort goldman sachs group inc analyst can i ask your lowe s business now you re the single line paint supplier there can you talk about how that makes you a better supplier the paint oil better at lowe s having sort of a uniform or unified supply strategy there john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer sure it ensures the terrific alignment that i touched on earlier we are looking at a collaborative view of how do we help our customer reach their goals and so the sharing of information and the tactics that we use are certainly in line with their goals and it allows us to have more open dialogue with how to best help them reach those goals and so there s a lot of momentum there is a terrific leadership team that is driven to improve those results and we want to make sure that our resources are in line with the goals that they have robert andrew koort goldman sachs group inc analyst thanks allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah thanks bob operator thank you our next question is from the line of steve byrne with bank of america please proceed with your question steve byrne bank of america merrill lynch analyst yes thank you bob you were talking about your outlook for second half raw material costs potentially being down year over year does that conviction come from your purchasing costs for raws today being down year over year that will flow through cogs in the next couple of quarters robert j wells senior vice president corporate communications and public affairs yeah that s part of it steve that we ve been building inventory with lower cost petrochemical raws part of it is the lag that our suppliers have in passing through lower cost feedstocks and those feedstocks working their way through the acrylic chain and i d say probably the latter point is most of it steve byrne bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay and john you mentioned that some of your contractor customers have what you described as unseasonably high backlog other than maybe a break in the last six months worth of weather is there anything else that that you could see holding them back from accelerating the execution of that backlogs such as access to the labor john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer well labor is clearly a piece of that no question about it and i think the first the projects aren t going to go away i mean it s a robust bidding market right now so there s a great deal of confidence on the part of our customers and i d say to your point about the labor we look at this as the opportunity for us to shine to our customers as they get under more pressure to serve their customers the model that we have the products that we have the service that we provide the alignment that we can reach with our customers becomes more valuable to those customers so our opportunity to help them be more successful so while it s a challenge for many of our customers from a volume standpoint they become more dependent on us and we like that we like to demonstrate what we can do and how we can help them be more successful steve byrne bank of america merrill lynch analyst thank you john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer thanks steve operator thank you our next question is from the line of nishu sood with deutsche bank please proceed with your question nishu sood deutsche bank analyst thank you thinking about the sales outlook for the year the 4 to 7 with 2 in the first quarter and between 2 and 5 i understand that obviously there s some comps issue in the later start to the painting season you mentioned the backlogs obviously in the prior question in earlier in your comments obviously is giving you confidence what else can you kind of describe for us in terms your what gives you the confidence to get to that 4 to 7 range for the year for example trends in april have they has the construction season gotten off to a more robust start with the later start or perhaps later in march just if you could kind of give us a little bit more color please on the outlook allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer hey nishu sood the start to april is inline with the sales guidance we gave and we talked about 2 to 5 with our north american stores being not only at the high end but above the high end and we feel good about that guidance as far as the second half you got to remember that our first half has its toughest comps performance coatings did 9 8 in the first quarter 11 in the second quarter so we re going up against the 10 quarter our store comps were 6 8 last year and our second quarter and as you know our second half tailed off so if you look at comparisons of mid almost high single digits in the first half and low single digits in the second half the other thing i would talk about some of the headwinds that we re facing in our first half will start to annualize and it s the exited business in the us that will annualize it s the guardsmen divestiture and even some of the tariff impacts that we saw in our industrial businesses and then the final piece of that is our fx year over year comparison gets easier in the second half we are basically neutral in the first half on fx last year and over 1 and so now we re saying we re going to be a little bit over 2 or a little bit over 2 in the first quarter that ll be a little bit below 2 because of seasonality but then in the second half we have easier comps so it s a grouping of many things that goes into our confidence in the second half john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yeah i d like to add to that if i could nishu i think your question is a good one about the confidence of our customers and i think al talked about a lot of really good points there a few others that i d like to expand on one is we re not waiting for things to happen here and we don t open our doors and hope people come in we re very aggressive and active in trying to grow our business and while our customers are confident with their pipeline we also hedge our bets in making sure that we have growth so we ve talked over the last couple of years about our share of wallet initiatives as well as our new account activity we ve been very aggressive over the first quarter really driving those activities inside our stores so we re excited about not only what will happen from our existing customers but the opportunity to grow in both new account and share of wallets start with second the investments that we re making give us a lot of confidence in new stores and new reps new products i mean we want to keep pushing that pipeline full of reasons for customers to continue to switch to sherwin williams we want to make it easier for our employees to be in front of those customers with something to increase the value proposition and then finally if you look at the other pieces of the businesses consumer benefits we think are strong as we get better alignment with our customers and we believe that we talked a lot about lowe s and we re excited about that and we believe there s a lot of opportunity but there s a lot of opportunity with our other customers in those segments as well and on the pcg side i mean those businesses coming together with terrific synergies and products people relationships specifications it s hard for us to look at any one piece of our business and not be excited about the balance of the year nishu sood deutsche bank analyst got it thanks for all the details focusing in on the consumer brands group if you factor out the guardsman divestiture and currency the 4 call it organic sales growth you saw there and i m not including obviously the inventory loaded in 3q it s the strongest quarter you have there in a while and especially with the late start to the painting season and the weakness overseas it implies just a really nice result in north america there are there any one off factors that might kind of temper the enthusiasm a little bit about the potential there was there some reloading ahead of the spring season just anything that might have boosted what looks like a pretty strong result in north america john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer for the most nishu no it s hard to draw that line at the end of the quarter to say which in any one year might fall on one side of the line or the other but the way you ve asked your question is much easier to answer there s nothing that we can point to you to say this happened this year versus last year we think to your point the team is executing we re implementing a good strategy but we still are very excited about what s ahead of us as well nishu sood deutsche bank analyst okay thank you robert j wells senior vice president corporate communications and public affairs thanks nishu operator thank you our next question is from the line of vincent andrews of morgan stanley please proceed with your question steven haynes morgan stanley analyst hi this is actually steve haynes on for vincent just wondering if you guys can maybe just elaborate a little bit more on your titanium dioxide pricing outlook this year and whether you re thinking that maybe after a sustained period of inventory destocking whether or not the coatings industry goals maybe need to restock in the back half thanks robert j wells senior vice president corporate communications and public affairs yeah we ll see to what extent the softness in demand over the last quarter or two has been destocking versus just a slowdown in demand particularly outside in north america we think demand remains pretty robust in north america it is likely the tightest tio2 market if you look across the regions and i think the pricing reflects that the pricing in tio2 has been relatively stable over the last couple of quarters that s our expectation going forward it s not to say that we re not going to see pricing announcements but unless you see the supply demand balance tighten meaningfully from here i m not sure to what extent any future pricing in that announcements are going to get traction our outlook is for stable relatively stable pricing over the balance of the year steven haynes morgan stanley analyst okay thank you robert j wells senior vice president corporate communications and public affairs sure thank you operator thank you our next question is from the line of don carson with susquehanna financials please proceed with your question donald david carson susquehanna financial group analyst thank you bob just a question on your outlook for the architectural paint market in north america both what you saw as growth in 2018 what you think could happen in 2019 and a particular question is we ve seen a lot of strength in remodeling in the last few years that appears to be slowing and i know harvard was out recently calling for much more of a slowing in 2019 so do you agree with that outlook and if so what would be the implications for the us architectural paint market and your growth robert j wells senior vice president corporate communications and public affairs good question don as a reminder at where we stand right now from an industry standpoint more than 80 of gallon volume in the industry is going into the repaint markets both residential and non residential so it is what will drive industry volume over the foreseeable future we think it s an over simplification to assume that turnover is the only driver of remodeling activity in fact if you look at all the historical drivers of us remodeling activity only one and albeit an important one that is existing home turnover has stalled over the last 12 months to 18 months the others including aging housing stock home value appreciation strong employment backdrop consumer confidence et cetera remain intact and i d argue a lot of those are getting stronger the other kind of difference in this cycle is in recent years there have been some unique non traditional factors driving demand for remodeling for example the baby boomers decision at least up to this point to age in place baby boomers represent about a third of owner occupied households but over the last couple of years have accounted for about 50 of the remodeling spend and we re not seeing that slow down at least there s no indication that that s slowing down as i mentioned in my previous comments on the housing market in general the conversion of single family rentals and vacant homes back to owner occupied we ve actually seen a reversal in the rate of home ownership that it s been declining or stagnant for years now we re seeing it start to tick back up as those rental the single family rentals are being absorbed by owners and it s important to note that the roughly 3 million housing units that went from rental or vacant to owner occupied over the last couple years on average are in higher disrepair than an existing home transaction would generally be and therefore require more remodeling and higher spend per unit than a typical existing home transaction and so our conclusion is absent a recession these factors are going to continue to drive growth and remodeling spend at higher rates than overall growth in the housing market and it s true that harvard has lowered their outlook for 2019 but we re still above 5 remodeling spend and we also believe that you re likely to see kind of a shift away from high ticket which has been driving a lot of the remodeling spend over the last few years to lower ticket which primarily is painting and decorating john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer don i d only add a couple of seconds here we ve had five years of double digit compounded growth in our res repaint business we believe we re uniquely positioned to capitalize on the paint portion of that remodel opportunity in a scenario of focus for us it s likely one of the largest opportunities we have as a company and so we re very excited about the opportunity in this space donald david carson susquehanna financial group analyst thank you robert j wells senior vice president corporate communications and public affairs thanks don operator thank you the next question is coming from the line of scott mushkin with wolfe research please proceed with your question scott andrew mushkin wolfe research analyst hey guys thanks for taking my questions i actually had two first i wanted to get your thoughts on wins i know local and regional builders and property managers are something you guys been focused on so i just want an update there and then my second question is as we look at the year to get at the high end of your plan or maybe even above what would you think it would drive that so a two part question thanks john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer so on the first piece scott when you talk about wins i m assuming it s all about winning businesses is that what you re referencing there scott andrew mushkin wolfe research analyst yes john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yeah so coming into the year we ve on the new residential side we ve now reached 18 of the top 20 new residential builders so that was up one of the top 20 in the last i think it was in the late third or fourth quarter was still pushing very hard on the large builders but we re also very focused on the regional builder and we re doing quite well there as well on property management it s been a terrific focus of our team in the americas group and we re uniquely qualified here as you would expect with our platforms to distribute product and fulfill the needs of these customers on a national basis so there s good progress there our numbers in the property management area are very similar in ratios of wins of the top 20 for property management as they are in new residential allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer scott i d say that to get to the high end of the range it s really the level of north america paint stores volume but i would also say on north america volume across consumer and performance coatings it s still by far the largest segment we have or geography we have and now to dictate where we fall into the range scott andrew mushkin wolfe research analyst thanks guys appreciate it john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer thank you scott operator thank you our next question is from the line of duffy fischer with barclays please proceed with your question mike leithead barclays bank plc analyst hey guys it s mike leithead on for duffy this morning first in north america your paint stores i was hoping regionally you could give us some sort of sense of the magnitude of delta between your best and worst region i guess i m just trying to get a sense of how hit the midwest was from a demand standpoint because of some of the weather activities there john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yeah just a second i ll look at that here i would say that the well i ll say it this way that the midwest and the southwest were hit pretty hard in the year the delta i don t know that we re going to share that information we all look at each other like we don t share that information mike leithead barclays bank plc analyst fair enough john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yeah go ahead i m sorry mike leithead barclays bank plc analyst and then second question just on raw materials versus volumes it seems like most people anticipate coatings volumes to accelerate in the second half of the year yeah raw material inflation is expected to stay relatively flat or even i think maybe potentially come down like you were saying earlier bob i guess is there any concern that if demand picks up there may be inflationary pressure on raw mats or are there other factors that hold raw materials back from that robert j wells senior vice president corporate communications and public affairs well first mike to be clear our growth outlook for the back half of the year doesn t necessarily we re not necessarily expecting industry volume to inflect at the same rate we think industry volume was a little subdued in the first quarter but our expectation to accelerate growth in the second quarter and especially in the back half is more pertains more to our business than it does to the industry you re absolutely right if we see a strong pickup in industry volume it s likely to tighten some markets for raw materials that s a high quality problem mike leithead barclays bank plc analyst got it thanks guys robert j wells senior vice president corporate communications and public affairs thank you operator thank you our next question is from the line of arun viswanathan with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question arun shankar viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst thanks good morning guys john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer good morning arun arun shankar viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst just on that point on the volumes just curious on your comp performance in q1 versus your own expectations and how you see that progressing through the year assuming that the comp on the volume side was in the 1 to 2 range could that accelerate as we go through the year i m just curious just given that there has been changes in q1 and q4 seem to be not as weak versus q2 and q3 in years past thanks john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yeah arun low single digit gallon growth that we realized in our first quarter was softer than we were expecting and when you look at our second quarter sales guidance that 2 to 5 and our paint stores at above that range it tells you that we re going to see accelerating volume in the second quarter and we would expect that similar cadence going up against the weaker second half allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer got it but just in conversations with our customers i mean they re very clear about their inability to get to that painting phase on the projects that they re on so these projects are there they re eager to get to them we expect that they will be and we re looking forward to serving them arun shankar viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst thanks and just as a follow up very strong margins in consumer the other two were a little bit i guess lighter but from your own kind of vantage points if you do see this volume kind of improve do you expect a material improvement in your margins in both segments and especially on the gross line as well thanks john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yeah i d say in consumer group part of the improvement we saw in our operating margin was good tight cost control that that team has been exhibiting throughout the past year and with realizing synergies their gross margin was actually flat year over year so they had have had to implement pricing and as we get volume to that group i would expect margin expansion the level of the sequential margin expansion will depend on volume the 69 ph was a pretty sizable quarter on performance coatings i would say we re very happy with the progress we re making on our operating margin our core operating margin being up 30 basis points we saw the team is making good progress on pricing and again there the synergy realization in there and when you talk about it sequentially i just want to be clear that s a volume issue and if you look at our sequential gross margins they were actually up so we re making good progress we have a lot of confidence in our medium term operating margin targets of high teens to low 20s allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah i d say that the performance coatings group s efforts in this area of pricing and margin really has been terrific those prices continue to roll into the first quarter our efforts are going to continue throughout the year so to al s point we re pleased with the consumer side but we re really excited about the performance coatings margins we expect those to continue arun shankar viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst great thanks and just a quick follow up if i can on the m a front having just discussed your priorities for buybacks versus m a have you seen any kind of bolt ons emerged that are attractive to you and if so which areas would those be in and if not would all the excess cash i guess go toward buybacks thanks john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yeah i ll take the first piece arun we are looking business by business and we often talk about our approach to our m a is driven by business units so we look by business then by geography to understand if there are voids that we should be pursuing and to us we re not trying to be everything to everyone everywhere we re really determined on executing our strategy and taking a very disciplined approach to that we have increased amount of activity we re engaged in a number of potential targets and we re excited about the stage that we are in given the integration of valspar and how some of these might be nice bolt ons to our businesses robert j wells senior vice president corporate communications and public affairs yeah and as we talked about on our year end call in 2019 we re getting back to our historical cadence of capital allocation and we talked about paying down 600 million of debt 300 million of that is long term that comes due in june the rest will be short term our capex will manage below 2 as you know we raised our dividend over 31 in the first quarter and expect that for the year and then in the first quarter we also bought back 750 000 shares of our stock for 305 million so you look at for the first quarter we returned 410 million to our shareholders that s a 27 increase year over year and you can be assured absent m a we re going to buyback our stock arun shankar viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst thanks robert j wells senior vice president corporate communications and public affairs thanks arun operator thank you our next question is from the line of kevin mccarthy with vertical research partners please proceed with your question kevin william mccarthy vertical research partners analyst yes good morning as a high level question for you regarding your first quarter sales variance you reported 1 9 i think the prior expectation was 2 to 6 and so in explaining that variance i think you called out the slower start in the states and challenging conditions overseas i m just wondering which one of those was more important or whether they were equally important in terms of explaining the variance versus your prior expectation john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer well it s all a matter of which of our business leaders we re talking to so i would tell you that we often talked about the stores business star tag as the engine of the company and so we always point to that model as a terrific model but it truly is the engine of the company and we like to see that engine going a little quicker i mentioned just earlier that from a painting contractors perspective getting that painting phase of many projects in the quarter was a bit of a challenge it s a smaller quarter for us it s a smaller quarter for our painting contractors so i don t think that they plan for perfection in the first quarter because of the volatility in the weather and so they still remain very confident that gives us great confidence and as i mentioned i think we re uniquely positioned to serve those customers so on the architectural side it s very very important on the industrial side when we looked at the comparables there the comps in the first quarter were up 9 8 the second quarter were up 11 so we re in the midst of the toughest comparison for both these businesses from a comp standpoint then it breaks down quite a bit down into the 4 range in the back half of the year meanwhile we re continuing with our efforts and the momentum of growing our new accounts the share wallet and on the industrial side gaining ground as well so architectural is important the industrial is right behind it but all of them important in our future growth kevin william mccarthy vertical research partners analyst okay that s helpful and then second i want to ask you about the packaging coatings business i think that i heard you say that it grew sales directionally any color with regard to volume price and the outlook for the balance of the year there would be helpful john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yeah we have a terrific team in our packaging business terrific technology unique technology i would tell you that globally our packaging was up in the mid single digits in and they were up in every region that we participate in so we ve got good momentum and we feel as though this is something that s only going to continue kevin william mccarthy vertical research partners analyst thank you so much robert j wells senior vice president corporate communications and public affairs thanks kevin operator thank you our next question is from the line of dmitry silversteyn with buckingham research group please proceed with your question robert j wells senior vice president corporate communications and public affairs dmitry operator dmitry your line is live you may proceed with your questions thank you we ll move onto our next question which is coming from line of justin speer with zelman associates please proceed with your question justin a speer zelman associates analyst hi thanks i just had a few questions first starting out with the americas group can you walk through the monthly trends in the quarter and then also to speak to maybe how things are shaping up into april 4 for that overall business and tag robert j wells senior vice president corporate communications and public affairs yeah i think if you look at the i ll start with april as i said earlier it s inline with our guidance of the 2 to 5 what stores gain at slightly above that range the first quarter i would just say january was strong and february and march were softer justin a speer zelman associates analyst okay so should we expect within that kind of the mapping of your guidance should we expect pricing power within this business to change from that 2 5 cadence as we look to the balance of the year or is it that 2 5 a good good one to think about robert j wells senior vice president corporate communications and public affairs i think it gets a little bit better as we go forward i mean we ve talked about the effectiveness improving over a nine month period and that still holds today justin a speer zelman associates analyst okay in terms of the segment margins and thinking about looking to the second quarter that the idea of you being maybe at or above the high end of that 2 to 5 growth ambition the implications for the second quarter and margins for tag you expect that that now flips the positive year over year as you look to 2q and then obviously the back half is going to be probably much better but 2q positive on a year over year basis robert j wells senior vice president corporate communications and public affairs yeah it s just that way i m not going to start giving guidance by segment but as my earlier comments with the demand outlook and the pricing that we just talked about we expect to see margin expansion in the year john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yeah to reach our 13 5 increased eps it s baked in there robert j wells senior vice president corporate communications and public affairs we need to that s right justin a speer zelman associates analyst sure sure okay and then flipping switching gears to the performance coatings business for that the intermediate term plan and in specific it s a 2020 margin plan that high teens below 20 target by 2020 how much of that is under your control be the pricing levers or the synergies and how much of market growth you re going to need and the reason i ask that is just as i m looking at this international market means fairly sluggish can you still get to that destination by 2020 from here because i think when i look at all the different businesses this is the one that s the furthest part so i just wanted to put that to you and see what your thoughts are there robert j wells senior vice president corporate communications and public affairs yeah justin first we re going to give you an update on our 2020 guidance at our investor day in june but we believe we have a number of factors that are in our control that help drive you to that target one is volume and new account growth the product innovation that john talked about the movement in v70 on the packaging side we still have opportunities for synergies within that group and both consumer brands with the majority of them being more focused toward performance coatings as we get into product reformulations in raw material changes in it and then we get into facilities that we talked about earlier so i think there s a number of things that are in our control that allow us to move toward that target how quickly we get there is to be determined justin a speer zelman associates analyst understood lastly for me in just terms of the consumer brands was there any load in benefit versus the prior year because i believe that the announcement was in february last year where you had a sizable win a notable win at a large customer was there any load in benefit or tailwind year over year from that customer win that graduated into the quarter john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yeah i think just the normal ramping up for us as the season i don t think there was anything dramatic or different for the most part justin justin a speer zelman associates analyst so that s fully annualized i guess you ve anniversaried all of that tailwind there s no more to come going forward in terms of just the apples and oranges benefit from that customer win robert j wells senior vice president corporate communications and public affairs no i d say that we from an annualization standpoint we had a little bit coming in q2 the lion s share of that will be in q3 from a comparison standpoint justin a speer zelman associates analyst okay perfect perfect okay well thank you very much appreciate it robert j wells senior vice president corporate communications and public affairs thanks justin operator thank you the next question is from the line of dmitry silversteyn with buckingham research group please proceed with your question dmitry silversteyn the buckingham research group analyst hello operator dmitry your line is live dmitry silversteyn the buckingham research group analyst could you hear me now john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yeah dmitry dmitry silversteyn the buckingham research group analyst all right perfect thank you stick my call again i just wanted to follow up on a couple of sort of items outstanding first of all in your americas business your latin american group given the high teens declines in foreign exchange was that a positive operating performance quarter for the group or not so much robert j wells senior vice president corporate communications and public affairs both the top line and bottom line would have been dilutive year over year dmitry silversteyn the buckingham research group analyst so you lost all the money on the ebit line there as well okay i m just trying to understand that the just kind of the old paint store group and seeing how well it done it did secondly in terms of european and asia pacific demand environment particularly for the industrial part of the business short of comps getting easier in the back end of the year is there anything that you can see or are seeing or we can point to in other words what would it take for the results there to get better at a macro level and what is it that you re doing in addition to that to make sure you deliver the growth that you expect to deliver in the back end of the year robert j wells senior vice president corporate communications and public affairs yes so you re talking about specifically europe with this question dmitry dmitry silversteyn the buckingham research group analyst europe and asia pacific yeah robert j wells senior vice president corporate communications and public affairs okay sure so in europe you re right overall there was some softness there as i mentioned we did see packaging up in every region so they were up in europe and we believe in europe we have some really terrific teams that are coming together and general industrial and our industrial wood businesses as well as our protective and marine capabilities so our goal there is to really start capitalizing on the combined company and the synergies that result from these two companies coming together al mentioned earlier about some of the synergies some of that comes in the way of cost savings but we re also anxious to do is to begin transferring the technology over there and that s beginning now but it certainly offers a terrific opportunity going forward in asia again overall a soft market some of that was the result of the implications of trade where we saw our industrial wood business under tremendous pressure as more and more companies grappled with the impacts of the implications of the trade issues again our packaging business was up our coil were up was up and both of those were actually up in double digit in asia so good performance there our general industrial offers opportunity there that we re anxious to capitalize on and but we do think the industrial was going to be under some pressure for some time given everything that s going on dmitry silversteyn the buckingham research group analyst okay so it sounds like in you re definitely not looking for any kind of a macro pick up it s basically entirely sort of self help and in terms of asia pacific that the macro environment you re not optimistic at all it sounds like as we go in the second half john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer i think in all these markets with our market share position i mean we ve got terrific opportunities yeah we d like to see the markets improve but in an odd way those grinding markets should position us to do even better and we like to grind we like the opportunity to get in and show that what we bring in solutions and products and services are differentiated so if the market comes that s great if not our teams know our expectations of them we want to grow dmitry silversteyn the buckingham research group analyst great that s a very good answer thank you for that information and last question just in north american market given the little bit of a slow start weather or otherwise in the paint business i noticed particularly in asia there seems to be a little bit more promotional activity as you look across your distribution channels are you having to be a little bit more promotional this year or is it basically business as usual and there s no incremental promotions that are needed to get the volume up john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer no i don t think that there s any significant difference in the promotional activity that s taking place right now we re certainly we don t feel as though that s necessary dmitry silversteyn the buckingham research group analyst okay perfect thank you robert j wells senior vice president corporate communications and public affairs thanks dmitry john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question is coming from the line of garik shmois with longbow research please proceed with your question garik simha shmois longbow research analyst hi thanks and thanks for taking my question just want to clarify on the volume ramp for the rest of the year i think there was a comment that was made that you expect to outpace the industry just want to be clear is this a broad based comment across businesses or is this targeting tag in particular john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer well we certainly believe that our tag business has positioned to outpace the market we ve talked about that for many years and the fact this year that we ve got the new stores new products everything that we have going we re really excited about this year s season in fact not only just everything from an investment and resource standpoint but the activity that our teams have demonstrated in this additional area that we ve talked about and i think may not be valued as much as we value by some of our investors which is the new account activity and share of wallet so we absolutely see a terrific ramp to outpace the market in our stores business outside of that when you say just limited to our stores i jokingly made the comment earlier it depends on who inside our company we re talking to but i say that tongue in cheek because the reality is when we sit and talk with everyone of our businesses and we review the opportunities it really is very exciting to talk about some of the things that were on the verge on the line trials that were on the promotional or the programs that we re working on with our customers so we think we have a foot in the right direction and everyone of these businesses and let s not to say there won t be challenges but we feel really good about where we are and where we re headed garik simha shmois longbow research analyst okay thanks and my follow up question is just as you think of the new store openings going from 15 in q1 to the 90 to 100 for the full year how should that track the rest of the way and are there any support costs or staffing costs that could be lumpy that we should be aware of john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes for the many many years we ve been opening stores at 90 to 100 we will open 15 in the first quarter and then we will open 35 ish in the fourth quarter and the rest find their way in the second and third quarters third and fourth and there s no lumpiness to the expense that you would expect garik simha shmois longbow research analyst okay thank you john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer thanks garik operator thank you our next question is from the line of chuck cerankosky with northcoast research please proceed with your question charles edward cerankosky northcoast research partners analyst good morning everyone john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer good morning chuck charles edward cerankosky northcoast research partners analyst i want to switch subject a little bit the deferred pension asset dropped more than 200 year over year and al could you give us the implications what that means to earnings per share and cash flows going forward and even what happened to cash flows in the first quarter as the annuities were purchased and how it impacted the financial statements please allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer sure the annuity purchase came out the defined benefit plans it did not impact the net operating cash that were reported that really was the net operating cash impact was really an increase in our working capital primarily architectural inventory to get ready for the spring selling season to make sure we re servicing our customers at a very very high level the impact of the pension settlement and annuity we took 32 4 million hit that s in other income and expense if it allowed us to monetize the over funded pension plan that we had and it s a little over the 200 million in cash that we now have available to us to fund our defined contribution pension plan in which we use 65 million in february to fund that contribution so going forward that allows us another good three or four years where instead of the company having to outlay cash we ll use that money that came out of that db plan charles edward cerankosky northcoast research partners analyst all right great thank any way to put al an annual eps number on that would it benefits john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yeah we haven t chuck i mean it s not material it s baked into our guidance and not material year over year to call out so we didn t charles edward cerankosky northcoast research partners analyst all right thank you best of luck over the rest of 2019 john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer thank you robert j wells senior vice president corporate communications and public affairs thanks chuck operator thank you our next question is from the line of p j juvekar with citi please proceed with your question p j juvekar citigroup inc analyst yeah hi thank you for taking my questions when you look at your business how much of your paint is order online and who is ordering online is it mostly contractors or diy customers can you just talk about sort of online purchases of paint john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yeah it s a relatively small percentage of our purchases and it s nearly all professional contractors that are using that we do have p j a program that s continuing to ramp up in the area of this e commerce to allow customers to do more business with us you will see areas that we re testing in different parts of the country and we would expect over the not too distant future to conduct more business over the internet but we don t want to we want to enhance we don t replace our stores we want to enhance the service and the capabilities of our stores and our reps through e commerce and we believe this is going to be a terrific tool that allow our customers to get the most out of the resources that we bring to the table p j juvekar citigroup inc analyst okay thank you would you say it s less than 5 today john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yeah p j juvekar citigroup inc analyst okay and then one last question you didn t talk much about valspar s industrial business particularly the big machinery business with cat and deere i was wondering what s going on in that business and what trends you are seeing thank you john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer and so the questions ph multiple speakers i d say overall our business there is doing well we again have a lot of respect for these customers we re working hard to bring more solutions to them i d say this was an area that when you look at the combination of our companies both technical organizations we re working on opportunities to enhance features of the product to help our customers one company had solved one area of an issue and the other one had supplied another and when we got our technical teams together we ve really found an opportunity to enhance what we believe to be is a terrific solution for those customers but also that might be expandable into other areas as well so it s an exciting part of our business one that we expect to continue to grow p j juvekar citigroup inc analyst thank you robert j wells senior vice president corporate communications and public affairs thanks p j operator thank you our next question is coming from the line of greg melich with evercore isi please proceed with your question gregory scott melich evercore isi analyst hi thanks i m trying to keep it brief just want to make sure i got the pricing dynamic right it s 2 5 was the pricing mix in the americas group comp if we looked at performance coatings should we assume that the price realized was something north of that maybe 3 5 or 4 if my back out math is correct and i had a follow up for al robert j wells senior vice president corporate communications and public affairs greg i d say the way that pricing rolls in is more choppy than our stores that i talked about and i would say it s not quite that high gregory scott melich evercore isi analyst yeah but it wouldn t be just it would be higher than i m just looking at the math if i add back the fx for north america to have grown 4 there must have been more price in performance coatings than in americas group or robert j wells senior vice president corporate communications and public affairs i would say it s a similar amount and our volume was up low single digits in performance coatings gregory scott melich evercore isi analyst all right fair that s what i was looking for and then second on the guidance for the full year could you remind us what the tax rate you guys are using for that as the midpoint or in a range and then link that to the buyback as well i mean you had more buyback than we had at least in the first quarter do you look at that 300 million this first quarter is sort of a new higher level of run rate or just given where the share price was more opportunistic if you think about the full year robert j wells senior vice president corporate communications and public affairs yeah the tax rate and i ll talk to the core tax rate we expect to be in the low 20 obviously we re a little bit lower than that in the first quarter but comparable with last year because of the favorable impact you get on stock comp is heavier in the first quarter just historically there s been more options exercised than you we have some vesting of our issues as far as the share buybacks i think we are going to be opportunistic and we were in the first quarter with where we saw our stock price i think you had done the math on free cash flow on our last call and got a little bit higher directionally than i would have been i think your number was 800 million to 1 billion and so i might be a little bit lower than that but it s going to depend on the m a activity and how that unfolds throughout the year that it will determine how much we ultimately buy gregory scott melich evercore isi analyst and so it sounds like for purposes of guidance you re still assuming maybe a couple million shares for the year not 3 million or 4 million robert j wells senior vice president corporate communications and public affairs that s fair gregory scott melich evercore isi analyst okay thanks a lot good luck guys thanks john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer thanks greg operator thank you our next question is from the line of eric bosshard with cleveland research company please proceed with your question eric your line is live you may proceed with your question thank you we will move on to our next question which is coming in the line of mike harrison with seaport global please proceed with your question rosemarie jeanne pitras morbelli g research analyst hi good morning wanted to ask a couple of questions on the lowe s business specifically about the bottom line contribution that you saw in q1 and what you re expecting in q2 can you just talk about how that played out compared to your expectations and are the costs related to that lowe s business where you want them at this point robert j wells senior vice president corporate communications and public affairs yeah mike i had a respect for all our customers we don t want to comment on any individual customer impact on our results now as far as the costs go we did lay out the fact that we were going to take a 50 million charge and about 40 of that was one time so that remaining 30 million if you will is spread pretty evenly out through the fourth quarter of 19 rosemarie jeanne pitras morbelli g research analyst all right and then one of your competitors that serves the diy market sounded a little bit more optimistic about trends in diy wondering if you share that view and if so what do you think is generating some of that improvement john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer well we re certainly positive about the space we think that as i mentioned earlier working with our partners to drive their success is important our view is that we re providing customers the brands and the quality of product that can help separate them from our or align them with their customers i will say that during that process we always are making sure that we have the right relationships and that we re in the right channels and with the right assortments with the right customers so that review is something that s ongoing and something that we work very hard on once those decisions are made and we work really hard to align ourselves and put our customers in the best position to win michael joseph harrison seaport global securities analyst all right and last question i had i was just wondering john if you can comment on the recent personnel changes i know you promoted david sewell to coo and then made some changes at the top of performance coatings and consumer is this just moving people up the ladder or does it suggest some more significant changes going on strategically at the top of those two segments john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer no i think if you look historically mike at the company i think it s 27 of the last 32 years we ve had a chief operating officer the company is we have we have strong expectations and we want to grow we want to grow fast and i believe david sewell a wonderful talented leader that can help us accomplish our goals aaron erter into our performance coatings is i think a tribute to the commitment that we have in identifying talent and making sure that they have the experiences to continue to develop rob lynch back filling aaron erter i mean i can go down the list i mean we work really hard at developing a strong depth of talent to be able to execute what it is that we re trying to do but what we re trying to do is grow and my belief in having a coo is specifically targeted at helping us to drive our business with more speed michael joseph harrison seaport global securities analyst all right thanks very much john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer thanks mike operator thank you our next question is from the line of rosemarie morbelli with g research please proceed with your question rosemarie jeanne pitras morbelli g research analyst good afternoon everyone and thank you for taking my question i was wondering if you could give us an update on the refinishing could you give us some details on the trends whether it is in north america and in international markets john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes i d say refinishing in north america rosemary was a relatively soft market and i d say that that we are kind of floating right with the market and that doesn t bode well for us as you would expect our expectations for our teams are not to run with the market so we feel as though we re positioned well we ve got some new technology that we think can help to expedite the efforts that we have we ve got a it s oddly enough another opportunity of the synergies of the two companies come together we have an ultra k ultra 9k technology that s a waterborne technology that we believe is a wonderful quality product great color helps in productivity all the levers that you would look at for vehicle refinish and so while our performance in the first quarter reflected kind of what we see in the market not only in north america i would say around the world for the most part our expectations for this team going forward will be to outperform the market we feel we re holding our own i guess would be the answer rosemarie jeanne pitras morbelli g research analyst so with everyone texting and teenagers doing all of that at the wheel of a truck why do you think the demand is so slow i am assuming you are counting on accidents in order to grow that particular business john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer we don t like when you frame it exactly that way but there are distracted drivers that certainly have some impact on it i d say that there s a general softness in the market and where we believe that there are opportunities for this business and so overall i think collisions industry wide we re down in the low single digits but again when i look at our market share opportunities there are growth opportunities for us and that s what we re working with our teams to capture rosemarie jeanne pitras morbelli g research analyst so even with ai causing cars to stop by itself even if someone is distracted at the wheel you still think that with the market decline you can still gain share and grow john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yeah and part of that comes to what i talked about earlier as far as the technology though all of this creates pressure in a segment and that pressure forces people to find better solutions to what it is that they re trying to do there are going to be some accidents out there and so if you look at the opportunity to help those customers whose business might be under pressure because of everything that you ve just described those customers are going to be looking for solutions that help them do their what they want to do more profitably we think we can help our customers accomplish that goal by bringing them the solutions to win rosemarie jeanne pitras morbelli g research analyst okay that is very helpful and if i could just have one last question in terms of china and the demand which obviously had slowed down because of tariffs but seems to be picking up in terms of domestic demand would that be helping are you seeing it first of all and is it mostly in your wood business that you would see it if it is occurring john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer well part of that has to do with the focus of our businesses i would say that we re looking more into that domestic business rosemary but it s not been the primary area of our focus so while we re looking to grow in those areas that speaks more to the point i made earlier about the fact that given our market share and the opportunities to grow that we need to always be looking for those opportunities regardless of what s happened in the market we ve not been traditionally solely focused on one area but we ve been more focused on the export of products than we have been the domestic market and so that gives us a terrific opportunity to grow forward in the future rosemarie jeanne pitras morbelli g research analyst got it thank you very much robert j wells senior vice president corporate communications and public affairs thanks rosemary operator thank you it appears we have no further questions at this time so i d like to pass the floor back over to mr wells for any additional concluding comments robert j wells senior vice president corporate communications and public affairs thank you jessie i d like to thank you all for joining us on this my last quarterly earnings call it s been my pleasure working

omers from capital loss during a period of market stress in 2018 our smoothed funded ratio increased by two percentage points to 96 reflecting improvement for the sixth consecutive year on a fair value basis the funded ratio declined by four percentage points from 101 to 97 as the net return was below the discount rate of 6 we undertook a rigorous assessment of the challenges that will influence the long term health of omers providing an opportunity for further dialogue on the risks facing our plan in 2018 we made progress toward our 2020 strategy we deployed 10 billion in private market assets in pursuit of our asset mix targets we directly engaged our stakeholders on the challenges facing our plan based largely on the feedback received the sc board made two changes that will address issues of fairness and equity we opened a new investment office in singapore to support our objective of gradual deployment of capital into higher growth asia pacific markets member satisfaction remained high at 91 since the first year of our 2020 strategy in 2015 our investment teams have generated 4 1 billion of net returns above our discount rate net assets have grown by 20 billion to 97 billion we have reduced our discount rate by 0 25 to 6 three years ahead of the schedule set out in the strategy the caisse and omers recently published their 2018 annual report since i already went through their respective results here and here i wanted to follow up and go over their annual reports to highlight some key investments and other noteworthy topics let me begin with the caisse last week it published its 2018 annual report and put out a detailed press release going over the main highlights yesterday i went over 2019 s most responsible investors and discussed why canadian pensions are at the forefront of sustainable investing and why the caisse is leading the pack here in canada the caisse s ceo michael sabia has some firm views on doing sustainable investing right and to his credit he has put this as a top priority of the organization and has been very vocal on climate change and why investors need to understand the risks and opportunities it presents now the caisse s 2018 annual report is available here unfortunately it s only available in french for now but the caisse s website states it will soon be available in english here still below i embedded the three most important tables 7 8 and 9 click on images table 7 shows you the performance relative to the benchmark in each asset class fixed income outperformed by 120 basis points last year mostly because the caisse has decent credit exposure where it is overweight see table 9 equities outperformed the benchmark by 320 basis points mostly owing to the stellar results posted by private equity which gained 17 last year real assets real estate and infrastructure posted a combined performance of 9 which is solid table 8 shows how the caisse is increasingly shifting its attention to emerging markets effectively doubling its exposure from 2013 to 2018 from 7 to 14 in that timeframe it also increased its exposure to the united states from 21 to 30 decreased it in canada from 53 to 36 and maintained it in europe 14 why is this important for two reasons first currency gains the annual report states at the end of 2018 the caisse s currency exposure was 55 a gain of 6 since the end of 2017 and it notes that over the last five years and last year the caisse benefitted from exposure to foreign currencies via its investments in public and private markets all over world it doesn t hedge f x exposure second the importance of emerging markets is only going to increase in the coming years i recently covered why the caisse invested in india s financial services industry well it turns out that anita m george executive vice president strategic partnerships growth markets has a huge job at the caisse very impressive lady which is why she figured among the top highest compensated senior managers at the caisse in 2018 click on image anita george s compensation is in indian rupees but it s just shy of 2 million canadian dollars stephane etroy the head of private equity has his compensation in british pounds but he made 3 75 million canadian dollars last year and emmanuel jaclot the evp infrastructure has his compensation published in euros but he made a little over 2 million canadian dollars last year macky tall head of liquid markets and head of cdpq infra earned a total compensation of 2 5 million canadian dollars last year then there s michael sabia the president and ceo lately he has been forced to take some compensation and he earned 3 87 million canadian dollars last year not bad but he s still underpaid relative to his peers in toronto and that isn t right on principle not because he needs or wants it the caisse had stellar results last year relative to most of its peers and yet compensation is still lagging it s gotten a lot better but only after a lot of struggle over the last five years a full discussion on compensation is available in the 2018 annual report and some key highlights on compensation are available in the press release here anyway the key thing to remember when thinking about compensation is long term performance click on image you have to pay up for long term performance and it takes people with a special skill set to deliver solid long term results now let me move to omers and begin with its 2018 highlights click on image and below are the highlights from the 2018 report to members click on image remember omers is a pension plan which still guarantees inflation protection so it is remarkable that it s fully funded 96 is fully funded for all intents and purposes i still maintain it needs to adopt conditional inflation protection like otpp and hoopp to ensure the plan s long term sustainability now you can download omers s 2018 annual report here it is packed with great information so take the time to read it carefully page 8 of the annual report is critical click on image as you can read since launching its 2020 strategy omers has generated 4 1 billion of investment income above its discount rate however in 2018 the plan did not return its absolute return target of 7 3 because of the negative 8 3 return in public equities still the strong performance in private markets private equity real estate and infrastructure and the fixed income exposure buffered the impact of drawdowns in equity markets here is something else worth noting in terms of omers s strategic asset mix click on image unlike the caisse omers is more exposed to the us market 44 but it too is looking to asia for long term growth the annual report contains a good discussion on sustainable investing diversity and inclusion growing responsibly and being committed to their communities the discussion on the funded status is a must read and i note the discount rate remained at 6 0 at the end of 2018 4 0 real net of a strategic margin of 0 25 which was taken prior to 2018 in terms of results i note the following on page 34 of the 2018 annual report click on image again omers shifted out of government bonds and increased its exposure to real assets private equity and credit all part of its long term strategy lastly the summary compensation table available on page 93 of the 2018 annual report click on image as you can see compensation at omers is higher than the caisse but i encourage you read the anual report to get a full discussion on compensation to really understand the details that wraps up my discussion going over the caisse and omers s 2018 annual report i wish they released their annual report at the same time they release their results just like otpp does below bill ford chief executive officer of general atlantic and michael sabia president and chief executive officer of caisse de depot et placement du quebec talk about the role of alternative investments with bloomberg s christine harper at bloomberg invest in new york june 2018 great discussion listen to what michael says in his opening remarks and how they are not just looking at buying assets but building businesses take the time to listen to the entire discussion
