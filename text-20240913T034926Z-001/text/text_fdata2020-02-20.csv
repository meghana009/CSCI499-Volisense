if you want a glimpse of the future head to santiago until recently the chilean capital was the beating heart of an economy lauded for its rapid growth rate and the speedy eradication of poverty a place so successful it was called an economic miracle and made a poster child for development by economists who urged others countries to replicate the chile model yet the city welcomed the new decade with intense protests as millions marched in its streets to protest rising inequality and the unaffordability of daily life this ongoing tumult represents a fall from grace that we need to understand since many other emerging economies are heading down the path first beaten by chile santiago is by far the biggest economic hub in chile with a population of 5 2 million it is home to a third of the chilean population is 10 times the size of the next largest city antofagasta and is the source of almost half of the country s economic output a poor country in the 1970s chile had a national income per person half of that in argentina today national income is almost 14 000 per person the highest in latin america and not far behind greece or portugal reflecting its exceptional performance chile was accepted into the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd in 2010 becoming the first south american country officially to graduate from emerging to developed status the wrinkle in the success story was the fact that with chile s miraculous growth came extreme inequality as well as being the oecd s newest and best performing member chile was also the most unequal economy in the rich world club with huge disparities one popular measure of inequality the share of income going to the best paid tenth of workers rose from 30 in the early 1970s to almost 50 by the late 1990s it has since edged higher meaning that everyone outside the top tenth nine out of 10 people in chile now share less than half of the national income among them on the face of it the
1 management report 1 1 purpose of the ecb s management report the management report is an integral part of the ecb s annual accounts and is designed to provide readers with contextual information related to the financial statements given that the ecb s activities and operations are undertaken in support of its policy objectives the ecb s financial position and result should be viewed in conjunction with its policy actions to this end the management report presents the ecb s key activities and operations as well as their impact on its financial statements furthermore it analyses the main developments in the balance sheet and the profit and loss account during the year and includes information on the ecb s financial resources finally it describes the risk environment in which the ecb operates providing information on the financial and operational risks to which the ecb is exposed and the risk management policies used to mitigate risks 1 2 activities the ecb is part of the eurosystem which has the primary objective of maintaining price stability the ecb s main tasks as described in the statute of the escb comprise the implementation of the monetary policy of the euro area the conduct of foreign exchange operations the management of the official foreign reserves of the euro area countries and the promotion of the smooth operation of payment systems the ecb is also responsible for the effective and consistent functioning of the single supervisory mechanism ssm with a view to carrying out intrusive and effective banking supervision contributing to the safety and soundness of the banking system and the stability of the financial system the eurosystem s monetary policy operations are recorded in the financial statements of the ecb and of the euro area national central banks ncbs reflecting the principle of decentralised implementation of monetary policy in the eurosystem table 1 below provides an overview of the main operations and functions of the ecb in pursuit of its mandate and their impact on the ecb s financial statements table 1 the ecb s key activities and their impact on its financial statements 1 further details on securities lending can be found on the ecb s website 2 further details on target2 can be found on the ecb s website 1 3 financial developments 1 3 1 balance sheet the ecb s balance sheet expanded significantly in the period 2015 2018 due the acquisition of securities under the asset purchase programme app in 2019 the ecb s total assets increased by 10 0 billion to 457 1 billion this increase was mainly due to i the rise in the market value of the ecb s foreign reserve assets owing to the increase in the price of gold and the appreciation of the us dollar and the japanese yen vis Ã  vis the euro during the year and ii the rise in the value of euro banknotes in circulation chart 1 main components of the ecb s balance sheet eur billions source ecb euro denominated securities held for monetary policy purposes constituted 55 of the ecb s total assets as at the end of 2019 under this balance sheet position the ecb holds securities acquired in the context of the securities markets programme smp the three covered bond purchase programmes cbpp1 cbpp2 and cbpp3 the abspp and the pspp during 2019 the ecb fully reinvested the principal payments from maturing securities held in its app portfolios in addition from 1 november 2019 the ecb restarted net purchases of securities under the app on the basis of the governing council s decision of 12 september 2019 on overall monthly eurosystem purchases and subject to predetermined eligibility criteria as at the end of 2019 the portfolio of securities held by the ecb for monetary policy purposes decreased by 1 3 billion to 250 4 billion see chart 2 mainly owing to redemptions of securities held under the smp cbpp1 and cbpp2 the total decrease in these holdings amounted to 2 2 billion the 0 1 billion decrease in the pspp portfolio was mainly due to the net impact of the amortisation of premiums and discounts on securities held in the portfolio which more than offset the net purchases conducted in the last two months of 2019 chart 2 securities held for monetary policy purposes eur billions source ecb in 2019 the total euro equivalent value of the ecb s foreign reserve assets which consist of gold special drawing rights us dollars japanese yen and chinese renminbi increased by 6 2 billion to 75 8 billion the euro equivalent value of the ecb s holdings of gold and gold receivables increased by 3 8 billion to 22 0 billion in 2019 see chart 3 owing to an increase in the market price of gold in euro terms while the size of these holdings in fine ounces remained unchanged this increase also led to a rise in the ecb s revaluation accounts which increased by the same amount see section 1 3 2 financial resources chart 3 gold holdings and gold prices left hand scale eur billions right hand scale euro per fine ounce of gold source ecb note gold revaluation accounts does not include the contributions of the central banks of the members states that joined the euro area after 1 january 1999 to the accumulated gold revaluation accounts of the ecb as at the day prior to their entry into the eurosystem the ecb s net foreign currency holdings of us dollars japanese yen and chinese renminbi increased in euro terms by 2 4 billion to 53 1 billion see chart 4 owing to the reinvestment of the income received during the year from these holdings and the depreciation of the euro against the us dollar and japanese yen the depreciation of the euro is also reflected in the higher balances in the ecb s revaluation accounts see section 1 3 2 financial resources chart 4 foreign currency holdings eur billions source ecb the us dollar continued to be the main component of the ecb s foreign currency holdings accounting for approximately 77 of the total at the end of 2019 the ecb manages the investment of its foreign currency reserves using a three step process first a strategic benchmark portfolio is designed by the ecb s risk managers and approved by the governing council second the ecb s portfolio managers design the tactical benchmark portfolio which is approved by the executive board third day to day investment operations are conducted in a decentralised manner by the ncbs the ecb s foreign currency reserves are mainly invested in securities and money market deposits or are held in current accounts see chart 5 securities in this portfolio are valued at year end market prices chart 5 composition of foreign currency investments eur billions source ecb the purpose of the ecb s foreign currency reserves is to finance potential interventions in the foreign exchange market for this reason the ecb s foreign currency reserves are managed in accordance with three objectives in order of priority liquidity safety and return therefore this portfolio mainly comprises securities with short maturities see chart 6 chart 6 maturity profile of foreign currency denominated securities source ecb in 2019 the value of the own funds portfolio remained virtually unchanged see chart 7 this portfolio mainly consists of euro denominated securities which are valued at year end market prices chart 7 the ecb s own funds portfolio eur billions source ecb the ecb s own funds portfolio is held as a counterpart to its paid up capital the provision for financial risks and the general reserve fund the purpose of this portfolio is to provide income to help fund the ecb s operating expenses which are not related to the performance of its supervisory tasks in this context the objective of the management of the own funds portfolio is to maximise returns subject to a number of risk limits this results in a more diversified maturity structure see chart 8 than in the foreign currency reserves portfolio chart 8 maturity profile of the ecb s own funds securities source ecb 1 3 2 financial resources the ecb s financial resources consist of its capital the general risk provision the revaluation accounts and the profit for the year these financial resources are i invested in assets that generate income and or ii used to directly offset losses materialising from financial risks as at 31 december 2019 the ecb s financial resources totalled 47 7 billion see chart 9 this was 5 7 billion higher than in 2018 mainly owing to an increase in the revaluation accounts following the depreciation of the euro chart 9 the ecb s financial resources eur billions source ecb note revaluation accounts includes total revaluation gains on gold foreign currency and securities holdings but excludes the revaluation account for post employment benefits unrealised gains on gold foreign currencies and securities that are subject to price revaluation are not recognised as income in the profit and loss account but are recorded directly in revaluation accounts shown on the liability side of the ecb s balance sheet the balances in these accounts can be used to absorb the impact of any future unfavourable movement in the respective prices and or exchange rates and thus strengthen the ecb s resilience to the underlying risks in 2019 the revaluation accounts for gold foreign currencies and securities increased by 5 1 billion to 30 2 billion mainly owing to the increase in the price of gold and the depreciation of the euro against the us dollar and japanese yen see chart 10 chart 10 the main foreign exchange rates and gold price over the period 2015 19 percentage changes vis Ã  vis 2015 year end data source ecb the profit resulting from the ecb s assets and liabilities in a given financial year can be used to absorb potential losses incurred in the same year in 2019 the ecb s profit was 2 4 billion 0 8 billion higher than in 2018 in view of its exposure to financial risks see section 1 4 1 financial risks the ecb maintains a provision for financial risks the size of this provision is reviewed annually taking a range of factors into account including the level of holdings of risk bearing assets the projected results for the coming year and a risk assessment the risk provision together with any amount held in the ecb s general reserve fund may not exceed the value of the capital paid up by the euro area ncbs following the five yearly adjustment of the key for subscription to the ecb s capital as at 1 january 2019 and the resulting reduction in the weightings of the euro area ncbs in the subscribed capital of the ecb and taking into account the results of the assessment of the ecb s exposures to financial risks the governing council decided to release 84 million from the ecb s provision for financial risks in order to comply with its maximum permitted level of 7 5 billion which is equal to the value of the capital paid up by the euro area ncbs the ecb s capital paid up by euro area and non euro area ncbs stood at 7 7 billion on 31 december 2019 81 million lower than at the end of 2018 this reduction was a result of the five yearly adjustment of the ecb s capital key that entered into force on 1 january 2019 and resulted in a decrease in the weighting of the euro area ncbs with fully paid up subscriptions in 2020 the shares of the ncbs in the capital of the ecb will change owing to the departure of the united kingdom from the european union and the consequent withdrawal of the bank of england from the european system of central banks escb the ecb s subscribed capital will remain unchanged as the share of the bank of england in the ecb s subscribed capital will be reallocated among euro area and non euro area ncbs the ecb s paid up capital will also remain unchanged in 2020 as the remaining ncbs will cover the bank of england s withdrawn share of the paid up capital 1 3 3 profit and loss account over the period 2015 19 the annual profit of the ecb has gradually increased from around 1 1 billion to around 2 4 billion see chart 11 mainly due to higher interest income generated on foreign reserve assets and on securities held for monetary policy purposes which more than offset a decline in interest income on banknotes in circulation and on the own funds portfolio in 2019 the ecb s profit was 2 366 million 2018 1 575 million the increase of 790 million compared with 2018 was due to both an increase in net interest income and better results from financial operations chart 11 main components of the ecb s profit and loss account eur millions source ecb note other income and expenses consists of net income expense from fees and commissions income from equity shares and participating interests other income and other expenses the net interest income of the ecb increased by 410 million to 2 686 million see chart 12 mainly owing to higher interest income earned on both foreign reserve assets and securities held for monetary policy purposes chart 12 net interest income eur millions source ecb net interest income on foreign reserve assets increased by 190 million to 1 052 million mainly as a result of the higher interest income earned on securities denominated in us dollars due to the increasing trend in us dollar securities yields throughout most of 2018 see chart 13 in particular for short maturities the ecb acquired securities with higher yields thereby increasing the average yield of its us dollar portfolio compared to the previous year this had a positive impact on the interest income earned on this portfolio during 2019 chart 13 two year sovereign bond yields in the united states japan and china percentages per annum month end data source ecb net interest income generated on securities held for monetary policy purposes in 2019 was 1 447 million which was 212 million higher than in 2018 see chart 14 net interest income arising from app securities increased by 316 million to 1 136 million this increase stemmed mainly from the pspp portfolio owing to the higher average holdings and average yield of the portfolio during the year compared to 2018 in particular the average yield of the portfolio has increased in the last two years as a result of i the higher yield securities acquired throughout 2018 compared to the historical average yield of the portfolio and ii the reinvestment of the principal payments in 2019 at a higher yield than that of the redeemed securities at the same time yields on euro area sovereign bonds remained low on average in 2019 see chart 15 the increased net interest income from app securities more than offset the reduction in net interest income on the smp cbpp1 and cbpp2 portfolios which fell by 104 million to 311 million owing to the decline in the size of these portfolios as a result of the maturing of securities in 2019 securities held for monetary policy purposes generated around 54 of the ecb s net interest income chart 14 net interest income on securities held for monetary policy purposes eur millions source ecb chart 15 ten year sovereign bond yields in the euro area percentages per annum month end data source ecb both the interest income on the ecb s share of total euro banknotes in circulation and the interest expense related to the remuneration of ncbs claims in respect of foreign reserves transferred were zero as a result of the 0 interest rate used by the eurosystem in its main refinancing operations mros net other interest income decreased mainly owing to lower interest income earned on the own funds portfolio as a result of the low yield environment in the euro area the net result of financial operations and write downs on financial assets amounted to a gain of 176 million see chart 16 this result was 322 million higher than in 2018 mainly owing to better net realised price results in 2019 there was a net realised price gain on sales of securities mainly owing to price gains on us dollar denominated securities as their market value was positively affected by the decrease in us dollar bond yields during the year chart 16 realised results and write downs eur millions source ecb in addition an amount of 84 million was released from the ecb s general risk provision to the profit and loss account as at 31 december 2019 in order to comply with the general risk provision upper limit as defined by the paid up capital of the euro area ncbs see section 1 3 2 financial resources the total operating expenses of the ecb including depreciation and banknote production services increased by 42 million to 1 156 million see chart 17 the increase compared to 2018 is mainly due to higher staff costs as a result of i the higher average number of staff in 2019 predominately in banking supervision and ii the higher expense in relation to other long term benefits mainly owing to the lower discount rate used for the actuarial valuation at the end of 2019 owing to the implementation of the new policy for leases in 2019 rental expenses related to leases which were previously recognised under administrative expenses are now recorded as depreciation as a result the administrative expenses were lower while the depreciation cost was higher than the previous year administrative expenses also decreased due to lower costs related to agency staff and external consultancy support banking supervision related expenses are fully covered by fees levied on the supervised entities chart 17 operating expenses and supervisory fees eur millions source ecb notes operating expenses are split between central banking and banking supervision the costs of shared services provided by the ecb s support business areas have been allocated among these two categories these shared services are provided by the existing support business areas of the ecb including premises human resources management administrative services budgeting and controlling accounting legal communication and translation services internal audit statistical and information technology services 1 4 risk management risk management is a critical part of the ecb s activities and is conducted through a continuous process of i risk identification and assessment ii review of the risk strategy and policies iii implementation of risk mitigating actions and iv risk monitoring and reporting all of which are supported by effective methodologies processes and systems figure 1 risk management cycle the ecb is exposed to both financial and operational risks the following sections focus on these risks their sources and the applicable risk control frameworks 1 4 1 financial risks the executive board proposes policies and procedures that ensure an appropriate level of protection against the financial risks to which the ecb is exposed the risk management committee rmc which comprises experts from eurosystem central banks contributes inter alia to the monitoring and measuring of and reporting on financial risks related to the balance sheet of the eurosystem and it defines and reviews the associated methodologies and frameworks in this way the rmc helps the decision making bodies to ensure an appropriate level of protection for the eurosystem financial risks arise from the ecb s core activities and associated exposures the risk control frameworks and limits that the ecb uses to manage its risk profile differ across types of operation reflecting the policy or investment objectives of the different portfolios and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets to monitor and assess the risks the ecb relies on a number of risk estimation techniques developed in house these techniques are based on a joint market and credit risk simulation framework the core modelling concepts techniques and assumptions underlying the risk measures draw on industry standards and available market data the risks are typically quantified by the expected shortfall es estimated at the 99 confidence level over a one year horizon two approaches are used to calculate risks i the accounting approach under which the ecb s revaluation accounts are considered as a buffer in the calculation of risk estimates in line with all applicable accounting rules and ii the financial approach under which the revaluation accounts are not considered as a buffer in the risk calculation the ecb also calculates other risk measures at different confidence levels performs sensitivity and stress scenario analyses and assesses longer term projections of exposures and income to maintain a comprehensive picture of the risks the total risks of the ecb decreased during the year at the end of 2019 the total financial risks for all the ecb s portfolios combined as measured by the es at the 99 confidence level over a one year horizon following the accounting approach stood at 8 1 billion which was 1 1 billion lower than the risks estimated as at the end of 2018 the decrease reflects lower currency and interest rate risk in the ecb s investment portfolios improvements in the credit quality of securities held in the ecb s portfolios and redemptions of securities held under the smp cbpp1 and cbpp2 credit risk arises from the ecb s monetary policy portfolios its euro denominated own funds portfolio and its foreign reserve holdings while securities held for monetary policy purposes are valued at amortised cost subject to impairment and are therefore in the absence of sales not subject to price changes associated with credit migrations they are still subject to credit default risk euro denominated own funds and foreign reserves are valued at market prices and as such are subject to credit migration and default risk credit risk decreased compared with the previous year owing to improvements in the credit quality of several european sovereigns and redemptions in the smp holdings credit risk is mitigated mainly through the application of eligibility criteria due diligence procedures and limits that differ across portfolios currency and commodity risks arise from the ecb s foreign currency and gold holdings the currency risk decreased compared to the previous year owing to higher revaluation accounts which act as buffers against adverse exchange rate and gold price movements in view of the policy role of these assets the ecb does not hedge the related currency and commodity risks instead these risks are mitigated through the existence of revaluation accounts and the diversification of the holdings across different currencies and gold the ecb s foreign reserves and euro denominated own funds are mainly invested in fixed income securities and are subject to mark to market interest rate risk given that they are valued at market prices the ecb s foreign reserves holdings are mainly invested in assets with relatively short maturities see chart 6 in section 1 3 1 balance sheet while the assets in the own funds portfolio generally have longer maturities see chart 8 in section 1 3 1 balance sheet this risk component as measured under the accounting approach decreased compared to 2018 reflecting developments in market conditions the mark to market interest rate risk of the ecb is mitigated through asset allocation policies and the revaluation accounts the ecb is also subject to interest rate risk arising from mismatches between the interest rate earned on its assets and the interest rate paid on its liabilities which has an impact on its net interest income this risk is not directly linked to any particular portfolio but rather to the structure of the ecb s balance sheet as a whole and in particular the existence of maturity and yield mismatches between assets and liabilities it is monitored by means of projections of the ecb s profitability which indicate that the ecb is expected to continue to earn net interest income in the coming years this type of risk is managed through asset allocation policies and is further mitigated by the existence of unremunerated liabilities on the ecb s balance sheet 1 4 2 operational risk the ecb s operational risk management orm covers all non financial risks the executive board is responsible for and approves the ecb s orm policy and framework the operational risk committee orc supports the executive board in the performance of its role in overseeing the management of operational risks orm is an integral part of the ecb s governance structure and management processes the main objective of the ecb s orm framework is to contribute to ensuring that the ecb achieves its mission and objectives while protecting its reputation and assets against loss misuse and damage under the orm framework each business area is responsible for identifying assessing responding to reporting on and monitoring its operational risks incidents and controls in this context the ecb s risk tolerance policy provides guidance with regard to risk response strategies and risk acceptance procedures it is linked to a five by five risk matrix based on impact and likelihood grading scales using quantitative and qualitative criteria the environment in which the ecb operates is exposed to increasingly complex threats and there are a wide range of operational risks associated with the ecb s day to day activities the main areas of concern for the ecb include a wide spectrum of non financial risks resulting from people information systems processes and external third party providers consequently the ecb has put in place processes to facilitate ongoing and effective management of its operational risks and to integrate risk information into the decision making process moreover the ecb focuses on enhancing its resilience as such response structures and contingency plans have been established to ensure the continuity of critical business functions in the event of any disruption 2

following accounting policies which the governing council of the ecb considers to achieve a fair presentation of the financial statements reflecting at the same time the nature of central bank activities accounting principles the following accounting principles have been applied economic reality and transparency prudence recognition of post balance sheet events materiality going concern the accruals principle consistency and comparability recognition of assets and liabilities an asset or liability is only recognised in the balance sheet when it is probable that any associated future economic benefit will flow to or from the ecb substantially all of the associated risks and rewards have been transferred to the ecb and the cost or value of the asset or the amount of the obligation can be measured reliably basis of accounting the accounts have been prepared on a historical cost basis modified to include the market valuation of marketable securities other than securities currently held for monetary policy purposes gold and all other on balance sheet and off balance sheet assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency transactions in financial assets and liabilities are reflected in the accounts on the basis of the date on which they were settled with the exception of spot transactions in securities transactions in financial instruments denominated in foreign currency are recorded in off balance sheet accounts on the trade date at the settlement date the off balance sheet entries are reversed and transactions are booked on balance sheet purchases and sales of foreign currency affect the net foreign currency position on the trade date and realised results arising from sales are also calculated on that date accrued interest premiums and discounts related to financial instruments denominated in foreign currency are calculated and recorded daily and the foreign currency position is also affected daily by these accruals gold and foreign currency assets and liabilities assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are converted into euro at the exchange rate prevailing on the balance sheet date income and expenses are converted at the exchange rate prevailing on the recording date the revaluation of foreign exchange assets and liabilities including on balance sheet and off balance sheet instruments is performed on a currency by currency basis revaluation to the market price for assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency is treated separately from the exchange rate revaluation gold is valued at the market price prevailing at the balance sheet date no distinction is made between the price and currency revaluation differences for gold instead a single gold valuation is accounted for on the basis of the price in euro per fine ounce of gold which for the year ending 31 december 2019 was derived from the exchange rate of the euro against the us dollar on 31 december 2019 the special drawing right sdr is defined in terms of a basket of currencies and its value is determined by the weighted sum of the exchange rates of five major currencies the us dollar euro chinese renminbi japanese yen and pound sterling the ecb s holdings of sdrs were converted into euro using the exchange rate of euro per sdr as at 31 december 2019 securities securities held for monetary policy purposes securities currently held for monetary policy purposes are accounted for at amortised cost subject to impairment other securities marketable securities other than securities currently held for monetary policy purposes and similar assets are valued either at the mid market prices or on the basis of the relevant yield curve prevailing on the balance sheet date on a security by security basis options embedded in securities are not separated for valuation purposes for the year ending 31 december 2019 mid market prices on 30 december 2019 were used illiquid equity shares and any other equity instruments held as permanent investments are valued at cost subject to impairment income recognition income and expenses are recognised in the period in which they are earned or incurred realised gains and losses arising from the sale of foreign currency gold and securities are taken to the profit and loss account such realised gains and losses are calculated by reference to the average cost of the respective asset unrealised gains are not recognised as income and are transferred directly to a revaluation account unrealised losses are taken to the profit and loss account if at the year end they exceed previous revaluation gains registered in the corresponding revaluation account such unrealised losses on any one security or currency or on gold are not netted against unrealised gains on other securities or currencies or gold in the event of such unrealised losses on any item taken to the profit and loss account the average cost of that item is reduced to the year end exchange rate or market price unrealised losses on interest rate swaps that are taken to the profit and loss account at the year end are amortised in subsequent years impairment losses are taken to the profit and loss account and are not reversed in subsequent years unless the impairment decreases and the decrease can be related to an observable event that occurred after the impairment was first recorded premiums or discounts arising on securities are amortised over the securities remaining contractual life reverse transactions reverse transactions are operations whereby the ecb buys or sells assets under a repurchase agreement or conducts credit operations against collateral under a repurchase agreement securities are sold for cash with a simultaneous agreement to repurchase them from the counterparty at an agreed price on a set future date repurchase agreements are recorded as collateralised deposits on the liability side of the balance sheet securities sold under such an agreement remain on the balance sheet of the ecb under a reverse repurchase agreement securities are bought for cash with a simultaneous agreement to sell them back to the counterparty at an agreed price on a set future date reverse repurchase agreements are recorded as collateralised loans on the asset side of the balance sheet but are not included in the ecb s security holdings reverse transactions including securities lending transactions conducted under a programme offered by a specialised institution are recorded on the balance sheet only where collateral has been provided in the form of cash and this cash remains uninvested off balance sheet instruments currency instruments namely foreign exchange forward transactions forward legs of foreign exchange swaps and other currency instruments involving an exchange of one currency for another at a future date are included in the net foreign currency position for the purpose of calculating foreign exchange gains and losses interest rate instruments are revalued on an item by item basis daily changes in the variation margin of open interest rate futures contracts as well as interest rate swaps that are cleared via a central counterparty are recorded in the profit and loss account the valuation of forward transactions in securities and of interest rate swaps that are not cleared via a central counterparty is carried out by the ecb based on generally accepted valuation methods using observable market prices and rates as well as discount factors from the settlement dates to the valuation date post balance sheet events the values of assets and liabilities are adjusted for events that occur between the annual balance sheet date and the date on which the executive board authorises the submission of the ecb s annual accounts to the governing council for approval if such events materially affect the condition of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date important post balance sheet events that do not affect the condition of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date are disclosed in the notes intra escb balances intra eurosystem balances intra escb balances result primarily from cross border payments in the european union eu that are settled in central bank money in euro these transactions are for the most part initiated by private entities i e credit institutions corporations and individuals they are settled in target2 the trans european automated real time gross settlement express transfer system and give rise to bilateral balances in the target2 accounts of eu central banks these bilateral balances are netted and then assigned to the ecb on a daily basis leaving each national central bank ncb with a single net bilateral position vis Ã  vis the ecb only payments conducted by the ecb and settled in target2 also affect the single net bilateral positions these positions in the books of the ecb represent the net claim or liability of each ncb against the rest of the european system of central banks escb intra eurosystem balances of euro area ncbs vis Ã  vis the ecb arising from target2 as well as other intra eurosystem balances denominated in euro e g the ecb s interim profit

eurosystem net intra escb balances of non euro area ncbs vis Ã  vis the ecb arising from their participation in target2 are disclosed under liabilities to non euro area residents denominated in euro intra eurosystem balances arising from the allocation of euro banknotes within the eurosystem are included as a single net asset under claims related to the allocation of euro banknotes within the eurosystem see banknotes in circulation below intra eurosystem balances arising from the transfer of foreign reserve assets to the ecb by ncbs joining the eurosystem are denominated in euro and reported under liabilities equivalent to the transfer of foreign reserves fixed assets fixed assets including intangible assets but with the exception of land and works of art are valued at cost less depreciation land and works of art are valued at cost the ecb s main building is valued at cost less depreciation subject to impairment for the depreciation of the ecb s main building costs are assigned to the appropriate asset components which are depreciated in accordance with their estimated useful lives depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis over the expected useful life of the asset beginning in the quarter after the asset is available for use the useful lives applied for the main asset classes are as follows the depreciation period for capitalised refurbishment expenditure relating to the ecb s existing rented premises is adjusted to take account of any events that have an impact on the expected useful life of the affected asset the ecb performs an annual impairment test of its main building and right of use assets relating to office buildings see leases below based on international accounting standard ias 36 impairment of assets if an impairment indicator is identified signalling that the asset may be impaired the recoverable amount is estimated an impairment loss is recorded in the profit and loss account if the recoverable amount is less than the net book value fixed assets costing less than 10 000 are written off in the year of acquisition fixed assets that comply with the capitalisation criteria but are still under construction or development are recorded under the heading assets under construction the related costs are transferred to the relevant fixed asset headings once the assets are available for use leases for all leases involving a tangible asset the related right of use asset and lease liability are recognised on the balance sheet at the lease commencement date and included under tangible and intangible fixed assets and sundry liabilities respectively right of use assets are valued at cost less depreciation in addition right of use assets relating to office buildings are subject to impairment regarding annual impairment test see fixed assets above depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis from the commencement date to either the end of the useful life of the right of use asset or the end of the lease term whichever is earlier the lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments comprising only lease components discounted using the ecb s incremental borrowing rate subsequently the lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method the related interest expense is recorded in the profit and loss account under other

payments from maturing securities purchased under the app the governing council expects net purchases to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates and to end shortly before it starts raising the key ecb interest rates the governing council also intends to continue the reinvestments for an extended period of time past the date when the governing council starts raising the key ecb interest rates and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation the securities purchased

associated with the securities held under all these programmes impairment tests are conducted on an annual basis using data as at the year end and are approved by the governing council in these tests

of new mortality tables and to a much lesser extent experience adjustments reflecting the difference between the actuarial assumptions made in the previous year s report and actual experience benefits

of up to 1 8 per annum depending on the age of the plan participants 3 in accordance with the ecb s pension plan rules pensions will be increased annually if general salary adjustments for ecb employees are below price inflation any increase in pensions will be in line with the general salary adjustments if the general salary adjustments exceed price inflation they will be applied to

pillar in 2019 amounted to 171 million 2018 140 million these contributions are invested in the plan assets and give rise to a corresponding obligation of equal value note 13 provisions this item

interest rate credit and gold price risks only the provision for financial risks will be used to the extent deemed necessary by the governing council to offset future realised and unrealised losses the size of and continuing requirement for this provision is reviewed annually based on the ecb s assessment of its exposure to these risks and taking a range of factors into account its size together with any amount held in the general reserve fund may not exceed the value of the ecb s capital paid up by the euro area ncbs taking into account i the reduction in the weighting of the euro area ncbs in the subscribed capital of the ecb as a result of the five yearly adjustment of the key for subscription to the ecb s capital as at 1 january 2019 see note 15 capital and reserves and ii the results of the assessment of the ecb s exposures to financial risks the governing council decided to release 84 million from the ecb s provision for financial risks on 31 december 2019 in order to comply with

domestic product of the eu in equal measure the fourth such adjustment following the establishment of the ecb was made on 1 january 2019 and the ncbs capital key shares were adjusted as follows paid up capital of the ecb the subscribed capital of the ecb is 10 825 million following the five yearly adjustment of the ecb s capital key the weighting of the euro area ncbs with fully paid up subscriptions in the ecb s subscribed capital was reduced by 0 7739 percentage points while that of the non euro area ncbs which only pay up 3 75 of their subscriptions increased by the same amount as

ecb and other eu institutions by a number of depositors shareholders and bondholders of cypriot credit institutions the applicants allege that they have suffered financial losses as a result of acts that they deem to have led to the restructuring of these credit institutions in the context of the financial assistance programme for cyprus two of these cases were dismissed on substance by the general court of the eu in 2018 and an appeal against these judgments is currently pending before the court of justice of the eu this follows orders of the general court in 2014 which found twelve similar cases inadmissible in their entirety and following appeals judgments of the court of justice in 2016 which either confirmed the inadmissibility or ruled in favour of the ecb the ecb s involvement in the process leading up to the conclusion of the financial assistance programme was limited to the provision of technical advice pursuant to the esm treaty acting in liaison with the european commission as well as the issuance of a non binding opinion on the cypriot draft resolution law it is therefore considered that no losses will be incurred by the ecb as a result of these cases 2 6 notes on the profit and loss account note 22 net interest income note 22 1 interest income on foreign reserve assets this item includes interest income net of interest expense in respect of the ecb s net foreign reserve assets as follows the overall increase in net interest income in 2019 was mainly due to higher interest income generated on the us dollar portfolio the appreciation of

2019 were as follows the market value of a number of securities held in the own funds and us dollar portfolios declined alongside an increase in the corresponding yields towards the end of 2019 this

for i the deficit of 15 million carried forward from the 2018 fee period and ii amounts reimbursed to individual banks for previous fee periods 2 million based on the actual expenses incurred by the ecb in the performance of its banking supervisory tasks the supervisory fee income for 2019 stood at 537 million the resulting surplus of 22 million arising from the difference between the estimated expenses 559 million and the actual expenses 537 million for 2019 is shown under the heading accruals and income collected in advance see note 12 2 accruals and income collected in advance it will

considered in the calculation of the annual supervisory fees instead it is recorded as income in the ecb s profit and loss account and is distributed to euro area ncbs as part of the ecb s profit distribution regime in 2019 the income arising from penalties on supervised entities amounted to 7 million thus the related income of the ecb for supervisory tasks in 2019 was as follows banking supervision related expenses result from the direct supervision of significant entities the oversight of the supervision of less significant entities and the performance of horizontal tasks and specialised services they also include expenses arising from support areas needed to fulfil the ecb s supervisory responsibilities including premises human resources management administrative services budgeting and controlling accounting legal communication and translation services internal audit and statistical and information technology services for 2019 the total actual expenses related to the ecb s supervisory tasks which are recovered via the annual supervisory fees were as follows the increase in the average number of staff working for ecb banking supervision led to a corresponding increase in salaries and benefits the higher staff numbers also drove the increase in premises related costs while the decrease in other operating expenditure was mainly due to lower consultancy expenses in relation to supervisory tasks most notably the targeted review of internal models trim which will conclude in 2020 note 26 income from equity shares and participating interests dividends received on shares which the ecb holds in the bis see note 6 2 other financial assets are shown under this heading note 27 other income other miscellaneous income during 2019 arose mainly from

were managerial staff 2018 337 staff costs increased in 2019 mainly owing to the higher average number of staff employed by the ecb and higher costs in relation to other long term benefits mainly as a result of the use of a lower discount rate for the actuarial valuation at the end of 2019 see note 12 3 sundry remuneration of the executive and supervisory boards members of the executive board and the members of the supervisory board employed by the ecb receive a basic salary and allowances for residence and representation in the case of the president a residence is provided in lieu of a

premises goods and equipment of a non capital nature and other services and supplies together with staff related expenses including training recruitment relocation and accommodation expenses the decrease in 2019 was mainly due to lower expenses in relation to rent of space agency staff and external consultancy support lower rental expenses resulted from the on balance sheet recognition of the right of use buildings see changes to accounting policies in section 2 3 accounting policies and note 6 1 tangible and intangible fixed assets and the recording of the related expenses as depreciation

coronavirus in china fell to just over 300 sparking a new wave of v shaped recovery optimism in markets this morning wall street australia and new zealand equity markets all hit record highs today with oil rallying hard overnight and palladium making yet another record high before we all get carried away though bloomberg reported that the reason that new cases of coronavirus have fallen is that china has changed its reporting methodology for the second time in seven days eliminating those who appear virus positive after a ct scan there are two ways of looking at this on the one hand a cynic

account of the monetary policy meeting of the governing council of the european central bank held in frankfurt am main on wednesday and thursday 22 23 january 2020 1 review of financial economic and monetary developments and policy options financial market developments ms schnabel reviewed the latest financial market developments the period since the governing council s monetary policy meeting on 11 12 december 2019 had been marked by three major events the year end the geopolitical tensions in the middle east and the signing of the phase one trade agreement between the united states and china the trade agreement appeared to be the most significant as it had helped consolidate the general improvement in market sentiment that had gained momentum in early september 2019 expectations that monetary policy would remain highly accommodative both in the united states and in the euro area further supported the improved market sentiment the year end as usual had been characterised by thin liquidity in money markets due to reporting and regulatory obligations the turn of this year however had been the smoothest since 2016 repo rates had remained mostly concentrated around levels prevailing before the turn of the year use of the eurosystem s securities lending facilities had also increased only slightly over the year end in the us money market the federal reserve s injections of additional liquidity had mitigated any potential year end tensions the new year had started with geopolitical tensions escalating in the middle east however financial markets had proved rather resilient which could be explained by a number of factors one had been the attempt by the authorities to quickly de escalate the situation through their rhetoric a second factor had been the prevailing high level of oil inventories in oecd countries combined with a global economy much less reliant on oil than in the past this cushioned the expected impact of supply side disruptions on the oil price a third factor might have been the general underlying improvement in market sentiment this improved sentiment had been visible in global bond markets since early september 2019 following indications that a phase one trade deal between the united states and china was within reach since september 2019 yields on 10 year german benchmark government bonds had increased by around 50 basis points in addition the spread vis Ã  vis the 10 year us treasury benchmark had narrowed by some 30 basis points some insight into the reversal in the us euro area interest rate differential could be derived from the breakdown of bond yields into the short term rate expectations component and the term premia component in both the united states and the euro area yields were currently well below their end 2018 levels but for different reasons in the euro area the expected interest rate path during 2019 had been adjusted downwards much less than in the united states and had also partly reversed as sentiment had brightened in recent months however the decline in term premia had proven much more persistent in the euro area this might partly be linked to the resumption of net asset purchases by the ecb which had removed additional duration risk from the market in addition the decline in term premia might be related to the reduced uncertainty around the outlook for short term interest rates the overnight index swap forward curve suggested that the markets currently expected the ecb to stay on hold for at least the next two years these expectations were broadly consistent with the subdued inflation outlook priced in by markets turning to corporate and government bond issuances the combination of improved market sentiment and continued monetary accommodation had likely fostered investor demand in the private sector strong issuance of corporate bonds had been observed for the year to date for public issuers investor demand for long maturity government bond issuances such as those of italy or spain had been exceptionally high in january prospects for continued monetary policy accommodation and improved market sentiment likely also supported equity valuations the s p 500 and the euro stoxx 600 were up by around 5 and 4 respectively since 12 december 2019 many equity indices were at or close to their historical highs the global environment and economic and monetary developments in the euro area mr lane reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area regarding the external environment global activity and trade had remained subdued there were some signs of a stabilisation and even a slight pick up in the purchasing managers index pmi data with the turnaround being most visible in the manufacturing pmi overall the pmis had signalled a stabilisation in global activity at modest growth rates in the fourth quarter of the year with signs of improvement within the last quarter global trade had recovered in the third quarter of 2019 and more recently trade uncertainty had declined based on the trade deal between the united states and china on the whole however global trade had remained subdued dampened by a still high level of trade tensions and weak asian demand turning to global financial conditions market sentiment towards risky assets had remained positive global equity prices had continued to increase especially in the united states since the governing council s december monetary policy meeting oil prices had decreased by around 1 and the euro had remained broadly stable against the us dollar although it had depreciated slightly in nominal effective terms turning to the euro area gdp growth had stood at 0 3 quarter on quarter in the third quarter of 2019 according to eurostat s third estimate in the fourth quarter business indicators had provided some signs of a stabilisation with the composite output pmi and the commission s economic sentiment indicator starting to increase in particular the results of forward looking manufacturing surveys appeared to have stabilised incoming data since the last governing council meeting pointed to continued positive but modest gdp growth the demand components of private consumption had continued to be supported by robust income developments this had reflected the overall resilience of the labour market most importantly solid growth in compensation of employees had continued moreover fiscal policies mainly in the form of lower taxes or higher transfers had also started to contribute positively to developments in disposable income in addition terms of trade developments driven by energy prices in particular had supported annual growth in disposable income over the course of 2019 however business investment dynamics remained weak and had been slowing since early 2019 the latest sectoral indicators suggested business investment would remain subdued in the short term extra euro area exports of goods had increased in the last four months although displaying some brexit related volatility looking at developments in euro area labour markets euro area employment had continued to rise in the third quarter but had increased only slightly consistent with the slowdown in economic growth the euro area unemployment rate had stood at 7 5 in november essentially unchanged since august euro area annual hicp inflation had increased to 1 3 in december reflecting mainly higher energy inflation but it remained considerably below the governing council s inflation aim hicp inflation excluding energy and food was unchanged at 1 3 with services inflation continuing to be substantially stronger than non energy industrial goods inflation measures of underlying inflation had remained generally muted although there were further signs of a gradual increase in line with previous expectations hicp sub components with a relatively high domestic content had become more prominent drivers of underlying inflation over recent years wage growth continued to be solid annual growth in compensation per employee was 2 2 in the third quarter of 2019 unchanged from the second quarter of 2019 and broadly in line with its long term average of 2 1 furthermore wage growth had remained broad based across sectors according to the latest survey of professional forecasters spf hicp inflation expectations were 1 2 1 4 and 1 5 for 2020 2021 and 2022 respectively following four successive rounds of downward revisions spf respondents had kept their inflation forecasts essentially unchanged with longer term inflation expectations standing at 1 7 market based indicators of longer term inflation expectations in the euro area had recovered somewhat since the governing council s last monetary policy meeting but remained at subdued levels with the five year forward inflation linked swap rate five years ahead standing at just above 1 3 turning to euro area financial conditions long term risk free rates had changed little since the december governing council meeting as was the case for the eonia forward curve with the short end of the curve remaining almost flat euro area equity prices for both financial and non financial corporations had continued to increase since the december meeting lower discount rates on the back of accommodative monetary policy had played an important role in supporting euro area equity prices in 2019 counteracting the drag from a decline in longer term earnings expectations financing conditions for euro area non financial corporations remained very favourable and had remained broadly unchanged since the december meeting turning to money and credit developments the annual growth rate of m3 had remained robust in november at 5 6 almost entirely driven by annual m1 growth portfolio considerations linked to low opportunity costs of holding m3 were the main economic factor supporting robust broad money growth from a counterpart perspective credit to the private sector was contributing about half of broad money creation while net external monetary flows accounted for the other half the pass through of monetary accommodation to euro area bank lending rates had been continuing although lending rates had stabilised in november standing slightly above historical lows this likely reflected earlier movements in market rates since february 2019 interest rates on loans to the private sector had been on a declining trend growth in loans to households and firms remained solid while the annual growth rate of loans to households had remained unchanged from october to november at 3 5 the annual growth rate of loans to non financial corporations had moderated to 3 4 from 3 8 likely reflecting some lagged reaction to the past weakening in the economy according to the january 2020 bank lending survey credit standards for loans to enterprises remained broadly unchanged in the fourth quarter of 2019 a continued tightening contribution from risk perceptions consistent with subdued economic activity in the euro area was counterbalanced by an easing impact from competitive pressures the survey had also indicated a weakening in demand for loans to firms in line with the slowdown in economic activity observed since 2018 turning to fiscal policies the euro area fiscal stance was assessed to be mildly expansionary for 2019 21 the fiscal stimulus consisted mainly of direct tax cuts and increases in transfers and was expected to contribute positively to disposable income growth in 2019 21 this provided a tailwind for private consumption for the first time since 2010 monetary policy considerations and policy options summing up mr lane remarked that financial conditions had remained accommodative supported by receding trade tensions and the unfolding effects of the september policy package bank lending conditions for firms and households continued to be favourable indicating an ongoing pass through of favourable market funding conditions incoming economic data confirmed the governing council s previous assessment of ongoing but moderate growth with slightly more positive signals from forward looking indicators some of the uncertainty surrounding international trade was receding but the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook relating to geopolitical factors protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets remained skewed to the downside hicp inflation dynamics and developments in underlying inflation remained subdued overall market and survey based indicators of inflation expectations continued to signal the risk of a prolonged period of low inflation however wage growth was resilient and broad based even though the pass through to inflation continued to be slow in addition there were tentative signs of a gradual pick up in underlying inflation overall despite some positive signals for future growth and inflation the outlook for price developments remained below the governing council s medium term aim and risks to the outlook were still elevated however financial conditions remained favourable and could rely on the automatic stabilisation function embedded in the forward guidance to accommodate any short term volatility in the outlook considering the tentative signals of a stabilisation in the euro area economy the governing council would await further data to see if there were firmer grounds for optimism on the basis of this assessment mr lane proposed keeping the monetary policy stance unchanged at the current meeting this would entail reiterating the forward guidance on policy rates net asset purchases and reinvestments of principal payments in addition in its public communication the governing council should continue to highlight that it remained ready to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate to ensure that inflation moved towards the aim in a sustained manner in line with its commitment to symmetry 2 governing council s discussion and monetary policy decisions economic and monetary analyses on the economic analysis the members of the governing council generally shared the assessment of the outlook and risks for economic activity in the euro area provided by mr lane in his introduction incoming information since the governing council s december monetary policy meeting was considered to be in line with the baseline scenario of ongoing but moderate growth in the euro area economy in the december 2019 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections in particular the weakness in the manufacturing sector remained a drag on euro area growth momentum however ongoing albeit decelerating employment growth and robust wage growth continued to support the resilience of the euro area economy in considering the outlook and risks for the external environment members noted that although global activity and trade were still subdued there were some indications as also reflected in recent survey data of a stabilisation and even a possible pick up in activity attention was drawn to the january 2020 update of the imf s world economic outlook which foresaw growth in global activity slightly above the december 2019 staff projections and stronger growth in 2020 compared with 2019 moreover reference was made to the imf s assessment that temporary factors behind the slowdown in global manufacturing such as the adjustment in the automobile sector to new emission standards and the lull in the launch of new tech products had appeared to fade members also agreed that some of the uncertainty surrounding international trade was receding although the risks to the external environment relating to geopolitical factors rising protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets continued to be tilted to the downside in discussing the risks to the external environment members took note of the recent phase one trade deal between the united states and china which appeared to have increased confidence and had been received positively by financial markets this together with greater clarity on the united kingdom s withdrawal from the eu following the uk general election in december had contributed to a decline in international risks although there was still substantial uncertainty at the same time it was noted that the tariffs imposed by both china and the united states had largely been left in place and that the trade deal could have adverse consequences for euro area exports as a result of trade diversion in addition unresolved issues remained between the united states and the eu as regards trade and there was evidence that firms were affected by uncertainty including about the impact of potential tariffs on the automobile sector moreover although it was now clear that the united kingdom would be leaving the eu at the end of january 2020 their future trade relationship still had to be agreed and there could be more divergence in this relationship than previously expected turning to euro area activity members broadly agreed that incoming economic data and survey information pointed to some stabilisation in euro area growth dynamics near term growth was expected to be similar to rates observed in the previous quarters thus broadly in line with the december 2019 eurosystem staff projections real gdp had increased by 0 3 quarter on quarter in the third quarter of 2019 following growth of 0 2 in the previous quarter this pattern of moderate growth reflected the ongoing weakness of international trade in an environment of continued global uncertainties which had particularly affected the euro area manufacturing sector and had also dampened investment growth at the same time the services and construction sectors remained more resilient despite some moderation in the second half of 2019 nowcasting models which took recent data releases into account pointed to a stabilisation in growth at low rates below estimates of potential growth the eurocoin indicator had remained unchanged in december as the impact of the positive stock market performance had been offset by persistent pessimism among firms in the manufacturing sector it was remarked that the increase in the stock market did not seem to be related to an improvement in earnings expectations as also appeared to be the case in the united states this pointed to a possible disconnect between buoyant financial markets and the continued subdued outlook for the real economy the risk of adverse spillovers from the continued weakness in the manufacturing sector to other sectors of the economy still needed to be monitored closely it was noted that so far activity in the services sector had been quite resilient supported by domestic demand and underpinned by favourable financial conditions related to the ecb s september 2019 monetary policy package as well as expansionary fiscal policy however while there might have been a bottoming out in manufacturing it was too soon to conclude that the slowdown in growth in the services sector had stopped as spillovers to services could emerge with a lag and the sector s current resilience might not last the point was made that the stabilisation in euro area growth was mainly driven by household consumption while external demand and corporate investment remained subdued weak investment suggested that there was little prospect of a sustained increase in growth potential and productivity the slowdown in employment growth was highlighted in the euro area s largest economy this slower employment growth could be considered a normal feature of a maturing business cycle amid emerging supply bottlenecks but other countries were not in a situation of full employment while euro area unemployment at 7 5 was around pre crisis levels it had been flat for some time and there was considerable heterogeneity in the level of unemployment across countries more positively reference was made to developments in a number of euro area indicators including the improvement in forward looking expectations components of business surveys and the rise in the citigroup surprise indicator it was felt to be important to acknowledge these positive signs and care should be taken to avoid being too slow to change the risk assessment it was noted that the automobile sector remained a concern and that there were also deeper structural factors affecting this industry that needed to be monitored closely however some caution was also expressed about becoming too optimistic it was noted that although the manufacturing pmi had improved it was still at a level which signalled a contraction in activity in particular the automobile sector and industrial production were still declining in the euro area s largest economy which would affect other countries in part via value chain linkages moreover the improvement in the citigroup surprise indicator was mainly related to confidence indicators while the real economy remained weak and the improvement in hard data had been negligible the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook related to geopolitical factors rising protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets remained tilted to the downside but had become less pronounced as some of the uncertainty surrounding international trade had receded the euro area fiscal stance was expected to provide some support to economic activity in view of the weak economic outlook the governing council welcomed the eurogroup s call in december for differentiated fiscal responses and its readiness to coordinate governments with fiscal space should stand ready to act in an effective and timely manner while in countries where public debt was high governments needed to pursue prudent policies and meet structural balance targets which would create the conditions for automatic stabilisers to operate freely all countries should intensify their efforts to achieve a more growth friendly composition of public finances on price developments there was broad agreement with the assessment presented by mr lane in his introduction according to eurostat euro area annual hicp inflation was 1 3 in december 2019 after 1 0 in november mainly reflecting higher energy price inflation on the basis of current futures prices for oil headline inflation was likely to hover around current levels in the coming months measures of underlying inflation had remained generally muted although there were further indications of a moderate increase in line with previous expectations while indicators of inflation expectations remained at low levels recently they had either stabilised or ticked up slightly labour cost pressures had strengthened amid tighter labour markets but the weaker growth momentum was delaying their pass through to inflation over the medium term inflation was expected to increase supported by the ecb s monetary policy measures the ongoing economic expansion and solid wage growth in discussing recent inflation developments members were encouraged by the fact that headline and underlying inflation had recently evolved in line with the december staff projections and by the evidence of a continued gradual upward trend in some indicators of underlying inflation hicp inflation excluding food and energy was at its highest level for four years although it was still slightly below its pre crisis average it was remarked that this level had been reached even without housing costs fully represented in the inflation measures while goods prices were being dampened by global factors and weak demand services prices were gradually increasing linked to the ecb s monetary policy measures on developments in other inflation measures it was noted that the gdp deflator was also increasing at the same time it was argued that the level of underlying inflation remained muted even though the likelihood of a general upward trend in inflation dynamics had increased members agreed with the assessment presented by mr lane in his introduction that wage growth remained resilient and was broad based against the background of solid labour market developments the observed upward movement in inflation had increased confidence that with wages and salaries having grown by over 2 5 in the third quarter of 2019 and above their long term average recent wage dynamics would pass through to inflation over time however it was felt that there was a need to continue to investigate the pass through of wages to inflation and developments in profit margins on longer term inflation expectations members noted that although the indicators had either stabilised or ticked up recently they continued to stand at low levels market based inflation expectations as measured by the five year forward inflation linked swap rate five years ahead currently stood at 1 3 meanwhile in terms of survey based measures in the spf for the first quarter of 2020 longer term inflation expectations were unchanged at 1 7 it was recalled that there were important issues related to the measurement of inflation expectations and that most of the gap between survey based and market based measures of longer term inflation expectations could be accounted for by estimates of risk and liquidity premia it was also pointed out that the risk of deflation had declined further however it was suggested that the low level of inflation expectations indicated that most investors expected inflation to remain below the ecb s aim for some time to come reference was made to survey evidence from the european commission highlighting a strong correlation between households inflation perceptions and measured hicp inflation mention was also made of some analysis showing that short term inflation expectations were heavily influenced by actual inflation and in turn affected longer term inflation expectations the concern was also expressed that the recent slight increase in market based measures of inflation expectations might be related to higher oil prices and might therefore not be sustained on the monetary analysis members broadly shared the assessment provided by mr lane in his introduction that overall money and credit developments remained robust the annual rate of m3 growth stood at 5 6 in november 2019 broadly unchanged since august the growth of loans to firms and households remained solid benefiting from very low bank lending rates and the ongoing support provided by a highly accommodative monetary policy stance in november although the annual growth rate of loans to households had remained unchanged the annual growth rate of loans to non financial corporations had moderated likely reflecting some lagged reaction to the past weakening in the economy these developments were also visible in the results of the euro area bank lending survey for the first quarter of 2020 demand for loans to firms had weakened for the first time since 2013 and rejection rates were increasing which could indicate a further decline in credit growth in the months ahead it was cautioned however that the bank lending survey reported banks estimates of demand not actual credit growth which had remained buoyant in some countries moreover credit standards for both loans to firms and loans to households for house purchase had remained broadly unchanged pointing to still favourable credit supply conditions monetary policy stance and policy considerations on the monetary policy stance members widely shared the assessment provided by mr lane in his introduction financial conditions had remained very accommodative overall all components of financial conditions indices had loosened over the course of 2019 namely short term and long term interest rates exchange rates and equity prices the monetary policy measures decided at the governing council s september meeting were seen to have lowered term premia and contributed to the overall substantial easing in financial conditions market sentiment had turned positive and risk appetite among market participants seemed strong uncertainties were perceived as receding mainly due to reduced us china trade tensions and the recent stabilisation in the economic outlook this had led to some upward movement in risk free interest rates with no further cuts currently being priced into the forward curve the accommodative monetary policy stance continued to safeguard very favourable bank lending conditions supporting household investment demand consumers expectations about their financial situation and consumer confidence members saw indications that the governing council s september package was being gradually transmitted to the economy they expressed confidence in the capacity of the monetary policy measures to provide the necessary monetary stimulus to support the euro area expansion and the gradual build up of domestic price pressures on the two tier system for reserve remuneration it was remarked that the implementation of the tiering had worked well banks access to the targeted longer term refinancing operations tltro iii was highlighted as an additional measure that was helping preserve favourable bank lending conditions the accommodative monetary policy stance had benefited the economy by contributing to the resilience of domestic demand in particular in the services sector whereas manufacturing continued to suffer from weak global demand notably investment was being held back by international uncertainty despite the low cost of borrowing it was also recalled however that the interest rate elasticity of investment had always been low and that a lack of correlation between borrowing costs and investment demand did not mean that monetary policy was ineffective members agreed that monetary policy had to remain highly accommodative for a prolonged period of time inflation was still far away from the governing council s objective and a robust convergence of inflation towards the governing council s aim was not yet assured notwithstanding a slight uptick in underlying inflation the current monetary policy configuration was seen as appropriate and sufficient to support underlying inflation pressures and developments in headline inflation over the medium term the point was made that the recent absence of any large projection errors for core inflation should support the governing council s confidence in the robust convergence of inflation to its medium term aim while market based measures of inflation expectations had increased slightly also on the back of the accommodative monetary policy stance it was argued that risks of an unanchoring of longer term inflation expectations remained against this background all members agreed with the proposal by mr lane to keep the monetary policy stance unchanged this entailed reiterating the governing council s forward guidance on policy interest rates net asset purchases and reinvestments of principal payments a highly accommodative monetary policy stance for a prolonged period of time was seen as necessary to sustain the euro area expansion the build up of domestic price pressures and thus the robust convergence of inflation to the governing council s medium term aim it was pointed out that the measures taken in september should be given time to exert their full impact on the euro area economy in this context members highlighted the essential role of the governing council s state dependent forward guidance in providing monetary accommodation it needed to be stressed that the forward guidance formulation by tightly linking the expected future path of policy rates to an inflation outlook that was sufficiently close to but below 2 as well as a consistent rise in observed underlying inflation ensured that financial conditions adjusted in accordance with changes in the inflation outlook in addition tying the likely path of policy interest rates to inflation prospects ensured that financial conditions would not tighten prematurely purely on the back of an improving growth outlook at the same time the need to continue evaluating the pass through of the september policy decisions was highlighted also in the light of the potential side effects of the present monetary policy stimulus financial stability related risks needed to be monitored closely as potential side effects might become more pronounced in an environment with low rates and a flat yield curve persisting for a long time in this context it was noted that a shift from bank based to market based finance in combination with investors search for yield could lead to increased risk taking reference was made to equity markets where the continued rise in valuations was difficult to square with a weaker earnings outlook on both sides of the atlantic subdued profit margins and pervasive uncertainty a remark was also made that higher housing prices could lead to fragilities in the financial system which might be insufficiently addressed by macroprudential policies on communication members broadly agreed with the proposals put forward by mr lane in his introduction it needed to be emphasised that a prolonged accommodative monetary policy stance was required that monetary policy transmission was effective and that the governing council was confident that the substantial monetary policy stimulus would pass through to inflation it was pointed out that risks remained tilted to the downside although they had become less pronounced as some of the uncertainty surrounding international trade was receding although a more positive assessment of risks could foster confidence in the upswing and further support positive economic developments it was cautioned that a more optimistic outlook for the economy needed to be communicated carefully in order not to give rise to a premature tightening of financial conditions as regards the governing council s forward guidance it needed to be emphasised that it was tied to the inflation outlook and therefore an accommodative stance would be maintained until the governing council had seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to but below 2 within the projection horizon and such convergence had been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics at the same time it was felt that the governing council needed to reiterate its commitment to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate to ensure that inflation moved towards its aim in a sustained manner in line with its commitment to symmetry following members preliminary considerations at the december 2019 meeting the governing council decided to launch a review of the ecb s monetary policy strategy since the last strategy review in 2003 the euro area and global economies had been undergoing profound structural changes declining trend growth on the back of slowing productivity and an ageing population as well as the legacy of the financial crisis had driven interest rates down this had reduced the scope for the ecb and other central banks to ease monetary policy using conventional instruments in the face of adverse cyclical developments in addition addressing low inflation was different from the historical challenge of addressing high inflation the threat to environmental sustainability rapid digitalisation globalisation and evolving financial structures had further transformed the environment in which monetary policy operated including the dynamics of inflation it was emphasised that the discussion on the strategy was to be kept separate from the ongoing monetary policy deliberations and should not be perceived as constraining the governing council in its readiness to act by adjusting all of its instruments as appropriate monetary policy decisions and communication taking into account the foregoing discussion the governing council decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would remain unchanged at 0 00 0 25 and 0 50 respectively the governing council expected the key ecb interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until it had seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to but below 2 within its projection horizon and such convergence had been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics the governing council would continue to make net purchases under its asset purchase programme app at a monthly pace of 20 billion the governing council expected them to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates and to end shortly before it started raising the key ecb interest rates the governing council intended to continue reinvesting in full the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the app for an extended period of time past the date when it started raising the key ecb interest rates and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation the governing council furthermore decided to launch a review of the ecb s monetary policy strategy approving the related press release the members of the governing council subsequently finalised the introductory statement which the president and the vice president would as usual deliver at the press conference following the end of the current governing council meeting introductory statement press

and western europe recorded an adjusted ebitda of 412m and a margin of 23 5 compared to 21 6 in 2018 this sharp increase is mainly due to the rise in sales volumes within the region a positive spread on sales as well as an improvement in industrial performance leading to an increase in the adjusted ebitda margin in southern and western europe of 184 basis points recorded an adjusted ebitda of 412m

eastern europe of 87 basis points in latin america adjusted ebitda amounted to 79m representing an increase of 2 8 for a margin of 29 8 compared to 31 2 in 2018 the decline in the margin percentage was mainly due to the dilutive impact of the sharp price increases implemented during the year the significant depreciation of the argentine peso and to a lesser extent the brazilian real also had a substantial impact on this decline adjusted ebitda increased in value as a result of higher volumes higher selling prices aimed at limiting the impact of high inflation in this region as well as the overall improvement in industrial performance net income amounted to 125m and hence more than doubled compared to the 49m reported in 2018 this increase is partly due to the significant improvement in the group s profitability which was reflected in particular by a 13 2 increase in adjusted ebitda in addition the strong decrease in net finance costs results from the refinancing operations carried out during the second half of 2018 a reduction in gross debt of 217m in 2019 and the refinancing on attractive terms and conditions at the time of the ipo capital expenditure amounted to 253m

related effects and contingencies plant closure costs and other items adjusted ebitda showed sharp growth of 13 2 16 0 at constant exchange rates and scope reaching 615m this strong performance driven by verallia s three strategic pillars is mainly the result of the sales price increases implemented in order to offset inflation in the price of raw materials and energy leading to a positive spread1 at group level and in each region the continued roll out of the value based pricing policy has also led to an improvement of the product mix2 operational leverage linked to the sustained growth in volumes was offset however by the significant destocking that took place since the start of the year to support this strong growth finally the third pillar the performance action plan pap drove a net reduction in cash production costs of 41m the impact of the implementation of ifrs 16 on adjusted ebitda amounted to 20m in 2019 in line with previous estimates adjusted ebitda margin alsoincreased by 130 basis point including 78 basis point related to the application of ifrs 16 reaching 23 8 adjusted ebitda breakdown by region southern and western europe recorded an adjusted ebitda of 412m and a margin of 23 5 compared to 21 6 in 2018 this sharp increase is mainly due to the rise in sales volumes within the region a positive spread on sales as well as an improvement in industrial performance leading to an increase in the adjusted ebitda margin in southern and western europe of 184 basis points recorded an adjusted ebitda of 412m and a margin of 23 5 compared to 21 6 in 2018 this sharp increase is mainly due to the rise in sales volumes within the region a positive spread on sales as well as an improvement in industrial performance leading to an increase in the adjusted ebitda margin in southern and western europe of 184 basis points in northern and eastern europe adjusted ebitda amounted to 125m increasing its margin to 22 0 compared to 21 1 in 2018 this increase was mainly led by sales volumes growth in the area a positive spread on sales as well as an improvement in industrial performance resulting in an increase of the adjusted ebitda margin in northern and eastern europe of 87 basis points adjusted ebitda amounted to 125m increasing its margin to 22 0 compared to 21 1 in 2018 this increase was mainly led by sales volumes growth in the area a positive spread on sales as well as an improvement in industrial performance resulting in an increase of the adjusted ebitda margin in northern and eastern europe of 87 basis points in latin america adjusted ebitda amounted to 79m representing an increase of 2 8 for a margin of 29 8 compared to 31 2 in 2018 the decline in the margin percentage was mainly due to the dilutive impact of the sharp price increases implemented during the year the significant depreciation of the argentine peso and to a lesser extent the brazilian real also had a substantial impact on this decline adjusted ebitda increased in value as a result of higher volumes higher selling prices aimed at limiting the impact of high inflation in this region as well as the overall improvement in industrial performance net income amounted to 125m and hence more than doubled compared to the 49m reported in 2018 this increase is partly due to the significant improvement in the group s profitability which was reflected in particular by a 13 2 increase in adjusted ebitda in addition the strong decrease in net finance costs results from the refinancing operations carried out during the second half of 2018 a reduction in gross debt of 217m in 2019 and the refinancing on attractive terms and conditions at the time of the ipo capital expenditure amounted to 253m including 207m of recurring investments namely 8 of consolidated revenue and 46m of strategic investments mainly relating to the completion of the investment in brazil for the construction of a new facility in jacutinga state of minas gerais as well as part of the construction works taking place in italy new furnace in villa poma and in spain new furnace in azuqueca regarding the two strategic investments in villa poma and azuqueca mentioned above almost all of the cash out payment will take place in the first half of 2020 with a startup planned at the same time operating cash flow came in higher at 408m versus 301m in 2018 driven by the sharp growth in adjusted ebitda and a significant improvement in operating working capital requirement despite the strong increase in revenue at its meeting today the verallia board of directors decided to propose the payment of a dividend of 0 85 per share in cash for the 2019 financial year corresponding to an overall amount of 100m as announced during the ipo this amount will be subject to approval

elsewhere taiwan s january export orders tumbled 12 8 nearly twice the decline economists forecast in december export orders rose by 0 9 the australian dollar was sold to new 10 year lows following the january employment report but we suspect that it was more about the broader developments that the jobs data itself the unemployment rate did tick up to 5 3 from 5 1 but reflected partly the increase in the participation rate 61 1 vs 61 0 full time jobs surged by 46 2k this is the most since last march it contrasts with the 12 month moving average that is closer to 12k part time positions fell by nearly 33k perhaps the most troubling part of the report was the 0 4 decline in hours worked the takeaway is that the market boosted the likelihood of a rate cut around the middle of the year

cautious optimism over afcfta trading under the african continental free trade agreement afcfta begins on july 1 the trade deal is expected to open the wider african market for local manufacturers creating a market of 1 2 billion people with a combined gdp of about 2 5 trillion however five months to its implementation manufacturers are cautiously optimistic they fear without addressing the dearth of infrastructure and market information asymmetry they may not be competitive under the deal assistant editor chikodi okereocha reports the momentum is building up across the 55 african countries manufacturers anticipation of the phenomenal opportunity for increased global competitiveness promised by the african continental free trade agreement afcfta is palpable as trading under the historic agreement takes off in about five months precisely july 1 but while manufacturers in other african countries are hopeful and gearing up to compete under a liberalised african market nigerian manufacturers appear less excited by the prospects of leveraging the trade deal to become globally competitive the nation learnt that manufacturers optimism over the soon to be implemented afcfta may have indeed been measured largely due to fears that the country s decrepit infrastructure and market information asymmetry may hurt their chances of benefiting optimally from the agreement the manufacturers association of nigeria man president mansur ahmed confirmed this fear when he said as the continent awaits the take off of afcfta in july the federal government must address the supply side constraints of lack of infrastructure if the gains of the afcfta must be realised ahmed who spoke at the 2020 man annual media luncheon in lagos also said policies and regulations must be business friendly in order to assist businesses to grow and ultimately enhance competitiveness and boost the economies of nigeria and other partnering african countries afcfta seeks to create a continental trade bloc of 1 2 billion people with a combined gross domestic product gdp of about 2 5 trillion the deal seen as an important milestone in promoting africa s regional integration and helping to increase intra african trade commits countries to removing tariffs on 90 per cent of goods and to liberalise services its main objective was to create a single continental market for goods and services with free movement of business persons and investments president muhammadu buhari signed the agreement on july 7 last year in niamey niger republic at the 12th extraordinary session of the assembly of the african union au on afcfta it was signed after 16 months of foot dragging during which the government said it needed to thoroughly consider the deal and country wide sensitisation and consultation of stakeholders the delay in signing the deal came after members of the organised private sector ops particularly manufacturers opposed the move they had warned the federal government not to sign the policy document as doing so will cripple the economy and leave more nigerians unemployed many of them expressed fears that the deal will be injurious to the nation s industrial sector and the economy generally they argued for instance that the agreement will turn nigeria into a dumping ground for imported foreign goods they insisted that the likely negative impacts of the agreement on private businesses and the economy far outweigh its supposed benefits however proponents of the free trade deal kicked their heels in insisting that afcfta the world s largest free trade area since the creation of the world trade organisation wto in 1994 will for instance boost intra african trade by about 60 per cent by 2022 currently intra african trade is put at just 16 per cent of its total trade compared with 19 per cent in latin america 51 per cent in asia 54 per cent in north america and 70 per cent in europe african countries according to experts are not trading among themselves their fundamental role in global trade has been to provide raw commodities in exchange for manufactured goods for instance the president of african export import bank afreximbank prof benedict oramah said africa is the continent that trades the least with itself despite the strong relationship between intra regional trade and industrial development and economic progress oramah who spoke at a meeting of man in lagos said afcfta is expected to bring the share of intra african trade to 22 per cent by 2022 up from about 16 per cent it will also bring total intra african trade to about 250 billion from about 160 billion speaking on from commodities to a global manufacturing hub the road ahead for nigeria the afreximbank boss added that since manufactures account for about 60 per cent of total intra african trade intra regional trade in manufactures can rise to more than 150 billion by 2022 while noting that the opportunity for african manufacturers is therefore phenomenal oramah specifically said that the preferences that afcfta offers can make nigerian manufactured goods more competitive in many african markets and can also make it possible for integration into regional and global supply chains he said a cotton yarn producer in nigeria can for example become a supplier to a fabric manufacturer in senegal replacing yarn imports from asia and as capacity is gained in the context of intra regional trade manufacturers can expect to gradually become competitive globally that is not all the president of the premier institution driving african integration and trade also said the rising middle class in the country and africa as well as the rapid urbanisation will expand demand for manufactured goods according to him it is projected that nigeria s urban population will reach 264 million by 2030 which is equal to 15 per cent of the projected population in that year these will spur demand for critical infrastructure housing processed food fast moving consumer goods fmcgs and a host of other light manufactures it is the manufacturing industry that will supply these items related to the foregoing is the gradual exit of china from labour intensive light manufacturing today nigeria and africa import 1 billion and 43 billion of light manufactures from china as china shifts to more capital intensive manufacturing due to rising labour costs those goods have to be supplied by somebody nigeria and indeed the entire african continent will have themselves to blame if this projected supply gap is filled from outside the continent oramah said dearth of infrastructure others given the fragile nature of nigeria s economy it is doubtful if the manufacturing sector is in any position to fill the projected supply gap with the economy lacking in key infrastructure the sector is too fragile to become competitive under the afcfta or even withstand competition from other countries ahmed perhaps put the situation in perspective when he said we cannot achieve competitiveness without the provision of infrastructure such as good road networks and electricity not only within african countries but also across the borders there is also the aspect of provision of soft infrastructure like visa tariffs and foreign exchange that will help ease the process of carrying out business transactions between countries we must address all these issues since the afcfta is not just about trade in goods but also trade in services according to him modern industry competitiveness depends to a great extent on provision of adequate and efficient infrastructure from the availability of power and energy to transport and logistics the role of infrastructure cannot be overemphasised in trade and economic development on the continent he said for instance while pointing out that transportation is vital to enhancing competitiveness in trade the man chief said due to poor infrastructure it will cost a business owner in nigeria more to transport goods from lagos to kano than it will cost a chinese business owner to transport the same goods from china to lagos the man boss also said electricity is a vital input for manufacturing process to the extent that it constitutes up to 40 per cent of production cost he therefore said increasing the tariff of this core input will have drastic negative effect on the gross national product gnp gdp disposable income consumption consumer price index employment and government revenue from corporate taxation and others however the lack of infrastructure is not peculiar to nigeria the problem cuts across most if not all the 55 african countries the continent s infrastructure needs according to afreximbank is between 130 and 170 billion yearly with a financing gap in the range of between 70billion and 110 billion yet nigeria s share of the continent s huge infrastructure gap is mind boggling for instance the financial derivatives company fdc said the country requires 15 billion about n4 59 trillion worth of investments yearly for 15 years to adequately develop her infrastructure nationwide the research firm in its bi monthly economic and business report for february 2018 said nigeria s under investment in infrastructure has left it with a core stock of infrastructure of just 20 per cent to 25 per cent of gdp compared to an average of 70 per cent of the gdp for more advanced middle income countries of similar size the fdc said bridging this gap will require investing about 15 billion yearly for the next 15 years asking given the government s limited access to international debt revenue constraints and competing priorities the major question is where will funding be sourced the firm said one of the biggest constraints to nigeria s competitiveness economic growth and diversification is the crippling infrastructure deficit estimated at 300 billion about n30 trillion by the african development bank afdb when considered that nigeria according to the vice president prof yemi osinbajo spent n2 7 trillion on infrastructure in 2016 and 2017 fiscal years for instance the challenge infrastructure gap poses to nigeria s competitiveness in global trade comes into bold relief the senior manager intra african trade initiative afreximbank gainmore zanamwe said because of the poor state of trade related infrastructure and weak transit and logistics infrastructure transport costs are 63 per cent higher in africa compared to the average in developed economies zanamwe also said poor trade facilitation was responsible for the low intra african trade according to him it takes up to 12 days to clear goods in some african borders as compared to an average of two days in developed countries and costs around 450 per day he added that because of supply side constraints the continent s level of industrialisation remained low and as a result the range of goods available for trade is limited and this gap is then filled by other countries outside the continent zanamwe listed other constraints to include lack of internationally accredited quality infrastructure and harmonised trade standards low implementation of regional trade commitments and limited access to trade finance among others
with brent d griffiths the ticker mike bloomberg got an ugly reception from his 2020 democratic rivals on his first national debate stage they turned the former new york mayor into an avatar for out

situation where in the last three years billionaires in this country saw an 850 billion increase in their wealth congratulations mr bloomberg but the average american last year saw less than a 1 percent increase in his or her income he said bloomberg replied that he couldn t speak for all billionaires all i know is i ve been very lucky made a lot of money and i m giving it all away to make this country better and he defended how much he s made i worked very hard for it he said it was a missed opportunity for bloomberg to talk up his plan to raise 5 trillion from higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations or plug the wall street reform plan he released this week to qualified but mostly positive reviews from industry critics advertisement but he returned to the broader issue of inequality and democratic prescriptions for it several minutes later what a wonderful country we have the best known socialist in the country happens to be a millionaire with three houses he said of sanders what did i miss here and he said while he disagrees with warren s proposal to impose a wealth tax on net worths greater than 50 million with a surcharge on those worth more than 1 billion he does back higher taxes on top incomes we should raise taxes on the rich i did that as mayor in new york city i raised taxes he said and if you take a look at my plans the first thing i would do is try to convince congress because they ve got to do it we can t just order it to roll back trump s tax cuts mostly though bloomberg s presence served to unify a cast of candidates that was otherwise as

watch advertisement white house advisers float minimum tax on corporations economic advisers to the white house have suggested propose a new minimum tax on corporations as part of his election year tax cut 2 0 package two people briefed on the planning said hoping to address criticism that the 2017 tax law allowed many of the country s largest firms to virtually eliminate their federal tax burden my colleague jeff stein reports the idea which is part of preliminary discussions and has not been officially endorsed could attempt to blunt criticism from democrats that the gop tax law allowed many large corporations to wipe out their federal corporate taxes altogether the plan could also help generate revenue that might be used to offset the impact of new middle class tax cuts trump has promised he would roll out a middle class tax plan before the 2020 presidential election the 2017 tax law lowered the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent but it allowed companies to continuing using loopholes and tax breaks to lower their taxes even further the tax law also eliminated the corporate alternative minimum tax which was supposed to prevent companies from overusing deductions to avoid paying any taxes this could be seen as a big admission proposing a minimum tax on corporations could be interpreted by critics as an extraordinary admission by the white house that its 2017 tax cut went too far in slashing business rates the potential tax plan also underscores the enormous political and policy challenges the white house will face in crafting a second tax cut proposal in time for the 2020 election in part because the white house appears to have overestimated the economic benefits that would result from the 2017 law barr raises possibility tech

looms in the trade conversation you may have missed it amid headlines of the u s trade war with china but a low intensity trade conflict with asia s other emerging giant is also smoldering it began a

steel duties greg ip writes in the wall street journal trump travels to india next week where he may reach some sort of truce with prime minister narendra modi but the underlying conflict will likely persist because it is driven by forces similar to those behind the trade war with china in essence modi seeks to replicate the formula that made china the world s no 2 economy by welcoming foreign

sites the company does not include an allocation of corporate and administrative and share based compensation expenses to the mine sites 4 cost of sales includes mining and processing costs royalties and amortization expense and is calculated based on the mid point of guidance the company s long term strategic objective is to generate increasing returns for its shareholders through low cost production and free cash flow growth from its existing operations and portfolio of development projects the company was successful in achieving these objectives in 2019 with production of 494 500 ounces of gold and a 10 reduction in total cash costs driving record operating cash flow in addition the company made substantial progress on its growth initiatives having completed construction of the low cost cerro pelon mine in mexico and advancing construction of the lower mine expansion at young davidson with several significant near term positive catalysts 2020 is expected to be a transformational year for alamos these include the recently announced substantial increase in high grade mineral reserves and resources at island gold the phase iii expansion study of island gold which is expected to be competed in june and demonstrate a larger very profitable long life operation the completion of the lower mine expansion at young davidson which remains on track for june and the transition to strong company wide free cash flow starting in the second half of 2020 production is expected to temporarily decrease in 2020 to between 425 000 and 465 000 ounces of gold this reflects the previously guided lower production from young davidson during the first half of 2020 while completing the tie in of the upper and lower mines as well as the end of production at el chanate total cash cost guidance of 770 to 810 per ounce and aisc guidance of 1 020 to 1 060 per ounce are temporarily higher reflecting lower gold production at young davidson during the tie in period in the first half of 2020 gold production in the first quarter of 2020 is expected to be within a range of 105 000 to 110 000 ounces consistent with annual guidance costs are expected to be higher in the first half of 2020 and decrease in the second half with the completion of the lower mine tie in at young davidson in 2021 production is expected to increase to approximately 500 000 ounces at lower costs driven by higher mining and production rates at young davidson the construction of the lower mine infrastructure at young davidson is in the final stages the tie in of the lower mine recently commenced and remains on schedule to be completed in june 2020 during this previously guided downtime of the northgate shaft ore will be trucked to surface from the upper mine at a rate of approximately 2 500 tpd given the lower production rate and a full workforce to support ongoing development during this period total cash costs and mine site aisc are expected to increase significantly in the first half of the year following completion of the tie in underground mining rates are anticipated to increase from approximately 6 500 tpd to a rate of 7 500 tpd by the end of 2020 this is expected to drive young davidson production higher and costs significantly lower in the second half of 2020 capital spending at young davidson in 2020 is expected to be between 75 and 85 million down from 2019 levels capital spending is expected to be lower during the second half of 2020 with approximately 60 of the capital budget planned for the first half of the year to complete the lower mine expansion combined with higher production and lower costs young davidson is expected to generate strong free cash flow in the second half of 2020 higher mining rates are expected to drive annual gold production to approximately 200 000 ounces at lower costs in 2021 gold production at island gold in 2020 is expected to be marginally lower than 2019 with higher throughput offset by lower grades mined grades are expected to be higher during the first half of 2020 and lower during the second half of the year reflecting mine sequencing total cash costs and mine site all in sustaining costs are expected to increase slightly from 2019 capital spending at island gold is expected to be between 50 and 60 million in 2020 excluding capitalized exploration the company is undertaking a number of projects to support the growing operation and mine life this includes an expansion of the tailings facility and the construction of a new administration building dry facility and underground workshop the company is currently conducting a phase iii expansion study at island gold beyond 1 200 tpd which is expected to be completed during the second quarter of 2020 this study will incorporate the recently released 2019 year end mineral reserve and resource update for island gold which included substantial growth in mineral reserves and resources the company expects this study will demonstrate island gold as a larger more profitable long life operation a total of 21 million has been budgeted in 2020 for surface and underground exploration at island gold to follow up on ongoing exploration success the 2020 program will be focused on continuing to define new near mine mineral resources across the two kilometre long island gold main zone which remains open laterally and down plunge across multiple areas of focus production from the mulatos district in 2020 is expected to be consistent with long term guidance of 150 000 to 160 000 ounces of gold ore will be mined and stacked from multiple sources in 2020 including the mulatos el victor and san carlos open pits as well as the newly constructed cerro pelon mine in addition the crushing and stacking of surface stockpiles will ramp up through the year as mining activities wind down in the san carlos and el victor pits in the first half of 2020 total cash costs are expected to increase slightly from 2019 reflecting the processing of lower recovery stockpiles which carry non cash historical inventory costs resulting in a higher reported cash cost per ounce mine site all in sustaining costs are also expected to increase due to higher sustaining capital mainly related to waste stripping activities at cerro pelon capital spending across the mulatos district is expected to total 20 to 25 million the majority of which is sustaining capital the company expects to make a construction decision on the la yaqui grande project during the second quarter of 2020 la yaqui grande is fully permitted having received the approval of the environmental impact assessment during the second quarter of 2019 and the change in land use permit in july 2019 capital spending on the company s development projects and capitalized exploration at existing operations is expected to total 35 million in 2020 the majority of this spending will be focused on exploration at island gold and exploration permitting and development activities at lynn lake with 183 million of cash and cash equivalents no debt and growing cash flow from its operations the company is well positioned to fund its internal growth

prices for the year ended december 31 2019 revenues of 262 1 million were 25 8 million higher than the prior year attributable to a 2 increase in ounces sold as well as higher realized prices cost of sales which includes mining and processing costs royalties and amortization expense of 59 4 million in the fourth quarter were consistent with the comparative quarter of 2018 as were underground mining costs of cad 51 per tonne cost of sales for the year ended december 31 2019 were 231 1 million slightly lower than the prior year period due to lower mining costs per tonne and lower tonnes processed total cash costs of 766 per ounce in the fourth quarter were consistent with the comparative period and in line with annual guidance total cash costs improved significantly in the fourth quarter compared to the first half of the year as a result of higher grades mined and lower mining and milling costs for the year ended december 31 2019 total cash costs of 800 per ounce were 3 lower than the prior year period and slightly above guidance total cash costs are expected to be higher in the first half of 2020 due to lower production during the lower mine tie in decreasing significantly in the second half of the year mine site aisc of 1 083 per ounce in the fourth quarter were higher than the comparative quarter of 2019 and higher than annual guidance reflecting the timing of sustaining capital expenditures mine site aisc for the year were 1 047 per ounce above guidance as a result of higher sustaining capital expenditures capital expenditures were 27 0 million in the fourth quarter this included 16 4 million of sustaining capital and 10 6 million of growth capital growth capital spending was focused on construction of the new tia1 tailings facility and continued lower mine construction for the full year capital expenditures of 99 9 million were focused on lower mine construction lateral development in the upper and lower mines and construction of the new tia1 tailings facility capital spending was above guidance due to additional grouting requirements and a change in scope of the new tailings facility from an upstream to a centreline design young davidson generated 11 9 million of mine site free cash flow in the fourth quarter significantly higher than the same period of 2018 due to a higher gold price and improved operating costs for the full year mine site free cash flow was 12 8 million generating a return after self financing the lower mine expansion since the acquisition of young davidson in 2015 the mine has generated operating cash flow of 467 4 million and invested 420 0 million in capital expenditures the majority of which has been focused on the lower mine expansion with declining capital spending following the completion of the lower mine expansion in june 2020 and a corresponding increase in gold production and lower operating costs young davidson is expected to generate strong free cash flow starting in

of 186 0 million a 14 increase from the prior year period due to an increase in realized gold prices the average realized gold price in the quarter was 1 463 per ounce compared to 1 244 per ounce in the prior year period cost of sales were 136 0 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 a 34 decrease compared to the prior year period primarily due to the prior year including a 64 0 million non cash inventory impairment charge at el chanate mining and processing costs were 87 4 million compared to 96 2 million in the prior year period this decline was attributable to lower operating costs at island gold and young davidson and the completion of mining activities at el chanate in the fourth quarter of 2018 consolidated total cash costs for the quarter were 722 per ounce compared to 770 per ounce in the prior year period a 6 decrease driven by low cost production growth at island gold aisc were 972 per ounce in the quarter 11 per ounce lower than the prior year period driven by lower total cash costs partially offset by higher sustaining capital spending royalty expense was 4 4 million in the quarter lower than the prior year period of 4 8 million as the 5 mulatos royalty commitment ceased in the first quarter of 2019 partially offset by a higher number of ounces sold at island gold and higher realized gold prices amortization of 44 2 million in the quarter was consistent with the prior year period expense of 42 1 million amortization of 348 per ounce was in line with guidance the company recognized earnings from operations of 41 6 million in the quarter higher than the prior year period due to higher realized gold prices combined with lower mining and processing expense driving stronger margins further the prior year period included a 64 0 million non cash inventory impairment charge at el chanate which impacted earnings in 2018 the company reported net earnings of 38 0 million in the quarter compared to net loss of 71 5 million in the same period of 2018 the increase in earnings is due to stronger operating margins the benefit of foreign exchange gains recorded within deferred taxes as well as the prior year period impacted by the non cash inventory impairment charge at el chanate on an adjusted basis earnings of 32 1 million or 0 08 per share increased compared to the prior year driven by higher realized gold prices and improved costs adjusted earnings reflect adjustments for one time gains and losses as well as foreign exchange movements related to the canadian dollar and mexican peso which generated a foreign exchange gain

of gold for record revenue of 683 1 million a 5 increase compared to 2018 this was primarily driven by higher realized gold prices and record production at island gold partially offset by less ounces sold at mulatos and el chanate which transitioned to residual leaching at the end of 2018 revenue benefited from a higher realized gold price of 1 381 per ounce compared to 1 278 per ounce in 2018 a 52 5 million impact cost of sales were 521 4 million in 2019 compared to 639 4 million in 2018 as the prior year included a 64 0 million non cash inventory impairment charge at el chanate cost of sales was also driven lower by lower mining and processing costs royalties and amortization charges mining and processing costs decreased to 339 0 million in 2019 from 387 2 million in the prior year primarily due to lower operating costs at young davidson and mulatos which drove down total cash costs in addition mining and processing costs decreased significantly at el chanate as mining activities ceased in the fourth quarter of 2018 consolidated total cash costs per ounce decreased 10 in 2019 to 720 per ounce compared to 802 per ounce in the prior year the decline in total cash costs was driven by low cost production growth at island gold and lower operating costs and higher grades mined at both young davidson and mulatos aisc decreased to 951 per ounce in 2019 from 989 per ounce in the prior year the decrease was primarily driven by the reduction in total cash costs partially offset by higher sustaining capital spending at young davidson royalty expense was 17 4 million in 2019 a 19 decrease compared to 21 6 million in 2018 primarily due to a lower royalty obligation at mulatos with the completion of the third party royalty commitment in the first quarter of 2019 amortization of 165 0 million in 2019 was lower than the prior year due to fewer ounces sold on a per ounce basis amortization was 334 per ounce in line with guidance and slightly higher than the prior year due to a higher proportion of sales coming from island gold and young davidson which include higher amortization charges the company recognized earnings from operations of 126 0 million in 2019 compared to loss of 22 6 million in 2018 the substantial increase in earnings from operations was driven by higher gold prices and increased production from island gold which generates stronger margins further the prior year included a 64 0 million non cash inventory impairment charge at el chanate the company reported net earnings of 96 1 million in 2019 compared to a net loss of 72 6 million in 2018 driven by improved margins and the 2018 inventory impairment charge at el chanate on an adjusted basis earnings of 83 5 million or 0 21 per share for the year were 326 higher than in

and probable reserves u s investors are cautioned not to assume that any part of measured or indicated resources will ever be converted into economically or legally mineable proven or probable reserves the estimation of inferred resources may not form the basis of a feasibility or other economic studies and involves far greater uncertainty as to their existence and economic viability than the estimation of other categories of resources non gaap measures and additional gaap measures the company has included certain non gaap financial measures to supplement its consolidated financial

private company aqua i worked on an intergovernmental agreement that moved the community of fairmont over to joliet s public water system saving residents from high water bills and lead poisoning for reference aqua is the same company that poisoned residents of university park i also advanced the idea that will county public buildings should be powered by 100 renewable energy sources this fight continues i have enjoyed my time on the will county board and i like seeing my actions make a difference but i have also learned that big problems cannot be solved from the board i have spoken to constituents who have lost loved ones because of our dysfunctional healthcare system and they have no one to turn to in washington d c people need someone who is willing to take on the entrenched for profit healthcare system moreover big oil is now trying to draft solutions to the climate crisis like the use it act another fossil fuel bailout and my opponent is going along with it by co sponsoring this bad legislation name a problem that working families struggle with and someone in washington is buying off lawmakers to keep that system exactly as it is broken voters of the 11th congressional district would be better served by someone who has made significant accomplishments in a short amount of time and who is rejecting corporate pac money i ran my last race with the tagline no strings attached as a team we knocked on 10 000 doors even though we were outspent 3 1 we won by 11 points against the other democrat and 8 points against the republican america needs congressmen and congresswomen who are not bought and paid for people who want to serve and people who can change the system before the system changes them my ability to win elections by building an organization that does not depend on campaign funding from wealthy donors is one of the key elements necessary to restoring our democracy my votes on the will county board have proven that i will continue to fight for my constituents even when it isn t politically popular like when i voted no on the gas tax what are your highest priorities for illinois and the nation while we must address the climate crisis and healthcare the growing wealth gap in america is the issue that seems to resurface again and again when i talk to voters at their doors for senior citizens who are living on a fixed income and living in poverty i support the scrap the cap approach that would keep social security solvent until 2078 currently earnings above 137 700 are not subject to a social security payroll tax by lifting the cap we can safeguard future generations and allow social security checks to keep pace with inflation this would affect 1 5 of wage earners many of them are millionaires and billionaires for many other people the issue is poverty and low wages passing the green new deal will not only move us off fossil fuels but allow us to pass a 15 hour living wage that is indexed to inflation a federal jobs guarantee will create living wage jobs as we transition america to wind solar and hydropower for some it is a choice between paying the mortgage or paying for healthcare i talked to one woman who chose to lose her house so she could pay 250 000 in doctor bills she still owes some money on those bills as a solution i am supporting medicare for all as the simplest to implement and most affordable way to cover the cost of healthcare for all americans for some residents the wealth gap makes it more difficult to pay for a college education and give their kids a debt free start in life as a solution i support fully funding education from pre k through college a substantial number of residents in illinois 11th congressional district have a criminal background because joliet is a prison town once someone has a record they will forever have a hard time getting a job let alone get a good paying job for these individuals to have a shot at the american dream we need serious criminal justice reform like eliminating mandatory minimums getting rid of cash bail and sealing people s records who have already served their time when americans have better paying jobs healthcare and more time with family they have a higher quality of life we all deserve a government that strives towards this common goal ai2html blurb iframe min width 100 width 280px var pymparent new pym parent nav list immigration if you could fix longstanding problems with this country s immigration system what would you do i would pass a reasonable pathway to citizenship for those who are living working and paying taxes in the united states we must also create a humane policy for refugees who come to our borders asking for assistance the idea that we would separate children from their parents and cage human beings like animals crosses a moral threshold that should offend every american to be clear i oppose any and all for profit prisons we know that unscrupulous businesses often exploit undocumented workers who have very few rights in the workplace the business interest in cheap labor drives undocumented workers into our workforce because congress has yet to pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill that will offer a path toward citizenship to people who are living and working here these workers remain undocumented undercutting wages and making it more difficult to collectively bargain this is an issue that should be uniting americans if undocumented workers have a reasonable path toward citizenship the exploitation would stop and the undercutting of wages would strengthen our economy for all workers increased penalties for companies who exploit undocumented workers should include jail time the one area that has not been leveraged as part of the national immigration debate is trade the most recent trade deal with mexico did push for a national average of 16 hour for mexico the reality is that people are migrating to the united states because we have a more democratic form of government more economic opportunities and a higher standard of living we can use global trade agreements to leverage other countries to raise their standards of living by making human rights women s rights workers rights and a democratic form of government a prerequisite for tariff free trade agreements these trade agreements should have higher environmental standards included entitlement programs are you prepared to take up real reform to social security and medicare to ensure their future solvency what specific reforms and cuts to entitlements would you be willing to support the american taxpayer is entitled to their social security and medicare benefits because they paid into these systems their entire lives it is unconscionable that anyone would even suggest cutting these benefits we need to go in the opposite direction and scrap the cap on social security meaning ending the practice of exempting earned income above 137 700 from the social security tax when the wealthiest of americans pay their fair share then we can make sure that the program is solvent for future generations too additionally all social security revenue should be protected from discretionary spending borrowing by congress i will oppose any privatization schemes that would give wall street greater influence over people s earned social security payments on medicare i support an improved expanded medicare for all system that would keep this program solvent and cover all americans please see my answer to question 5 health care what is the government s obligation if any to help american workers secure health insurance do you support the creation or continuation of a program such as medicare for all or obamacare do you have a different idea if you support a government related insurance plan how would you pay for it i support a medicare for all system that would replace all premiums co pays and deductibles with a smaller payroll tax that is often estimated to be about half the cost of premiums and co pays it would be a health care system and not insurance against getting sick medicare for all is a tax cut even after the affordable care act aca was passed america still has 29 million uninsured citizens and millions more who are under insured those who have access to care can hardly call it affordable and many people avoid going to the doctor at all even for check ups which can prevent future illness the simplest way to fix our healthcare system is to replace overpriced private health insurance with an improved and expanded medicare for all americans system you would still have unlimited options when choosing your primary care physician dentist eye doctor or specialty care providers all medically necessary procedures would be covered including emergency room visits i had a very similar system as a military spouse for ten years of my life military families are eligible for tricare a system that operates similar to but simpler than medicare i was able to go to any private doctor of my choosing and tricare a government insurance system paid the bill this is a centrist and popular position two recent polls august 2018 and may 2019 show that over 70 of americans want a medicare for all system but if it is so popular why are lawmakers not listening and jumping on board why are some candidates and voters still calling this an extreme position and using scare tactics to frame the debate according to opensecrets org big pharma and the for profit health care system spent 24 million buying influence over democratic lawmakers and they spent 30 million buying influence over republican lawmakers in the last election cycle it is no wonder we have such a rigged system that results in 40 000 deaths each and every year because american citizens couldn t afford private insurance it is time we say enough with insurance and pharmaceutical companies profiting from the suffering and deaths of others health care is a human right foreign policy what security role should the u s play in world affairs the united states should continue to be a member of the united nations continue to play the role of world leader and avoid unilateral military conflicts unless directly attacked any military or humanitarian intervention should be carried out with our allies reserving military force as a last resort the most recent assassination of an iranian military general by president trump underscores the need for greater congressional oversight and enforcement of the 1973 war powers act congress needs to reserve the power of the purse and use it to influence the decisions of any president democrat or republican instead my opponent voted down amendments that would have strengthened congressional oversight and he voted to increase the national defense authorization act by 22 billion dollars to a total of 738 billion annually congress needs to overturn the authorization for use of military force aumf that is a product of the 2001 attack on the world trade center it is outdated and gives too much power to the executive branch finally i want to share a different vison for how the united states can work toward world peace the issue that affects all of us is the climate crisis and it needs to be tackled as a global problem with the united states first addressing co2 emissions at home other countries like england france germany and austria have already taken the lead in moving away from fossil fuels these countries draw nearly 40 of their electricity from renewable sources while the united states is still around 17 we could be a forward thinking leader in addressing the climate crisis shift our resources to renewable energy development and use trade agreements to leverage co2 reduction plans from growing industrialized countries like india and china instead of spending 38 billion of u s taxpayers money arming other countries in the middle east we should spend that money getting off of fossil fuels economy unemployment is at a 50 year low and economic growth is steady assess the state of the economy and tell us how you would improve economic prospects for americans while some prefer to use the word red hot to describe the united states economy i choose the word unstable while wall street is doing quite well and unemployment is low we also need to look at the enormous wealth gap in the united states the monolithic and growing amount of personal and student debt the fact that many families are working two or more jobs and still struggling to pay for health insurance or basic necessities with fewer and fewer families even investing in the stock market growing debt coupled with temporary and unstable employment create a situation that could quickly spiral out of control according to a harvard princeton study published in 2016 94 of all new job growth from 2005 2015 in the united states was defined as alternative work arrangements alternative work is broadly defined as temporary agency workers on call workers contract company workers and independent contractors or freelancers quite simply these are not stable good paying jobs which means that our economy is increasingly balanced on the head of a pin americans are now buried in nearly 14 trillion of personal and consumer debt this includes 1 5 trillion in student loan debt 1 1 trillion in credit card debt 1 3 trillion in auto loans and 9 5 trillion on mortgages the level of consumer debt continues to rise and the only thing preventing another crash is a low default rate any shift in the job market could change things overnight the best way to reduce debt and bring stability to the economy is by closing the wealth gap and strengthening the middle class currently the three wealthiest men in america jeff bezos bill gates and warren buffet own more wealth than the bottom 50 of america the top 10 controls more wealth than the bottom 70 the wealthy have become rich by underpaying their workers and shifting the burden of household sustainability onto the u s taxpayer in the form of subsidized housing medicaid and food stamps the solution is multi faceted and includes increasing the minimum wage to 15 hour indexed to inflation passing medicare for all replacing corporate bailouts to fossil fuel companies with a massive green jobs package erasing student debt and passing union card check legislation that would allow more americans to join unions increased levels of economic instability lead to a poor quality of life increased stress levels increased mental health problems and all of this parlays into some of the other problems we are noticing in our society like gun violence increased suicide rates and chemical addictions we need to stop using wall street success as the only measure of prosperity in the united states my opponent isn t even talking about the wealth gap because he is a multi millionaire who has benefited from owning a non union company climate change what measures if any to combat climate change do you support unless we focus on energy efficiency green building electric cars and renewable sources of energy like wind solar and hydro our dependence on fossil fuels will eventually make earth uninhabitable the green new deal would provide significant resources to homeowners and municipalities to transition to renewable fuels and make residential and commercial buildings energy efficient the plan provides job training and a living stipend for those workers who will transition from work in oil refineries to work in solar farms wind farms or carbon farms when ocean and air temperatures increase arctic ice melts this past june greenland lost two gigatons of ice and last spring scientists started reporting that the permafrost is melting at an accelerated rate 70 years earlier than predicted the 2018 intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc report says that we now have 11 years to act before the damage to our planet is irreversible the degradation to our atmosphere is caused by greenhouse gasses largely methane and co2 from the burning of fossil fuels there is no question that we depend on oil and gasoline to get us to and from work every day heat our homes and power our nation new green energy jobs will be well paying union jobs on the transportation side we will have to subsidize the transition to electric vehicles and eventually rebuild our entire infrastructure to use high speed rails or other new innovations the green new deal is massive in scope and spending but we have the money and we have done this before in the same way that americans pulled together to address the crisis of the great depression and world war ii i believe that we will pull together once again we pulled ourselves out of the great depression with the new deal by investing heavily in public works and infrastructure projects that put americans to work rebuilding our nation we have the money consider that the fossil fuel industry receives 20 billion in subsidies every year consider that we have spent close to 5 trillion to fund an ongoing series of wars in the middle east to keep oil flowing to the u s consider the cost of climate related natural disaster level hurricanes since hurricane katrina that have cost 537 billion in damages not to mention the savings in reduced household expenses on utilities and transportation costs indeed it is time we are prudent with our tax dollars and spend this money much more sensibly on the people and planet the climate crisis is our great depression it s our wwii it s our responsibility and challenge to overcome i believe that our generation will write our names in history as the generation that took on fossil fuels and mass pollution to create a sustainable future for the human race gun laws describe briefly your position on how to balance the 2nd amendment and gun safety gun regulation alone will not address some of the root causes of gun violence some of the compounding issues around gun violence include an absence of economic opportunities for the majority of americans the nation should treat this issue as a health crisis not just a regulatory issue i do support the 2nd amendment and have a foid card but the section of the constitution that is missing is the well regulated part we need to ban assault weapons at the national level and i would support national background checks i think that gun owners should be required to take a gun safety class prior to obtaining a gun license similar to taking drivers education classes before getting a driver s permit congress just appropriated 25 million to study gun violence i think that any new gun laws could be passed with a 10 year sunset clause to give those who are studying gun violence time to evaluate the effectiveness of new laws if the law is found ineffective or makes gun violence worse this would enable ongoing review and changes as necessary more when have you shown independence from your party on an issue of major import most recently i was the lone democratic no vote for a 4 cent gas tax increase i spent months urging the democratic caucus to offer a small property tax rebate for homeowners in will county to offset the tax hike will county is home to centerpoint the largest inland port in the world the warehouse district attracts elevated levels of truck traffic that destroy our county and municipal roads the gas tax would have generated revenue from diesel sales which i agree with however it would have hurt working people who are already paying for the increased damage to our roads party leaders ignored my initiatives and pushed forward during the meeting in which we voted on the gas tax residents came out to complain and some board members said that they would revisit the property tax relief idea therefore i am continuing to explore these options for constituents i ran my last campaign against the democratic party s wishes and beat their hand picked insider who had an incredible amount of support from organized labor and outspent me 3 1 i was opposing another warehouse expansion project called northpoint that would once again offer tax abatements to the warehouses and cost taxpayers more money to repair roads i have continued to be a voice for the voters in my district and opposed this type of expansion instead pushing for better developments in housing and innovations that would provide not just living wage jobs more housing options but also quality of life with environmental protections if you are an incumbent tell us the most significant accomplishment of your current term if you are a newcomer tell us how you as a rookie would keep from being a backbencher beating a 5 term incumbent and multi millionaire will give me a powerful voice and a national fundraising apparatus to get through the general election once elected i intend to join the progressive caucus and work with caucus leaders to leverage leadership positions on core committees as a mathematician and data analyst i will work to use my skillset to be an effective leader within the caucus and answer the question how are we going to pay for it finally there is an existing climate solutions caucus in congress that is almost entirely focused on the tax and dividend plan i will be working with other members who are concerned about the climate crisis in general to form a new climate caucus that considers support for other pieces of legislation to address the climate crisis lastly i believe we must have campaign finance reform all levels of government are heavily influenced by big money but nowhere are the pay to play schemes more perverse than in washington d c it was bad enough when revolving door relationships between lobbyists staff and lawmakers allowed the wealthy and powerful to bundle donations and buy access to those writing the legislation but in a post citizens united world 2010 the wealthy can spend unlimited resources on political campaigns with little or no disclosure that is why we need a constitutional amendment to overturn citizens united i will be a strong voice in changing this so that every voter in america can have faith that their opinion matters it s time we all stand up and say enough is enough it is time to restore our democracy and make our government one that is of by and for the people

compensation expenses to the mine sites 4 cost of sales includes mining and processing costs royalties and amortization expense and is calculated based on the mid point of guidance the company s long term strategic objective is to generate increasing returns for its shareholders through low cost production and free cash flow growth from its existing operations and portfolio of development projects the company was successful in achieving these objectives in 2019 with production of 494 500 ounces of gold and a 10 reduction in total cash costs driving record operating cash flow in addition the company made substantial progress on its growth initiatives having completed construction of the low cost cerro pelon mine in mexico and advancing construction of the lower mine expansion at young davidson with several significant near term positive catalysts 2020 is expected to be a transformational year for alamos these include the recently announced substantial increase in high grade mineral reserves and resources at island gold the phase iii expansion study of island gold which is expected to be competed in june and demonstrate a larger very profitable long life operation the completion of the lower mine expansion at young davidson which remains on track for june and the transition to strong company wide free cash flow starting in the second half of 2020 production is expected to temporarily decrease in 2020 to between 425 000 and 465 000 ounces of gold this reflects the previously guided lower production from young davidson during the first half of 2020 while completing the tie in of the upper and lower mines as well as the end of production at el chanate total cash cost guidance of 770 to 810 per ounce and aisc guidance of 1 020 to 1 060 per ounce are temporarily higher reflecting lower gold production at young davidson during the tie in period in the first half of 2020 gold production in the first quarter of 2020 is expected to be within a range of 105 000 to 110 000 ounces consistent with annual guidance costs are expected to be higher in the first half of 2020 and decrease in the second half with the completion of the lower mine tie in at young davidson in 2021 production is expected to increase to approximately 500 000 ounces at lower costs driven by higher mining and production rates at young davidson the construction of the lower mine infrastructure at young davidson is in the final stages the tie in of the lower mine recently commenced and remains on schedule to be completed in june 2020 during this previously guided downtime of the northgate shaft ore will be trucked to surface from the upper mine at a rate of approximately 2 500 tpd given the lower production rate and a full workforce to support ongoing development during this period total cash costs and mine site aisc are expected to increase significantly in the first half of the year following completion of the tie in underground mining rates are anticipated to increase from approximately 6 500 tpd to a rate of 7 500 tpd by the end of 2020 this is expected to drive young davidson production higher and costs significantly lower in the second half of 2020 capital spending at young davidson in 2020 is expected to be between 75 and 85 million down from 2019 levels capital spending is expected to be lower during the second half of 2020 with approximately 60 of the capital budget planned for the first half of the year to complete the lower mine expansion combined with higher production and lower costs young davidson is expected to generate strong free cash flow in the second half of 2020 higher mining rates are expected to drive annual gold production to approximately 200 000 ounces at lower costs in 2021 gold production at island gold in 2020 is expected to be marginally lower than 2019 with higher throughput offset by lower grades mined grades are expected to be higher during the first half of 2020 and lower during the second half of the year reflecting mine sequencing total cash costs and mine site all in sustaining costs are expected to increase slightly from 2019 capital spending at island gold is expected to be between 50 and 60 million in 2020 excluding capitalized exploration the company is undertaking a number of projects to support the growing operation and mine life this includes an expansion of the tailings facility and the construction of a new administration building dry facility and underground workshop the company is currently conducting a phase iii expansion study at island gold beyond 1 200 tpd which is expected to be completed during the second quarter of 2020 this study will incorporate the recently released 2019 year end mineral reserve and resource update for island gold which included substantial growth in mineral reserves and resources the company expects this study will demonstrate island gold as a larger more profitable long life operation a total of 21 million has been budgeted in 2020 for surface and underground exploration at island gold to follow up on ongoing exploration success the 2020 program will be focused on continuing to define new near mine mineral resources across the two kilometre long island gold main zone which remains open laterally and down plunge across multiple areas of focus production from the mulatos district in 2020 is expected to be consistent with long term guidance of 150 000 to 160 000 ounces of gold ore will be mined and stacked from multiple sources in 2020 including the mulatos el victor and san carlos open pits as well as the newly constructed cerro pelon mine in addition the crushing and stacking of surface stockpiles will ramp up through the year as mining activities wind down in the san carlos and el victor pits in the first half of 2020 total cash costs are expected to increase slightly from 2019 reflecting the processing of lower recovery stockpiles which carry non cash historical inventory costs resulting in a higher reported cash cost per ounce mine site all in sustaining costs are also expected to increase due to higher sustaining capital mainly related to waste stripping activities at cerro pelon capital spending across the mulatos district is expected to total 20 to 25 million the majority of which is sustaining capital the company expects to make a construction decision on the la yaqui grande project during the second quarter of 2020 la yaqui grande is fully permitted having received the approval of the environmental impact assessment during the second quarter of 2019 and the change in land use permit in july 2019 capital spending on the company s development projects and capitalized exploration at existing operations is expected to total 35 million in 2020 the majority of this spending will be focused on exploration at island gold and exploration permitting and development activities at lynn lake with 183 million of cash and cash equivalents no debt and growing cash flow from its operations the company is well positioned to fund its internal growth initiatives and expects to transition to strong free cash flow generation in the second half of 2020 fourth quarter and year end 2019 results young davidson

facility and continued lower mine construction for the full year capital expenditures of 99 9 million were focused on lower mine construction lateral development in the upper and lower mines and construction of the new tia1 tailings facility capital spending was above guidance due to additional grouting requirements and a change in scope of the new tailings facility from an upstream to a centreline design young davidson generated 11 9 million of mine site free cash flow in the fourth quarter significantly higher than the same period of 2018 due to a higher gold price and improved operating costs for the full year mine site free cash flow was 12 8 million generating a return after self financing the lower mine expansion since the acquisition of young davidson in 2015 the mine

of 186 0 million a 14 increase from the prior year period due to an increase in realized gold prices the average realized gold price in the quarter was 1 463 per ounce compared to 1 244 per ounce in the prior year period cost of sales were 136 0 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 a 34 decrease compared to the prior year period primarily due to the prior year including a 64 0 million non cash inventory impairment charge at el chanate mining and processing costs were 87 4 million compared to 96 2 million in the prior year period this decline was attributable to lower operating costs at island gold and young davidson and the completion of mining activities at el chanate in the fourth quarter of 2018 consolidated total cash costs for the quarter were 722 per ounce compared to 770 per ounce in the prior year period a 6 decrease driven by low cost production growth at island gold aisc were 972 per ounce in the quarter 11 per ounce lower than the prior year period driven by lower total cash costs partially offset by higher sustaining capital spending royalty expense was 4 4 million in the quarter lower than the prior year period of 4 8 million as the 5 mulatos royalty commitment ceased in the first quarter of 2019 partially offset by a higher number of ounces sold at island gold and higher realized gold prices amortization of 44 2 million in the quarter was consistent with the prior year period expense of 42 1 million amortization of 348 per ounce was in line with guidance the company recognized earnings from operations of 41 6 million in the quarter higher than the prior year period due to higher realized gold prices combined with lower mining and processing expense driving stronger margins further the prior year period included a 64 0 million non cash inventory impairment charge at el chanate which impacted earnings in 2018 the company reported net earnings of 38 0 million in the quarter compared to net loss of 71 5 million in the same period of 2018 the increase in earnings is due to stronger operating margins the benefit of foreign exchange gains recorded within deferred taxes as well as the prior year period impacted by the non cash inventory impairment charge at el chanate on an adjusted basis earnings of 32 1 million or 0 08 per share increased compared to the prior year driven by higher realized gold prices and improved costs adjusted earnings reflect adjustments for one time gains and losses as well as foreign exchange movements related to the canadian dollar and mexican peso which generated a foreign exchange gain

of gold for record revenue of 683 1 million a 5 increase compared to 2018 this was primarily driven by higher realized gold prices and record production at island gold partially offset by less ounces sold at mulatos and el chanate which transitioned to residual leaching at the end of 2018 revenue benefited from a higher realized gold price of 1 381 per ounce compared to 1 278 per ounce in 2018 a 52 5 million impact cost of sales were 521 4 million in 2019 compared to 639 4 million in 2018 as the prior year included a 64 0 million non cash inventory impairment charge at el chanate cost of sales was also driven lower by lower mining and processing costs royalties and amortization charges mining and processing costs decreased to 339 0 million in 2019 from 387 2 million in the prior year primarily due to lower operating costs at young davidson and mulatos which drove down total cash costs in addition mining and processing costs decreased significantly at el chanate as mining activities ceased in the fourth quarter of 2018 consolidated total cash costs per ounce decreased 10 in 2019 to 720 per ounce compared to 802 per ounce in the prior year the decline in total cash costs was driven by low cost production growth at island gold and lower operating costs and higher grades mined at both young davidson and mulatos aisc decreased to 951 per ounce in 2019 from 989 per ounce in the prior year the decrease was primarily driven by the reduction in total cash costs partially offset by higher sustaining capital spending at young davidson royalty expense was 17 4 million in 2019 a 19 decrease compared to 21 6 million in 2018 primarily due to a lower royalty obligation at mulatos with the completion of the third party royalty commitment in the first quarter of 2019 amortization of 165 0 million in 2019 was lower than the prior year due to fewer ounces sold on a per ounce basis amortization was 334 per ounce in line with guidance and slightly higher than the prior year due to a higher proportion of sales coming from island gold and young davidson which include higher amortization charges the company recognized earnings from operations of 126 0 million in 2019 compared to loss of 22 6 million in 2018 the substantial increase in earnings from operations was driven by higher gold prices and increased production from island gold which generates stronger margins further the prior year included a 64 0 million non cash inventory impairment charge at el chanate the company reported net earnings of 96 1 million in 2019 compared to a net loss of 72 6 million in 2018 driven by improved margins and the 2018 inventory impairment charge at el chanate on an adjusted basis earnings of 83 5 million or 0 21 per share for the year were 326 higher than in

in the latest article in a series on how some of the world s key emitters are responding to climate change carbon brief profiles iran a major petrostate stricken by long running droughts iran was the world s eighth largest emitter of greenhouse gases in 2015 it is a resource rich nation with enormous reserves of oil and gas as well as considerable renewable energy potential however sanctions have significantly affected iran s economy disrupting oil exports and slowing its transition to a cleaner energy system water shortages dust storms and air pollution are among the environmental issues facing the country often driven by mismanagement but also with links to climate change while iranian leaders have said they view climate change as a serious threat the nation remains one of only a handful yet to ratify the paris agreement as tensions with the us escalate once again iran has made it clear that any climate action it undertakes will depend on cooperation and assistance from the international community update 24 02 2020 following a parliamentary election that saw the lowest turnout since the 1979 revolution conservative hardliners took a large majority in a move expected to weaken president hassan rouhani politics the islamic republic of iran is a mid income country home to around 82 million people its economy ranks 27th globally in terms of gross domestic product gdp and is the second largest in the middle east and north africa mena region after saudi arabia oil is a critical part of the iranian economy but has also historically been at the heart of the nation s struggles the election of the nationalist prime minister mohammed mossaddegh and subsequent nationalisation of the anglo iranian oil company in the 1950s led to the uk and the us overthrowing the government and installing a cooperative regime this administration was subsequently toppled in the 1979 islamic revolution triggering the first wave of us economic sanctions against iran these have largely persisted ever since fundamentally shaping the nation s politics including its response to climate change iran s leaders have been outwardly vocal in their support for climate action while emphasising their nation s status as a developing country that needs international support to cut emissions while the modern iranian political system involves the election of a president and contains elements of a parliamentary democracy it is not considered truly democratic the president and parliament are overseen by the guardian council consisting of 12 theologians and legal experts and are ultimately answerable to the supreme leader currently ayatollah ali khamenei new legislation can be vetoed by the council if it does not tally with the national constitution or islamic law the iranian parliament has 285 directly elected members as well as five additional seats reserved for religious and ethnic minorities the next parliamentary election is due to take place on 21 february and there is a presidential election scheduled for 2021 iran s president hassan rouhani on the day of his election 17 june 2013 credit upi alamy stock photo the current president is the relatively moderate hassan rouhani a former nuclear negotiator who was first elected in 2013 then reelected in 2017 with a greater majority he has described climate change as one of the most significant challenges of the 21st century climate change mitigation and adaptation is primarily governed by the national climate change office which is part of the department of environment a governmental agency overseen by the president former department head dr masoumeh ebtekar has called climate change a serious threat to life on earth however as the vast majority of iran s emissions come from its energy sector there are a range of other agencies and ministries that play key roles in climate action including the supreme energy council and the national iranian oil company nioc concern about climate change goes all the way to the top of iran s leadership in 2015 just before cop21 where the paris agreement was adopted khamenei issued a 15 point list of environmental policy directives which emphasised the importance of managing climatic changes confronting environmental threats such as desertification dust particles drought and microbial and radioactive transmitters the same letter also called for an expansion of the green economy emphasising low carbon industries and promotion of green and non fossil modes of public transportation despite promises of reform from the president human rights violations are still rife in iran among the groups that have been targeted are environmental campaigners with more than 60 activists and researchers arrested in 2018 nevertheless there has been widespread unrest in recent years partly in response to environmental issues including the nation s long running drought as well as wider concerns relating to iran s economic downturn a hike in fuel prices and the conservative government in general paris pledge iran is involved in international climate negotiations and has signed the paris agreement but it is one of a small number of countries yet to ratify the accord while the initial signing signals intent to comply with the agreement it only becomes binding through ratification only eight countries in the world have failed to complete this procedure including other oil producing nations such as iraq and libya iran s cabinet headed by president rouhani ratified the agreement and sent it to parliament for final approval in 2016 but this has still not been granted and confirmed to the un secretary general the us which has officially ratified the agreement is nevertheless in the process of leaving the process altogether due to its position as a major economy and long standing rival of iran it could be politically untenable for the iranian government to ratify if the us is seen as not sharing the burden of climate change when participating in international climate negotiations iran is a member of the g77 and the like minded group of developing countries lmdc its position in these talks is similar to many of its fellow developing nations and was laid out at cop23 by then deputy head of the environment department dr kaveh madani because of their historical responsibility for global warming the developed countries must take the lead in mitigation and in providing finance and technology to developing countries without shifting the burden onto these countries developing countries should take responsible climate actions but not at the expense of their economic and social development media reports from iran suggest that while some politicians have called on the president to formally join the paris agreement there are concerns from others that the accord could act against our national interest and put the country into significant expenses majid shafie pour a member of the iranian delegation at cop23 noted the international community s criticism of us president donald trump s decision to withdraw from the paris agreement in an interview with deutsche welle he emphasised the value of cooperation and his government s desire to adhere to the climate principles however at the most recent intersessional climate talks in bonn iran was criticised along with the us russia and saudi arabia for trying to undermine discussions around the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc special report on 1 5c emphasising scientific knowledge gaps iran remains part of previous international climate treaties having ratified the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc in 1996 iran also ratified the kyoto protocol in 2005 in 2015 it also submitted an intended nationally determined contribution indc to the unfccc committing to cut emissions by 4 in 2030 compared to a business as usual scenario this pledge is not an official ndc and has been described as relatively vague in addition iran s indc pledged a 12

700m tonnes of co2 equivalent mtco2e in 2010 to over 1 700mtco2e in 2030 however this assumes a strong gdp growth rate of 8 annually which has not been the reality since the indc was published in 2015 in 2017 18 it dropped to 3 8 emissions growth projections under business as usual may therefore be unrealistic crucially both of iran s scenarios assume the termination and non existence of unjust sanctions see section below the cost of implementing the full 12 reduction is estimated by iran to be 70bn plus an additional 100bn investment in adaptation majid shafiepour iran delegate at cop24 7 dec 2018 credit kiara worth iisd a report compiled for the european parliament says it is important to note that the reduction pledged by iran is small compared to the projected increase in emissions in this regard it will be interesting to see whether the islamic republic of iran will be able to follow the encouragement of article 4 4 of the paris agreement which is for developing country parties to move towards economy wide emission reductions or limitation targets over time analysis conducted by a team at the wuppertal institute for climate environment and energy in germany concluded that emissions could be cut by 40 by 2030 compared to business as usual by implementing energy efficiency improvements alone this rises to nearly 50 in a scenario where renewables are rolled out on a significant scale climate policy beyond international commitments climate change action has tended to fall within iran s strategies for achieving sustainable development captured in its five year development plans of the policies introduced so far that have a climate aspect the majority involve reforms to the energy system which is by far the biggest source of iranian emissions one key measure included in the fifth five year development plan which ended in 2015 was a target to reduce energy intensity by 30 this is the amount of energy associated with each unit of economic output other important policies have also addressed improvements to energy efficiency such as the law on energy consumption pattern reform and the subsidy removal plan more information on subsidies can be found below there have also been measures to encourage the uptake of renewable energy these include the budget for purchasing renewable energy electricity as well as a feed in tariff for renewable energy and a financial support mechanism to drive private sector investment however progress has been slow according to a report prepared for the german environment agency despite the various laws and policies that have been rolled out to boost energy efficiency and renewables uptake the report says reasons for this include the monopolistic and state regulated nature of the energy market which can hinder market mechanisms as well as lack of private investment and macroeconomic factors such as inflation economic recession and falling oil revenues in recent years iran has also laid out its overarching climate strategy in the second and third national communications it has presented to the unfccc in may 2017 the government launched a national strategic plan on climate change which it said was developed in line with the kyoto protocol and paris agreement environment minister ebtekar said the strategy reflects iran s strong political will in achieving sustainable development the document is only available in persian in a speech at the launch of the plan un representative gary lewis said by announcing this strategy iran had become one of a very small number of countries that is acting in this evidence based way this plan was originally intended as an appendix to the current sixth five year development plan which runs from 2017 to 2021 and does not itself mention climate change however the plan as a whole was not approved by the iranian cabinet instead a series of mitigation targets for 2021 were brought from it into the development plan these targets included an increased share of renewables to 5 of installed generation capacity cutting overall gas flaring by 90 decreasing absolute energy consumption in the building sector by 5 and restricting registration of vehicles lower than euro iv standard as it stands it is unlikely iran will meet its target for clean energy by next year despite many theoretically effective policies an overriding issue that can hamper their implementation in iran is corruption which is prevalent across the economy including the fossil fuel sector economic sanctions owing to their tight links with the global trade in oil and development of renewable energy technologies economic sanctions are intrinsic to iran s climate strategy and the way it is framed by the country s leadership the sanctions were first introduced by the us after the revolution and have since been implemented by other states in a bid to curb the iranian nuclear weapons programme these sanctions reached a high point in 2012 when the eu banned iranian oil exports and the world bank stopped all oil related transactions with iran this cost the country more than 160bn in oil revenue from 2012 to 2016 the joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa struck in 2015 between president rouhani and several world powers including the us saw iran suspend its nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of key sanctions anti american mural on the wall of the former us embassy credit rutger klevenfeldt alamy stock photo however us sanctions have since been reinstated under current us president donald trump this has taken a significant toll on iran s fossil fuel sector and wider economy with oil exports set to fall to half their 2017 18 levels the introduction and relaxation of sanctions has already triggered large swings in the nation s economy over the years and iranian authorities have made it clear they do not think they can cut emissions with sanctions in place iran s indc document makes repeated mentions of unjust sanctions stating any climate action on its part depends on their removal this intended program inclusive of unconditional and conditional participation in mitigating ghgs emission as well as in terms of areas related to adaptation is in its entirety subject to the removal of economic technological and financial restrictions and in particular termination of unjust sanctions imposed on iran during the past several decades as well as non imposition of restrictions or sanctions in the future the same document also says international sanctions prevented the nation from hitting its 30 energy intensity reduction target set out in its 2010 2015 development plan a report on iran s indc implementation from the german environment agency cites sanctions as one of the four overarching barriers to realising iran s mitigation potential alongside institutional capacities access to energy efficient technologies and availability of capital iran s economic isolation makes it harder to access project financing and technology transfer required to meet its renewable energy goals mostafa rabiee from the renewable energy organisation of iran suna now part of the renewable energy and energy efficiency organization satba has suggested that meeting the country s renewable targets would require 10bn in foreign investment some have pointed to the links between sanctions and climate action as an argument against the punitive sanctions favoured by the trump administration mana mostatabi from the national iranian american council niac writes in a blog post that climate change provides a rare chance for a positive sum engagement that can yield positive benefits not only for iran and the us but also for an interconnected world increasingly united by a need to preserve our planet following jcpoa several european companies secured contracts to build solar and wind projects in iran appearing to confirm the boost provided by removing sanctions see section below for more information however lifting sanctions has been also described as a double edged sword as the resulting stronger economic growth and unrestricted trade in oil could lead to higher emissions people protest in tehran against the announcement of the us withdrawal from the iran nuclear deal 11 may 2018 credit ahmad halabisaz xinhua alamy live news with sanctions reintroduced once again by the us iran s economy was predicted by the international monetary fund imf to shrink by 9 5 in 2019 as oil exports fell the white house stated the decision to impose tighter sanctions was intended to bring iran s oil exports to zero and deny the regime its principal source of revenue oil and gas iran is an energy superpower with significant fossil fuel resources as its disposal it ranks second in the world for natural gas reserves and fourth in proven oil reserves with 9 of the global total of oil there has been speculation that iran s position could shift to third if the size of a large oil field announced by president rouhani at the end of last year is confirmed iran is the world s seventh biggest oil producer at around 4 5m barrels per day and its exports to asian and european markets make it one of the largest exporters of crude oil in the world around a fifth of iran s gdp came from oil according to central bank of iran figures going up to 2013 although this has been affected by us eu and un sanctions on oil exports it is a founding member of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec and the state owned national iranian oil company manages all upstream oil and natural gas projects while iran is one of just three countries in the region using coal less than 0 2 of its energy mix is from this source the chart below shows the dominance of fossil fuels in the iranian electricity system with 94 of the nation s power produced by oil gas and coal electricity generation in iran by fuel 1985 2018 terawatt hours source bp statistical review of world energy 2019 chart by carbon brief using highcharts as a result of its significant fossil fuel wealth energy accounts for more than 90 of iran s emissions according to its indc and therefore most of the potential for emissions cuts exists in this sector according to the iea iran also accounts for around 6 of global methane emissions due to the activity of its energy sector these high methane emissions can be seen in the infographic at the top of this piece iran s indc states dependence of the national economy on revenues from production and export of oil and its byproducts that are high carbon intensive have made the economy public welfare resources and technology of the country vulnerable to mitigation of ghgs emission the international energy agency iea has warned that producer economies such as iran that rely heavily on oil and gas are under threat from the combined effect of global climate action energy efficiency gains and the rise of shale gas in the us iran has a handful of projects mainly involving improvements to gas power generation registered under the clean development mechanism cdm to produce carbon credits for use under the kyoto protocol however one research paper concluded that a lack of long term planning for the kyoto protocol limitation of technology and finance lack of regulation and functionality of a financial system and international sanctions had held back iranian cdm implementation the iranian government has previously encouraged the domestic use of gas in order to release more oil for export while most of the nation s natural gas is for domestic use iran also exports it via pipelines to turkey armenia azerbaijan and iraq particularly since the development of the supergiant south pars gas field the industry in iran has grown at an unprecedented rate and gas has become the main source of energy for every sector apart from transport however since the reimposition of sanctions which have made it harder to export crude oil there has been a sharp policy reversal as the government encourages domestic oil use to free up gas for export this trend will likely have knock on effects for iran s emissions profile south pars north dome gas condensate field in asaluyeh iran credit alireza firouzi alamy stock photo one key issue for the fossil fuel industry in iran is gas flaring the process of burning gas that is released as a by product during oil and gas recovery according to data collected by the world bank iran is the world s third largest practitioner of gas flaring after russia and iraq wasting over 17bn cubic metres of gas last year via flares while data on this practice can vary considerably one study from 2016 estimated flaring was responsible for up to 10 of iran s greenhouse gas emissions the government s third communication to the unfccc placed the figure for such fugitive emissions at 19 the same as emissions from the entire transport sector reducing emissions from gas flaring has been highlighted as a key priority in government communications the latest five year development plan targeted a 90 reduction by 2021 and a goal to completely eliminate flaring beyond that date oil minister bijan namdar zanganeh has stated that 5bn is needed to curb gas flaring in iran while another government estimate has put the figure for gas recovery projects at 10bn however international funds to help reduce gas flaring such as the clean investment fund are not available to iran the nation is not a member of the world bank s global gas flaring reduction project which also provides finance finally according to the world resources institute iran s total transport emissions are among the highest in the world accounting for roughly a fifth of the nation s entire emissions profile however with air pollution a major problem in big cities such as tehran cleaning up the transport sector has been a key target highlighted by the government only china has more compressed gas powered vehicles in its fleet that iran part of the government s efforts to make use of its excess domestic gas other strategies to clean up the sector include an upgraded public transport fleet the promotion of urban traffic management policies and the enforcement of european fuel standards in cities energy efficiency and subsidies the sheer abundance of fossil fuel supplies combined with extensive government subsidies has left iran with rapidly escalating demand for energy from a highly inefficient system its energy intensity is very high around twice the global average and its energy consumption per capita is estimated to be 80 above average for the middle east over the past decade energy consumption has grown by more than 50 as a result of development population growth urbanisation and subsidies demand has been growing at a significantly higher rate than the overall economy one study described the energy intensity of the nation s industrial production as unacceptably high four times the european average and almost nine times that of japan iran has had a direct subsidy system to reduce the price of fuel and some food in place for decades estimates for the scale of energy subsidies in iran have varied significantly but they are frequently cited as the largest in the world the iea estimates they account for around 15 of the nation s gdp cars queuing at a petrol station tehran iran credit sueddeutsche zeitung photo alamy stock photo by way of comparison according to the iea s analysis for 2018 iran spent 26 6bn on oil subsidies and 26bn on gas subsidies compared to saudi arabia s 25 8bn and 6 2bn respectively the agency has noted that phasing out fossil fuel consumption subsidies remains a pillar of sound energy policy and that highly subsidised fossil fuels in the middle east have hindered the development of renewables in the region iran s problem is most evident in its treatment of gasoline which received around one third of subsidies in 2010 the resulting low prices have encouraged very high consumption in urban areas and contributed to serious air pollution in major cities in a bid to reverse this trend the government has been pursuing subsidy reforms in its five year development plans gradually raising the prices of petroleum products natural gas and electricity subsidy removal is seen as important for achieving energy efficiency and according to the government is intended to drive equality by replacing the subsidies with targeted welfare payments to poorer people however the policy has faced difficulties and public backlash leading to violent crackdowns and parliament delaying its second phase a recent overnight 50 hike in petrol prices once again sparked widespread protests since the subsidy reform programme began in 2010 renewed sanctions and the collapse of the iranian currency the rial mean that iranians are not actually paying much more today than they were at the outset and fuel usage has not changed substantially iea data shows fossil fuel subsidies in iran fell from 92bn in 2012 to 31bn in 2016 before doubling again to 69b in 2018 in line with shifts in the global crude oil price a 2015 paper by dr saeed moshiri at the university of saskatchewan concluded that iran s current policy of price increases would not solely be able to reduce energy consumption renewables iran is powered almost entirely by fossil fuels but it is widely agreed that given the right opportunities and investment it has enormous potential for renewable energy the nation has been described as potentially one of the best regions to use pv systems due to its high number of sunny days and levels of solar radiation there are significant opportunities for the development of iranian wind power and geothermal energy also has potential across the middle east region including iran while there have been some policies in recent years to encourage renewable development progress has been slow as it stands iran only gets around 0 1 of its power from non hydro renewables such as wind and solar noting its commitment to 5 renewables capacity the government has laid out its position iran s macro planning on energy is optimised utilisation of fossil fuel resources and improvement in exploitation of diversified resources of renewable energy to supply a portion of the country s ever increasing energy demand the government s fifth development plan pledged to install 5 gigawatts gw of renewable energy capacity by 2015 by incentivising private companies to invest in the sector this included small scale less than 10 megawatt mw hydro projects and not large hydro which is relatively well developed this was dismissed as too ambitious in a report by law firm cms given the sector s lack of development and international sanctions and indeed the target was not met wind turbines near urmia iran credit kaveh manafzadeh alamy stock photo since then iran s sixth development plan which ends next year once again aims for 5gw of renewables and plans for an additional 2 5gw by 2030 furthermore the iranian power generation transmission distribution and management company tavanir has predicted renewables could provide 10 of iran s electricity by 2021 however difficulties with financing projects and lack of local expertise remain major barriers to the development of the sector when sanctions were eased following the nuclear deal in 2015 there was a surge of interest from european companies seeking to build new renewable projects in iran according to the climate institute within around two months after the jcpoa was agreed the nation had organised deals that would have seen its solar capacity increase by 1 150mw this is compared to the period from 2005 and 2011 when this capacity increased by just 14mw to 67mw in total a reuters story from 2018 notes that prior to washington reimposing sanctions more than 250 companies had signed agreements to add and sell power from renewables in iran however with president trump threatening to penalise companies doing business in the country international companies began pulling out uk renewable energy investor quercus announced it would stop the construction of a large 570m solar power plant specifically citing us sanctions on iran while the iranian government has signalled it wants to diversify its energy mix there are also some doubts about its commitment to clean energy one report from 2018 notes that while renewable energy s importance is now routinely acknowledged in iran authorities still do not view it as a priority and a comprehensive plan for renewable energy is lacking nuclear and hydropower while iranian wind and solar have so far failed to take off in any significant way two other forms of low carbon energy hydropower and nuclear have had marginally more success making a dent in the dominant fossil fuel sector nevertheless both have faced barriers in an assessment of different energy sources in the middle east and north africa mena region one study concluded that nuclear is a highly desirable alternative to fossil fuels while noting its very low deployment across the region construction site of the second phase of iran s bushehr nuclear power plant in bushehr tehran 10 nov 2019 credit ahmad halabisaz xinhua alamy live news in fact iran is the only mena nation to have constructed a nuclear power plant the bushehr 1 facility completed in 2011 it will soon be joined by the united arab emirates which is expected to complete its first plant by the end of 2020 bushehr 1 has 1gw of capacity and with the help of russia iran is aiming to construct bushehr 2 with an additional 1 8 gw of capacity by around 2026 besides technical issues with expanding nuclear the same study cites the lack of trust of the global community towards the misuse of nuclear resources as one of the major barriers to iran s nuclear power for more than a decade sanctions against iran have been enforced specifically in a bid to stop the nation developing nuclear technology while iran has maintained that its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes the trump administration is concerned that allowing it to enrich uranium could fuel the development of nuclear weapons iran is now enriching uranium at levels above those agreed in the 2015 deal following the us withdrawal but the material used in bushehr is sourced from russia by comparison large scale hydropower is relatively uncontroversial in geopolitical terms but in a region beset by severe water scarcity it comes with its own problems the karun 3 dam khuzestan province iran credit m samadi cc by sa 3 0 despite this it is by far the largest renewable energy source in iran currently providing around 3 5 of the nation s electricity according to the international hydropower association as of 2015 there was around 11gw of installed hydro capacity in iran however iranian officials have warned that protracted droughts are affecting the nation s hydropower capabilities because of the water shortage there are predictions of hard times for iran s power industry deputy head of iran s power generation and transmission company gholamreza khosh kholq told news outlets in 2015 referring specifically to the nation s hydropower drought and adaptation iran is highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change average temperature rise compared to the pre industrial baseline is already 1 8c one and a half times the mean global temperature rise the iranian leadership has made it clear it is aware of the threats iran faces and there are suggestions that climate change adaptation is seen as a priority over mitigation efforts iran s indc lists cuts in agricultural production dust storms harm to biodiversity and heat exhaustion and the spread of some diseases among the dangers stoked by climate change it also states that agriculture and the wider economy will face 3 7bn in damages every year from 2015 to 2030 compared to 2010 due to the changing trends of climate change and hydrological parameters drought is perhaps the most serious environmental issue facing the country iran has struggled with water shortages for decades and as of last year around 97 of the country was experiencing drought conditions as a result thousands of villages have been deserted and officials have predicted that millions more people will be displaced climate change is expected to make this problem worse with research suggesting precipitation will fall in the coming years given what they viewed as its lack of inclusion in climate change negotiations the iranian delegation at cop24 in 2018 called for water scarcity to be incorporated into proceedings drought in maharloo lake in fars province southern iran 11 nov 2019 credit ahmad halabisaz xinhua alamy live news however aside from climate change this issue has also been driven by mismanagement in iran with excessive use of water in the agriculture sector and a push to construct dams on some of the nation s major rivers indeed while the link between climate and water shortages is clear experts have pointed out that it is wrong for the iranian authorities to shift the blame to global warming as one paper concludes natural climate variabilities climate change droughts and economic sanctions have had undeniable impacts on iran s water resources yet iran s water problems are mostly manmade and the product of decades of poor management caused by lack of foresight uncoordinated planning and the wrong perception of development current environment minister isa kalantari told afp in 2018 that the country faced losing 70 of its farmland in the coming decades noting in the past we basically thought that environment was not that important the national climate change office conducted a vulnerability and adaptation assessment in 2014 and incorporated it into its third national communication to the unfccc as with emissions mitigation efforts the government has emphasised the need for additional international financial resources and technology transfer to help prepare its water and agricultural sectors for a changing climate note on infographic data for energy consumption comes from bp statistical review of world energy 2019 data for

the canadian health care system is frequently used as a model by americans who advocate putting the government in charge of health care as senator bernie sanders i vt put it in canada for a number of decades they have provided quality care to all people without out of pocket expenses you go in for cancer therapy you don t take out your wallet ref in reality canadians suffer similar out of pocket burdens as americans while paying far higher taxes and receiving lower quality of care months long waiting lists for urgent care substandard equipment that would embarrass turkey ref years of delay on life saving drugs and widespread capacity shortages have all become hallmarks of the canadian health care system one major reform proposal endorsed by a majority of democrats in the house of representatives known as medicare for all would outlawref private coverage except for elective procedures like plastic surgery and in its place would establish a government run program to provide all u s residents with coverage across the board including for hospitalization and doctor visits dental vision and hearing care and long term care ref the plan would require no co payments or fees as all care would be funded by the government through taxes or public debt the plan would specifically ban private insurance plans from providing the same benefits as public coverage forcing all americans onto the public plan ref as proposed medicare for all is far more extensive and far more distortionary than even canada s current system it is worthwhile then to explore the problems that canadian patients and canadian taxpayers have come to face who pays for health care in canada like the u s canada s health care system is funded by a mixture of public and private insurers these insurers pay for care that occurs at a mixture of private and public providers canada s mandatory public insurance covers most of two types of medical cost hospitals and physicians offices which together make up about half of all medical expenses in canada for these categories public spending covers 90 percent of hospital costs and 98 percent of doctors offices costs for the remaining half of health costs private spending makes up the majority of spending paid either by private insurance or paid out of pocket by the patient this includes pharmaceuticals 16 percent of total spending in canada other institutions including nursing homes and long term care 11 percent of total spending and other professionals including most vision and dental care physical therapy hearing aids physiotherapy and psychological treatment 11 percent of total spending ref spending in the u s is distributed similarly with hospitals and physicians totaling 53 percent of health care spending while 10 percent of spending goes to prescription drugs 5 percent to nursing home care 3 percent to home health care 4 percent to dental care and 27 percent to other health care ref for that half of health spending that occurs outside hospitals and physicians offices public spending in canada covers just 36 percent of pharmaceutical spending 70 percent of spending on other institutions and only 11 percent of spending on other professionals ref so for that half of medical spending canadians must find another way to pay for most care as a result 63 percent of canadians have private insurance similar to the 56 percent of americans with private insurance ref while 35 percent of canadians and 36 percent of americans are covered by comprehensive government plans ref in both countries publicly funded comprehensive coverage goes mainly to the elderly and the poor and in both countries the government has various programs to proactively seek out and cover both groups finally in both countries many of these vulnerable populations nonetheless fail to claim benefits leaving roughly 2 percent of canadians and 8 percent of americans uninsured ref because half of canadian health care costs are for categories primarily paid privately private spending makes up 31 percent of total canadian health care costs see table 1 compared to about half in the u s of that canadian private spending roughly half is paid by patients out of pocket and half is paid by private insurers equivalent numbers for the united states vary between private spending making up 44 percentref and 51 percentref of health care costs of which about one quarter is paid out of pocket and the remaining three quarters is paid by private insurers ref like all universal systems the canadian health system is only universal in the sense that everybody is forced to join it is emphatically not universal in terms of what is covered proposals like medicare for all therefore are promoting something far larger in both taxes and in distortions than what exists in canada or indeed in any developed country including europe out of pocket costs in canada there are several ways to estimate the differences between canadian and american out of pocket health care costs the peterson kaiser family foundation health system tracker estimates that in purchasing power adjusted current u s dollars the average canadian pays us 690 per year in out of pocket medical costs while the average american pays 1 103 about 34 more per month ref however this difference drops by about two thirds when measured by household income or by gross domestic product gdp the organization for economic development and cooperation oecd estimates that canadians pay 2 2 percent of final household consumption in out of pocket medical costs while americans pay 2 5 percent a difference of roughly 15 per month for the median american household see chart 1 ref using gdp instead of household income yields similar results the oecd calculates that canadians spend 1 6 percent of gdp on out of pocket health spending compared to 1 9 percent in the u s the world bankref and the peterson kaiser family foundation health system trackerref make similar estimates agreeing that canadians spend 1 5 percent of gdp on out of pocket medical costs while americans spend 1 9 percent of gdp while these numbers are very close they are actually getting closer since 1970 u s out of pocket spending as a percentage of total medical spending has been falling steadily from 33 percent in 1970 to about 10 percent in 2017 ref meanwhile canadian out of pocket spending has been falling much slower so that by 2016 it totaled 15 percent of total medical spending a higher proportion than in the u s ref as a result statistics canada warned in early 2020 that the percentage of canadians experiencing large out of pocket burdens is growing writing that etween 1998 and 2009 the percentage of households spending more than 10 of their total after tax income on health care rose by 56 ref out of pocket spending in canada disproportionately hits the poor in a 2009 report statistics canadaref estimated that out of pocket spending as a percentage of household income is more than twice as high among the lowest income quintile as among the highest at 5 7 percent of after tax income for the poorest one fifth of canadian households and only 2 6 percent for the richest quintile beyond out of pocket burdens canadians experience other health care related stresses familiar to americans in a 2015 survey commissioned by the ontario securities commission ref 16 percent of canadians over 50 reported that unexpected medical expenses used up a significant part of their retirement savings while nearly two thirds of early retirements in canada were related to health expenses the same report found that despite public coverage canadians ages 75 and above have median out of pocket costs of 2 000 per year including supplementary health insurance premiums and out of pocket medications of this 75 population 69 percent report having to pay rising medical costs by selling off assets cutting spending on necessities getting a job or borrowing money more broadly among canadians ages 50 and above fully 39 percent report out of pocket health costs as a top concern making out of pocket costs the third highest concern after inflation and declining health itself specific to drugs one study in 2018 estimated that 731 000 canadians per year between 2 2 percent and 2 8 percent of the population borrow money to pay for their prescription drugs ref finally one key topic in the u s health care financial debate has been medical bankruptcy as one canadian research study concluded it is incorrect to assume that adopting insurance system in the us will have a significant impact on bankruptcy rates bankruptcy and a lack of health insurance coverage are both caused by the same thing a lack of income which in turn is usually a result of unemployment ref indeed a 2006 report commissioned by the canadian governmentref found that medical reasons were cited as the primary cause of bankruptcy for approximately 15 percent of bankrupt canadian seniors ages 55 and above higher than some estimates for u s bankruptcy ref taxes in canada taxes in canada are much higher than in the u s and this is largely because of government health care spending in addition to combined sales taxes ranging from 11 percent to 15 percent for all but one province personal income tax rates are also much higher the oecd calculates that a married canadian couple with two children and one earner making the median wage pays 27 percent of its income to the government of which 10 percent is paid in income taxes and 17 percent in social security taxes the comparable american couple pays just 4 percent of its earnings in income taxes and 15 percent in social security taxes moreover canadian taxes rise faster with income if that same family earns 168 percent of the median wage about 90 000 in each country s currency it will pay 18 percent of earnings in income taxes in canada and only 9 percent in the u s ref on a national level according to the oecd canadian taxation sums to 33 percent of gdp compared to 24 percent in the u s meaning it is 36 percent higher even so nearly a quarter of what americans pay in taxes consists of social security payments while the far less generous canadian social security makes up just 14 percent of taxation this is because canadian social security averages just 984 compared to 1 470 in the u s ref taxation excluding social security contributions then comes to 28 percent of gdp in canada compared to just 19 percent in the u s meaning 51 percent more ref this excess taxation is largely a result of health spending which has bloated provincial budgets to nearly three times the taxes of u s states ref provincial taxes have grown to nearly the same level as federal taxation meanwhile provincial health costs have risen to fully 37 percent of provincial budgets in 2016 up from 33 percent in 1993ref and range as high as 42 percent ref canada s fraser institute has estimated this excess tax burden from public health costs at roughly 9 000 for a household of two adults with or without children ref or 750 per month in additional taxes beyond the financial stress of paying higher taxes tax differences of this magnitude are large enough to materially affect national wealth in a 2007 paper economists christina and david romer estimated that an increase in taxes leads to a fall in gdp roughly two to three times larger than the amount raised ref this implies that canada s excess tax burden could reduce gdp by between 16 percent and 24 percent in fact the world bank estimates canadian gdp as 26 percent lower than in the u s ref there may be other reasons why canada is so much poorer than the u s but the romers estimate suggests excess taxation is a serious problem this last point is important for discussions about net savings from socialized medicine democratic presidential candidates senator elizabeth warren d ma and senator bernie sanders i vt have claimed that their health care plans would cut total health spending for example by dictating lower hospital reimbursement rates or insurance payments ref charles blahous recently estimated thatref medicare for all would raise federal taxes by 32 trillion over 10 years and would likely raise total health care costs even under the most generous assumptions health care costs could fall by at most 2 trillion during that period leaving 30 trillion in tax damage ref quality of health care in canada waiting lists medical waiting times have become a national crisis in canada and continue to worsen the average wait time for medically necessary treatment between referral from a general practitioner and a consultation with a specialist was 8 7 weeks in 2018 136 percent longer than in 1993 patients then have to wait again between seeing the specialist and the actual treatment another 11 weeks on average 97 percent longer than in 1993 from referral to treatment then it takes an average of 19 8 weeks see chart 2 to be treated in addition to the original wait to see the family doctor in the first place this for medically necessary treatment not cosmetic surgery in less populated areas wait times can stretch dramatically longer in new brunswick for example patients have to wait an average of six and a half months just to see a specialist then another four months for the actual treatment 45 1 weeks on average again for medically necessary treatment ref in contrast nearly 77 percent of americans are treated within four weeks of referral and only 6 percent of americans report waiting more than two months to see a specialist ref as for appointments a 2017 survey of american physicians in the 15 largest u s cities found that it took just 24 days on average to schedule a new patient physician appointment including 11 days for an orthopedic surgeon and 21 days for a cardiologist ref as a result of these long waits by one recent estimate at any given moment over one million canadians 3 percent of the entire population are waiting for a medical treatment ref these lists can average six months and often much longer in rural areas which tend to suffer from doctor shortages so severe that many do not even have a family doctor ref the shortages ripple through the system one doctor in ontario called in a referral to the local hospital only to be told there was a four and a half year wait to see a neurologist ref a montreal man was finally called for his long delayed urgent surgery two months after he had died ref one 16 year old boy in british columbia waited three years for an urgent surgery during which time his condition deteriorated so much that he became a paraplegic ref these cases are unfortunately not isolated a survey of specialists found that average wait times exceed what is deemed clinically reasonable for fully 72 percent of conditions in canada the situation continues to worsen every year in 1994 the average gap between clinically reasonable delay and actual delay was only four days and by 2018 had grown to 23 days the worst gap was in orthopedic surgery where some 150 000 canadians per year suffered for 11 weeks longer than specialists determined as clinically reasonable neurosurgery wait times were nearly a month longer than clinically reasonable cataract surgeries nearly two months longer hip and knee replacements three months longer and so on ref with one million waiting many canadians turn in desperation to u s health care the very system some u s policymakers propose to transform in 2017 alone canadians made 217 500 trips to other countries for health care of which 52 500 were to the u s ref paying out of pocket to skip the waiting ref medical trips abroad included 9 500 general surgeries 6 400 urology treatments and 5 000 diagnostic tests including colonoscopies and angiographies of the veins ref one happy albertan summed up the trade off after her hip replacement in the cayman islands the total cost was 25 000 canadian to regain at least one year of my life ref these desperate patients spent 1 9 million per day to escape canadian health care up 54 percent in just the past four years ref of course those costs are not included in the canadian health spending numbers but can show up in u s health care spending when the dollars were spent in the u s a major cause of canada s waiting lists is the use of so called global budgets while effectively banning private clinics and private insurance for medically necessary treatment global budgets in which health providers get a fixed budget each year rather than being paid per treatment are a form of rationing that strongly tends to lead to long wait times ref meanwhile rules hobbling private provision in canada mean that nearly half of existing doctors would like to work more hours but are effectively banned from doing so ref both senator warren s planref and senator sanders planref explicitly propose global budgets and both effectively ban private insurance when it comes to global budgets a 2014 report from the university of british columbia concluded one weakness of global budgets is that under the impetus to meet budget targets providers might restrict access to services or limit the number of admissions to facilities moreover global budgets provide little incentive for innovation or to improve efficiency of care global budgets do not promote coordination across service providers in acute and post acute settings creating a fragmented healthcare system that is often associated with inefficiencies and reduced quality of care ref indeed the report noted most of the countries that had previously used global budgets have since transitioned to other funding mechanisms such as activity based funding ref the prospect of importing canadian style medical wait lists is not merely hypothetical the veterans health administration for example recently admitted to off books waiting lists running to four to six months ref this suggests that the tendency to cut corners and ration care is not some uniquely canadian flaw but rather a characteristic of government management of health care skimping on care in canada lack of equipment outdated drugs staff shortages beyond rationing care by using waiting lists the other key to canada s government cost controls is underinvesting in equipment using cheaper and outdated medicines and staff shortages while the average employer sponsored private insurance plan in canada covers between 10 000 and 12 000 drugs most public plans in canada only cover 4 000 ref canada has 35 percent fewer acute care beds than the u s ref and only one fourth as many magnetic resonance imaging mri units per capita indeed it has fewer mri units per capita than turkey chile or latvia ref as a result canadian waits for mris average almost 11 weeks adding months of diagnostic delays on top of the months of treatment delays even routine diagnostic equipment like ultrasound machines has four week waiting lists in some provinces the waits are much longer in british columbia for example patients wait nearly five months for an mri while in quebec new brunswick and nova scotia patients wait eight weeks for a simple ultrasound ref canada skimps on equipment even more than european countries compared to the average oecd country canada has one third fewer computerized tomography ct scanners positron emission tomography pet scanners and mri units half as many angiography units and eight times fewer lithotriptors machines that shatter kidney stones and gallstones ref some common treatments are simply unavailable to canadians for new pharmaceuticals for example canada s policy of forcing down prices so that american consumers essentially pay for canada s research and developmentref has led to years long delays for canadian patients in addition to a 630 day average wait before new drugs are approved canadians must wait for the drugs to actually be listed on their plan averaging 152 days for private plans and 473 days for public plans comparing to the u s for drugs submitted for regulatory approval in both jurisdictions canada takes five times longer 434 days of additional delay ref cutting corners on facilities and using outdated drugs show up in canadian mortality rates thirty day in hospital mortality rates in canada are 20 percent higher than in the u s for heart attacks and nearly three times the u s level for strokes ref cancer age standardized mortality is 10 percent higher in canada than in the u s despite far healthier lifestyles with both obesity and diabetes rates a full third lower in canada than in the u s when it comes to personnel canada underspends on medical staff and doctors ranking 29th out of 33 among high income countries for doctors per 1 000 population accounting for a large part of those wait times ref canada has half as many specialist physicians per capita as the u s ref and while the number of general practitioners per capita is similar to the u s rules banning doctors from mixing public and private practice discourage doctors from working beyond the minimum hours despite these rules that have contributed to a doctor shortage in canada termed critical for nearly 20 years ref nearly half of doctors would actually like to work overtime or see private patients but are prevented from doing so by government rules that require doctors to resign completely from public patients if they see any private patients at allref a daunting prospect for a doctor considering opening a private clinic meanwhile canada s physician lobby actively limits the number of specialists ref the problem is proportionately worse in rural areas where physician density is nearly two thirds below the oecd 16 average for rural areas ref the doctor shortage particularly in rural areas is widely reported in the canadian press ref with such shortages and waiting lists canadian emergency rooms are packed so packed that canadians sometimes just give up and go home of canadian er visitors who are seen 29 percent report wait times of over four hours three times the u s level ref in quebec more than half of er visits are longer than four hours ref canadian seniors are 65 percent more likely to have visited the emergency room er four or more times in the past year than american seniors ref ultimately nearly 5 percent of canadian er visitors end up leaving without ever being treated giving up on a medical system that is perennially free but out of stock at the moment in one study at two ers in alberta 14 of the 498 walkaways were subsequently hospitalized and one died within the week ref facing these widespread staff shortages canadian medical providers frequently do poorly on patient assessments canada scores 15th out of 20 oecd countries on octors spending enough time with patients ref and one study on patient satisfaction found that the patients interviewed reported feeling dehumanized in current health care culture ref as if the patient is a burden to the doctor instead of a client to serve one recent trend in canada is for medical providers to initiate ne issue per visit rules that force patients to make multiple appointments not only inconveniencing them but extending wait times yet again as patients work through their medical issues appointment by appointment each with its own waiting list as one doctor commented such tactics raise an ethical question about rationing health care in a public system and whether patients are being denied treatment as a result ref beyond making patients feel dehumanized overworked doctors risk compromising treatment according to oecd numbers canada s doctors leave foreign bodies in patients at a rate 53 percent higher than u s doctors and rates of postoperative sepsis are nearly 36 percent higher ref the canadian health care system has become a part of canadian national identity a treasured point of difference with americans alas in surveys canadians actually do not love their health care all that much a 2017 survey found that while 74 percent of americans are completely or very satisfied with the quality of health care they have received during the past 12 months among canadians it is only 66 percent meanwhile only 25 percent of americans rate their care as either somewhat or not at all satisfactory with the comparable proportion of dissatisfied canadians one third higher at 33 percent ref polling suggests that americans health care satisfaction would plunge if they were forced into the high taxes and waiting lists endemic to canadian health care a kaiser family foundation poll found that net favorability to health care reform proposals is negative 23 when participants hear it would require increases to taxes and a staggering negative 44 when people hear it would cause delays in getting tests and procedures ref higher taxes and delays of even medically necessary treatment are precisely what the canadian health care model offers conclusion canadians bear similar medical out of pocket burdens as americans while paying far higher taxes lower overall health spending in canada is largely achieved by rationing care with waiting lists using cheaper drugs skimping on equipment and underinvesting in medical facilities and staff to the point of nationwide shortages far from the feel good we re all in this together rhetoric canadian health care hides costs by throwing burdens on already suffering patients sound proposals exist for reforming american health care including price transparency enabling patients to shop around and choose from a variety of insurance options and eliminating anti competitive rules one could make a strong case for proactive policies to help those who cannot afford health care but canada s top down government run model is one of the worst possible options copying even extending a failing and outdated canadian monopoly rife with unintended consequences and suffering patients is not what americans deserve peter st onge phd is senior economist at the montreal economic institute

open pit measured and indicated mineral resources and 1 1 million ounces of open pit inferred mineral resources produced 601 566 ounces in 2019 significant potential for growth in mineral reserves increased production and improved unit costs tony makuch president and chief executive officer of kirkland lake gold commented 2019 was a year of record operating and financial performance for kirkland lake gold driven largely by strong production growth at fosterville at very low unit costs we also continued to demonstrate an ability to generate substantial amounts of operating and free cash flow which resulted in a rapid buildup in our cash position we more than doubled our cash during the year at the same time that we incurred higher growth capital expenditures reflecting significant progress at a number of key projects including our 4 shaft project at macassa the 4 shaft project is advancing extremely well and we now have the potential to complete the project early at a lower total capital cost we also put our cash to use in 2019 to reward shareholders through dividend increases and share repurchases we plan to substantially increase these efforts including doubling our quarterly dividend to 0 125 per share effective the second quarter of 2020 and committing to buying back 20 million shares over the next 12 24 months we will reward our shareholders through these initiatives while still being able to fund our growth internally given the strength of our balance sheet and the significant cash flow that our operations generate looking ahead the addition of detour is a major milestone for our company with the completion of the acquisition on january 31 2020 we now move forward with three highly competitive free cash flow generating assets macassa and detour lake in norther ontario and fosterville in victoria australia collectively these three operations are expected to produce around 1 4 million ounces this year at unit costs and on a scale that will position us to generate well over half a billion dollars of free cash flow this year given the quality of macassa detour lake and fosterville we have decided to designate our holt complex in northern ontario and assets in the northern territory of australia as non core and will be considering strategic options to the maximize value of these assets as a company we are very committed to value creation with our three high quality assets we expect to combine industry leading operating and financial results continued progress with growth projects and ongoing exploration success in order to reverse the recent performance of our shares and once again be a top performing stock as we have been over the last three years 1 see non ifrs measures later in this press release

a revenue change in revenue for any period is derived from two factors the increase or decrease in sales volumes volume impact and the average realized price of gold rate impact in fy 2019 revenue totaled 1 380 0 million an increase of 464 1 million or 51 from fy 2018 of the growth in revenue 325 million related to a 36 increase in gold sales to 979 734 ounces with higher sales levels at fosterville accounting for the increase an 11 increase in the average realized gold price to 1 405 per ounce in fy 2019 versus 1 263 per ounce in fy 2018 provided the remaining 139 million of the increase in revenue year over year revenue in q4 2019 totaled 412 4 million an increase of 132 1 million or 47 from 280 3 million in q4 2018 increases in both gold sales and the average realized price both contribution significantly to the improvement the average realized price in q4 2019 was 1 481 a 20 improvement from the same period in 2018 which resulted in 67 million of additional revenue in q4 2019 a 23 increase in gold sales to 278 438 ounces driven mainly by the impact of higher grades at fosterville on production and sales levels contributed the remaining 65 million of revenue growth in q4 2019 versus q4 2018 compared to the previous quarter revenue increased 30 9 million or 8 from 381 4 million in q3 2019 the increase in revenue was entirely from higher sales volumes which increased 9 from 256 276 ounces in q3 2019 the average realized gold price in q4 2019 was unchanged from the previous quarter net earnings and adjusted net earnings full year net earnings net earnings in fy 2019 totaled 560 1 million or 2 67 per share which compared to net earnings of 273 9 million or 1 30 per share in fy 2018 the most significant factor accounting for the 104 increase in earnings per share was the 51 increase in revenue in fy 2019 which had a favourable impact on the change in earnings per share of 1 56 1 09 related to the increase in sales volumes and 0 47 to the increase in the average realized gold price other factors that contributed to the increase in earnings per share included a 0 11 per share favourable impact from a reduction in expensed exploration costs in fy 2019 versus fy 2018 the reduction in expensed exploration costs resulted from a review of the company s drilling programs in the second quarter of 2019 which resulted in a determination that based on the extent to which the company s drilling is being completed contiguous to and for the purpose of extending existing mining areas a greater proportion of expenditures were evaluation in nature and as should be capitalized rather than expensed total exploration and evaluation expenditures in fy 2019 including both expensed and capitalized expenditures increased 63 to 159 2 million from 97 9 million the previous year with capitalized expenditures accounting for 125 7 million of fy 2019 exploration and evaluation expenditures versus 31 3 million in fy 2018 a reduction in the company s effective tax rate to 29 8 in fy 2019 versus 30 5 the previous year contributed an additional 0 02 to earnings per share growth year over year total income taxes in fy 2019 were 238 1 million of which 189 6 million was current income tax expense and 48 5 million was deferred tax expense during fy 2018 the company recognized 40 7 million of current income tax expense and 79 6 million of deferred income tax expense the significant amount of deferred income tax expense in fy 2018 resulted from the utilization of 53 3 million of deferred tax assets in respect of loss carryforwards to reduce current income tax expense partially offsetting the factors contributing to an increase in earnings were higher operating expenses an other loss in fy 2019 versus other income in fy 2018 and increased corporate g a costs depletion and depreciation costs production costs and royalty expense all increased in fy 2019 compared to fy 2018 the level of these expenses is linked to production and sales volumes with higher levels in fy 2019 largely resulting from growth of 35 and 36 respectively in total production and sales year over year other loss of 18 8 million before income taxes mainly reflected 16 2 million before income taxes of foreign exchange losses in fy 2019 largely reflecting the strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the us and australian dollars during the year the primary factor driving other income of 5 1 million before income taxes in fy 2018 resulted from foreign exchange gains of 16 9 million before income taxes due to the australian and canadian dollars weakening against the us dollar during fy 2018 which was only partially offset by a pre tax 10 9 million mark to market loss of fair valuing the company s warrant investments during the year the 18 8 million other loss in fy 2019 versus 5 1 million of other income in fy 2018 had a 0 08 unfavourable on the year over year change in earnings per share corporate g a expense in fy 2019 on a pre tax basis totaled 45 4 million including 9 3 million of share based payment expense versus 31 6 million including 5 5 million of share based payment expense in fy 2018 the increase in corporate g a expense reduced earnings per share by 0 03 in fy 2019 higher corporate g a expense in fy 2019 largely reflected related to the expansion of corporate capabilities in both canada and australia in support of the company s continued growth the increase in share based payment expense in fy 2019 largely resulted from share price appreciation resulting in greater mark to market values for the company s outstanding deferred share units restricted share units and performance share units adjusted net earnings adjusted net earnings in fy 2019 totaled 576 4 million or 2 74 per share versus net earnings of 560 1 million or 2 67 per share the primary difference between adjusted net earnings and net earnings in fy 2019 related to the exclusion from adjusted net earnings of 16 2 million 12 9 million after tax of foreign exchange losses resulting from fluctuations in the canadian and australian dollars against the us dollar in fy 2018 adjusted net earnings totaled 274 0 million or 1 30 per share which compared to net earnings of 273 9 million or 1 30 per share the difference between adjusted net earnings and net earnings in fy 2018 resulted from the exclusion from adjusted net earnings of 10 9 million 9 4 million after tax of mark to market losses on the fair valuing of the company s warrants 16 9 million 13 2 million after tax of foreign exchange gains to align with the foreign exchange adjustment made in fy 2019 as well as 5 4 million 3 8 million of after income taxes related to purchase price allocation adjustments on inventory q4 2019 net earnings in q4 2019 totaled 169 1 million or 0 81 per share which compared to net earnings of 106 5 million or 0 51 per share in q4 2018 strong revenue growth was the primary factor contributing to the increase in net earnings from q4 2019 the 47 increase in revenue to 412 4 million increased earnings per share by 0 46 in q4 2019 versus q4 2018 with both a higher realized gold price and increased sales volumes each contributing approximately 0 23 per share to the increase other factors contributed to higher earnings were a 0 02 per share favourable contribution from reduced expensed exploration costs and a 0 01 per share favourable impact from a lower effective tax rate in q4 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 the q4 2019 effective tax rate was 27 1 versus 28 7 in q4 2018 with the reduction largely resulting from a reduced deferred tax expense of 0 5 million in q4 2019 mainly due to revision of estimates in q4 2019 the company had current income tax expense in q4 2019 of 62 4 million in q4 2018 current income tax expense totaled 17 1 million with deferred income tax expense of 25 7 million factors that reduced net earnings per share in q4 2019 versus q4 2018 included a pre tax other loss of 25 2 million versus 1 2 million pre tax of other income for the same period a year earlier as well as higher levels of operating expenses including depletion and depreciation production costs and royalty expense as well as increased corporate g a costs the other loss in q4 2019 mainly reflected foreign exchange losses while higher operating expenses mainly resulted from increased production and sales volumes growth in corporate g a was due to the expansion of corporate capabilities in both canada and australia in support of the company s continued growth net earnings in q4 2019 compared to net earnings of 176 6 million or 0 84 per share in the previous quarter a significant factor impacting the change in earnings per share quarter over quarter was a 0 14 unfavourable impact from a pre tax other loss of 25 2 million in q4 2019 which compared to 13 9 million of pre tax other income in q3 2019 both the other loss in q4 2019 and other income in q3 2019 related to foreign exchange with there being 23 3 million 16 1 million after tax of foreign exchange gains in q4 2019 reflecting fluctuations of the canadian and australian dollar against the us dollar and a 13 7 million 9 1 million after tax foreign exchange gain the previous quarter increases in depletion and depreciation expense production costs and exploration expense also contributed to lower net earnings and earnings per share versus q3 2019 having a favourable impact on net earnings and earnings per share was the 8 increase in revenue quarter over quarter to 412 4 million in q4 2019 which increased earnings per share by 0 11 from q3 2019 and was all related to higher sales volumes a lower effective tax rate also contributed favourably to earnings the effective tax rate in q4 2019 of 27 1 compared to an effective tax rate of 30 5 in q3 2019 the lower effective tax rate had a 0 05 positive impact on earnings per share in q4 2019 compared to q3 2019 adjusted net earnings adjusted net earnings in q4 2019 totaled 185 3 million or 0 88 per share versus net earnings for the same period of 169 1 million or 0 81 per share the primary difference between adjusted net earnings and net earnings in q4 2019 related to the exclusion from adjusted net earnings of 23 3 million 16 1 million after tax of foreign exchange losses resulting from fluctuations in the canadian and australian dollars against the us dollar in

rounding analysis for peyto shareholders one of the guiding principles at peyto is to tell you the business facts that we would want to know if our positions were reversed therefore each year peyto provides an extensive analysis of the reserve evaluation that goes far beyond industry norms in order to answer the most important questions for shareholders base reserves how did the base reserves that were on production at the time of the last reserve report perform during the year and how did any change in commodity price forecast affect their value value creation how much value did the 2019 capital investments create both in current producing reserves and in undeveloped potential has the peyto team earned the right to continue investing shareholders capital growth and income are the projected cash flows capable of funding the growing number of undeveloped opportunities and a sustainable dividend stream to shareholders without sacrificing peyto s financial flexibility risk assessment what are the risks associated with the assessment of peyto s reserves and the risk of recovering future cashflows from the forecast production streams 1 base reserves peyto s existing proved producing reserves at the start of 2019 the base reserves were evaluated and adjusted for 2019 production as well as any technical or economic revisions resulting from the additional twelve months of production and commodity price data as part of insite s independent engineering analysis all 1 493 producing entities zones wells were evaluated these producing wells and zones represent a total gross estimated ultimate recoverable or eur volume of 3 9 tcfe remaining pdp pa reserves plus cumulative production to date which is down 0 7 from previous estimates and included a slight positive revision to liquid reserves and a slight negative revision to gas recoveries the first year decline of the base reserves is forecast to include changing liquid recoveries resulting in a change in the shape of the base decline curve from previous years in aggregate however peyto is pleased to report that its total base reserves continue to meet with expectation which increases the confidence in the prediction of future recoveries the commodity price forecast used by the independent engineers in this year s evaluation is significantly lower than last year which had the effect of reducing the net present value of all reserve categories for example the debt adjusted npv discounted at 5 of last year s proved developed producing reserves decreased 460 million or 24 due to the difference in commodity price forecasts and peyto s realized historical offsets to posted prices insite s price forecast used in the variable dollar economics is available on their website at www insitepc com for 2020 insite is now forecasting the total base production all wells on production at dec 31 2019 to decline to approximately 61 800 boe d 324 mmcf d of gas and 7 800 bbl d of ngls by december 2020 this decline incorporates the changing liquid yields for new cardium wells and implies a total base decline rate of approximately 23 from december 2019 the 2020 forecast decline rate is lower than the 2019 actual base decline of 29 which also exhibited this liquid yield dynamic in the new cardium wells the historical base decline rates and capital programs are shown in the following

peyto invested a total of 206 million in organic activity to buy and evaluate exploration lands expand its pipeline gathering network and drill 61 gross 53 net wells in keeping with peyto s strategy of maximizing shareholder returns an evaluation of the economic results of this investment activity is necessary in order to determine on a go forward basis the best use of shareholders capital not only does this look back analysis give shareholders a detailed report card on the capital that was invested it also helps illustrate the potential returns that can be generated from similar future undeveloped opportunities exploration and development activity of the total capital invested in exploration and development activities in 2019 approximately 4 was spent acquiring lands and seismic 13 on pipeline and facility projects and the remaining 83 was spent drilling completing and connecting existing and new reserves thirty nine of the 61 gross wells drilled or 64 were previously identified as undeveloped reserves in last year s reserve report 34 proved 5 probable additional the remaining 22 wells were locations developed in the year and were not recognized in last year s report the discovery and development of a new higher liquid rich region of peyto s cardium play has unveiled a more profitable resource as evident in increased liquid bookings peyto s booked cardium locations

represents only well related capital for drilling completion equipping and tie in this annual analysis of reserves that are converted from an undeveloped state to a producing state helps to validate the accuracy of the remaining future undeveloped reserves and their capital requirements this accuracy by which peyto can predict future reserve recoveries and capital requirements also helps to reduce the risk associated with valuing future undeveloped locations value reconciliation in order to measure the success of all capital invested in 2019 it is necessary to quantify the total amount of value added during the year and compare that to the total amount of capital invested at peyto s request the independent engineers have run last year s reserve evaluation with this year s price forecast to remove the change in value attributable to commodity prices this approach isolates the value created by the peyto team from the value created or lost by those changes outside of their control ie commodity prices since the capital investments can be funded from a combination of cash flow debt and equity it is necessary to know the change in debt and the change in shares outstanding to see if the change in value is truly accretive to shareholders at year end 2019 peyto s estimated net debt had decreased by 6 or 78 million to 1 147 billion while the number of shares outstanding remained the same at 164 9 million shares the change in debt includes all capital expenditures as well as any acquisitions and the total fixed and performance based compensation paid out for the year although these estimates are believed to be accurate they remain unaudited at this time and may be subject to change based on this reconciliation of changes in bt npv the peyto team was able to create 363 million of proved developed producing 1 131 billion of total proven and 1 892 billion of proved plus probable additional undiscounted reserve value with 206 million of capital investment cost reductions and marketing arrangements the ratio of capital expenditures to value creation is what peyto refers to as the npv recycle ratio which is simply the undiscounted value addition resulting from the capital program divided by the capital investment for 2019 the proved developed producing npv recycle ratio is 1 8 which means for each dollar invested the peyto team was able to create 1 8 new dollars of proved developed producing reserve value the historic npv recycle ratios are presented in the following table 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 wt avg capital

profitably grow the resources which generate sustainable income dividends for shareholders for income to be more sustainable and grow peyto must profitably find and develop more reserves simply increasing production from the existing reserves will not make that income more sustainable reserve life index rli or a reserve to production ratio provides a measure of this long term sustainability during 2019 the company again deployed a conservative capital program but was successful in effectively replacing 75 of annual production with new pdp reserves using less than 64 of funds from operations fourth quarter production decreased by 11 from 86 738 boe d 459 mmcf d gas 10 273 bbl d ngls to 77 457 boe d 397 mmcf d gas 11 220 bbl d ngls the change in both pdp reserves and fourth quarter production resulted in increasing the proved developed producing reserve life index from 8 7 years to 9 4 years for comparative purposes the total proved and p p rli index was 19 and 29 years respectively management believes that the most meaningful method to evaluate the current reserve life is by dividing the proved developed producing reserves by the actual fourth quarter annualized production this way production is being compared to producing reserves as opposed to producing plus non producing reserves the following table highlights the company s historical rli index 2006 2007

during peyto s 21 year history the company has found and developed 3 8 tcfe of total natural gas and associated liquids which resides in 348 of these net sections effectively peyto has invested 6 2

evaluators as proven undeveloped with the remaining 36 or 405 as probable undeveloped in addition the pu and pa categories include deep cut facility installations at two of peyto s greater sundance gas plants the net reserves associated with the undeveloped locations not including existing uphole zones totals 2 9 tcfe 484 mmboes consisting of 2 44 tcf of gas and 78 mmbbls of ngls while the total

incremental value at the insite commodity price forecast the undiscounted forecast for net operating income for the tp and p p reserves over the 7 year future development capital schedule as contained in the evaluator s report totals 4 1 billion and 5 7 billion respectively more than sufficient to fund the future development capital shown in the table above ensuring those reserve additions are accretive to shareholders the total estimated future development capital for both total proved and p p reserves increased from the previous year by 136 million and 102 million respectively which reflects the increase in future locations combined with the significant improvement in drilling and completion costs 4 risk assessment effectively 100 of peyto s natural gas and natural gas liquid reserves exist in low permeability tight sandstone reservoirs in the alberta deep basin in almost all cases the volumetric capacity of these sandstone reservoirs can be determined using traditional geological and reservoir engineering techniques which when complimented by production performance data increases the certainty of the reserve estimates in the majority of peyto s core areas continuous drilling activity has further refined the geologic and geometric definition of these reservoirs to a higher level of certainty in addition these deep basin sandstone reservoirs do not contain mobile water nor are they supported by active aquifers mobile water traditionally increases the risk associated with reservoir recovery by impeding the flow of hydrocarbons through the reservoir and up the wellbore water production separation and disposal processes also increase operating costs which shortens the economic life of producing wells further contributing to reduced recovery as many of these traditional reserves determination and recovery risks are not present in peyto s deep basin reservoirs management has a higher level of confidence in its reserves and their ultimate recovery peyto s high operating margins have meant that forecasts of net operating income are less affected by commodity price volatility than in most traditional reserve evaluations as a result the predicted economic life of peyto s producing wells are less sensitive to changes in commodity prices these high operating margins are achieved through the company s high level of ownership and control of all levels of production operations through a concentrated geographic asset base and by striving to be the lowest cost producer in the industry peyto attempts to further reduce the risk of predicted operating incomes with an active market diversification and hedging program that is designed over time to expose 40 of its natural gas sales to aeco based pricing link 40 to us pricing and sell 20 directly to intra alberta industrial markets as always peyto will continue to hedge future prices to smooth out the volatility in both alberta and us natural gas markets through a series of frequent transactions which is similar to dollar cost averaging the future gas price finally peyto is the operator of over 99 of its producing wells and has one of the highest ratios of producing to non producing wells in the industry approximately 98 of peyto s asset base has been organically developed by peyto and contains very few abandonment liabilities at december 31 2019 peyto owned 1 528 5 net wells of which over 90 are on production today and most are expected to produce for decades to come of the non producing wellbores 21 are considered medium risk inactive wells that require downhole suspension over the next several years the capital requirement for this work is estimated at 1 5 million for perspective the current existing developed reserves have a forecast value of 3 3 billion npv 5 of the pdp pa and pdnp pa while the cost to abandon and reclaim all wells sites and facilities is estimated at 55 million using the same 5 discount rate for future costs these cumulative factors listed above which reduce the traditional risk of realizing future cashflows from peyto s reserves is why in management s opinion peyto s reserves can be valued at lower discount rates than other more conventional asset bases loading loading performance ratios the following table highlights annual performance ratios both before and after the implementation of horizontal wells in late 2009 these can be used for

analysis for peyto shareholders one of the guiding principles at peyto is to tell you the business facts that we would want to know if our positions were reversed therefore each year peyto provides an extensive analysis of the reserve evaluation that goes far beyond industry norms in order to answer the most important questions for shareholders base reserves how did the base reserves that were on production at the time of the last reserve report perform during the year and how did any change in commodity price forecast affect their value value creation how much value did the 2019 capital investments create both in current producing reserves and in undeveloped potential has the peyto team earned the right to continue investing shareholders capital growth and income are the projected cash flows capable of funding the growing number of undeveloped opportunities and a sustainable dividend stream to shareholders without sacrificing peyto s financial flexibility risk assessment what are the risks associated with the assessment of peyto s reserves and the risk of recovering future cashflows from the forecast production streams 1 base reserves peyto s existing proved producing reserves at the start of 2019 the base reserves were evaluated and adjusted for 2019 production as well as any technical or economic revisions resulting from the additional twelve months of production and commodity price data as part of insite s independent engineering analysis all 1 493 producing entities zones wells were evaluated these producing wells and zones represent a total gross estimated ultimate recoverable or eur volume of 3 9 tcfe remaining pdp pa reserves plus cumulative production to date which is down 0 7 from previous estimates and included a slight positive revision to liquid reserves and a slight negative revision to gas recoveries the first year decline of the base reserves is forecast to include changing liquid recoveries resulting in a change in the shape of the base decline curve from previous years in aggregate however peyto is pleased to report that its total base reserves continue to meet with expectation which increases the confidence in the prediction of future recoveries the commodity price forecast used by the independent engineers in this year s evaluation is significantly lower than last year which had the effect of reducing the net present value of all reserve categories for example the debt adjusted npv discounted at 5 of last year s proved developed producing reserves decreased 460 million or 24 due to the difference in commodity price forecasts and peyto s realized historical offsets to posted prices insite s price forecast used in the variable dollar economics is available on their website at www insitepc com for 2020 insite is now forecasting the total base production all wells on production at dec 31 2019 to decline to approximately 61 800 boe d 324 mmcf d of gas and 7 800 bbl d of ngls by december 2020 this decline incorporates the changing liquid yields for new cardium wells and implies a total base decline rate of approximately 23 from december 2019 the 2020 forecast decline rate is lower than the 2019 actual base decline of 29 which also exhibited this liquid yield dynamic in the new cardium wells the historical base decline rates and capital programs are shown in the following table 2008 2009 20101 2011

noted that horizontal multi stage fracture technology began to be widely used after 2010 which changed the nature of the drilling inventory also the company s total internal drilling inventory is larger and more comprehensive than that identified in the insite report the undeveloped reserves at year end 2018 originally booked to the 39 locations referred to above totaled 129 bcfe 3 3 bcfe well

yielding proved developed producing plus probable additional reserves of 124 bcfe 3 2 bcfe well the actual reserves developed have a higher liquid content than originally forecast however which generates higher netbacks the following table illustrates the company s historical performance in converting future undeveloped locations into producing wells and demonstrates that peyto has

represents only well related capital for drilling completion equipping and tie in this annual analysis of reserves that are converted from an undeveloped state to a producing state helps to validate the accuracy of the remaining future undeveloped reserves and their capital requirements this accuracy by which peyto can predict future reserve recoveries and capital requirements also helps to reduce the risk associated with valuing future undeveloped locations value reconciliation in order to measure the success of all capital invested in 2019 it is necessary to quantify the total amount of value added during the year and compare that to the total amount of capital invested at peyto s request the independent engineers have run last year s reserve evaluation with this year s price forecast to remove the change in value attributable to commodity prices this approach isolates the value created by the peyto team from the value created or lost by those changes outside of their control ie commodity prices since the capital investments can be funded from a combination of cash flow debt and equity it is necessary to know the change in debt and the change in shares outstanding to see if the change in value is truly accretive to shareholders at year end 2019 peyto s estimated net debt had decreased by 6 or 78 million to 1 147 billion while the number of shares outstanding remained the same at 164 9 million shares the change in debt includes all capital expenditures as well as any acquisitions and the total fixed and performance based compensation paid out for the year although these estimates are believed to be accurate they remain unaudited at this time and may be subject to change based on this reconciliation of changes in bt npv the peyto team was able to create 363 million of proved developed producing 1 131 billion of total proven and 1 892 billion of proved plus probable additional undiscounted reserve value with 206 million of capital investment cost reductions and marketing arrangements the ratio of capital expenditures to value creation is what peyto refers to as the npv recycle ratio which is simply the undiscounted value addition resulting from the capital program divided by the capital investment for 2019 the proved developed producing npv recycle ratio is 1 8 which means for each dollar invested the peyto team was able to create 1 8 new dollars of proved developed producing reserve value the historic npv recycle ratios are presented in the following table 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 wt avg capital

the year by the total capital cost for the period eg 2018 proved developed producing 1 066 232 4 6 3 g rowth and income as a dividend paying growth oriented corporation peyto s objective is to profitably grow the resources which generate sustainable income dividends for shareholders for income to be more sustainable and grow peyto must profitably find and develop more reserves simply increasing production from the existing reserves will not make that income more sustainable reserve life index rli or a reserve to production ratio provides a measure of this long term sustainability during 2019 the company again deployed a conservative capital program but was successful in effectively replacing 75 of annual production with new pdp reserves using less than 64 of funds from operations fourth quarter production decreased by 11 from 86 738 boe d 459 mmcf d gas 10 273 bbl d ngls to 77 457 boe d 397 mmcf d gas 11 220 bbl d ngls the change in both pdp reserves and fourth quarter production resulted in increasing the proved developed producing reserve life index from 8 7 years to 9 4 years for comparative purposes the total proved and p p rli index was 19 and 29 years respectively management believes that the most meaningful method to evaluate the current reserve life is by dividing the proved developed producing reserves by the actual fourth quarter annualized production this way production is being compared to producing reserves as opposed to producing plus non producing reserves the following table highlights the company s historical rli index 2006 2007

rights are held in a number of stacked prospective horizons expanding this land base by almost four fold to a total of 3 247 net sections of rights over duvernay montney and seven cretaceous horizons during peyto s 21 year history the company has found and developed 3 8 tcfe of total natural gas and associated liquids which resides in 348 of these net sections effectively peyto has invested 6 2 billion to fully develop 11 of its existing land base which has also resulted in the generation of 6 3 billion of cumulative funds from operations and 2 6 billion in cumulative earnings to date likewise the remaining undeveloped land base holds significant future potential the independent reserve evaluators have forecast development activity for the next six years as shown in the following

future development activity their forecast is by no means a complete assessment of peyto s current opportunities nor is peyto content to just sit back and harvest these current opportunities each year the results from the drilling activity spawn additional offsetting locations both on currently owned lands and lands peyto does not yet own but attempts to acquire the pace of inventory generation has historically exceeded the pace of drilling activity at a ratio of 2 1 resulting in a growing number of future drilling locations recognized in peyto s reserve report gross locations 2009 2010 2011

recognized in the reserve report increasing from 1 201 gross 982 net locations to 1 280 gross 1 035 net locations of these future locations 64 or 630 are categorized by the independent reserve evaluators as proven undeveloped with the remaining 36 or 405 as probable undeveloped in addition the pu and pa categories include deep cut facility installations at two of peyto s greater sundance gas plants the net reserves associated with the undeveloped locations not including existing uphole zones totals 2 9 tcfe 484 mmboes consisting of 2 44 tcf of gas and 78 mmbbls of ngls while the total capital required to develop them is estimated at 3 5 billion or 1 21 mcfe this is forecast to create net present value of 3 5 billion 5 discount rate post capital recovery or 21 per share of incremental value at the insite commodity price forecast the undiscounted forecast for net operating income for the tp and p p reserves over the 7 year future development capital schedule as contained in the evaluator s report totals 4 1 billion and 5 7 billion respectively more than sufficient to fund the future development capital shown in the table above ensuring those reserve additions are accretive to shareholders the total estimated future development capital for both total proved and p p reserves increased from the previous year by 136 million and 102 million respectively which reflects the increase in future locations combined with the significant improvement in drilling and completion costs 4 risk assessment effectively 100 of peyto s natural gas and natural gas liquid reserves exist in low permeability tight sandstone reservoirs in the alberta deep basin in almost all cases the volumetric capacity of these sandstone reservoirs can be determined using traditional geological and reservoir engineering techniques which when complimented by production performance data increases the certainty of the reserve estimates in the majority of peyto s core areas continuous drilling activity has further refined the geologic and geometric definition of these reservoirs to a higher level of certainty in addition these deep basin sandstone reservoirs do not contain mobile water nor are they supported by active aquifers mobile water traditionally increases the risk associated with reservoir recovery by impeding the flow of hydrocarbons through the reservoir and up the wellbore water production separation and disposal processes also increase operating costs which shortens the economic life of producing wells further contributing to reduced recovery as many of these traditional reserves determination and recovery risks are not present in peyto s deep basin reservoirs management has a higher level of confidence in its reserves and their ultimate recovery peyto s high operating margins have meant that forecasts of net operating income are less affected by commodity price volatility than in most traditional reserve evaluations as a result the predicted economic life of peyto s producing wells are less sensitive to changes in commodity prices these high operating margins are achieved through the company s high level of ownership and control of all levels of production operations through a concentrated geographic asset base and by striving to be the lowest cost producer in the industry peyto attempts to further reduce the risk of predicted operating incomes with an active market diversification and hedging program that is designed over time to expose 40 of its natural gas sales to aeco based pricing link 40 to us pricing and sell 20 directly to intra alberta industrial markets as always peyto will continue to hedge future prices to smooth out the volatility in both alberta and us natural gas markets through a series of frequent transactions which is similar to dollar cost averaging the future gas price finally peyto is the operator of over 99 of its producing wells and has one of the highest ratios of producing to non producing wells in the industry approximately 98 of peyto s asset base has been organically developed by peyto and contains very few abandonment liabilities at december 31 2019 peyto owned 1 528 5 net wells of which over 90 are on production today and most are expected to produce for decades to come of the non producing wellbores 21 are considered medium risk inactive wells that require downhole suspension over the next several years the capital requirement for this work is estimated at 1 5 million for perspective the current existing developed reserves have a forecast value of 3 3 billion npv 5 of the pdp pa and pdnp pa while the cost to abandon and reclaim all wells sites and facilities is estimated at 55 million using the same 5 discount rate for future costs these cumulative factors listed above which reduce the traditional risk of realizing future cashflows from peyto s reserves is why in management s opinion peyto s reserves can be valued at lower discount rates than other more conventional asset bases performance ratios the following table highlights annual performance ratios both before and after the implementation of horizontal wells in late 2009 these can be used for comparative purposes but it is cautioned that on their own they do not measure investment success 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 proved developed producing fd a mcfe 1 55 1 18 1 36 1 44 1 64 2

accurate way to evaluate the current reserve life is by dividing the proved developed producing reserves by the annualized actual fourth quarter average production in peyto s opinion for comparative purposes the proved developed producing reserve life provides the best measure of sustainability the recycle ratio is calculated by dividing the field netback per boe by the fd a costs for the period eg 2018 proved developed producing 15 95 7 08 2 3 the recycle ratio is comparing the netback from existing reserves to the cost of finding new reserves and may not accurately indicate investment success unless the replacement reserves are of equivalent quality as the produced reserves the reserve replacement ratio is determined by dividing the yearly change in reserves before production by

bell creek mines alternative performance non gaap measures per ounce measures cash costs and aisc are non gaap financial measures that do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by ifrs and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies pan american produces by product metals incidentally to our silver and gold mining activities we have adopted the practice of calculating a performance measure with the net cost of producing an ounce of silver and gold our primary payable metals after deducting revenues gained from incidental by product production this performance measurement has been commonly used in the mining industry for many years and was developed as a relatively simple way of comparing the net production costs of the primary metal for a specific period against the prevailing market price of that metal silver segment cash costs and aisc are calculated net of credits for realized revenues from all metals other than silver silver segment by product credits and are calculated per ounce of silver sold gold segment cash costs and aisc are calculated net of credits for realized silver revenues gold segment by product credits and are calculated per ounce of gold sold consolidated cash costs and aisc are based on total silver ounces sold and are net of by product credits from all metals other than silver silver basis consolidated by product credits prior period cash costs per ounce reported in previous news releases and md as were based on cash costs per ounce of payable silver produced and were net of by product credits calculated with average market prices applied to all metals produced other than silver given the increased complexity of the business with the addition of the new gold operations the company determined that conforming the calculation of cash costs with a consistent method to that used for aisc using realized by product sales as by product credits and based on per ounce of silver sold would provide a more consistent per ounce measure as such the comparative cash costs amounts in this md a have been quantified using the current methodology and are different from those previously reported as shown in the detailed quantification of consolidated aisc below corporate general and administrative expense and exploration and project development expenses are included in the calculation of consolidated silver basis aisc but are not allocated amongst the operations and thus are not included in either the silver or gold segment aisc totals in prior years these costs were similarly included only in the consolidated all in sustaining costs per silver ounce sold aiscsos metrics and not allocated to each mine s aiscsos amount as such consolidated aiscsos in previous years included such costs where total silver segment aisc in the current period does not a detailed description of how previously reported cash costs were quantified is provided in the company s prior period md as cash costs per ounce metrics net of by product credits is used extensively in our internal decision making processes we believe the metric is also useful to investors because it facilitates comparison on a mine by mine basis notwithstanding the unique mix of incidental by product production at each mine of our operations relative performance on a period by period basis and against the operations of our peers in the silver industry cash costs per ounce is conceptually understood and widely reported in the mining industry we believe that aisc also calculated net of by products is a comprehensive measure of the full cost of operating our business given it includes the cost of replacing silver and gold ounces through exploration the cost of ongoing capital investments sustaining capital general and administrative expenses as well as other items that affect the company s consolidated cash flow to facilitate a better understanding of these measure as calculated by the company the following tables provide the detailed reconciliation of these measure to the applicable cost items as reported in the consolidated financial statements for the respective periods all operating results from the mines acquired in the tahoe acquisition only include results from february 22 2019 to december 31 2019 and the year to date amounts do not represent a full

creek mines adjusted earnings and basic adjusted earnings per share adjusted earnings and basic adjusted earnings per share are non gaap measures that the company considers to better reflect normalized earnings as it eliminates items that in management s judgment are subject to volatility as a result of factors which are unrelated to operations in the period and or relate to items that will settle in future periods certain items that become applicable in a period may be adjusted for with the company retroactively presenting comparable periods with an adjustment for such items and conversely items no longer applicable may be removed from the calculation the company adjusts certain items in the periods that they occurred but does not reverse or otherwise unwind the effect of such items in future periods neither adjusted earnings nor basic adjusted earnings per share have any standardized meaning prescribed by gaap and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar

bell creek mines alternative performance non gaap measures per ounce measures cash costs and aisc are non gaap financial measures that do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by ifrs and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies pan american produces by product metals incidentally to our silver and gold mining activities we have adopted the practice of calculating a performance measure with the net cost of producing an ounce of silver and gold our primary payable metals after deducting revenues gained from incidental by product production this performance measurement has been commonly used in the mining industry for many years and was developed as a relatively simple way of comparing the net production costs of the primary metal for a specific period against the prevailing market price of that metal silver segment cash costs and aisc are calculated net of credits for realized revenues from all metals other than silver silver segment by product credits and are calculated per ounce of silver sold gold segment cash costs and aisc are calculated net of credits for realized silver revenues gold segment by product credits and are calculated per ounce of gold sold consolidated cash costs and aisc are based on total silver ounces sold and are net of by product credits from all metals other than silver silver basis consolidated by product credits prior period cash costs per ounce reported in previous news releases and md as were based on cash costs per ounce of payable silver produced and were net of by product credits calculated with average market prices applied to all metals produced other than silver given the increased complexity of the business with the addition of the new gold operations the company determined that conforming the calculation of cash costs with a consistent method to that used for aisc using realized by product sales as by product credits and based on per ounce of silver sold would provide a more consistent per ounce measure as such the comparative cash costs amounts in this md a have been quantified using the current methodology and are different from those previously reported as shown in the detailed quantification of consolidated aisc below corporate general and administrative expense and exploration and project development expenses are included in the calculation of consolidated silver basis aisc but are not allocated amongst the operations and thus are not included in either the silver or gold segment aisc totals in prior years these costs were similarly included only in the consolidated all in sustaining costs per silver ounce sold aiscsos metrics and not allocated to each mine s aiscsos amount as such consolidated aiscsos in previous years included such costs where total silver segment aisc in the current period does not a detailed description of how previously reported cash costs were quantified is provided in the company s prior period md as cash costs per ounce metrics net of by product credits is used extensively in our internal decision making processes we believe the metric is also useful to investors because it facilitates comparison on a mine by mine basis notwithstanding the unique mix of incidental by product production at each mine of our operations relative performance on a period by period basis and against the operations of our peers in the silver industry cash costs per ounce is conceptually understood and widely reported in the mining industry we believe that aisc also calculated net of by products is a comprehensive measure of the full cost of operating our business given it includes the cost of replacing silver and gold ounces through exploration the cost of ongoing capital investments sustaining capital general and administrative expenses as well as other items that affect the company s consolidated cash flow to facilitate a better understanding of these measure as calculated by the company the following tables provide the detailed reconciliation of these measure to the applicable cost items as reported in the consolidated financial statements for the respective

creek mines adjusted earnings and basic adjusted earnings per share adjusted earnings and basic adjusted earnings per share are non gaap measures that the company considers to better reflect normalized earnings as it eliminates items that in management s judgment are subject to volatility as a result of factors which are unrelated to operations in the period and or relate to items that will settle in future periods certain items that become applicable in a period may be adjusted for with the company retroactively presenting comparable periods with an adjustment for such items and conversely items no longer applicable may be removed from the calculation the company adjusts certain items in the periods that they occurred but does not reverse or otherwise unwind the effect of such items in future periods neither adjusted earnings nor basic adjusted earnings per share have any standardized meaning prescribed by gaap and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar

impact coming primary elections but bloomberg s performance was probably poor enough to further solidify bernie sanders as the front runner again even if the market thinks the probability of sanders beating trump is low we generally agree it is not a zero probability event and the market will have to come to terms with at least some risk of a bernie presidency moreover if bernie did beat trump that likely would mean turnout was high among democrats so grabbing full control of congress cannot be ruled out under that scenario a bernie presidency that is frustrated by a republican controlled congress is very different than a bernie presidency with congress behind him and a mandate to tweak the us economic machine in his vision the market is seemingly far from pricing any degree of probability that this event comes to fruition in the context that a bernie win is a non zero event the market is seemingly being a bit complacent here europe advertisement european shares eased from

leo leo denault chairman of the board and chief executive officer thank you david and good morning everyone today we are reporting strong results for another very successful year our adjusted earnings per share is 5 40 in the top half of the guidance range that we raised last quarter our financial results combined with our operational achievements once again show that we deliver on what we set out to do everything we accomplished in 2019 also reinforces our confidence in our continued success into the future this past year we saw solid achievements in all aspects of our utility business in power generation we placed into service two clean efficient and modern ccgts totaling 1800 megawatts in louisiana the st charles power station came online in may affirming our track record of completing major generation projects on time and on budget and sometimes better and a few months later entergy mississippi purchased the choctaw generating station these resources are part of our portfolio transformation strategy to replace older generation with cleaner more efficient assets they improve system reliability reduce cost for our customers and produce significantly fewer emissions further advancing our sustainability goals renewable energy is another key component of our portfolio transformation we currently have close to 400 megawatts of renewable capacity that are in operation and nearly 2000 megawatts of additional renewable projects in various stages of development about half of those are specific projects that we ve already discussed with you the other half are potential new projects we are currently evaluating and we will share more details with you at the right time we are committed to providing our customers with renewable power options and as technology and economics continue to improve we expect to meet even more of our supply planning needs with renewables also in generation we recently commissioned a 7 4 megawatt battery at our perryville station in louisiana this is an innovative application of battery technology that will allow entergy louisiana to start a 150 megawatt combustion turbine without grid power and it will support grid reliability and resiliency in 2019 we invested a 1 billion in our transmission infrastructure during the year we completed several projects including phase 1 of the western region economic transmission project in texas the southwest louisiana improvement project and auto transformer projects in little rock and central mississippi our transmission investments benefit our system and our customers as they reduce congestion enhance system reliability efficiency and resiliency and support the economic development of our jurisdictions by enabling service to new customers in distribution we are now one third of the way through the installation of 3 million advanced meters across our service area to complement this effort we are investing in an improved digital platform to create a multi channel experience for our customers a new outage and distribution management system and enterprise asset and work management system and increased automation on our grid this technology platform not only provides customer usage insights today but also lays the foundation for advanced capabilities over time and with billions of real time data points available we ll be able to glean new insights that will drive fundamental change in the way we serve our customers while they consume the least amount of energy resources our customers expectations are evolving and we re preparing to meet them instead of simply providing an input electricity or gas we re thinking about the outcomes our customers need and desire from their power consumption with new technologies and capabilities deployed we ll be able to anticipate their needs and offer tailored solutions in 2019 we formed keystring labs our innovation center to engage with stakeholders and develop new solutions that address our customers desired outcomes and make their lives better for example we ve developed a backup generator offering for commercial and industrial customers called power through we installed our first 1 megawatt generator at a grocery store in texas the resource is available to the store in the event of a power outage and it s available to the utility at other times both parties share the cost which makes it economic for everyone and mutually beneficial entergy texas has already utilized this resource providing cost effective and efficient power back to the grid we also have a line of sight on additional projects in december we received approval from the mississippi public service commission to deploy 20 generators in the state and we are actively working with our regulatory teams to introduce power through across all our jurisdictions keystring labs is also working on solutions to expand beneficial electrification of sectors that currently use fossil fuels this is an important pillar of our broader strategy to reduce societal carbon emissions beyond our own footprint this is a practical and environmentally responsible way to help customers in other industries meet their sustainability goals by relying on entergy s grid power instead of higher emitting fossil fuels we recently launched a utility scale shore power project that extends our distribution system to marine vessels imports our first shore power project went into service just last month which we estimate will achieve up to 42 net reduction in carbon emissions 48 net reduction in sulfur oxides and 98 reduction in nitrogen oxides we believe we have significant opportunities to deploy shore power projects as we have 37 ports in our service area 7 of which are among the 20 largest ports in the united states these are just some of the innovative projects we re working on across the organization and we are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead customer solutions will be an important part of our business and we will continue to explore opportunities to improve our customers everyday lives through new technology data analytics innovation and creative solutions over the last several years we have built constructive relationships with our regulators that have enabled the development of progressive regulatory mechanisms across our jurisdictions we have formula rate plans in four of our five jurisdictions arkansas louisiana mississippi and new orleans entergy arkansas and entergy louisiana will file this year to request renewal for their current frps entergy texas has cost recovery factors for transmission and distribution investments they also have a rider for ami recovery in 2019 new legislation directed the public utility commission of texas to establish a rider for generation investments that rider is currently being developed through a rulemaking process which we expect to be finalized in the third quarter in new orleans the city council approved a rate reduction that reflects a 9 35 roe and caps entergy orleans equity at 50 we have appealed that decision and we continue to work with council members to reach a fair outcome as a result of collaborative work with our regulators 90 of our three year capital plan is expected to be recovered through timely progressive regulatory mechanisms for the last several years our strategy to manage risks has included the planned orderly exit from our merchant business this past year we sold vermont yankee and pilgrim and with a final and sale agreement in place for indian point we are well on our way to complete our ewc exit our leadership in sustainability and environmental stewardship has been a hallmark of who we are for nearly two decades and it remains a key focus for us today in 2019 we were named once again to the dow jones sustainability north america index we are the only electric utility to receive this honor 18 years in a row and we are very proud of this recognition as djsi is one of the most respected independent sustainability measures in the world we earned perfect scores in the areas of climate strategy corporate citizenship and philanthropy policy influence materiality and water related risks this past year we released our climate scenario analysis we outlined our role in meeting the imperative to reduce risk posed by climate change we announced a new greenhouse gas emissions goal to reduce our co2 emissions rate to 50 below year 2000 levels by 2030 i m proud to say that today we are already one of the cleanest large scale generation fleets in the country according to the 2019 m j bradley benchmarking air emissions report this independent third party analysis confirms that of the top 20 privately or investor owned power producers in the united states entergy has the fourth lowest co2 emissions rate in the nation in addition we have limited coal resources which produce only 6 of our 2019 energy mix we have definitive plans to retire the majority of those resources by the end of 2030 and we are evaluating options for the rest we ve worked hard over the last 20 years to ensure that we are one of the cleanest utilities among our peers and our renewed environmental commitments will ensure that we remain so for years to come beyond environmental efforts entergy has established a legacy of corporate citizenship we make an impact in our communities through a combination of philanthropy and volunteerism and advocacy we ve earned national recognition for our efforts in improved education and workforce development eradicate poverty

give you a view of our five year outlook and we will continue the conversation on key areas of focus for our company so stay tuned for more details i will now turn the call over to drew who will review our 2019 financial results 2020 guidance and our outlook andrew marsh executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you leo good morning everyone as leo stated we are reporting strong results for another very successful year 2019 adjusted earnings per share were 5 40 in the top half of our guidance range that we raised last quarter these results keep us firmly on track to achieve our longer term growth aspirations i ll begin with a review of results for the fourth quarter and then move to the full year i ll provide an overview of our guidance i ll also provide an overview of our guidance for 2020 starting with the quarter on slide 5 on a per share basis entergy adjusted earnings were 0 68 slightly below fourth quarter of 2018 turning to the utility on slide 6 rate actions in arkansas louisiana mississippi and texas contributed positively to the quarter s results regulatory charges and provisions recorded last year also contributed to the quarter over quarter variance lower retail sales volumes and higher operating expenses primarily depreciation and o m partially offset the increase the higher share count also affected this quarter s results on a per share basis moving to ewc on slide 7 as reported earnings were 1 08 approximately 3 higher than a year ago this was largely the result of higher returns on decommissioning trust investments during the quarter favorable tax items and lower asset write offs and impairment charges on slide 8 you can see that operating cash flow in the quarter was 699 million 173 million higher than a year ago the biggest driver was the lower amount of unprotected excess adit return to customers another offsetting key driver was an incremental 200 million contribution to our pension trust made possible by the strong cash flows in 2019 now turning to the full year on slide 9 entergy adjusted eps for 2019 was 5 40 0 11 higher than for 2018 these results exceeded the midpoint of both our original and our revised guidance ranges utility adjusted eps on slide 10 was 6 95 in 2019 0 07 higher than 2018 while the magnitudes are different the drivers for the annual increase were the same as for the quarter i just reviewed slide 11 summarizes ewc as reported earnings which were 0 74 for full year 2019 gains on the decommissioning trust fund investments lower asset write offs and impairment charges and lower operating centers were the main drivers partially offsetting this increase was lower revenue primarily due to the shutdown in sale of pilgrim full year operating cash flow shown on slide 12 was approximately 2 8 billion 432 million higher than last year the most significant driver was an approximately 300 million reduction in the unprotected excess adit return to customers 2019 results also benefited from increased collections for fuel and purchase power cost recovery at the utility and lower revenues at ewc partially offset the increase moving to slide 13 our 2020 adjusted eps guidance range is 5 45 to 5 75 for the midpoint of 5 60 this and our 2021 and 2022 outlook ranges remain the same as our outlooks at eei we continue to target a 5 to 7 annual growth rate for adjusted earnings per share a few of the key drivers for 2020 earnings growth are summarized on slide 14 starting on the top line a full year of 2019 rate activity at entergy louisiana and entergy mississippi will contribute to 2020 s growth as well as entergy arkansas new rates that were effective in january of this year we will also make frp filings in mississippi new orleans and louisiana and we expect the lake charles power station to go into service during the second quarter with rate recovery in the month following its in service date additionally our project sales volume in 2020 is expected to increase year over year our projected sales volume in 2020 is expected to increase year over year driven by strong industrial sales growth of approximately 5 5 this is partly offset by slightly negative residential and commercial sales volume we continue to expect volatility in industrial sales from quarter to quarter as new and expansion customers ramp up operations overall we see about 2 positive sales growth for 2020 we project utility o m to be approximately 2 6 billion in line with our previous disclosures and about 30 million higher than 2019 this is driven by pension expense and items offset in revenue such as energy efficiency and storm reserves smaller amount is due to a full year of st charles and choctaw as well as the lake charles power station coming online depreciation and interest expense are also expected to increase as we expect as we continue to grow our business through productive investments to benefit our customers and our communities on a per share basis we expect our average share count to be 201 million shares as a result of settling the remainder of our equity forward mid year 2019 finally our cash and credit metrics as of the end of the year are shown on slide 15 our parent debt to total debt is 21 6 and our ffo to debt is 14 6 this includes the effects of returning 300 million of unprotected excess adit to customers over the last 12 months excluding this give back and certain items related to our exit of ewc ffo to debt would have been 16 8 while we still have some unprotected excess adit remaining we have returned over 1 billion to our customers and the bulk of the credit impact is now behind us we remain committed to our credit targets including at or above 15 for ffo to debt by 2020 and below 25 for parent debt to total debt as well as maintaining our investment grade profile i d also like to note that our finalized capital plan is in the appendix of our materials our capital plan through 2022 continues to grow and now totals nearly 12 billion led by an incremental transmission investment in louisiana and texas the financing framework for our capital plan has not changed since 2018 and we don t see a need for equity until 2021 now that we are in 2020 we are actively considering the timing and method to fill that need in a manner that best supports our financial goals as leo mentioned 2019 was a very successful year for our company the fundamentals that support the steady predictable growth of our business are strong and as we continue to optimize our efficiencies through continuous improvement technology and innovation we see an opportunity to take our business to the next level we are excited about the growth ahead and now the entergy team is available to answer questions questions and answers operator thank you our first question comes from shar pourreza with guggenheim partners carl guggenheim partners analyst hi good morning guys it s actually carl for shar leo denault chairman of the board and chief executive officer good morning shar andrew marsh executive vice president and chief financial officer okay good morning leo denault chairman of the board and chief executive officer good morning carl guggenheim partners analyst good morning congratulations on a great quarter leo denault chairman of the board and chief executive officer thank you carl guggenheim partners analyst you talked about some of these innovative capital deployment programs that kind of you re putting in place and just wanted to kind of get a little bit of an idea for how big do you see the opportunities for all of the electrification and kind of customer solutions and how does that fit within the plan that was presented at eei leo denault chairman of the board and chief executive officer as far as the plan there is very little in there we have added some dollars when we went through the process at the end of the second quarter where we had some continuous improvement opportunities and then we put money back into the business for all of our stakeholders there were some level of that from the keystring labs sort of initiatives but there is very little in the plan really at this point for those opportunities it s a little early for us to start to size it up as the year goes on and we start to develop more we will but our view is that at the end of the day the distribution side of the business and these customer solutions will be the fastest growing part of our business customer solutions could include all kinds of electrification if you look at for example louisiana industry is the second largest emitter of greenhouse gases behind transportation with utilities third which is a little bit different than it is in the rest of the country given the nature and the size of the industrial complex in louisiana so across all of our footprint we see a significant amount of opportunity in the electrification space once we work beyond shore power and into manufacturing processes and even transportation sector so that could get significant over time as we go forward and there is a lot of other things that they re going to be able to do in addition to what we ve already done in solar in addition to what we re already doing in backup generators as i mentioned while we put the footprint of ami eam customer digital and all of those other technological improvements that we do on the system we get significant amounts of data that will allow keystring labs and the rest of the company to actually create products and services based on that so it s too early to size what it to size it up and give you any numbers but if you go five years 10 years down the road we think that it s going to be pretty significant carl guggenheim partners analyst wonderful thanks just one quick follow up is on the numbers for kind of sales volume in 2019 seem a little bit weaker and a little bit weak on the industrial sales and just the customer count can you comment on what you re seeing in terms of just economic activity and kind of how does that play into going into 2020 andrew marsh executive vice president and chief financial officer sure this is drew the fundamental strength that we have that are sort of built into our service area are still in place in terms of the low costs down here from an energy perspective are low rates the welcoming communities for industrial growth the access to the river and the infrastructure and the labor and everything else so all those things are still in place and so we continue to see opportunity going forward that would allow us to continue to grow on the industrial base talking about 2019 versus 2020 we talked about over the course of 2019 how some of our key customers that we were expecting to ramp up were not able to ramp up as fast as we anticipated but we still expect them to be there and so that s contributing to kind of the year over year expectations for 2020 as well as on the smaller industrial customer size base there was quite a bit of rain in arkansas so a number of our customers in that normally do pumping for agricultural use on an industrial scale weren t there but we expect them to be back in 2020 barring assuming a normal weather condition up in arkansas so that s really what s driving kind of the change year over year and kind of the softness in 2019 and i ll let rod talk a little bit about sort of the where we actually see customers going forward rod west group president utility operations hey good morning i think we commented during the last quarter that our confidence in the outlook comes from the fact that our growth expectations stem from our ability to actually identify specific projects and we know exactly who those customers are over the last several years we ve improved our capacity to engage those customers giving us greater visibility and insight through various aspects of their project development cycle from concept to financial investment decisions and so when we give you our outlook it s a probability weighted assessment of the timing of those projects coming online and the associated load and financial implication so our outlook is still strong and we can tie our expectations in the near term to specific firms within a different industrial segment so we still have clarity admittedly they sometimes come in lumpy over the course of quarter over quarter but our confidence is still high in the industry outlooks driving our growth carl guggenheim partners analyst perfect that s really helpful congrats on good quarter thanks guys leo denault chairman of the board and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from julien dumoulin smith with bank of america julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey good morning team thanks for the time leo denault chairman of the board and chief executive officer good morning julien julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey so perhaps to tick up on some of the commentary leo can you elaborate a little bit more on some of the customer centric angles and specifically what i m getting at is i think some of your commissioners in louisiana specifically have talked about some more direct access and i don t mean direct access in the competitive sense but more in terms of procurement choices i m just curious should we expect something along the lines of green tariffs or something like that to sort of enable another angle here i don t want to leave the witness too much but i m curious on that angle and then separately leo you also talked about the resource portfolio at large from what i understand i think there is a retirement study ongoing and i just wanted to understand a little bit as to how that might play out more specifically in terms of dockets and how we see sort of the planning process play more specifically out in the near to medium term rather leo denault chairman of the board and chief executive officer let me try and keep up with that question or that series of questions the as far as the customer solutions area goes it s wide ranging across all of our customer segments so we ve done low income rooftop solar in out of keystring labs we ve done backup generation for small industrial and commercial at the utility level we re engaging with our larger industrial customers across a variety of different ways to interact with them to help them do business better we have been investigating green tariffs we have been investigating community solar we are looking at a whole host of other types of products and services that provide us the opportunity to give our customers the outcomes they desire if you think about a customer utility function it goes beyond just and i don t mean electric utility but from an economic standpoint it goes beyond just the low cost provision of highly reliable power it goes beyond that in terms of what their objectives are in terms of what they want to do with that consumption so if they have a sustainability objective in addition to just selling them electricity we want to help our customers with that sustainability objective so hence that s where you get into a position where you electrify a sector in the shore power arena as i mentioned just there we help those customers meet their sustainability objectives in quite honestly a way that meets their needs at a lower cost and so that s a very very important way for us to serve the customer while we serve the communities while we enhance our sustainability footprint and theirs and make them more competitive in their businesses so i in terms of specifics julien across that products and services will be developed out of innovation by working with our customers in a different way than we have before because technology data information analytics allow us that capability in ways that weren t available and the more technologies we put on the system the more availability we ll have at that data and that information and our ability to actually make that happen so the reason we re so excited about it is it s pretty wide ranging in terms of what we re going to do for different segments of the residential class versus different segments of the commercial class versus different in specific customers in the industrial space so that s about as specific as i really want to get at the moment on that i mean as far as the resource plan goes we re obviously constantly in the mode of evaluating what the resource plan looks like going forward in all of our jurisdictions and as we see technologies change our view of what those resources could be broadens and so from the standpoint of say what type of technology choices we make whether they d be on the energy efficiency side on the side of renewables gas or what have you we have the opportunity to expand that footprint and as technology improves and renewables and battery and other storage technologies become more economic and more operable we ll see more of those show up in the system and it s our anticipation that we will continue to provide three things for our customers through the resource plan one is operability when they turn on the lights they come on that s obviously a ticket to play we continue to want to be one of the lowest cost providers in the united states that helps our competitive position and helps the economic development of the service territory which obviously creates a good business cycle for us and then we want to help ourselves our communities and our customers meet their sustainability objectives we re going to do all three of those and we re going to optimize those to the extent practical so that means taking advantage of all the technologies out there in the most efficient way we can i don t know if rod wants to add anything to that i hope rod west group president utility operations yeah i mean i would only add that in louisiana we ll be making filings with the commissions with the commission relative to green tariff options that we want the commission to consider in response to some of the sustainability objectives of our industrial customers but that s an ongoing conversation that that falls right in line with the comments you just made leo andrew marsh executive vice president and chief financial officer and we have a retirement study due after the st charles project goes in service that will address some of the things that leo was talking about leo denault chairman of the board and chief executive officer i forgot about that one julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst excellent guys thank you leo denault chairman of the board and chief executive officer thank you julien operator thank you our next question comes from praful mehta with citigroup praful mehta citigroup global markets inc analyst thanks so much hi guys leo denault chairman of the board and chief executive officer hey praful andrew marsh executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning praful praful mehta citigroup global markets inc analyst good morning so leo on the generation side you had mentioned that you have opportunities for more generation projects going forward just wanted to understand is that from low growth driven or the 5 6 coal that you have currently that you plan to retire what s kind of driving the new generation opportunities and what kind of fuel mix are you looking for as you go forward in the new generation leo denault chairman of the board and chief executive officer the generation opportunities are similar to what we ve discussed in the past we still see a need to transform our fleet from the older less efficient generation to new cleaner more efficient way to provide power and our perspective on the mix hasn t changed from where we were at eei that if we look 22 to 30 in that 7 000 megawatt to 8 000 megawatt range and we think that based on where technology is going and what we could foresee that roughly half of that could be renewables the way we re going to fill that out is going to be specific to those three points that i made a minute ago has to be the right operational characteristics at the right cost with the right sustainability footprint our objective is to optimize that as much as possible and so as we ve discussed before as we get closer to each one of those resource choices to the extent renewables storage technologies and other factors have made those more operable and cost effective they become a bigger part of the resource mix that doesn t change how much capacity we need because we need to provide the service we need to provide and the age of the fleet is what it is and as i mentioned we have plans for retirement of majority of the coal resources that are out there and we re looking at what to do with the others so that plus old gas fleet that still needs to be refreshed all go into the mix praful mehta citigroup global markets inc analyst got it thanks for that second question or the follow up on the equity needs point drew i think you mentioned or at least at eei you had a range of 5 to 10 now you re saying you re at the upper end of that so closer to the 10 just wanted to understand what s driving that equity need going up a little bit and is that a little bit of managing the credit as well just want to understand that driver andrew marsh executive vice president and chief financial officer sure praful so i think that s probably in part of what it is and nothing has changed relative to where we said in 2018 from our plan and i think there is some credit considerations there is our earnings considerations all those are part of what we are working through and also the capital plan itself has grown over the it has grown since eei grew last summer so it s been growing as well and as we always been has been talking about there is the potential for considerably more equity needs out or capital needs out in the future so i think all those things are factoring into how we re thinking about where the equity might land when we go to fill that need in 2021 praful mehta citigroup global markets inc analyst got it and finally any performance the outperformance that you had in your decommissioning trust especially on indian point i m assuming that doesn t accrue to entergy because that was part of like the deal that was struck in terms of the sale of indian point correct andrew marsh executive vice president and chief financial officer that s correct so the trust fund at indian point is holtec s responsibility in terms of the level that it s at and that will all be part of the nrc proceeding that is under way right now praful mehta citigroup global markets inc analyst got it really appreciate it guys congrats on a great quarter thanks andrew marsh executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you leo denault chairman of the board and chief executive officer thanks praful operator thank you our next question comes from sophie karp with keybanc capital markets sophie karp keybanc capital markets inc analyst hi good morning guys congrats on the quarter leo denault chairman of the board and chief executive officer good morning thank you sophie andrew marsh executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you sophie karp keybanc capital markets inc analyst just wanted to talk a little bit more about cash flows and balance sheet obviously the ocf metric and leverage metrics are improving and that s very encouraging where might we see may be positive surprise there or where is the room for a change versus your what you are anticipating right now maybe it s a pension as it relates to performance of the pension assets or may be a surprise to load growth can you just walk us a little bit more some of the puts and takes and what might affect the trajectory of the improvement here either way andrew marsh executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so there is a couple of drivers out there that have been helpful in 2019 one was at ewc our cash flows came in little bit better than we anticipated the team there has done a great job managing costs and identifying ways to reduce capital needs as we transition toward shutting down those plants so that s been very positive we had some very positive working capital developments in utility and we may see some more of that this year because of lower fuel prices so that s been helpful of course the performance of the pension trust has been good but at the same time interest rates have been coming down and raising the liability and so we actually our liability went up about 1 billion from 7 4 billion to 8 4 billion last year solely because of interest rates dropping over 100 basis points our delta between our assets and our assets went up as well our delta stayed about the same around 2 billion year over year so we weren t able to make up as much ground as we were hoping given the positive performance but we did we were able because of some of the positive cash flows as i mentioned in my remarks able to put some incremental cash into the pension trust about 200 million more than we planned at the beginning of the year we did that at the end of the year so that will help continue to de risk that pension liability so those are kind of some of the drivers and some of those where i would expect to continue to be opportunities going forward in terms of the potential for lower fuel prices helping our working capital and then potentially some incremental room and ewc as well and none of that takes into consideration some of the things that leo was talking about around continuous improvement if we can find incremental headroom through continuous improvement on our cash flows then we can put that to work either with incremental investments to benefit our customers or other investments to create value for all our stakeholders sophie karp keybanc capital markets inc analyst got it thank you and a follow up i had is on indian point so we ve seen objection filings by the new york attorney general can you just walk us through how these proceedings typically kind of go and how much weight would be afforded to a party like that i guess in this proceeding that should we be worried about this leo denault chairman of the board and chief executive officer yeah so the questions that the new york attorney general are asking are the same ones that we have addressed in the proceedings at the nrc for both vermont yankee and for pilgrim and namely they are around the financial and technical capabilities of holtec to in this case to do the work of decommissioning and that s really that is what the nrc is addressing that is there what they are accountable for figuring out in the proceeding and so i think that ll be a good forum to address those questions and we are confident i ll add we re confident that holtec will be able to answer those they ve already answered them successfully in two other proceedings one with us around pilgrim and then of course oyster creek sophie karp keybanc capital markets inc analyst got it thank you this is very helpful leo denault chairman of the board and chief executive officer thank you andrew marsh executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from greg gordon with evercore greg gordon evercore analyst thanks i feel like you may have indirectly answered most of this but when i look at the slide deck from eei and just compared it to the slide deck now as you ve refined your guidance the in particular o m costs i think were only expected to be up 0 10 more or less at eei now they re up 0 25 and i think that s in part due to a lower pension discount rate used 4 as a placeholder and the last deck you re using just under 3 4 now and i also you ve pointed out that a lot of those increased costs were probably offset by increased revenues so can you am i capturing all of that or am i missing something andrew marsh executive vice president and chief financial officer no i think you re on the right track greg it s drew the pension discount rate did come down lower than what we were anticipating when we were talking at eei and so that was of the incremental o m that was probably 40 of the delta also there is another 40 is associated with things that are offset in the top line energy efficiency storm reserve changes that at the bottom line will be a net zero and then of course there are a little there are a few odds and ins but those dollars add up to something really small so i think all in all and actually i would say we are overall we re in line with what we are expecting 2 6 billion in the utility and we ve talked about trying to keep it flat at around 2 65 billion going forward is what we discussed last summer so we ve managed to work against all of those things that move the o m up a little bit but it s still within the expectations that we had overall greg gordon evercore analyst yeah that s a good answer and then as i compare the expected rate actions from the fall till now it looks like on the margin you re maybe i missed it but the dcrf and tcrf filing and the ami riders filing those weren t explicitly included in the retail price actions in the fall deck and they re included now so those are modest increase in regulatory activity versus the fall plan or would those always anticipated but just maybe not called out explicitly leo denault chairman of the board and chief executive officer yes i think we were anticipating that we were going to do those things but we hadn t explicitly called them out greg gordon evercore analyst okay great and then in terms of the capex plan obviously it s up modestly for 22 but 2 gigawatts of potential incremental opportunities i mean look i m just going to spitball at a 1 000 a kilowatt i mean is it right to think about that as long as you can most importantly as long as you can sort of pencil out that those incremental capital expenditures drive customer benefits is that am i right that that could be up to a 2 billion increase in capex and over what timeframe might that be andrew marsh executive vice president and chief financial officer absolutely it s a big opportunity for us we talked about the the capital plan is inching toward a 4 billion average at this point if we look beyond our capital horizon 2022 i would expect that it would be up above 4 billion and all the things that you re talking about are going to be a piece of that opportunity that s on the generation side i mean leo was saying that the biggest opportunity is on the other end of the value chain at the distribution end and the customer services that s where the biggest growth opportunity we think will ultimately be so there is significant capital opportunity out there for us but the thing that you said is really what we are working through which is how do we make sure that we can create value for our customers and really all of our stakeholders while we put this capital to work and do it with a way that allows our customers to manage this through their bills and that s that s kind of the key to this whole thing and all the continuous improvement and the innovation in the new products and services the leveraging of technology creating headroom in those bills that s what we are that s what we re after and we see opportunities for that in a significant way down the road greg gordon evercore analyst hey leo i ve got a question for you that you re probably not going to want to answer but i ll ask it anyway there is with the opportunities you have in hand just organically it would seem to me that you guys control your own destiny but you ve always said that you ve been open to better ideas about the strategic direction of the company is that just frame damage at this point because you ve got so much opportunity organically or with the rate what would the set of circumstances have to be for you to want to be distracted enough by a strategic offer to consider it leo denault chairman of the board and chief executive officer i think the criteria are the same certainly we as management team and the board are open to and i think you characterized it correctly better ideas so if there is a way to advance them all beyond what we think we can do the way we are configured today we will investigate it in addition to it having to be something that does advance the ball it has to be transactable both with the counterparty and through the regulatory process because there s no point going forward if you can t get along well enough to go through the process and if you can t get the process completed there is obviously that s it doesn t matter how good the idea is if we can t get it done it doesn t matter and then you did also bring up the third thing that we always discuss and that s distraction is in our industry because of the way the process works it takes 18 to 24 months to get something done are you distracted during that timeframe from doing the things that got you to the point where we are today in such a way that if you don t get across the goal line or even if you do you ve lost so much ground that it doesn t make it worth it if you can solve that puzzle then our stance would continue to be that it is worthwhile we do have in my opinion the most attractive stand alone plan that we ve ever had for all four of our stakeholders we have significant amount of opportunity to improve the level of service and the way we serve our customers we had significant opportunity to continue sustainability objectives and our community building across the environmental the education workforce training eradication of poverty space anything to provide value for our communities we continue to have an opportunity to expand our culture in a way that engages our employees the way they ve never been before and certainly all of that results in the investment profile that grows the business for certainly our shareholders so it s a pretty high bar in that first part about can you actually have a better idea that advances the ball enough to make it worth doing that doesn t mean we don t look at it it doesn t mean we wouldn t be open to it it just means that i think now the bar is as high as it s been in that front greg gordon evercore analyst thanks leo thank you all take care leo denault chairman of the board and chief executive officer thank you greg operator thank you our next question comes from michael lapides with goldman sachs michael lapides goldman sachs analyst hey guys thanks for taking my question real quickly can you remind us what the stated retirement dates are for some of your coal units i m taking larger ones like white bluffs and then some of the smaller ones independence nelson etc leo denault chairman of the board and chief executive officer yes the arkansas units michael are part of that settlement that gets us to the by the end of 2030 yeah michael lapides goldman sachs analyst okay is there a scenario where especially given the economics of coal versus gas versus solar where you would fast forward or move up the retirement dates which might create a little bit of a capacity need but also may potentially create customer savings leo denault chairman of the board and chief executive officer there is i mentioned in my scripts that in addition to what we are doing we are looking at what to do with the rest of that fleet there is that kind of analysis going on a regular basis we look at all of the resources we have and what s the right balance between spending the money required to keep them operating versus replacement and so that s on the table at this point in time we haven t made that call michael lapides goldman sachs analyst got it my other question is on the nuclear side and can you talk a little bit about the dispatch economics all in economics for your nuclear fleet in the southeast and just how you re thinking about those plants and kind of where they sit economically on the dispatch or as we ve seen in other parts of the country both regulated and non regulated we ve seen some nuclear retirements and trying to just think about the is it even the nuclear units that we should be thinking about as fleet transformation over time andrew marsh executive vice president and chief financial officer hey michael this is drew and so in regards of where it sits in the dispatch stack it sits low right it run those run all the time they have low variable costs and so they are going to run all the time we do know about the economics and we ve talked about that in the northeast obviously with the shutdown of our ewc fleet but there are many reasons why you might want to continue to operate your nuclear fleet that are very very important from a policy perspective and you can evaluate those more effectively in the utility setting than you can in a merchant power market where all that matters is that marginal electron s price so when you talk about and you see folks supporting nuclear plants in those unregulated power markets for these same reasons right you re talking about clean generation that supports the grid it s always available it diversifies the portfolio it provides good tax base and so there s a lot of jobs in communities and a lot of active volunteering coming out of these plants that have a lot of employees and so there s a lot of policy reasons why you want to keep a nuclear plant around but it s hard to evaluate those in a merchant setting and you see people doing that already in those in illinois and then in parts of new york and other places you can do that more easily in a rate regulated framework evaluate those characteristics michael lapides goldman sachs analyst understood and then last question where do you think you could stand when you benchmark yourselves on t d costs either on a per line mile or per customer whatever you all think the most appropriate metric is kind of where do you think you stand versus the peer group and how do you think about the path to kind of getting the top decile leo denault chairman of the board and chief executive officer it s a tricky metric to be making broad generalizations about the peer group because the peer group would have to be somebody who s service territory characteristics mirror ours so there is a big difference between people who are in urban dense versus rural versus mountainous versus swampy versus all of the other things that makes that up doesn t mean we don t do it and doesn t mean we don t compare favorably in a lot of respects but we need to go beyond just those benchmarks michael and get into what can we do to continuously improve ourselves once we get outside of the plant level because there s too many variables to just make broad generalizations i wouldn t think even if we are a top decile that we wouldn t be able to find ways to improve michael lapides goldman sachs analyst got it thanks guys much appreciated leo denault chairman of the board and chief executive officer thanks mike andrew marsh executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator thank you and our final question will come from jonathan arnold with vertical research jonathan arnold vertical research analyst hi good morning guys leo denault chairman of the board and chief executive officer good morning andrew marsh executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning jonathan jonathan arnold vertical research analyst hi thanks for taking my call just can you give us a little preview of what kinds of things we might expect you to do at the analyst day i mean obviously you ve talked about a lot of evolving opportunities at the margin but as more specifically do you think you ll roll forward your outlook to 23 are you going to continue giving these multi year outlooks is that the plan or just a sense of what we should be practical leo denault chairman of the board and chief executive officer yes i think jonathan as i mentioned in my remarks we ll go out typically the way the process has worked for us we ve historically done in analyst day every other year and when we do it we roll out kind of a five year look versus the every odd year roll out three year look i guess and so i would anticipate that we would do that obviously give a little bit more ability to dive into what we re doing in terms of all the things that we ve been talking about here maybe turn more cards on what those opportunities look like and what they might be gives us a little more time to get into a little bit more detail that way but i think kind of just more discussion around the opportunity set in front of us which again we i mentioned it in my prepared remarks we have a pretty good base here with some of the lowest rates in the country one of the cleanest fleets in the country some of the only industrial growth in the country some of the best regulatory mechanisms in the country and a no shortage of opportunities to invest on behalf of our customers to increase the level of service that they get while we manage the bill path to be at or below the level of inflation and so just looking at the outlooks that we provided you here that s a again in my estimation is one of the best positions we ve been in as a company but it doesn t mean we are not looking for ways to do better because our team keeps coming up with more investment opportunities for us to make on behalf of our customers that could improve that level of service more whether it s in the traditional things about sustainability and reliability or whether it s in some of these newer areas where we start to talk about customer solutions where we re getting closer and closer and closer to providing them outcomes rather than just inputs so the idea of continuous improvement to provide the headroom that allows us to get there and improve things i think is a great challenge for us and continuous improvement takes many forms whether it s continuous improvement through rpa and utilization of our supply chain shared service and it functions to actually drive costs out of the business while we up scale actually the level of performance or whether it s in economic development and new load growth that isn t in the plan today that helps drive cost down for the rest of the customers or just the fact that gas prices continue

bell creek mines alternative performance non gaap measures per ounce measures cash costs and aisc are non gaap financial measures that do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by ifrs and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies pan american produces by product metals incidentally to our silver and gold mining activities we have adopted the practice of calculating a performance measure with the net cost of producing an ounce of silver and gold our primary payable metals after deducting revenues gained from incidental by product production this performance measurement has been commonly used in the mining industry for many years and was developed as a relatively simple way of comparing the net production costs of the primary metal for a specific period against the prevailing market price of that metal silver segment cash costs and aisc are calculated net of credits for realized revenues from all metals other than silver silver segment by product credits and are calculated per ounce of silver sold gold segment cash costs and aisc are calculated net of credits for realized silver revenues gold segment by product credits and are calculated per ounce of gold sold consolidated cash costs and aisc are based on total silver ounces sold and are net of by product credits from all metals other than silver silver basis consolidated by product credits prior period cash costs per ounce reported in previous news releases and md as were based on cash costs per ounce of payable silver produced and were net of by product credits calculated with average market prices applied to all metals produced other than silver given the increased complexity of the business with the addition of the new gold operations the company determined that conforming the calculation of cash costs with a consistent method to that used for aisc using realized by product sales as by product credits and based on per ounce of silver sold would provide a more consistent per ounce measure as such the comparative cash costs amounts in this md a have been quantified using the current methodology and are different from those previously reported as shown in the detailed quantification of consolidated aisc below corporate general and administrative expense and exploration and project development expenses are included in the calculation of consolidated silver basis aisc but are not allocated amongst the operations and thus are not included in either the silver or gold segment aisc totals in prior years these costs were similarly included only in the consolidated all in sustaining costs per silver ounce sold aiscsos metrics and not allocated to each mine s aiscsos amount as such consolidated aiscsos in previous years included such costs where total silver segment aisc in the current period does not a detailed description of how previously reported cash costs were quantified is provided in the company s prior period md as cash costs per ounce metrics net of by product credits is used extensively in our internal decision making processes we believe the metric is also useful to investors because it facilitates comparison on a mine by mine basis notwithstanding the unique mix of incidental by product production at each mine of our operations relative performance on a period by period basis and against the operations of our peers in the silver industry cash costs per ounce is conceptually understood and widely reported in the mining industry we believe that aisc also calculated net of by products is a comprehensive measure of the full cost of operating our business given it includes the cost of replacing silver and gold ounces through exploration the cost of ongoing capital investments sustaining capital general and administrative expenses as well as other items that affect the company s consolidated cash flow to facilitate a better understanding of these measure as calculated by the company the following tables provide the detailed reconciliation of these measure to the applicable cost items as reported in the consolidated financial statements for the respective

normalized earnings as it eliminates items that in management s judgment are subject to volatility as a result of factors which are unrelated to operations in the period and or relate to items that will settle in future periods certain items that become applicable in a period may be adjusted for with the company retroactively presenting comparable periods with an adjustment for such items and conversely items no longer applicable may be removed from the calculation the company adjusts certain items in the periods that they occurred but does not reverse or otherwise unwind the effect of such items in future periods neither adjusted earnings nor basic adjusted earnings per share have any standardized meaning prescribed by gaap and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar

new york feb 21 the rally in us equities took a pause and the strong dollar got stronger yesterday rising to a three year high against a basket of trading partner currencies after a steep slide in the

and that japanese funds were dumping local assets in favour of us shares and gold advertisement the strongest explanation for the yen s decline is a widespread selling by japanese asset managers amid growing fears about the health of japan s economy said raffi boyadijian investment analyst at xm the yen s slide is unusual because the exchange rate with the dollar has been shedding its close correlation to the price of gold and us treasury yields a development to be watched he said this raises question marks about whether the yen is losing some of its shine as the world s preferred safe

in the years that followed the global and sovereign debt crises italy has experienced a rise of populist forces lega and movimento 5 stelle that culminated in june 2018 in the formation of a populist government which lasted approximately one year these political developments affected the concerns and risk associated with budgetary policies debt sustainability and the very prospects of continued membership of the euro what have been the effects of political risk shocks during the period 2013 to 2019 on italy s domestic financial markets and real economy are there any spillover effects to financial markets of other euro area countries these questions are of primary importance in light of the rise of populist forces in other countries albeit with their own specificities that are profoundly altering the political landscape 1 not surprisingly all these international developments have generated an increase in economic policy uncertainty and a series of papers provide empirical evidence on its adverse effects on the financial markets and the real economy for instance baker et al 2016 analyse the effects of economic policy uncertainty on the us economy kelly et al 2016 focus instead on the effect of political uncertainty around election and international summits on stock option contracts caldara et al 2019 and baker et al 2019a discuss the consequences of trade uncertainty for us firms and for the us stock market respectively finally bloom et al 2019 analyse the implications of brexit for uk firms 2 one element that is interesting and distinctive about the italian case is that the rise in populism occurred in the context of a high level of government debt around 130 of gdp and decades of slow growth these factors contributed to concerns about debt sustainability thus the italian experience is very relevant for countries in similar circumstances however italy s economic importance it is the third largest euro area country and the eight largest in the world in terms of gdp makes the italian case of general significance as domestic political risk shocks have the potential to generate direct and indirect spillover effects to other euro area countries a quick look at the evolution of the sovereign credit default swap cds spreads for the 2014 clause dollar denominated contracts from september 2014 onward suggests that many of the significant fluctuations occur as a result of important domestic political developments 3 these can be seen in figure 1 where we report italy s sovereign cds spreads together with those of other euro area countries in particular the cds spread displays a pronounced spike between the end of the second quarter and the beginning of the third quarter of 2018 reaching values above 250 basis points an upward jump of around 150 basis points in addition we observe smaller increases at the same time in the sovereign cds spreads of other euro area countries this upward movement coincides with a series of events which saw the two major populist parties in italy lega and movimento 5 stelle creating first a coalition and eventually a government note also that the sovereign cds spread for italy has been much higher particularly since 2018 compared not only to the spreads for germany and france but also to ireland spain and portugal figure 1 sovereign cds spread 2014 clause contracts for selected euro area countries note the figure reports the spread on the dollar denominated 2014 clause 5 year sovereign cds contracts for france germany ireland italy portugal and spain in a new paper balduzzi et al 2020 we build on these observations and assume that the daily change in the italian sovereign cds spread on the dates of political events e g elections and the formation of a government and policy announcements e g the submission of the draft budget to the european commission and the subsequent correspondence is informative about the unobserved shocks to concerns associated with budgetary policies government debt sustainability and membership of the euro in italy 4 this is a plausible hypothesis as the sovereign cds spread reflects the probability of the government defaulting on its debt and the expected losses for bond holders in that case we apply the methodology discussed in stock and watson 2018 and use the daily change in the cds spread for italian government bonds on political and policy announcement dates as an instrument for political risk shocks in the context of local projections jorda 2005 the choice of a high frequency change in the cds together with the use of controls for international risk is made in order to plausibly satisfy the exogeneity assumptions required by the local projection instrumental variables lp iv procedure 5 the change in the cds spreads on our selected dates see figure 2 highlights the importance of the rise to power of populist forces and of their policy announcements in generating an increase in political risk at the same time it also emphasises the relevance of institutional constraints such as the european commission and the italian presidency placing limits on budgetary policies perceived as risky and on a repositioning of italy with respect to the european fiscal rules and membership of the common currency these constraints triggered risk decreasing shocks that cushioned the increase in all the spreads and the negative effects on the stock market stemming from the rise and ascendance to power of the populist forces 6 figure 2 sovereign cds spread 2014 clause contracts around political events note changes in the cds spread of the sovereign 2014 clause contract denominated in dollars around selected dates changes are defined as the closing price of the event day minus the closing price of the previous day ec stands for european commission we use the lp iv approach with the instrument obtained using the high frequency identification strategy described above to analyse the effect of political risk shocks on financial markets using data at a daily and monthly frequency our evidence from the response of each endogenous variable at different horizons to a single shock indicates that increases in political risk associated with the rise to power of populist forces have a powerful effect on both domestic and international financial variables italian sovereign and bank cds spreads as well as the italian btp german bund yield spreads increase making government and bank borrowing more expensive for a sense of the size of the quantitative impact note that a unit change in our instrument leads to a sustained change of the btp bund spread that is twice as large 7 political risk shocks also negatively affect italian stock market returns although the effect is not as pronounced as for the spreads we also provide evidence that political risk shocks affect the difference between the spread for the 2014 and the 2003 clause italian cds contracts denominated in the same currency defined as the isda basis which captures the probability of redenomination and depreciation of the new currency in that case our shocks also affect the quanto spread defined here as the difference between the spreads on the dollar denominated and euro denominated italian sovereign cds contracts which reflects the probability of sovereign default and the associated expected depreciation of the euro relative to the dollar note that the 2014 and 2003 contracts begin to diverge at the beginning of 2017 but the gap opens up dramatically in june 2018 with the former displaying much larger increases reaching 286 basis points in mid november 2018 while the latter increased only to 177 basis points 8 importantly the sovereign cds spreads for spain and portugal display significant and sizable responses to italian political risk shocks there is also an effect on france and germany but this is smaller and less significant similarly in terms of the spread of government bond yields relative to the german bund the quantitative effects are larger for spain and portugal followed by ireland and france finally we show that these shocks have had adverse effects on the real economy and present some evidence supporting this conclusion based on the monthly purchasing managers index pmi and other leading indicators of real activity from the beginning of 2013 until july 2019 the negative effects although significant were not as large as one might have feared this is most likely because the political shocks we have analysed occurred in the context of a large degree of monetary accommodation and the provision of ample liquidity by the ecb this has contributed to preventing italian spreads from reaching the levels observed during the sovereign debt crisis in 2011 2012 in addition the strengthening of banks balance sheets following a period of positive growth from 2015 to the middle of 2017 the recapitalisation exercises prompted by the european banking authority eba stress tests and the reduction in the share of non performing loans has allowed banks to deal with the increase in the spread in government and bank bonds without significantly increasing lending rates as a result the bank cost of funding channel was not important during this period while it was key during the global and sovereign debt crises as shown in balduzzi et al 2018a in sum all the factors we have mentioned have lessened but not eliminated the negative impact of the rise of populism on the real economy in italy although lega is now out of the government that has been formed by the more conventional centre left parties in coalition with movimento 5 stelle italy continues to be characterised by political instability there are legitimate questions about the ability of the government to survive as well as concerns about the outcome of an election if it were to be called in light of the continued strength in the polls of the lega party in addition there are doubts about the possibility of a political equilibrium in italy in support of reforms that could set the country on a more favourable growth path which would help with debt sustainability all this is reflected in the level of the sovereign cds spread that although smaller than in the second half of 2018 it is still around 140 basis points higher than that of all other euro area countries except greece italy has been an ideal laboratory to explore and learn about the economic consequences of political risk shocks and this is likely to continue to be the case in the future references

redenomination of the sovereign debt by a g7 country or an oecd country with an investment grade government debt as a default event we report the figures for the dollar denominated contract as it has the more liquid market 4 more precisely we focus on those dates on which general elections for the italian and european parliament took place as well as the dates when the president of the italian republic chooses a political leader to attempt forming a government incarico they also include the dates in which the budget law is introduced and later revised to be sent to the european commission for approval as well as replies of the commission finally we consider changes around the time of a few significant announcements such as the formation of a novel coalition between the populist parties movimento 5 stelle and lega after the last general elections il contratto and the recent withdrawal of one of the two parties lega from the government 5 the use of external instruments in local projections is also found in fieldhouse et al 2018 see also stock and watson 2012 mertens and ravn 2013 gertler and karadi 2015 and ramey and shapiro 1998 for estimation of structural vars using external instruments the econometric methodology is described in details in balduzzi et al 2020 in essence the variable being instrumented indicator variable is in our case the change in the sovereign cds itself at all dates under the normalizing assumption that a change of one unit in political risk is associated with a unit change in the cds spread the instruments must satisfy two key exogeneity assumptions to be valid the first one contemporaneous exogeneity requires that changes in sovereign cds spread on the selected dates are orthogonal to the other structural shocks in the system occurring at the same time this must hold conditionally on a set of controls that include in our case past values of italian financial market variables as well as the contemporaneous and past values of the log change in the vix and of the first principal component of the change in the cds spread for euro countries with the exception of greece and italy plus the uk the choice of a narrow window of a day and of a limited number of dates is meant to maximize the probability that this is the case the second assumption lead lag exogeneity requires our instrument to be also uncorrelated with leads and lags of all the shocks in the system we address this issue by including as a control lagged values of the dependent variable and of the instrument itself we also we conduct a standard placebo test where we define our instrument as the change in the cds spread on a randomly chosen set of dates the results are supportive of our approach finally we implement a large set of robustness checks including some in which we reduce the number of dates eliminating those around which other international shocks may have occurred 6 specifically there are drastic increases in the spread in correspondence of the announcement of the contract between the movimento 5 stelle and lega parties to govern together in may which outlined the intention of pursuing a very expansionary fiscal policy based on an increase in welfare payments reddito di cittadinanza and a lowering of the retirement age quota 100 those concerns were enhanced by the intention of the incoming populist government to propose paolo savona an economist that has expressed opposition to italian membership of the euro to the position of minister of economy and finance the main economic post in the italian government the increase in the spread that followed was in part reversed by the opposition of the president of the republic sergio mattarella who imposed the choice of a more moderate minister of economy giovanni tria another upward movement in the spread followed the drafting of the budget law at the end of 2018 that contemplated a budget deficit of 2 4 of gdp and its subsequent rejection by the european commission it also eventually triggered a procedure for excessive debt the achievement of a compromise with a lower deficit and the end of the excessive debt procedure brought some respite however the cumulated effect over the period captures the market s increasing overall concerns about budgetary sustainability and italy s position concerning fiscal rules and the euro 7 a simple back of the envelope way to think about the quantitative effects is to observe that the 5 years btp bund spread fluctuated around an average value of 216 basis points during the populist government which represents a 120 basis points increase relative the average from september 2014 to the day of the contract between lega and movimento 5 stelle if we cumulate the changes in the sovereign cds spread around political and policy dates over this period we obtain a value of around 35 basis points this cumulated change in our instrument can account for a large fraction of the observed btp bund spread

a 5 increase as compared to the year ended 2018 during the year ended december 31 2019 we mined 25 7 million ore tonnes a 7 decrease from the previous year offset by an 8 increase in gold stacked grade during the fourth quarter of 2019 18 5 million tonnes of material were mined a decrease of 3 compared to the third quarter of 2019 due to a long shovel move and variance to planned haulage cycles a new leach pad cell was commissioned on schedule with material stacking commencing in the fourth quarter during the fourth quarter of 2019 we delivered approximately 6 7 million tonnes of ore

sold were 811 an increase of 12 compared to the year ended 2018 primarily due to higher leach pad opening inventory unit costs total mining costs of 1 74 per tonne for the year ended december 31 2019 were consistent with the prior year primarily due to 5 higher tonnes mined offset partially by 4 higher total mining costs processing and general and administrative unit costs were higher for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to the prior year mainly due to 7 fewer ore tonnes mined total processing costs for the year ended december 31 2019 were consistent with total processing costs for the year ended 2018 while general and administrative costs increased 7 primarily due to higher labor costs for the year ended december 31 2019 aisc per payable ounce of gold sold was 1 034 compared to 974 for the year ended december 31 2018 primarily due to the higher cash costs referred to above offset partially by an increase in the number of ounces sold in the fourth quarter of 2019 cash costs per payable ounce of gold sold were 778 a decrease of 5 compared to the previous quarter primarily due to lower leach pad opening inventory unit costs in the fourth quarter resulting from higher grades mined in the third quarter total mining costs of 1 83 per tonne in the fourth quarter of 2019 were 6 higher than the previous quarter due to 3 fewer tonnes mined and 3 higher total mining costs total mining costs were higher in the fourth quarter of 2019 mainly due to the timing of haul truck tire replacements processing unit costs were 12 lower in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the previous quarter mainly due to 6 higher ore tonnes mined and 7 lower total processing costs total processing costs were lower in the fourth quarter of 2019 mainly due to lower cyanide consumption and lower power unit rates general and administrative unit costs in the fourth quarter of 2019 were consistent with the previous quarter as higher ore tonnes mined were offset by higher labor costs in the fourth quarter of 2019 aisc per payable ounce of gold sold was 1 117 compared to 1 104 in the third quarter of 2019 due to higher planned sustaining capital expenditures primarily related to the

an average realized gold price of 1 481 per ounce during the third quarter of 2019 exploration the main focus of the 2019 exploration program at marigold was to convert red dot mineral resources into mineral reserves during previous quarters we conducted exploration drilling for additional mineral resources along areas that were north and south of red dot within the mackay pit and on valmy target areas such as crossfire and east basalt during the fourth quarter of 2019 we completed a total of 64 reverse circulation rc drill holes for 20 682 meters on these targets during the year ended december 31 2019 our red dot exploration program focused on geotechnical drilling and engineering with the goal of declaring additional mineral reserves in the fourth quarter of 2019 we completed the second phase of confirmation drilling which included nine core holes for 3 700 meters based on the results of these evaluations we converted mineral resources to mineral reserves and red dot is anticipated to extend the marigold mine life into the early 2030s without requiring expansion of the haul fleet or the associated expansion capital exploration at marigold for the year ended december 31 2019 was successful in replacing mined depletion and growing mineral reserves compared to the year ended december 31 2018 including leach pad inventory year over year probable mineral reserves increased by 18 at the same time indicated mineral resources inclusive of mineral reserves and leach pad inventory decreased by 11 due to depletion and model changes inferred mineral resources

10 38 a decrease of 35 compared to the year ended december 31 2018 the decrease is mainly due to increased production as the chinchillas mine achieved steady state operations driven by higher silver mill feed grades and recoveries partially offset by higher unit processing costs driven by a re start of the zinc circuit in 2019 the pumping of tailings for in pit disposal at the pirquitas plant and higher ore haulage costs for the year ended december 31 2019 aisc per payable ounce of silver sold was 14 06 a decrease of 27 compared to the year ended december 31 2018 the decrease is mainly due to lower cash costs per payable ounce of silver sold offset partially by higher capital expenditures including capital stripping costs of which the majority were incurred in the first half of 2019 in the fourth quarter of 2019 cash costs per payable ounce of silver sold were 8 90 a decrease of 37 compared to the third quarter of 2019 the decrease is mainly due to lower per unit operating costs as a result of higher mill throughput and higher by product credits during the fourth quarter of 2019 driven by higher production resulting from an increase in mill throughput feed grades and recoveries in the fourth quarter of 2019 aisc per payable ounce of silver sold was 11 18 a decrease of 36 compared to the third quarter of 2019 the decrease is mainly due to lower cash costs per payable ounce of silver sold offset partially by higher capital expenditures including capitalized stripping costs during the fourth quarter of 2019 mine sales realized silver price is a non gaap financial measure please see cautionary note regarding non gaap measures for the year ended december 31 2019 silver sales totaled 7 7 million ounces an increase of 105 compared to the year ended december 31 2018 lead sales totaled 24 1 million pounds and zinc sales totaled 14 1 million pounds the increase in concentrate sales is mainly due to an increase in production as 2019 represented the first full year of production at the chinchillas mine for the year ended december 31 2019 realized silver price was 16 26 per ounce an increase of 2 compared to the previous year in the fourth quarter of 2019 silver sales totaled 2 6 million ounces an increase of 72 compared to the third quarter of 2019 lead and zinc sales totaled 9 4 million pounds and 3 1 million pounds respectively representing increases of 128 and 51 respectively compared to the previous quarter the increase in concentrate sales is mainly due to higher production in the fourth quarter of 2019 driven by higher throughput feed grades and recoveries as well as the timing of concentrate sales exploration during the fourth quarter of 2019 we completed 2 074 meters of diamond drilling exploring the granada target the granada target is the projected intersection of the north dipping past producing historic potosi vein and the south dipping cortaderas breccia vein which hosts much of the current underground mineral resources at pirquitas we anticipate completing the drilling in 2020 and reporting these results in the first half of 2020 chinchillas project argentina the chinchillas project was completed in the fourth quarter of 2019

expect to produce on a consolidated basis at the midpoint of guidance approximately 425 000 gold equivalent ounces at gold equivalent cash costs of 740 per payable ounce sold at the marigold mine gold production is expected to increase in 2020 compared to 2019 marigold is well positioned for another record production year as the mine benefits from an additional hydraulic loading unit purchased in 2019 expected to be commissioned in the first quarter of 2020 and continued operational efficiencies production is weighted toward the second half of the year as a result of mine sequencing and access to higher grade ore capital investments are expected to total 60 million including 12 million for two replacement haul trucks and 15 million for an additional leach pad to be built in 2020 the continuous build of leach pad capacity will ensure the operation can maintain leach cycle times and gold recoveries at higher ore stacking rates capitalized stripping is expected to total 20 million with the majority incurred through the first three quarters of the year exploration expenditures totaling 12 million are expected to focus on drill programs at mackay basalt valmy and trenton canyon with the goals of adding mineral reserves and defining additional mineral resources within these areas exploration expenditures include 2 million for drill testing trenton canyon s sulphide targets at the seabee gold operation we expect to deliver another record gold production year in 2020 as we continue executing our plan of increasing mining rates to support higher sustained mill throughput production is weighted to the first half of the year due to access to higher grade ore cash costs are expected to remain low between 460 and 500 per payable ounce of gold sold sustaining capital investments remain focused on mining equipment and ventilation with 5 million planned for underground and surface equipment to enable higher mine production due to continued exploration success at seabee in 2019 we commenced an expansion of tailings storage capacity at the mine in 2020 investment in the tailings facility expansion is estimated to total 12 million as phase 1 of the project is completed and phase 2 is initiated with completion expected in 2021 once completed seabee is expected to have tailings capacity for current mill throughput levels into the early 2030s non tailings facility related capital expenditures are concentrated in the first quarter of 2020 as equipment is delivered over the ice road expected capitalized development expenditures of 12 million support higher mining rates and reflect the development strategy for the santoy complex exploration expenditures at seabee are estimated to total 12 million with a focus on expansion and definition of santoy gap hw and surface drill programs at the seabee and fisher properties following up on targets identified in 2019 at puna operations we expect to produce between 6 0 and 7 0 million ounces of silver at cash costs net of by products of between 10 50 and 12 00 per payable silver ounce sold production is weighted to the first half of the year due to higher grades with the majority of capital stripping expected in the second half of the year sustaining capital investments of 15 million relate principally to maintenance of mine mill and power generating equipment a 6 million investment to replace contracted ore transportation is also planned as the operation focuses on lowering unit operating costs at the pitarrilla project located in mexico we plan to spend 4 million in 2020 as part of a two year 10 million exploration program related to extending an existing decline to provide drill access to the underground mineral resources an improved geological model from work completed in 2019 indicates strong potential to better define known high grade mineralized veining associated with steeply dipping rhyolite dyke contacts extending the underground ramp provides access for tighter spaced drilling at better orientations to test the rhyolite dykes and veins for continuity if infill drilling confirms the continuity of high grade mineralized structures there would be potential to enhance the grades of existing mineral resources at the san luis project located in peru we expect to commence a detailed mapping program in the area of the existing high grade gold silver mineral

marigold mine the seabee gold operation and puna operations have been determined based on prices of 1 250 per ounce of gold and 18 00 per ounce of silver these prices are unchanged from those used to determine the mineral reserves estimate at december 31 2018 at the marigold mine our 2019 exploration program led to an increase in mineral reserves probable mineral reserves increased to 3 9 million ounces of gold 228 8 million tonnes at an average gold grade of 0 49 g t at the year ended december 31 2019 an increase of 18 compared to the year ended december 31 2018 after consideration of mining depletion in 2019 of 330 000 ounces 912 000 ounces 51 9 million tonnes at an average gold grade of 0 55 g t of probable mineral reserves were added in 2019 the increase in probable mineral reserves is mainly attributable to our successful infill and exploration drilling programs which converted mineral resources at phases 2 and 3 of red dot and mackay we added 874 000 ounces 53 0 million tonnes at an average gold grade of 0 51 g t of gold probable mineral reserves at red dot in phases 2 and 3 indicated mineral resources inclusive of mineral reserves totaled 4 9 million ounces of gold 301 8

this article appears in the february 21 2020 issue of executive intelligence review december 1981 the economic need for increasing the human population authorÃ¢ s foreword man is not ecologically an animal population editorÃ¢ s note this report being published here for the first time was requested in december 1981 for the economics studies of a bishopsÃ¢ conference in rome little more than a generation after the opening up of the nazi concentration camps oecd official dr alexander king and others established an organization the club of rome whose intent has been to cause global genocide on a scale a hundred times greater than that perpetrated by the hitler regime today after more than a decade of such malthusian propaganda institutions of the united nations organization the international monetary fund the world bank and bank for international settlements and sections of leading nationsÃ¢ governments and major political parties are openly engaging in genocidal practices and advocacies defined as capital offenses during the post war nuremberg proceedings in general advocates of this genocide have shown their degenerated consciences increasingly impervious to charges of criminal intent they respond to such charges with what they present as Ã¢ scientific arguments Ã¢ or with related arguments to the effect that the targetted populations of the Ã¢ third worldÃ¢ nations are Ã¢ doomed to die anyway Ã¢ worse the majority of the citizenry of leading nations refuses to treat such advocacy as an abomination this is obviously a pervasive problem among the oecd nations the soviet chairman of the austria based international institute for applied systems analysis iiasa dzhermen gvishiani and the Ã¢ global systems analysisÃ¢ circles in moscow are as cold bloodedly committed to mass murder in the Ã¢ third worldÃ¢ as gvishianiÃ¢ s personal friend and collaborator aurelio peccei this pervasion of genocidal practices and advocacies by influential circles and individuals combined with the monstrous toleration of such advocacies by the general populations is to be viewed as a reflection of the fact that the moral condition of leading institutions and populations is today qualitatively worse than during the 1930s and 1940s the issue before us is not merely that of preventing genocide the toleration of policies such as global 2000 today is to be seen as conclusively symptomatic of a civilization which must be rescued from a loss of the moral fitness to survive there has been of course important resistance against the genocidal proposals of the malthusian world federalists however so far this opposition has been predominantly impotent two facets of this morally impotent behavior stand out in the authorÃ¢ s view firstly there has been an unwillingness to publicly denounce leading perpetrators including aurelio peccei as purely and simply nuremberg code violators by treating the issue of genocide as a Ã¢ gentlemanly difference of opinion Ã¢ we contribute to the passivity of public opinion on this issue in conditioning populations step by step into toleration or even support of such mass murder policies secondly the opponents of genocide have usually put themselves into the position of debating what the malthusians represent as conclusions logically deduced by scientific procedures anti malthusian scientists refuse generally to expose other members of their fraternity as evil hoaxsters even though most scientists are qualified to prove that every allegedly scientific argument of the malthusian Ã¢ environmentalistsÃ¢ is an outright fraud so the news media is advantaged to misrepresent the issue as a conflict between Ã¢ traditionalist moral prejudicesÃ¢ and Ã¢ the objective if cruel conclusions produced by rigorous scientific inquiry Ã¢ the following report attacks the malthusians on their most vulnerable point respecting Ã¢ scientific arguments Ã¢ the simplest and most pervasive empirical evidence demonstrates that it is worse than absurd to apply to human populations the statistical procedures developed by ronald a fisher and others for studies of plant and animal populations if the human species were to be considered as another animal population for purposes of statistical ecological population studies we consider only those abstracted features of human behavior which rank man slightly above a gifted baboon it would be generous on the basis of such false assumptions to estimate that the human species might have achieved at any time up to the present a total population in the order of several millions living individuals therefore if one assumed at a corresponding point in a socratic dialogue that the existence of a population in the order of four and a half billions represents an ecological problem the mere admission of such a problem by the malthusians is a virtual admission of the total incompetence of the assumptions of fact and method upon which the entirety of the malthusian mode of argument depends the mere fact that the human species might at any point reach a hundred millions individuals to say nothing of more than four billions is already proof that the malthusian ecologistsÃ¢ calculations are totally incompetent by at least three orders of magnitude any corporation whose engineer made such an error would assign that engineer promptly to occupations for which he were professionally qualified such as picking up refuse as this report summarizes the method for determining such a judgment the maintenance of the potential relative population density of a human population requires forms of technological progress which in turn require an increase of the total productive labor force of society and hence the total population the required range of human population to effect ecological stability over the period into decades of the coming century is approximately ten billions individuals without an increased population of that order of magnitude it will become increasingly difficult to maintain the increasingly diversified division of labor which technological progress implies without technological progress in that order of advancement the world will suffer a genocidal sort of ecological crisis more or less of the magnitude the most radical among the malthusian ecologists project Ã¢ lyndon h larouche jr wiesbaden new york city december 24 1981 1 rudiments of Ã¢ human ecologyÃ¢ the obvious measurement to be applied to the study of the reproduction of any population is potential relative population density this measures the density of population which can be achieved by a population solely through its own activities of producing the material preconditions for existence of the entire population excepting man the characteristic potential relative population density is fixed in range by heredity this potential can be improved only by action external to the species or variety itself as such external action is illustrated by improvements in cultivation of crops and livestock only man can willfully improve his societyÃ¢ s potential relative potential population density the study of human ecology is a study of the necessary conditions and means for effecting such willful changes in the productive and related behavior of our species gottfried wilhelm leibniz 1646 1716 for this inquiry we employ gottfried leibnizÃ¢ s contributions to both economic science and physical science work power and technology although leibnizÃ¢ s discoveries date from his founding of modern economic science with the publication of his society and economy during the 1670s these notions obviously apply as appropriately to the earliest known phases of human social practice as well as to recent centuries it is improvements in technology which are the immediate correlative of improvements in a societyÃ¢ s potential relative population density the question immediately posed is whether improvements in technology are necessary for human existence or whether such improvements however beneficial are merely optional the key to human ecology is the proof that a succession of such improvements is necessary for perpetuation of human existence it is a fact that there are no absolute limits to the natural resources available to mankind it is sufficient to note that fact without proof at this point in our report there are however relative limits to exploitable forms of natural resources at least relative to any fixed order of technology the nature of such relative limitations is so obvious empirically that we need merely describe the proof this observation is the beginning of a scientific form of human ecology potential relative population density is as we have indicated an examination of a societyÃ¢ s ability to produce the material preconditions of existence of a society of the same or expanded number of at least the current quality of individuals the crux of this process is the activity of a section of the whole population we may describe in descriptive terms as the societyÃ¢ s goods producing labor force it is the activity of that labor force which produces all of the changes in the material preconditions of life and production upon which the continued or expanded existence of the whole population depends the useful activities of this goods producing labor force are divided principally into the transforma tion of natural resources into raw materials and the processing of those raw materials into usable forms of goods plus of course the physical distribution of goods within the network of production and consumption it requires no extensive discussion at this stage of our report to note that the total goods producing labor force is a determined percentile of the entire population it is also obvious that there is an implicit number of individuals of the total population maintained per average member of the goods producing labor force we shall soon consider how variations in these ratios are determined for the immediate moment the observa tion made is adequate white house eric draper it is clear therefore that if the percentile of total labor force required for any part of the production of a total required goods output were increased without thereby increasing the total goods output the number of persons sustained in the total population would be reduced relative to the total labor force there is no disagreement between us and the malthusians that the usable number of types of natural resources is limited for any fixed quality of prevailing technology of goods production nor is there any disagreement between us respecting the bare fact that as exploitation of those natural resources continues society incurs the growing social cost of using poorer grades of such resources and of going further and digging deeper to secure resources of equal or poorer quality this is the general case at least as long as the level of technology practiced is approximately fixed so if the percentile of the labor force required for producing the same required quantity and quality of raw materials is increased in such a fashion the remaining percentile of the total labor force is reduced and the possible standard of living of the total population is reduced in consequence of such chain reaction effects in other words the potential relative population density is reduced technological progress overcomes this problem in two ways insofar as technological progress merely increases the productivity of labor this rise in productivity may be adequate or better than adequate to offset the rising costs of raw materials more fundamental forms of advancement in technology redefine advantageously the spectrum of what constitutes natural resources technological progress is indispensable even to maintain a constant potential relative population density this technological progress is not superimposed on unchanging Ã¢ biological individuals Ã¢ technological progress means an increase in the power of the average individual over nature such a more powerful individual is a more developed individual if we measure the social cost of producing an individual of a certain quality in terms of a Ã¢ market basketÃ¢ of average consumption of goods and services the individual of greater productive power costs more to produce however in successful development the social costs percentile of the total labor forceÃ¢ s activity required to produce the more abundant market basket required to produce the more developed individual shrinks relative to the costs of producing a poorer individual in a less technologically advanced form of that society the amount of average goods and services rises but the total social cost of filling that market basket declines in other words the percentile of the potential activity of the total population required to produce its required human consumption decreases at the same time that the content of the average market basket improves in quantity and quality family composition to develop from the average new born person an adult who is both morally qualified as a citizen and qualified to assimilate modern productive and related technology requires a program of combined classical and scientific general education spanning the ages of from approximately six to eighteen years of age prior to any specialist education even with the best content of public educational programs imaginable at present this span of basic education could not be significantly shortened specialist education beyond eighteen years of age requires approximately two additional years for technicians and even with optimal improvements in university curricula could not produce qualified doctoral candidates in the arts and science in less than an average six years in specialist fields of medicine the period of advanced education and related training is longer let us consider briefly some of the implications of these requirements for training of youth prior to entry into a modern labor force the implications are all properly obvious yet they also serve to point out a few crucial facts too often ignored by policy makers and policy influencers national cancer institute first let us imagine attempting to maintain a program of education of the labor force completed at between eighteen and twenty four years of age in a whole population whose mean life expectancy were between thirty five and forty five years of age it is sufficient to compare the ratio of the whole populationÃ¢ s labor force members of households to see the point immediately without a life expectancy in the order of between seventy and eighty years the maintenance of a modern society becomes almost unfeasible on grounds of social costs alone so in addition to rising Ã¢ market basketÃ¢ costs of education and of sustaining the persons being educated we must expend efforts to increase longevity hygienic programs health care improved nutrition are obviously indispensable it is also clear that the most costly per patient aspect of medical science diseases associated with aging is the fighting front of warfare against death out of which combat the knowledge is adduced necessary to increasing the average life expectancy of the entire population imagine that we would extend the productive age of the population to seventy five or eighty years by improvements in health and longevity consider the effects in terms of reduced social costs of sustaining an average individual for the entire society in the same vein of thought one leading social cost problem of industrialized nation economies today is a sharp decline in the birth rate whose effect is to make the populations of those nations demographically aged rather than increasing the birth rate to restore the balance in the population influential forces of those nations are proposing to accelerate the death rate among persons over fifty five years of age to redress the imbalance by murder as a state policy complementing this demographic aging of industrialized nationsÃ¢ populations we have a population in the sixty five to eighty five year interval of age who are being killed by combinations of increasing material deprivation and ennui we must improve the physical well being of the average individual entering and participating in this age range and must provide optional forms of fruitful activityÃ¢ instead of relegating the retired ages to the equivalent of a mythical Ã¢ elephantÃ¢ s graveyard Ã¢ the net social cost of larger medical expenditures and other supportive efforts will be less than nothing and all of us can then cease to lower our heads in shame when we look at the condition of our aged parents and grandparents in addition to the costs directly attributable to education and to support of the young during that age interval the advancement of technology requires improvement in the cultural circumstances of life of the entire populationÃ¢ of all ages this improvement is required most obviously in respect to the adult householdÃ¢ s functions of child rearing the cultural level of the household and general community affect most significantly the intellectual potentials of the youth in school eirns sylvia spaniolo that is but the first obvious feature of this matter as it should become obvious in the course of the unfolding of this report the level of technological culture achieved by a member of the labor force at the close of basic education and apprenticeship can not be the end of education in a well ordered society technological revolutions of some degree must occur cumulatively over periods of not less than seven and fifteen years the member of the labor force must do more than qualify for a fixed level of technological competence the member of the labor force must not only assimilate new technologies several times over the course of a lifetime but must participate in the usual case in contributing to initiation of improvements in technology a rich cultural life with the institutions of leisure appropriate to this is an unavoidable aspect of just maintaining and improving the potential relative population density as the costs of educating an individual increase relative to earlier prior levels of technology and as the value of creative leisure time activities to society increases such forms of waste as an average of several hours each working day travelling to and from work become intolerable similarly the necessity of expending a significant number of hours each day in shopping for food and other regular items of household consumption becomes an intolerable condition fools argue that these costs to the population do not count as costs to production foolish accountants do not understand the importance of several hours a week spent singing in a chorus performing in an amateur orchestra or instrumental group house music in the community and home study at home of some matter of interest to the citizen of various social activities with family friends and acquaintances in these leisure activities not only are the qualities of the citizen developed but a population which is creatively stimulated in its leisure life is of improved morale and greater increased disposition and aptitude for creative innovation in activities as a member of the labor force these observations are not to be pushed aside as amiable sentimentalities as the significance of such matters of leisure activities should become clear as this report unfolds a population were prudent to waste none of its wealth on gambling tawdry entertainments on household consumption expenditures to solicit envy and so forth a good simple life were better saving expenditures and time for those activities of family community and private leisure which improve the mind and soul of the citizen conspicuous is the case of the united states which may spend as much on mind destroying Ã¢ recreational drugsÃ¢ as upon military defense and which spends massive amounts on pornography and other predicates of sodom and gomorrah after we strip away such immoral waste and reduce our requirements to those of a simple fruitful and good household and individual life those prudent requirements can not be left unfulfilled without some cumulative damage to the productive potentials of the population through technological progress society produces individuals of average increased power over nature this increase of power is correlated in direction with increases in the quantities and varieties of the content of the average market basket of goods and services at the same time there are correlated changes in the necessary composition of the family household for these and related reasons it is absurd to compare the population reproduction characteristics of two societies or two different periods of the same society on the basis of merely counting the number of individuals produced 1 2 3 from the vantage point of the implied mathematics for study of human ecology no feature of the statistical analysis employed for ecological studies of plant and animal populations has any applicability to human populations 2 the Ã¢ thermodynamicsÃ¢ of society the indispensable succession of technological advances required merely to maintain a constant value of potential relative population density defines the process of human reproduction as what is properly termed negentropic this as we shall elaborate the point at a proper later point of this report is key to understanding why increases in the absolute size of the human population are necessary for those technological advances which would be required even to maintain a constant potential relative population density even for a smaller population in a proper approach to analysis of any physical system we analyze the total work applied to the system into two principal components a certain amount of work must be applied to the system to maintain it in the same degree of organization as during a preceding epoch in ordinary usage one speaks today of the Ã¢ energy of the systemÃ¢ in identifying the work necessary to maintain the physical system in the equivalent of a constant state in applying this to society the constant value of reference is a constant value for potential relative population density this is the first component of our analysis of the work applied to society the second component is the portion of work available to accomplish useful change above and beyond maintaining the system in its previous or equivalent state this second component is usually identified as the Ã¢ free energyÃ¢ of the system in the instance of human ecology this is the portion of the total work of society available to expand the scale of the society and to increase the value of the societyÃ¢ s potential relative population density the study of all physical systems is properly focussed upon the way in which the values of the ratio of free energy to energy of the system change a system in which this ratio increases is called negentropic negative entropy a system in which this ratio decreases is called entropic it is important at this point to stress that modes of economic analysis which purport to measure the wealth of a nation as the sum of the wealth of individuals firms and farms are intrinsically incompetent modes of analysis if the total wealth of a nation falls below the levels of consumption required to maintain a constant potential relative population density the national economy is functioning at a level insufficient to maintain the equivalent of Ã¢ energy of the system Ã¢ the economy is collapsing if the trends so reflected continue the society will die we must take the society as a whole as the indivisible unit of primary measurement we must consider the parts of the whole only in respect to the effect of action of the part on the balance of growth or contraction of the whole any violation of this requirement introduces absurdity into the accounting unfortunately at this time precisely such absurdity predominates in the national income accounting procedures of nations the uno and supranational and private institutions to analyze an economy a society we begin with the population as a whole as the primary unit of measurement we then analyze the activities of this population as a whole studying the mediation of the reproduction of the population as a whole through the production of goods by the labor force portion of that total population to effect such an analysis we assort the population into two principal categories we make this assortment by households not by individuals since the household is the indivisible unit of reproduction and rearing of new members of society for purposes of broad analysis we divide the population of households into two principal categories households represented by members of the goods producing and transportation labor force and other households although useful administration and services contribute directly or indirectly to maintaining and improving the productivity of goods producing labor administrative and service functions are not productive in and of themselves their benefit to the economy potential relative population density must be mediated through goods producing labor and that labor must be fruitfully employed we treat essential categories of administration and services plus necessary military and security functions plus idleness and other waste as Ã¢ overhead expensesÃ¢ of society as a whole we divide the whole goods output of productive labor as a whole into categorical forms of consumption of such goods first the consumption of goods by households of the goods producing labor force second capital goods consumption for goods production and transportation third consumption for maintenance of categories of Ã¢ overhead expenses Ã¢ fourth finally the margin of Ã¢ net profit Ã¢ represented by goods or available goods producing capacity after deducting the cited three categories of combined costs and expenses it might be argued that members of the labor force may change employment from productive or overhead forms of occupations and that two members of the same household may be employed in different categories this poses no inherent difficulty for analysis since it is as we shall show the rate of change of ratios rather than momentary statistical values which concern us it should be readily seen that the combined costs and expenses we have identified correspond to Ã¢ energy of the system Ã¢ and that the Ã¢ net profitÃ¢ corresponds at least potentially to the Ã¢ free energyÃ¢ of the reproductive process it is the ratio of these two values which becomes the central point of reference for our continuing process of analysis cc neil palmer ciat if the society were both fixed in scale of population and productive activity the rise in marginal costs of the raw materials associated with a fixed technology would cause the value of the key ratio to fall over the course of successive epochs of production entropy without the application of Ã¢ free energyÃ¢ the net profit margin to expand the economy and to increase productivity through technological advances the society is self doomed to die we interrupt the development of our point here to refer to the argument of the malthusians the malthusians argue that because of apparent limits of the natural resources which present technology requires for necessary raw materials we must halt or even reverse technological progress placing increased emphasis upon labor intensive over capital intensive modes of production they argue that this policy they propose is indispensable to delay an ecological crisis from the points we have outlined thus far and we have relied upon no debatable inferences in any of this it is clear that if an ecological crisis were to confront us it would occur for no other reason than that we were foolish enough to heed the advice of such ecologists unless we increase productivity relying upon advances in the quality of productive technology for this purpose we shall indeed bring a genocidal sort of ecological crisis upon humanity if we refused to begin deploying nuclear energy technology on a large scale immediately hundreds of millions of people in the developing sector would die unnecessarily from combined direct and indirect consequences of combined shortages and high social costs of energy to resume our development of the points of this section we have already emphasized the seeming paradox that the social cost of producing an individual must decline while the costs in terms of comparative market baskets must increase translating what we have outlined on that point into the terms of reference we have introduced in this present section we say that such a rise in the market basket cost of average labor represents an increase in the level of Ã¢ energy of the systemÃ¢ per capita however if this is associated with a lower social cost of producing the average individualÃ¢ s market basket there is a tendency for the rate of profit to riseÃ¢ provided expenses do not increase to prevent this and that capital costs do not increase to prevent this result in such a case the Ã¢ energy of the systemÃ¢ would increase while the free energy ratio increased also the persistence of such a trend over successive epochs of the productive cycle represents manifest negentropy the source of such negentropy is not investment in production as such but rather investment in improved productivity investment in improved technology it is the rate of Ã¢ injectionÃ¢ of improved technologies into the economy which determines the potential negentropy of the economy and nothing else this is the only source for maintaining and improving the potential relative population density of the society for reasons we shall now begin to elaborate the increase in the per capita level of Ã¢ energy of the systemÃ¢ occurs not only in respect to household and related consumption it occurs also with respect to capital consumption by agriculture broadly defined industry and transportation it also occurs with respect to certain essential features of administration and services as distinct for the increases in Ã¢ energy density levelsÃ¢ of the households associated with administration and services we shall now elaborate these features of the matter in successive steps until a rounded picture of the matter is thus presented leibnizÃ¢ s revolution in economic science the school of naples contributed an essential leading role in development of statecraft for all of europe at the beginning of the seventeenth century this center added major contributions to what was known as cameralism in italy and germany and as mercantilism in france in opposition to the rentier financier interests which identified wealth with fixed natural resources and extraction of profit only as usury or ground rent the cameralists treated natural resources as Ã¢ mere accidents of geography Ã¢ and correctly located the source of wealth as the development of the productive powers of labor within this policy the importance of the articulated tool was situated and was frequently termed Ã¢ artificial labor Ã¢ within this general policy outlook gottfried leibniz effected a revolution through which modern economic science was established beginning the 1670s in france the central feature of leibnizÃ¢ s revolution in statecraft was his focus upon the generalized implications of heat powered machines Ã¢ by which one man may accomplish the work of a hundred others Ã¢ from this inquiry overlapping leibnizÃ¢ s pre 1676 development of the differential calculus leibniz developed the notions of work power and technology common to both economic science and to physical science thereafter to these conceptions and their implications for our subject here we shall refer repeatedly as we proceed through the remaining pages of this report we interpolate here a few indispensable observations respecting the directions in which leibnizÃ¢ s influence flowed in economic science and physical science into the mid nineteenth century so that we need not introduce such qualifications piecemeal as occasion for such references occurs at later points in this report by economic science we mean the currents of mercantilism and cameralism which guided the economic development of leading nations of continental europe and the united states inclusively over the period from 1653 cardinal mazarinÃ¢ s defeat of the spanish hapsburgs into the third quarter of the nineteenth century including the industrial development of northern italy by cavourÃ¢ s circle and the successful meiji restoration development in japan after leibniz the names mercantilism and cameralism continued to be used to designate a subsumed economic science and also the alternate term Ã¢ physical economy Ã¢ this was mediated during the eighteenth century through leibnizÃ¢ s influence and most notably through circles associated with the oratorian teaching order in france in france leibnizÃ¢ s term technology was translated as polytechnique out of these currents emerged two subsumed developments the first was the 1789 1791 establishment of what was named Ã¢ the american systemÃ¢ of political economy under president george washington and treasury secretary alexander hamilton this american system was based on a leibnizian version of french mercantilism the second was the establishment of the Ã£ cole polytechnique by lazare carnot and his former teacher gaspard monge after 1815 and the fusion of german cameralism with the american system e g friedrich list the term american system became the name in general use to designate economic science in general outside japan and the influence of this author and his associates economic science no longer exists in practice what is taught as economics in european and united states universities and in most other nations is the so called british school of political economy the dominant variety of british dogma taught and upheld by most putative professionals today is the application of the Ã¢ hedonistic calculusÃ¢ of jeremy bentham which john stuart mill william jevons and alfred marshall renamed the Ã¢ utilitarianÃ¢ dogma in political economy the axiomatic premise of marginal utility is the argument of bentham that man is incapable of knowing any values but those corresponding to the individualÃ¢ s subjective perception of the pleasure and pain associated with isolated transactions marginal utility presumes that variations in prices reflect the individualÃ¢ s efforts to measure the relative pleasure and pain associated with transactions it is assumed that in an extended ergodic process the actual money prices will tend to converge on the relative hedonistic values associated with the individualÃ¢ s experience in buying and selling of goods labor and services professor milton friedman is thoroughly consistent with the axiomatic principles of british economy when he proposes legalization of many things now treated as unlawful practices including traffic in heroin on grounds of Ã¢ free trade Ã¢ his argument is the hedonistic argument we have just summarily identified in its earlier version that of british east india company propagandists adam smith thomas malthus and david ricardo the british system of political economy was the most immediate issue of the american war of independence the representatives of the american system including mathew carey friedrich list and henry c carey were most explicit and detailed in explaining how and why the american system and the british system of smith malthus and ricardo were deadly adversaries left public domain right franÃ£ ois sÃ£ raphin delpech public domain friedrich list 1789 1846 behind the shameless immorality of modern british and viennese neo positivist political economy its avowed adherence to the Ã¢ hedonistic principle Ã¢ british political economy is totally adapted to the principles of a rentier financier society as opposed to an industrial capitalist society as david ricardo was quite explicit on this point and as karl marx critically defends ricardoÃ¢ s essential point the british system before and after john stuart mill is based on the principle of usury and ground rent if one recognizes that usury is a special form of ground rent one understands the whole matter more readily it denies the existence of a necessary determined level of industrial profit on production by industries and farms and refuses to take into account such features of the economic process as we emphasize in this report the british dogma of Ã¢ free tradeÃ¢ has always been a policy aimed at driving the prices of industrial and agricultural products and labor down to the lowest margin possible thus increasing the portion of the total income of society exacted in the form of usury and ground rent on these and related grounds the careys and others described the british system as a mixed feudalist industrialist system better than Ã¢ feudalistÃ¢ would be the designation Ã¢ oligarchical Ã¢ using that term in the sense of the policy embodied in the fourth century b c proposal to establish a Ã¢ western division of the persian empireÃ¢ on the basis of the Ã¢ persian model Ã¢ although several presidents of the united states jefferson madison jackson van buren pierce buchanan and others were advocates of the british east india companyÃ¢ s policies washington adams monroe john quincy adams and lincoln adhered vigorously to the american system through the work of those administrations all of the policy institutions of education and of agricultural and industrial progress were established before 1871 with the british and j p morganÃ¢ s success in corrupting the congress in 1876 to enact the specie resumption act the united states surrendered its sovereignty over its national debt currency and principal flows of credit to foreign forces centered in the city of london today only japan adheres to economic science in policy or at least in terms of accepted economic doctrines every other nation of note including east bloc nations teaches and worships the british system of political economy in either its strict form or its marxian offshoot left clipart right thomas phillips john linnell thomas malthus 1766 1834 as this author has given the proof in published locations the british doctrine of political economy is axiomatically malthusian in its implications for practice those objections to malthusian policies which one might suppose to originate with even the narrowest self interests of industry and agriculture are nullified by the widespread credulous acceptance of british dogma in the name of putative economics in physical science the patterns flowing from leibniz are approximately the same as for economic science the emigration of the Ã£ cole polytechniqueÃ¢ s leading figures to alexander von humboldtÃ¢ s berlin during the post 1815 period brought leibnizÃ¢ s french currents into union with his german currents and with the collaborators of bernhard riemann e g enrico betti around cavourÃ¢ s circles in northern italy since the work of riemann and georg cantor during the period concluding with cantorÃ¢ s work of 1871 1883 no truly fundamental accomplishments in scientific knowledge have occurred there have been numerous important achievements in scientific work applying to broader domains the scientific apparatus developed at gÃ£ ttingen and berlin through the 1880s but no fundamental discoveries of the sort which marked the progress of continental science from nicholas of cusaÃ¢ s commentaries on archimedean science through kepler pascal leibniz et al into riemannÃ¢ s and cantorÃ¢ s fundamental breakthroughs the fundamental unsolved problems of physical science today remain as they were when riemann died in 1866 and cantor rounded out his work of the 1871 1883 period why the years immediately preceding and following 1871 appear in so many facets of culture to be a critical turning point in the general trends of modern history is an important and most significant question but one we think it inappropriate to more than indicate here what is significant in this dating for the halt in fundamental progress in scientific method is that riemannÃ¢ s successors excepting perhaps some among bettiÃ¢ s circle in italy either rejected or greatly diluted the central feature of riemannÃ¢ s contribution to physics and mathematics what is sometimes termed the principle of the ontologically transfinite a notion precisely congruent with the classical christian theological presentation of the nature of substantiality in the perfect consubstantiality of the trinity this was the center of the impetus given to physical science by cusa the dominant feature of the founding of modern mathematical physics by kepler the central feature of leibnizÃ¢ s scientific method and also of riemann and cantor among others once that principle was pushed out of scientific work fundamental scientific progress flattened out progressing sideways to considerable extent but not forwards usda nrcs jeff vanuga usda this principle as reflected in the authorÃ¢ s understanding of riemannÃ¢ s 1854 habilitation dissertation and other matters is the crucial feature of the authorÃ¢ s contributions to economic science and thus the premise for what is termed the larouche riemann method of economic analysis now having summarily identified matters we shall encounter subsequently in this report we resume the immediate point in the ordinary development of a heat powered machine we study the essential movements to which we desire to give a powered expression in the machine thus we shift the source of energy from the muscle power of man and beast to the heat energy driving the machine we then go further in the same direction not only increasing the power of machines but increasing the energy flux density of the heat sources employed to drive productive processes of all kinds a similar process occurs in the development of agriculture the very low energy flux density of sunlight per hectare and the rates at which plants can convert sunlight into biomass are limiting conditions since the work of justus von liebig et al we treat the soil with trace elements and other conditioning features and inject energy in the form of manufactured fertilizers this combined with powered machinery irrigation and so forth and with improvements in crops and livestock to take advantage of artificial conditions enables us to increase greatly the per hectare yields while increasing greatly the number of hectares efficiently worked by a single farmer the increase in levels of per capita consumption of agriculturally produced food and fiber in the united states while the agricultural component of the labor force has contracted from 90 1790 to approximately 4 today is the much cited illustration of this wild agricultural land like the earth itself has a poor fertility the fertility of agricultural land is the benefit of human labor the improvements in the land crops livestock and methods of production cumulatively injected and maintained by farmers in cooperation with society generally so in the advancement of technology we increase the per capita Ã¢ energy of the systemÃ¢ in the household in industry in agriculture and in transportation as this process unfolds in the domain of production of goods and in transportation the relative increase of per capita Ã¢ energy of the systemÃ¢ in the form of improvements in nature and in production capital is greater than in the growth of relative per capita Ã¢ energy of the systemÃ¢ in the form of household consumption physical economics flow chart let us change the definition of the content of karl marxÃ¢ s symbology to concur with the different content we assign in this report let the household and related goods consumption of the goods producing labor force be signified by v let the Ã¢ energy of the systemÃ¢ represented by capital improvements in nature and production capital be signified by c let the Ã¢ overhead expensesÃ¢ be signified by d let the gross surplus of goods produced after deducting c v be signified by s let s Ã¢ d be signified by sÃ¢ Â² then sÃ¢ Â² c v represents the crucial ratio of Ã¢ free energyÃ¢ to Ã¢ energy of the systemÃ¢ as measured in terms of the ratios of goods producing households c increases more rapidly than v while it is required that sÃ¢ Â² c v must rise since the market basket value of v per capita increases even though the social cost of v per capita decreases the increase in productivity required must be premised on the required result in terms of sÃ¢ Â² c v for the condition that the market basket content of per capita v rises as required this rise in productivity must be effected by injections of improved technology the measure of a succession of values for the ratio sÃ¢ Â² c v is an increase in the societyÃ¢ s potential relative population density the change in value of sÃ¢ Â² c v sufficient to increase the potential relative population density by some designated degree is the measure of the net work accomplished by society all other work applied to the economy society merely maintains the value of the system value of potential relative population density and is thus broadly comparable to the molecular activity in some three legged stool standing stably in a corner this latter work we designate therefore as virtual work the rate of increase of the net work of the economy society is the power of the process being analyzed the ordering of innovations which fulfills the conditions we have identified so far is technology this ordering correlates with a long term tendency for the required per capita energy density consumed by society to rise geometrically relative to increases in societyÃ¢ s indicated potential relative population density given this basic and other conditions to be satisfied the business of statecraft is to discover and implement those improvements which satisfy these conditions foremost among those requirements of statecraft is the fostering of general education and scientific inquiry such that the needed innovations in technology may be developed and as developed will be given to a labor force educated to the level needed to assimilate such improvements for practice 3 about ten billions people during the recent three years the author and his associates have been conducting computer assisted projections of economic development for india mexico and other nations as well as recurring studies of current trends in the u s and other economies this method called the larouche riemann method is the only computer study of the post october 1979 volcker measuresÃ¢ effects which has accurately forecast all of the essential features of the recent period in fact all of the leading econometric studies have been repeatedly totally incompetent using this same approach we have attempted to estimate the general characteristics of an acceptable form of world economy approximately fifty years ahead using rather conservative estimates of the rates at which technological progress might be effected in developing nations but requiring the elimination of misery we find that the required world population fifty years from now must be slightly less than or greater than ten billions people the precise calculations are not the significant point any competent calculation must yield a comparable result the calculations are to be made in any case by something approximating the following successive steps the estimated per capita energy consumption of industrialized nations is about 38 000 kilowatt hours the energy consumption of poorer but not the poorest developing nations is approximately an order of magnitude less for reasons implicit in our review of factors of Ã¢ energy of the system Ã¢ it is impossible to achieve combined agricultural and industrial outputs per capita equivalent to 1980 industrialized sector averages without approaching 30 000 to 35 000 kilowatt hours per capita in all of the developing sector our goals are modest ones for india forty five years hence we project an estimated agricultural component of the labor force of about 25 about that of the soviet union today or of france at the beginning of the fifth republic we project at the present phase of our study about 35 000 kilowatt hours per capita for egypt with a population of about 90 millions persons by the year 2020 this sort of fact leads to the desired calculations first we know that most of the added energy production must be supplied by nuclear energy plants costs of fossil fuel energy production are already significantly higher than for current generations of fission energy plants and must rise on the basis of unavoidably rising social costs of fossil fuelsÃ¢ although undeveloped resources of petroleum and natural gas vastly exceed published estimates we will use natural gas where economics prescribes and will include high potential hydroelectric development wherever it exists or can be developed as a by product of urgently needed water management programs the proposals for solar energy for industrial use and for Ã¢ renewable resourcesÃ¢ are a wild hoax the capital costs of solar energy substitution are inherently one or two orders of magnitude higher per kilowatt hour than nuclear except as fossil fuels are locally cheap and abundant and except as high potential hydroelectric sources are available the entire increase of energy input to the developing sector must come from nuclear energy based on our knowledge of the scientific and engineering problems involved and aided by studies of projections by u s energy agencies we know that laboratory production of net energy from a fusion energy process can be demonstrated before 1985 and that commercial fusion energy production can be made available by the turn of the century this means that the bulk of the added energy for developing sector and other nationsÃ¢ needs must be supplied by known types of fission energy plants for about the next twenty five years or longer we know the labor content of the construction and operation of each such type of energy plant we know the labor content of the types of materials used in construction of such plants a set of corresponding linear equations permits us to estimate with fair accuracy the total amount of labor force required merely to supply the plants and materials used in constructing and maintaining such plants over the next quarter century and to construct estimates in a similar fashion for an additional quarter century we also know as a fair estimate the ratios of social cost for energy production to other categories of production and other employment by such means we construct an estimate of the total labor force required fifty years hence since we know the variables of household demography well enough to offer fair estimates of the ratio of labor force to total household population a fair estimate of the size of required population follows hence approximately ten billions people are estimated as required ford motor co the principal objection to such an estimate is the observation that productivity should increase significantly over fifty years at first glance that is a very persuasive objection after rigorous reflection we reject the objection the effect of improvements in technology must necessarily be to increase the scale of required labor force and hence the population in summary descriptive terms our refutation of the indicated sort of objection is this the advancement of technology depends upon a two component increase in the complexity of the social division of goods producing labor the social division of labor in human labor terms is increased while at the same time the elements of the division of labor incorporated as heat powered elements in goods producing capacity is also increasing so far this twofold process always results in a net increase in the number of elements of the social division of goods producing labor furthermore for related reasons as technology advances and as production becomes increasingly capital intensive the number of required scientists and engineers per 100 000 goods producing operatives increases this increase is associated with the rate of required increase in capital intensity and with the complexity of the division of labor therefore if we take the sum of distinctive functions of the social division of goods producing and transportation labor plus the equivalent embedded in goods producing capacityÃ¢ s capital intensity and designate that sum by the symbol n then technological progress takes the form of a transformation of the complexity of the productive process from order n to order n m this yields another expression for technological progress p f n in that expression p signifies potential relative population density f signifies some function to be designated for the ratio enclosed in the brackets and n and m have the significance we have identified immediately before this point since we also have from our earlier discussion p f p for which f p is not the same as f n the projective equivalence of the two functions is indicated as we shall indicate later in this report there is a strong conclusive proof for the appropriateness of the notion of functions f n such a function is uniquely riemannian in the sense Ã¢ riemannianÃ¢ is defined in exemplary fashion by bernhard riemannÃ¢ s 1854 habilitation dissertation Ã¢ on the hypotheses which underlie geometry Ã¢ the author has treated this summarily in published writings including the recently published treatment of systems analysis in the executive intelligence review a proper definition of Ã¢ negentropicÃ¢ is a purely geometric definition as distinct from the statistical definition commonly used during the post war period to date a negentropic universe is a riemannian universe whose characteristic feature is a constant transformation from a continuous manifold of momentary order n to a successor such manifold of order n 1 the mere fact that our universe exists is already conclusive empirical proof that that universe is negentropic as a whole in the sense associated with riemann this latter point was argued by philo of alexandria and appears as a leading point of ridicule of isaac newtonÃ¢ s work by leibniz in the leibniz clarke correspondence to that point we shall return as indicated in due course here hypothetically technological progress could reach some qualitative point of transformation in the general ordering of progress at which point of change the net increase in the topological ordering of economic phase space would be entirely Ã¢ compactedÃ¢ into the development of capital goods of production and transportation in terms of industrial and agricultural technology as defined by the period 1670 to the present such a change is presently impossible to the present a net increase in the social division of labor in production and transportation of goods is inherent in progress only after we have shifted into a new series of kinds of technological progress a generalized riemannian relativistic physics of the sort implicit in riemannÃ¢ s 1860 Ã¢ shock waveÃ¢ experimental design could we begin to envisage the kind of transformation in which advances in economy per se would not directly incur required increases in the labor force therefore pending a generalization of such riemannian relativistic physics as a new basis for productive technology in general we are obliged to assume the persistence of the indicated rule that technological progress increases the complexity of the social division of labor and increases the required scale of the labor force as a result of such increases in complexity consequently if the projection indicated by calculation from rough constraints energy requirements fulfilled by nuclear energy production underestimates technological progress on the one side such overestimation of social costs of production is an underestimation of the increase in required size of the labor force caused by technological progress before examining the proof to this effect to be adduced from physical science we consider the economic principles involved from the vantage point of the classical formulation of the american system u s treasury secretary alexander hamiltonÃ¢ s 1791 report Ã¢ on the subject of manufactures Ã¢ usda lance cheung from rural to urban preponderance the root of misery in the world today is that underdevelopment of the social division of labor which is reflected in a twenty five percent or higher rural component of the total national labor force a relatively low yield per hectare and relatively much worse a high ratio of farm labor required per 100 hectares intrinsically defines a society as subject to a relatively low potential relative population density the ratio of total population sustained per farmer is the first measurement of economic development and the broad determinant of a societyÃ¢ s potential relative population density a policy of promoting rural over urban life and of promoting labor intensive rather than capital intensive development of agriculture is today in and of itself an act of genocide the leading task of the world today is to develop rapidly both the per hectare yields of farming forestry and so forth and the number of hectares productively subsumed under the labor of an average farmer in broad terms of policy this is to be accomplished by a choice of direction outlined in hamiltonÃ¢ s cited report a report which uniquely corresponds to successful agricultural development over the course of the past two centuries to date and which has been proven the only competent policy of approach to developing economies generally given the indicated commitment to supply the world with adequate per capita energy supplies the application of this energy input in the developing sector must emphasize those combined actions for capital intensive development of agriculture and of the entire population which leads to the kind of rural to urban shift required we must give precedence to the application of limited global means to those forms of investment which have the most immediate bearing upon this indicated transformation there must be a Ã¢ shockÃ¢ transformation of public education together with measures of hygiene and health care which rapidly qualify populations usually fifty percent children and youth both as citizens and as employable productive labor in terms of modern technology in agriculture we begin by injections of water management soil treatment pest control fertilization and mechanization to transform the productivity of modes of agricultural production already in use but we act so with definite targets to be reached over one and two generations and in terms of incremental improvements estimated in decades mexico is among the more fortunate instances of a nation whose population has a developed sense of national common interest and which is able to assimilate masses of improvements in agricultural and urban goods production on condition that the youth populationÃ¢ half the totalÃ¢ is educated rapidly enough and afforded suitable employment opportunities as youth enter the labor force this transformation of agriculture and of conditions of life of the populations requires emphasis on certain forms of capital intensive industrial and transportation developments let us view this problem first in its presently most practical and cruelest terms of reference among the most afflicted nations of africa the draper fund established by the genocidalist general william draper of the investment banking firm of dillon read advocates the racialist genocidalist policies of cecil b rhodes with a vengeance draper fund representatives such as general maxwell taylor prescribe the virtual extermination of whole national populations of black africa and of other regions of the developing sector to preserve the natural resources of these targetted regions as future Ã¢ strategic assetsÃ¢ of the dominant anglo saxon populations taylor in strongly pressing the government of the united states to openly adopt such a genocidal policy as Ã¢ strategy Ã¢ merely reflects more shamelessly as does genocidalist william paddock on the subject of mexico the prevailing views of a complex of persons and institutions including the aspen institute ford foundation new york council on foreign relations george ball and influential elements within the averell harriman faction of the u s democratic party the u s state department and the congress the Ã¢ conditionalitiesÃ¢ policy of the internationa1 monetary fund related policies of the world bank and bank for international settlements and of such uno agencies as unitar united nations institute for training and research are only efficient means for imposing genocidal conditions of famine epidemic and homicidal strife upon and among developing sector nations the leading authors of these policies are fully witting of that connection the same pro genocidal policy is applied in practice to the delivery of food aid to famine stricken regions of africa let us compare the prevailing practice of delivery of aid with the approach which should be implemented the rudimentary principles of an assistance development policy for the most suffering regions of the world emerge clearly from considering this problem in its simplest practical terms of reference during the period beginning august 1980 the author and his collaborators attempted to mobilize needed u s governmental action for aid of starving populations in africaÃ¢ over the wicked opposition of the carter administration assembling a task force of experienced leading u s farmers and with counsel from logistical specialists we proposed the following approach we proposed that the logistical methods which would be recommended by the u s corps of engineers under war time conditions be deployed to effect both delivery and means of distribution of food into regions of africa in which the imperiled portions of the population are located if we commit our will to such emergency undertakings we can make a peaceful use of the logistical policy employed for warfare to construct simultaneously ports airfields rail systems highway systems and functioning transportation networks through which to deliver food supplies and other aid needed directly to or close to the areas in which the needy population resides the transportation network established for the efficient initial distribution of aid becomes the network through which basic development aid to aid the populations in increasing their self sustaining powers for the next yearÃ¢ s crops is also delivered this same transportation network permits agriculture to begin efficient specialization in production of an above subsistence surplus for urban markets if the development of water management systems and supplies of pesticides soil treatment materials and fertilizers is introduced by way of the transportation network a modest but marginally decisive improvement in the self sustaining capacities of populations can be effected if food aid is distributed instead to relief camps and the population invited to move toward those relief camps in search of food a hideous destruction of the society results the villages and households are destroyed the affected population reduced to an utterly helpless state of dependency upon aid promoting vagabondage among males and rendering the relief camps virtual death camps and the trek to the camps a gruesome death march under such circumstances food aid whether intended to have such effects or not becomes an instrument for promoting genocide to repeat the important point assistance must be directed to increasing the potential relative population density of the population to increasing the populationÃ¢ s power to sustain its own existence by means of its own productive labor continuing beyond emergency measures of the kinds we have indicated to be needed we must aid the nations affected in producing themselves the most crucial among the agricultural capital goods initially supplied from abroad in general such investments will not mature to become financially self sustaining during a period of less than seven to fifteen years low cost long term credit amortized after an initial period of grace over a total span of fifteen to twenty five years is the general policy required to supply nations of the most afflicted categories with the transformations by which they will become truly self sustaining over the period from the late fourteenth century through the early nineteenth century in europe we demonstrated with aid of improvements devised on the basis of experience approaches to promotion of classical culture scientific education and general education through which new generations of peoples were uplifted in their moral capacities and self sustaining powers the rentier financier interests of oligarchism typified earlier in this timespan by venice and genoa and later by veniceÃ¢ s colony of switzerland and the extension of venetian genoese power through the british dutch and other east india companies caused the mercantilist cameralist policies of economy and national development to be curtailed contaminated or even sabotaged so the practice of europe as a whole over the indicated period is no model of reference especially abhorrent is the colonialist imperialist policy fostered chiefly under british influence yet if we abstract the good work promoted within the overall policy conflict within europe we have a model of reference for discerning the capacities and susceptibilities of any human population to be uplifted the humboldt reforms introduced to prussia although never fully realized exemplify the early nineteenth century assimilation of the whole sweep of experience of europe from the work of dante alighieri through the period of the successive jacobin and napoleonic tragedies of france the case of india takes us to the opposite end of the spectrum among developing nations the sanskrit language is the oldest of living literate languages today dated by brahmins to vedic writings from as early as 3 000 b c the internal Ã¢ grammaticalÃ¢ features of sanskrit even those features immediately evident from the outside of the languageÃ¢ s speakers are more advanced in respect of potential conceptual powers of communication than even the classical greek or danteÃ¢ s italian although indian culture has never fully recovered overall from the devastating influence of the plague of wicked cults devastating europe asia and northern africa during the course of the first millennium b c where the sanskrit culture is preserved as a leading elite influence and where this influence intersects modern science and technology india includes a population with the highest ranking cultural potential among nations of the world today iaea petr pavlicek the number of ph d and related science graduates annually in india compares favorably with the total for the united states india ranks third in the world today in the sheer numbers of qualified professionals and at current rates alone will exceed the united states in this category by the close of the present century the cultured urban labor force is presently in the approximate range of about 60 millionsÃ¢ more than the entire population of most nations and should rise to about 100 millions or more in approximately a generation given the harsh constraints on available productive capital goods for industry agriculture and transportation the industrial sector of indiaÃ¢ s economy is at a modern technological level relative to western europe the united states and the soviet union where limited means have been concentrated for agricultural development as in prime minister nehruÃ¢ s program in the punjab india has demonstrated its ability to become a potential food exporter the problem of india is that the large component of rural poor represents an entropic drag on the negentropic impulse of the relatively more developed sector of the population a different but broadly comparable situation exists in brazil in indonesia and other nations which might be grouped loosely into the same broad sub classification among developing nations as a whole in accounting terms the indian economy as a whole is operating at or just below Ã¢ break evenÃ¢ in terms of potential relative population density a few additional remarks concerning india aid in making the working point clearer out of the upper 20 of indiaÃ¢ s annual graduates of advanced scientific training institutions 40 48 of the total 12 000 emigrate to employment opportunities in chiefly industrialized nations the medical professionals from ranks of sub continent nationals are becoming a dominant feature of the medical care of britainÃ¢ s population which is only the most conspicuous case if we estimate that the equivalent of between 250 000 and 300 000 dollars is required to educate a graduate scientist in the united states and that a scientist has a working professional life of about thirty five or more years the impact of lost professional strata of the population of such developing nations is better appreciated conversely if this same lost potential were redirected by aid of suitable material means to internal development of the developing sector or even to the internal development of the nation represented by such professionals we have a rough sense of what is very immediately feasible in cases roughly approximating the case of india the reduction of the rural component of indiaÃ¢ s labor force to about 25 by 2020 2025 a d is a clearly feasible proposition this means that the average condition of life of substantially more than a billion indians by the period 2020 2025 a d could be better in quality than that for france during the 1950s by a generation later comparable results could be effected in poorer developing regions these estimates are in our view safely conservative this work of export of capital goods from industrialized into developing regions would be economically practicable if the dominant british system of rentier financier world order were replaced by renewal of the american system a shift from usury and ground rent into investible profits of goods production and distribution of such goods would make possible an increase to approximately 200 billions dollars annually or greater in long term development investment credit to developing nations this would accelerate capital turnover in industrialized exporting nations and would thus foster rapid increases in technologically driven productivity of goods production in exporting nations this increase in internal productivity of exporting nations would itself pay for the costs of developing credit for expanded exports that is the populations of exporting nations would experience no reduction in their material conditions of life as a result of enlarged volumes of capital goods exports to developing nations we in the industrialized nations have a vast reservoir of human productive power presently wasted in an excessive growth of labor intensive services and the administration of such variously wasteful or outrightly immoral and parasitic activities if the united states for example reoriented toward bringing the goods producing component of the labor force back to even substantially less than the percentile existing in 1946 1947 the total physical output of the united states would be more than doubled through combined increase in the goods producing percentile and advances in productivity associated with such priorities in investment policies this shift would be deflationary respecting the internal u s economy and hardening of the value of the dollar related kinds of improvements are feasible over the course of a decade in other industrialized nations of western europe presently the industrialized sector as a whole is operating below breakeven levels as measured in potential relative population density for the nationsÃ¢ populations each as a whole and the sector as a whole if the levels of goods output is increased substantially and only within immediately feasible degrees there must be an abrupt shift to a net growth trend within the industrialized sector as a whole from a negative value of sÃ¢ Â² c v to a positive value for sÃ¢ Â² c v this shift means the unleashing of a regenerative negentropic potential within the affected economies a process of self feeding economic growth and technological progress under such conditions the new world economic order our remarks imply becomes eminently feasibleÃ¢ on condition we begin soon before a catastrophic collapse in the economic situation under present imf policies under those conditions proposed the first limitation on the world economy is defined as the need for acceleration of development of more advanced technologies that development in turn requires overcoming the shortage of qualified people which in turn requires that we reproduce and develop the people required 4 the larouche riemann method although the authorÃ¢ s economic science is properly situated within the mercantilism cameralism of leibniz and the american system during 1952 he made a crucial discovery through reexamining bernhard riemannÃ¢ s 1854 habilitation dissertation from the vantage point of approximately a year of wrestling with georg cantorÃ¢ s notion of the transfinite through that view of riemannÃ¢ s contributions this author was enabled to develop a fresh approach to crucial included problems of economic science most specifically the problem of conceptualizing as a mathematical idea the stimulation of economic growth through injections of advances in technology although this is treated more or less adequately in either published locations or in items scheduled for publication during the first half of 1982 there are practical reasons for restating those matters from a theological standpoint of reference here we will be excused for limiting our specific references to several exemplary points from the history of modern science we wish to take up only as much as bears directly on the immediate purposes of this report although the implications of the Ã¢ five platonic solidsÃ¢ were extensively explored during the late fifteenth and sixteenth centuries johannes kepler established modern mathematical physics by proving the hypothesis of the golden mean on the scale of the broadest empirical evidence available the solar orbits although kepler himself devotes the greatest portion of his published writings to this fundamental point keplerÃ¢ s work has been so extensively suppressed or misrepresented in textbooks and classrooms over recent centuries that even physical science professionals generally manifest no awareness of the crucial point or its significance the fact that only five regular polyhedral solids can be constructed in visual space proves conclusively that visual space is shaped by something higher that the characteristic features of lawfully ordered transformations in visual space reflect a determining principle beyond the immediate scope of representation within visual space kepler proved that the orbits of the planets could not be determined by any mode of action contained entirely within visual space but rather that this action was shaped by harmonic principles reflecting the efficiency of a largely unseen higher order space gottfried leibniz combined the outline of future development of physics given by kepler with crucial discoveries of blaise pascal discovering the differential calculus during the period 1675 1676 and otherwise founding more interrelated branches of human knowledge than the modern university graduate would be able to list this successive work of kepler pascal leibniz and contributing influences was mediated through gÃ£ ttingen and the Ã£ cole polytechnique chiefly to a cumulative effect reflected for today in the combined work of chiefly riemann and cantor we knowÃ¢ we are able to prove conclusivelyÃ¢ that the visual space is what is termed a discrete manifold which is in large part a shadowy projection of a higher order reality a continuous manifold through mastery of the implications of the projective relationship between the continuous and discrete manifold we are able to focus our attention on certain unique classes of observations and experiments which open up to our knowledge certainty respecting crucial features of the unseen continuous manifold shadows do not cause the movement of shadows yet the shadows are projectively real and reflect efficient ontologically existent action within the continuous manifold projected to our vision as the discrete manifold the definite objects and metrical relationships we associate with visual space are shadowy ephemerals yet they reflect real existence in the continuous manifold as evaporating footprints in the snow reflect the man who has passed there through the line of investigation traced through archimedes nicholas of cusa leonardo da vinci luca pacioli kepler et al we know as leibniz insisted against descartes that the proper representation of action in the continuous manifold from the vantage point of visual thinking is not straight line action but vortical action harmonically proportioned in a manner which is linked to the principle of the golden mean if we construct for example a conical helping figure we can precisely determine the values of the chords for a twenty four key well tempered domain of musical composition that demonstration has been reformulated recently by one of the authorÃ¢ s collaborators dr jonathan tennenbaum as is summarily described here to assist the readers in following the nature of our argument the helping figure used is a simple conical construction of a logarithmic spiral on the side of a cone constructing the sector of a circle and constructing a cone from that sector project the spiral onto the circular base of the cone and divide the base into twelve equal sectors the chords marked off on the spiral by the radii defining the twelve sectors of the circular base are the proportions of the twelve tones of the well tempered octave scale a useful pedagogical device for communicating the notion of projective relationships between a continuous manifold and a discrete manifold is the following adaptation of a riemannian stereographic projection project higher order conical projections of spiral action onto the interior surface of a hollow sphere within this hollow sphere place a smaller hollow sphere the observerÃ¢ s eyes are looking into the interior surface of the smaller hollow sphere from a point we designate as the Ã¢ north pole Ã¢ the images seen by the observer are stereographic projections of images on the interior surface of the larger sphere those images on the interior surface of the larger sphere are projections of conical spiral action this construction we emphasize is a pedagogical device employed to communicate to a student certain very general notions concerning projective relations between a continuous and discrete manifold most of the commonplace fallacies encountered included the fallacy of Ã¢ indeterminable interconnectedness Ã¢ are dispelled by aid of such a pedagogical device since a spiral action is generated by continuous action in the form represented by functions of complex variables spiral action within hyperconical space is a representation of a continuous manifold through such projections laser techniques are useful for classroom models we show the student how the appearances of a discrete manifold are generated on the interior surface of the smaller of the hollow spheres through such pedagogical devices we demystify topology topology is seen as a matter of isolating those features of projective relationships which are consistent at all phases from the continuous manifold to the stereographic projection to the observer on the interior surface of the smaller hollow sphere immediately a certain range of conceptual problems are readily eliminated but this brings new more profound problems to our attention the points lines surfaces and solids of discrete manifold images are understood to be not self evidently discrete objects in the ontological sense of self evident discreteness but are rather lawfully determined topological singularities arising from continuous action in the continuous manifold that visual space should exhibit the harmonic characteristics considered by keplerÃ¢ and for microphysics by arthur sommerfeld ceases to be a conceptual difficulty eliminating the first sort of conceptual problem makes the deeper problem apparent these problems at first appear to be two but upon adequate reflection the two reduce to one the first problem is that the efficient action associated with the singularity shadows of the discrete manifold is efficient the second problem is that action in the discrete manifold has metrical characteristics such that we must locate a corresponding existence for these metrical characteristics of the discrete manifold within the continuous manifold in brief there is only one kind of continuous manifold in which singularities are efficient actors and the generation of projected metrical characteristics of a discrete manifold may occur this is a continuous manifold in which the existence of the manifold is characterized by a going over from any existing order of geometric degrees of freedom n to n 1 in such a case as integration of a singularity in a continuous manifold according to what riemann names dirichletÃ¢ s principle the singularity is ontologically efficient within the continuous manifold and projects the image of real efficient action within the discrete manifold that is the kernel of riemannÃ¢ s 1854 habilitation dissertation and the kernel of riemannian physics that dissertation is defective only with respect to its incomplete treatment of the notion of number cantorÃ¢ s work on the transfinite from the 1871 1883 period implies the remedy for that incompleteness it was at that point of progress that fundamental discoveries in science essentially halted with the contributions of riemann and cantor this accomplishment and the work leading into it was violently opposed by the british by augustin cauchy and by cauchyÃ¢ s posthumous german co thinkers such as leopold kronecker richard dedekind and hermann von helmholtz james c maxwellÃ¢ s fraudulent treatment of the work of heinrich weber and riemann lord rayleighÃ¢ s incompetent criticism of riemannÃ¢ s design of the shock wave experiment and the fanatical attacks on riemann cantor and to only a lesser degree felix klein and max planck by the british apostles group including the evil bertrand russell typify the conditions responsible for the varying cases of dilution or outright outlawing of the riemann cantor contributions during the latter nineteenth century and the present century to date however all of the crucial developments in or verging upon relativistic plasma physics during the present century demonstrate that riemannian physics is correct and riemannÃ¢ s opponents incompetent in respect of the grounds of their opposition the continuous manifold universe whose action is characterized by the geometrical notion of a going over from each n degrees of freedom to n 1 degrees of freedom is a negentropic manifold this geometric definition is the only properly rigorous definition of negentropy this and the supporting forms of crucial experimental proof of riemannÃ¢ s physics shows that the notions of Ã¢ conservation of energyÃ¢ and the related notion that the universe is composed of a finite number of discrete calories watts or what have you are absurdities superimposed upon science what we view as energetic phenomena have a proper geometric interpretation within the context of a negentropic continuous manifold that interpretation is the interpretation of the functions of ratio of free energy to energy of the system which coheres with the geometric view of such a negentropic manifold the energy of the system reflects action characterized by functions of n 1 n in respect to space of order n the transformation of the system to one of order n 1 from one of order n is the only net work performed by the system the free energy of the system to attempt to adduce a unified field in terms of naive interpretations of the variables of the expression e mc2 is to exhibit the elementary fallacy of superimposing exogenously the misinterpreted metrical appearances of action in the discrete manifold upon the continuous manifold what we must measure within the experimental terms of reference of the discrete manifold is not but the value of d2s for the condition that the physical phase space of action increases its order from n to n 1 this is the only aspect of the discrete manifold whose metrical projective characteristics could be in congruence with the characteristic form of action in a continuous manifold to christian theology such developments within science are matters of old knowledge riemannÃ¢ s standpoint reflects the arguments against the fallacy of the Ã¢ big bangÃ¢ portrayal of creation by philo of alexandria the action of n into n 1 defines the universe as a continuing creation in which the principle of creation is continually efficient and is ordered in a manner comprehensible to mankind as lawful rational this action is subsumed by a higher principle transfinite with respect to all subsumed actions of the series in cantorÃ¢ s definition of transfiniteness yet all this is nothing but the theological comprehension of the ontologically primary highest ontological order of that which expresses the perfect consubstantiality of the trinity the task of ordering of development of society is that of ordering the progress of development of human labor to such effect that manÃ¢ s willfully ordered practice is brought into accord with that perfect consubstantiality although it is readily demonstrated in the manner we have indicated that the perpetuation of human existence requires submission to the injunction to be fruitful to multiply and to exert dominion over nature the ultimate purpose of this mode of perpetuation of human existence is to develop the individual into a more perfect state of accord with the principle of consubstantiality it is from that vantage point and only that higher vantage point that the practice of statecraft is adequately informed application the case for riemannian physics as the author has summarized the most crucial points here informs us properly that such physics is an approximation of the notion of the hypothesis of the higher hypothesis therein from that standpoint lies its proper application if one attempts to describe an economy in terms of post war varieties of input output analysis it becomes clear to the careful observer very quickly that no analysis of an economy in terms of systems of simultaneous linear equations is competent to the extent such input output mappings of the economic process have any empirical applicability those mappings are limited to relative short intervals thus in the case of a developing economy for example analysis requires a series of input output models designating any arbitrary such model by the denotation a i for the series 1 2 3 i n we have the series of successive input output tables a 1 a 2 a 3 a i a n each of these is distinguished from the others by a different composition of the totality of rows and columns and different values for the coefficients associated with each common row or column hence actual economic processes are described as Ã¢ non linear Ã¢ what we require to solve such a Ã¢ non linearÃ¢ problem in analysis is a method for adducing a constant Ã¢ factorÃ¢ of change determining the transformation of the economy from congruence with one to the next of such a series of input output tables that Ã¢ factor Ã¢ that adduced principle of ordered enumerability is the transfinite we have defined as technology it is only when we refine the proper usage of leibnizÃ¢ s notion of technology as a transfinite in that sense that the notion of technology acquires the quality of Ã¢ nameability Ã¢ of conceptual definiteness as a conception we require the notion of the function of n m n as related to potential relative population density the equivalence of a function of sÃ¢ Â² c v as we have indicated that function and the required rise in energy density per capita and energy flux density of heat sources is the approach required to adduce the notion of technology but wait to what result are we leading by such inquiry we must situate such a notion of the economic process within the universe within the lawful ordering of the universe when mankind increases its productivity its potential relative population density man is demonstrating an increased power over nature he is demonstrating a more perfect mastery of the lawful composition of the universe yet each definite phase of progress in knowledge for willful practice in this sequence is in and of itself an imperfect ephemeral truth does not lie in ephemerals whence lies truth in scientific progress if no one ephemeral phase of such progress represents truth in and of itself truth lies only in that adducible ordering principle efficiently common as a principle of hypothesis to successive advances in the power of human practice truth lies only in those adducible principles of sufficient reason which underlie successive successful scientific revolutions as a notion of hypothesis which is transfinite with respect to each and all of the scientific revolutions it subsumes what from the vantage point of such a transfinite principle of sufficient reason is the lawful composition of our universe what is it that we must master to increase our mastery over nature science so defined and technological progress as the predicate of science in the form of human labor are congruent the principle of sufficient reason and the principle underlying technological progress are reflections of one and the same principle to analyze the economic process therefore we must analyze the efficient action of technological progress as a reflection of the negentropic ordering of the universe as a whole conversely since increase of mankindÃ¢ s potential relative population density is the only possible form of proof of what we called scientific knowledge the lawful ordering of the universe must be nothing other than what technological progress in increasing the potential relative population density of society proves to us must be the lawful ordering of the universe economic science so construed is the highest expression and authority for physical science there may be other values some might choose to project upon the economic process but they are false and immoral in consequence as guides to the policy of practice of the human species

chief executive officer of tpg specialty lending inc joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi thank you good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today let me start off by reviewing our full year and fourth quarter 2019 highlights and then i ll hand it off to my partner and our president bo stanley to discuss our portfolio activity and metrics our cfo ian simmonds will review our financial results in more detail and i will conclude with final thoughts before opening the call to q a after the market closed yesterday we reported fourth quarter net investment income per share of 0 51 and net income per share of 0 57 this result this resulted in full year net investment income per share of 1 94 which corresponds to a return of equity of 12 the full year net income per share of 2 34 which corresponds to a return on equity of 14 5 supported by the earnings power of our portfolio we generated earnings in excess of our base dividend more on this in a moment the difference between this quarter s net investment income and net income per share was primarily driven by unrealized gains from both the impact of net tightening credit spreads on the valuation of our portfolio and portfolio company specific events at year end our reported net asset value per share reached another high record of 16 83 compared to 16 72 and the prior quarter and 16 25 at year end 2018 yesterday our board approved a 5 increase to our quarterly base dividend from 0 39 to 0 41 per share to shareholders of record as of march 30 payable on april 15 our board also declared a q4 supplemental dividend of 0 06 per share to shareholders of record as of february 28 payable on march 31 finally our board declared aggregate special cash dividends of 0 50 per share that will be paid to shareholders during q2 statistically 0 25 per share will be payable on april 30 to shareholders of record as of april 15 and 0 25 per share will be payable on june 30 to shareholders of record as of june 15 there s been a couple of changes to our dividend policy this quarter so let me take a few moments to discuss these in detail starting with the increase in our base dividend as we said many times in the past we view our base dividend as an ongoing cash liability and therefore we set it at a level that we believe with the high degree of confidence will be supported by the earnings power of our portfolio this is evidenced by our track record of strong base dividend coverage to net investment income which through the end of 2019 has averaged 127 since our march 2014 ipo nearly three years ago in may 2017 we introduced a variable supplemental dividend framework as a way enhanced cash distributions to our shareholders and slow the growth of our excise tax while preserving the stability of our net asset value since that time and given the change in the regulatory framework in the form of lower asset coverage requirement we believe that fundamental earnings power of our business has increased slightly offset by the decrease in libor over the course of 2018 taken into account our go forward expectations for balance sheet leverage asset level yields and potential for credit losses we believe again with a high degree of confidence that our portfolio will be able to support a higher base dividend as for the 0 50 per share special dividends that our board had just declared those who know us know we ve historically stayed away from paying specials given our focus on building net asset value and our desire to foster a long term shareholder base while our philosophy hasn t changed our consistent over earning of our dividends combined with our expectation of near term capital gains from portfolio realizations will likely result in ric distribution requirement issues that we wanted to proactively address while these special dividends were a tax driven decision all in all all else equal we expect that our return on equity will experience a slight uplift as a result of capital efficiency gains and the reduction in excise tax on our undistributed income and the slight increase in financial leverage since we ve recalibrated our base dividend to correspond with our view of earnings power of the portfolio in the intermediate term we don t expect any ric distribution requirement issues for the foreseeable future for avoidance of doubt there will be no changes to the calculation of our quarterly variable supplemental dividends except to note that the impact of the special dividend will be excluded from the purposes of the nav constraint which ensures that our nav declines by no more than 0 15 per share over the current and preceding quarter pro forma for the impact of the supplemental dividends before passing over to bo to talk about our portfolio activity i d like to quickly highlight the broader market backdrop and its impact on how we think about our business this past year was characterized by periods of volatility a divergence in sector performance and their corresponding credit spreads investor preference for high quality pay growth was driven by a mixed macro backdrop deteriorating underwriting standards and growing concerns around loan downgrades a flight to quality was observable and rising lcd spread deltas between first lien and second lien loans between bb and b credits rated credits in between cyclical and non cyclical industries this trend was particularly notable in the second half of the year it is the peak in november before moderating at year end as shared on our last call given the low cyclical exposure in our portfolio the volatility in credit spread movements throughout the year had a relatively muted impact on the valuation of our portfolio when we took into account industry when we took into industry specific comps for each of our investments looking ahead although we may see volatility related to the u s presidential election and the unfolding economic impact of the coronavirus fundamentally we think the near term u s economy remains in good shape supported by deescalating trade tensions accommodative monetary policy and low inflation however we believe economic cycles do exist as such we will continue to focus on being at the top of the capital structure limiting our exposure at cyclicals and finding strong risk adjusted returns for secondary source of repayment as it relates to our financial policy given the competitive late cycle environment we expect that we will continue to operate below the top end of our targeted leverage range of 0 9 to 1 25 this allows us to preserve our reinvestment option and create higher risk adjusted returns in next market dislocation as a result of our recent efforts on the liability management side which ian will discuss in detail we have ample and diverse funding sources with long dated maturities for our capital needs across market cycles with that i d like to turn the call over to bo who will walk you through our portfolio activity and metrics in more detail robert stanley president thanks josh the competitive environment for direct lending in 2019 continue to be challenging but we re starting to see signs of stabilization compared to record 2018 levels capital raise for middle market direct lending in 2019 was down over 35 and private debt dry powder at year end albeit still elevated at nearly 260 billion was down over 10 from the prior year given this ample dry powder and the credit bifurcation in the broadly syndicated market that josh mentioned one of the main themes over the past few quarters has been the growing market share of direct lenders and large syndicated sponsor financing our decision on whether to pursue a particular opportunistic investment strategy is informed by the risk reward dynamics in that market for us we found that in the current environment the best risk adjusted returns continue to transpire from our sector themes by partnering with sponsors and companies only in situations where we have a differentiated view of the business or the sector or the ability to provide creative solutions for complex situations we ve been able to command better pricing and terms compared to the broadly syndicated markets to give you a flavor of our investment activity over 25 of total commitments this year on a dollar basis were in retail asset based loans that we underwrite based on liquid collateral values instead of enterprise values which tend to fluctuate with market cycles our robust deal activity in retail abl in 2019 is reflective of the particularly challenging year for brick and mortar retailers which saw a record high 9 300 store closings we believe there will be continued there will continue to be disruptions in the traditional retail model and therefore the ongoing need for capital solutions in the space given our platform s relationships and core expertise in retail abl as illustrated by an average gross unlevered irr of 23 fully realized retail abl investments we expect this to continue to be one of our investment themes for the period ahead outside of retail just under 50 of total commitments in 2019 were sponsored transaction within our specialized sector sub themes such as business services and fintech where we believe we have a competitive advantage and where the underlying businesses have attractive revenue characteristics high quality customer bases and strong returns on invested capital overall we had a productive q4 with total commitments of 329 million and total fundings of 289 million across nine new investments and upsizes to four existing investments this quarter we were aging on eight of nine of our new investments which we believe is valuable in our ability to control the loan structuring and monitoring process compared to the record repayment activity of 383 million in q4 of last year this quarter was relatively quiet with 104 million of repayments from one full and six partial investment realizations resulting in net portfolio growth of 185 million for q4 for full year 2019 we generated 1 2 billion of commitments and 1 1 billion of fundings we had total repayments of 575 million for the year resulted in net portfolio growth of 512 million to get a more accurate snapshot of our portfolio s growth trend it s best to look at it over a longer 18 month period given the strong repayment levels we experienced in late 2018 over the last 18 months our portfolio grew by 291 million or a modest 10 on an annualized basis looking at the year over year portfolio trends as the portfolio grew in 2019 we kept our average investment size steady resulting in an improvement in the diversification of our portfolio our top 10 borrower exposure decreased to 33 of portfolio at fair value down from 39 in the prior year similarly our portfolio cyclical exposure which excludes our asset based loans in retail and our reserve and asset based loans in energy decreased from 4 1 to 2 9 of the portfolio year over year on a fair value basis at december 31 our top two industry exposures on a fair value basis were business services at 16 8 and retail and consumer products consisting predominantly of retail asset based loans at 14 9 from a credit statistics standpoint we continued to improve the interest coverage and net leverage profile of our portfolio at year end across our core portfolio companies our average net attachment point was 0 2 times and our average last dollar leverage was 4 2 times compared to 0 4 times and 4 4 times a year ago and the average interest coverage ratio for our core portfolio companies improve from 2 8 times to 3 2 times year over year we had no investments on non accrual status at year end and the overall performance of our portfolio remains steady at 1 15 on our assessment scale of one to five with one being the highest compared to 1 14 in q4 of last year we continue to have limited junior capital exposure with 96 of first lien exposure at year end on the underwriting side we source 99 of our portfolio through non intermediated channels this has supported our ability to structure effective group voting control on 80 of our debt investments and an average two financial covenants per credit agreement it has also supported our ability to structure call protection across our debt portfolio which provides fee income in periods of high portfolio turnover to support our roes as for portfolio year yields at year end the weighted average total yield on our debt and income producing securities at amortized cost was 10 7 compared to 10 8 in the prior quarter breaking down the drivers of this yield movement there was 30 basis points of downward impact from the decrease in the effective libor across our debt investments which was partially offset by 20 basis points of uplift from the yield impact of new versus exited investments the yield at amortized cost on new investments this quarter was 12 3 compared to 12 on exited debt investments with that i d like to turn it over to ian ian simmonds chief financial officer thanks bo as josh and bo mentioned this quarter was strong from both an earnings and originations perspective in q4 we generated net investment income per share of 0 51 which put our 2019 full year net investment income per share at 1 94 at year end we had total investments of 2 2 billion total debt outstanding of 1 1 billion and net assets of 1 1 billion or 16 83 per share which is prior to the impact of the 0 06 per share supplemental dividend that will be paid during q1 given our increased net funding activity this quarter our average debt to equity ratio moved into our revised target leverage range for the first time increasing from 0 86 times in the prior quarter to 0 97 times our average debt to equity ratio for the full year was 0 84 times consistent with our prior year and our leverage at december 31 was 1 times following our inaugural index eligible unsecured notes offering in q4 that we discussed on our november earnings call last month we made further enhancements to our capital structure and liquidity profile by increasing the commitments under our revolving credit facility from 1 245 billion to 1 315 billion and extending the final maturity by approximately a year to january 2025 in addition in january we opportunistically reopened our 2024 notes increasing the total principal amount outstanding from 300 million to 350 million we were able to execute the reopening at a price above par which implied a spread to five year treasuries of 195 basis points 50 basis points tighter than the implied spread on our original transaction this reopening allowed us to increase our unsecured funding mix with negligible impact on our weighted average cost of debt and therefore our roe given our risk management principle of mitigating interest rate risk across our floating rate portfolio we entered into a fixed to floating interest rate swap on the 50 million of new notes consistent with the rest of our fixed rate debt pro forma for the revolver amendment and the use of net proceeds from the notes reopening we had 870 million of undrawn revolver capacity at year end we feel very good about our capital position and the significant amount of liquidity we have to support our reinvestment option in environments where we can generate outsized roes for our shareholders turning to our presentation materials slide 9 is the nav bridge for the quarter walking through the main drivers of this quarter s nav growth we added 0 51 per share from net investment income against the base dividend of 0 39 per share there was a positive 0 04 per share impact from credit spread movement on the valuation of our portfolio and a negative 0 03 per share impact from net unrealized mark to market losses on the interest rate swaps on our fixed rate securities given movements in the forward libor curve other changes in net realized and unrealized gains primarily driven by portfolio specific events contributed a positive 0 07 per share impact to this quarter s nav moving on to our operating results detail on slide 11 total investment income for the fourth quarter was 66 5 million compared to 70 1 million from the previous quarter breaking down the components of income interest and dividend income was 57 6 million up 1 5 million from the previous quarter as a result of the increase in the average size of our debt portfolio other fees which consist of prepayment fees and accelerated amortization of upfront fees from unscheduled paydowns were lower at 1 8 million compared to 11 2 million in q3 given quieter prepayment activity this quarter other income was 7 1 million compared to 2 7 million in the prior quarter net expenses excluding management and incentive fees for the quarter was 16 5 million up from 16 1 million in the prior quarter due to higher interest expense from an increase in the average quarterly debt outstanding our weighted average interest rate on average debt outstanding decreased 24 basis points quarter over quarter primarily from the decrease in the effective libor across our debt instruments given the one quarter timing lag on the libor reset date on our interest rate swaps and the downward movement in libor during q4 we expect a continued tailwind to our weighted average cost of debt in next quarter s results let me take a moment to wrap up on the roes of our business after record repayments at the end of 2018 we steadily rebuilt the portfolio increasing our financial leverage from 0 59 times to 1 times while maintaining a strong return on assets of 12 5 with an average debt to equity ratio that was consistent with the prior year at 0 84 times we generated roe on net investment income of 12 and an roe on net income of 14 5 looking at year over year trends our roe on net investment income decreased from 14 in 2018 mostly resulting from record 2018 repayment levels which corresponded with elevated activity related fees the increase in our roe on net income from 11 6 in the prior year to 14 5 was partially driven by an increase in portfolio valuations resulting from a reversal of the q4 2018 credit spread widening it was also driven by net unrealized gains related to certain portfolio investments and net unrealized gains on our interest rate swaps resulting from changes in the shape of the forward libor curve i d like to quickly flag that as per our adoption of recent hedge accounting guidance we ve applied hedge accounting treatment to our 2024 unsecured notes and the related interest rate swaps as a result changes in the fair value of this particular interest rate swap will be offset by changes in the carrying value of the 2024 notes there will be no unrealized gains or losses recognized in our income statement related to this hedging relationship and therefore changes in the fair value of the swap will not impact our roe on net income going forward as we look ahead to full year 2020 based on our expectations over the intermediate term for our net asset level yields cost of funds and financial leverage we expect to target a return on equity of 11 to 12 based on our pro forma year end book value per share of 16 77 which includes the impact of the q4 supplemental dividend this corresponds to a range of 1 84 to 2 01 for full year 2020 net investment income per share with that i d like to turn it back to josh for concluding remarks joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi thank you ian our fourth quarter results supported another year of strong roes for our shareholders for the year ahead our objective continues to be generating attractive risk adjusted returns for our shareholders for our direct origination strategy the differentiated human capital expertise across our platform and capital allocation decisions that serve in the best long term interest of our stakeholders before moving to q a i d like to address the pending topic regarding our broader tpg sixth street partners investment platforms relationship with tpg holdings our sixth street business was started in 2009 as a strategic partnership with tpg sixth street currently manages 33 billion across the platform with over 250 people and nine global offices in the past 10 years our sixth street business and tpg have each grown and evolved thoughtfully and in productive ways likewise so has a relationship with tpg my partners and i at sixth street have been having a series of discussions with tpg about the next step in the evolution of our relationship including the option of operating the independent organizations with tpg continuing to maintain a minority stake in the sixth street business given sixth street scale sector expertise market presence and the fact that we have already been operating autonomously a potential next phase as an independent organization is going to be business as usual for tslx there would be no changes to the dedicated management personnel of our business and our shareholders will continue to benefit from the same sourcing underwriting and operational capabilities of the platform they have experienced with tslx since inception as of today no formal agreement has been finalized and there s no guarantee that one will be reached in either case or we business as usual for us those who know us know that our northstar has always had make decisions in the best interest of our shareholders with that i d like to thank you your continued interest and for your time today operator please open up the line for questions questions and answers operator our first question comes from rick shane with j p morgan your line is open richard shane j p morgan analyst hey guys thanks for taking my questions this morning josh you partially addressed my first question in your final comments related to the separation of sixth street from tpg but i am curious do you think one of the things that has worked well at tslx over the years is good response to incentives do you think your incentives are going to change as you separate from tpg joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi no hey rick thanks for the question i think we re both on the same time schedule which is pretty early in the morning so excuse me i m down with a little bit of the cold look we tend to remain exactly the same all the team s economic group based in the sixth street business and the focus of the team has always been able to create long term value for both our private lps and our public shareholders and we effectively had very limited economics coming from the activities across the firm so i think the incentives remain exactly the same and actually probably a little bit stronger on a go forward basis if we come to a conclusion that we re going to operate as an independent entities but it s basically business as usual and the focus was again has always been you take care of your shareholder you take care of your private lp everything else kind of falls in place focus on your client focus on your customer richard shane j p morgan analyst got it thank you for that and then sort of on a more portfolio related question when we look at the portfolio on a year over year basis of the top 10 investments today for our new investments two of those being abls which typically are shorter have a shorter time on the balance sheet is that the type of rotation that we should continue to expect on an ongoing basis and the reason i asked that is that as you as the company continues to scale do you expect to do slightly larger transactions and drive higher rotation of that top 10 joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi yeah those are very good questions so let me break it down i think there has been a and part of our late cycle focus has always been that you can manage being the late cycle in our mind kind of four different ways one is move up the capital structure the second is being defensive industries where you have sources of repayment that are not related to the economic cycle the third is to create more diversity in your portfolio and the fourth is to have run lower balance sheet leverage so i think the we ve created year over year a lot more diversity in our top 10 investments and you ll also see things that have less correlation to the economic cycle and that could be things that have strong secondary sources of repayment from asset values that are not related to the economic cycle or shorter duration investments so i think that will be continued theme for us on managing how we think about the how we think about beating the late cycle so i don t know if i answered your question i hope i did richard shane j p morgan analyst no you did i mean i think i would have in some ways expected greater concentration of new investments in the top 10 typically that sort of ratchets up over time but i was in part curious if it was not increasing is a function of that sort of late cycle defense more defensive approach joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi that is correct richard shane j p morgan analyst great that s it for me thank you guys joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi great thank you operator our next question comes from fin o shea with wells fargo your line is open finian o shea wells fargo securities analyst hi good morning thanks for taking my question just a couple on portfolio names i ll start with a small investment avidxchange which was recapitalized this quarter you re in the debt equity now but can you give context on how this fits into your platform structure there was a post quarter announcement that you had a funding round i don t know if that news was in january i don t know if that was this same deal but i m mainly asking in the purpose of is this a name that sort of migrates to your from the debt platform to the capital solutions strategy joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi yeah hey fin let me start off first with the industry and then i ll put i ll turn it over to bo to talk about the investment so avidxchange we ve been around i guess probably for four or five years it fits squarely in our theme of b2b payments and payment ecosystems so it provides it s a company that has a ecosystem that provides payments across that ecosystem mostly in property management in the property management sector so it fits squarely in our theme the business has continued to grow significantly it has it continues to reinvest and grow at a significant rate the latest investment we did quite frankly was had a larger suite had a larger structured equity investment and so we de risked because it was less appropriate to fit inside the that tslx platform and in that series of transactions where they raised junior equity to our structured equity they also redeemed us out of our original equity investment i ll turn it over to bo if i missed anything robert stanley president no i think you touched on everything this has been a long term relationship and part of the theme that we ve been pursuing over the last five years and the numbers of the b2b payments you picked up the announcement of the there was a junior capital raise a series upraise of 125 million in late december in addition to our debt and our prep solution so that s what was picked up in the press finian o shea wells fargo securities analyst okay thanks for the context on that and so some a question on forever 21 being an abl that s a very rich spread you attained and i think as we speak it might have been paid off given the acquisition of the brand by strategics but can you give us context on was that can we not see an abl spread these days how much of that was for just the short amount of time you would hold it or the risk of going probably a deep stretch second lien abl for example joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi yeah so a great question and forever 21 i would say at this point 97 98 resolved but i ll walk through it so first of all you can t beat irr and people don t understand when i say that but look if you hold if you have a 30 irr and you hold for a day you really have no mom to compensate you for risk to the downside so the spread was to compensate for a minimum return given that we were actually allocating real capital to the situation it was a dip financing and where our thesis was you had asset value in the brand you had two core real estate warehouses in the center of l a that we thought were very very valuable and that we had a real view on and then you had the inventory what i would say is forever 21 is pretty well noted in the press had a very very rocky december as of december 31 we actually had kept our mark basically consistent with our with the cost basis versus what you would have expected you would have expected it to migrate up to the effectively the coal price or coal plus the access fee that would obviously that we will get our active fee and we would get all of our economics and in retrospect that mark was very conservative but it was a very difficult december for the company but look our thesis was it was a little bit too big to fail it was one of they biggest rent payers in the mall ecosystem i think calvin centers was 2 5 or 2 2 5 of the rents and so it was a little bit too big to fail that it had a real brand name and then it had real underlying asset value in the form of inventory and real estate as of yesterday with the proceeds we have about 9 million outstanding against a real estate property that s basically under contract for i think 19 5 million so again it s basically revolved but december was it was we had a very conservative mark and again it goes to the expertise of our platform of understanding component parts of underlying asset values of these companies finian o shea wells fargo securities analyst okay got it that s all for me thanks so much operator thank you our next question comes from mickey schleien with ladenburg your line is open mickey schleien ladenburg thalmann analyst yes good morning everyone and josh thanks for getting up early and battling through your cold i wanted to ask a high level question to what extent do you believe the volatility in the more liquid loan markets may benefit your direct lending platform going forward given that we re hearing more and more borrowers are migrating away from bsl toward direct lending joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi yeah so it s a great question mickey look i think that i would start up and saying that there s been some volatility in the broadly syndicated market that the broadly syndicated markets have been really differentiated by the have and have not that s kind of diverse course so the correlations will no longer won across credit spreads that s reversed course a little bit and there s the correlations are getting tighter my deep overall concern is that for the industry is that given where the industry sits on the cost curve i e when you look at our base management fees and our incentive fees that we better be a little careful or better be a lot careful of being a pure substitute to the broadly syndicated market where people can access the broadly syndicated market at 50 basis 25 basis points to 50 basis points through a closed end fund or a clo structure and us effectively creating the same risk return and because we sit so much higher on the cost curve this has actually been a theme for me mickey that you and i have discussed probably now over five or six years which was my problem with ticc which was they basically brought broadly syndicate loans and brought other people s clo equity and didn t manufacture their own and so where they sat on the cost curve they were basically taking 1 and destroying the 1 of providing something we less than 1 value to the shareholders given where they sat on the cost curve so my hope is that if the industry will see volatility as a way to create solutions and certainty and get paid for that providing that certainty to issuers if the industry is effectively substituting and providing the same risk reward at higher on the cost curve the industry is going to be in deep trouble mickey schleien ladenburg thalmann analyst i understand and i thank you for that color that s really helpful josh your firm is well known for doing deep dives on a sector basis and obviously with some particular specialties i m curious to understand what you re thinking in terms of the alternative energy sector we get everybody talks about oil and gas and how to favor it is but there s a flip side obviously as to what s going to replace that so are there borrowers in that space that are of the right size with the right balance sheets and cash flow profiles that are starting to look interesting to you joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi yeah so good question so as you i think you re exactly right i think there s going to be quite frankly given the disruption in energy and how much capital has been destroyed and upstream e p and quite frankly the demand probably for traditional carbon products going down there s going to be opportunity for people who have deep knowledge on where asset is in the cost curve what their decline is what the unit economics are there s going to be opportunity given the lack of capital of the industry the energy industry will attract over time for people who are net debt return as it relates to the alternative energy space the answer is we actually have a very we have a great team sitting in new york focused on all energy and infrastructure project run on energy they typically fit better in a private fund format because they typically were typically buying assets or cash flow from assets versus winding the corporate borrowers and so we ve done a lot of stuff in renewables in spain and italy where the take or pay contracts and so they typically have not hit the typical corporate loan that is required under the 40 act of the good asset and they ve typically taken another form which is buying street the cash flows or buying asset with little or no merchant risk that being said we have the expertise and so if a corporate loan does pop up that will be a great opportunity for us but your entities again are i think are right i think generally the energy space is a little bit of a mess start back in 2015 i guess but it s continued most forward and it s structured enough people got the decline goes wrong demand for overall carbon products going down the equity markets and the high yield markets and then you have emerging disruptive technologies in all synergy and so i think over a period of time that it can be a unique spot for us to take the expertise of our platform and create value that being said we have you have some commodity price risk and so we re going to be very careful when we do that mickey schleien ladenburg thalmann analyst thank you for that and if i could just finish with a couple of sort of housekeeping questions just to gauge risk in the portfolio can you give us a sense of what the portfolios average debt to ebitda ratio is joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi yeah i think bo covered in the prepared remarks i think it s gone down year over year so our last dollar on average our last dollar attachment point is 4 2 times that compares to that on average last year of 4 5 times on an interest coverage basis it s i think also got better that s effectively and i m giving exact numbers i think it was 3 2 this year compared to 2 8 last year i mean and some of that quite frankly is earnings growth a mix between earnings growth and that continues to be having a comment at that mickey schleien ladenburg thalmann analyst okay and lastly maybe for ian just at a high level ian on a portfolio company basis what were the main drivers of the realized loss and the unrealized gains this quarter ian simmonds chief financial officer on the unrealized there s no major driver it s i don t want to describe as cats and dogs but there s probably about 12 names that contribute to that overall so nothing specific stands out there s a small realized gain on a liquid name that we have but it s less than 0 05 there s really nothing major to highlight joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi yeah i mean look i think curriculum which i think has publicly announced that got refinanced in q1 so the remarkable update basically up to the call price that was 0 02 but there was nothing that will contribute more than 0 02 on a single basis right mickey schleien ladenburg thalmann analyst and that s also the case with the realized loss joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi yeah mickey schleien ladenburg thalmann analyst okay that s great that s all for me this morning i appreciate your time thank you very much joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi great thanks mickey ian simmonds chief financial officer thanks mickey operator our next question comes from chris york with jmp securities your line is open christopher york jmp securities analyst good morning guys and thanks for taking my questions this one may be for ian so other income was a record this quarter can you breakdown some of the drivers there whether that was led by higher structuring or syndication fees joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi yeah so we actually didn t have any syndication fees in the quarter chris and i ll just give you a little bit of context if you look at our call it an activity basis fee so accelerated oid from prepayments which there wasn t that much of this quarter and obviously we didn t have that many prepayments in general if you look at that plus syndication fees which was zero and then our other income collectively those items were 0 14 per share for the quarter if i look at what those items collectively have been over the last four years the average has also been 0 14 per share so in aggregate we re basically the same as what we ve experienced historically in the other income items this particular quarter it was really driven by an amendment that i think was known to the market with ferrellgas and then we had a couple of other items that were we re calling them work fees because they involved some service and input on our part that drove that other income line christopher york jmp securities analyst very helpful i noticed that you did put in the k that it was an amendment fee so how much was that amendment fee specifically in the fourth quarter joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi look ferrell is a publicly traded company i don t want to get into details i think the total other income is dollar wise ian simmonds chief financial officer 7 million joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi 7 million and farrell was a own pay it was a smallest piece of that so but people should look at the farrell k or their public reporting and what they disclosed christopher york jmp securities analyst got it okay and then in your prepared remarks you said that some of your decision to issue a special dividend this year was driven by expected gains i think in maybe the first half of this year does that include ferrellgas or curriculum or what are the specific drivers there joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi let s take a if we take a step back and i mean it turns a little ian is the greatest tax person but i do kind of play on every once a while we had about 1 60 per share in undistributed income and we barely made and by the way this is all manageable but our tax year ends in march and we were basically only had about 1 8 million or 2 million of room against the minimum distribution requirement of 0 90 we got 90 and so for us and again that could have been that s all solvable and would have been solved but if you look forward at where our base is and where our kind of recurring special no we don t call special ian simmonds chief financial officer supplemental joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi supplemental dividends are through the year effectively on an accrual basis in q1 we would have been out of compliance with the minimum distribution requirements now we have until march 20 march 21 to solve that but on an accrual basis we would no longer be and that s a function of both net investment income and cap gains and so that played a big part of it which is we knew we are going to have to make a large special dividend by march 2021 it was known we are in an effective accrual basis we would have been out of compliance in q1 we barely made it in q for this tax year so that s one piece of it the second piece of it is that the excise tax was continuing to grow and continuing to burden shareholder returns and was just a pure friction cost and so we were able to minimize we basically are reducing that by a third on a pro forma basis and that will grow again quite frankly but we re reducing that by a third and so and then the third piece of it was that there is capital efficiency in that we re saving we re effectively reducing our equity and that has a associated cost of capital and borrowing which has a associated cost of capital that s a lot and so when you put all those three things together which is we knew we were going to have to be in compliance on a ric basis in 2021 we knew we weren t going to be in compliance in 2021 that this is actually on a net income basis accretive because you re saving the excise tax you re saving a little bit of management fee given that you go into the break which has been reduced by interest expense and reduced by a little bit of infinity but it s positive about 0 01 a share on a net income basis given the excise tax and you re generating higher roes it seems like although it was not consistent with the past actions the fact that circumstances have changed christopher york jmp securities analyst color is extremely helpful and josh you played the role well as a ric expert ian simmonds chief financial officer the only thing i would add chris and we read your report that came out last night and you referenced the growth in undistributed income year over year and i think that was actually pretty good as a way to think about one of the inputs into how we sized the special dividend so this time last year our undistributed income was we estimated at about 1 22 top for the year we re now at 1 60 so there s 0 38 of growth over that period so that was one of the inputs into how we size that josh referenced the potential to save say excise tax which is important to us because that s loss to the system and then we re also very focused on preserving nav and so the other way we thought about sizing especially we looked at a year on year growth that we had achieved through operating results in 2019 we backed off the impact of the swaps with the tailwind that we got from mark to market movements in the swaps so that s sort of triangulated to 0 50 special dividend that s what we re thinking behind it as we had discussions with the public christopher york jmp securities analyst sure it makes a lot of sense i was just trying to i mean when i was looking at undistributed income growth the comments you had in the prepared remarks were just what i was focused on so i ll switch gears the last one was on your potential separation agreement so i think investors had generally thought the bdc and then tssp had received some halo benefits from its association with tpg so given the recent change at the advisor with tpg why would it be wrong for investors to think either the informational advantages or maybe even the future capital raising with lps seem to be consolidating relationships could be impacted going forward joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi yeah look i mean i think if there was a halo benefit if you look back nine years ago today the tssp platform is 33 billion of aum these conversations we had conversations obviously with our private lps they ve known about the changing relationship over the last nine years when we started the business there was 10 people today there s 250 people we ve built out industry expertise we haven t relied on the firm for any informational advantages for years so i don t again i think it s business as usual that cap again i would say that nothing is done but it was in the press and surely that our revolver lenders the minimum was done post to being in press the revolving lenders didn t care our cost of capital and change we did a tap on the bond deal our cost of capital didn t change quite frankly went down and so it is and it s been very well known in both the lp market and i think with our shareholders this has really been a jv controlled by the tssp class 3 partners and manage nobody s ever done our investment committee nobody s ever referred the deal to us in the bdc and so it is really the business as usual christopher york jmp securities analyst that s a good answer and obviously your comments on the debt capital mitigate our concerns there so good perspective last one just following up on that so i know the fee was very nominal but and the separation agreement is pending right now but will there be a suspension of the licensing fee to tpg for the use of your name would that expire joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi yeah so there is look again there is no there hasn t been any actual fee related to the tpg specialty lending so and that either the management company has paid or the shareholders have paid obviously on a go forward basis i think to be determined but quite frankly it s really sixth street partners branded business sixth street partners managed business and again there hasn t been a deal we haven t come to a deal with all that reflects christopher york jmp securities analyst got it that s it for me thanks guys operator thank you our next question comes from kenneth lee with rbc capital your line is open kenneth lee rbc capital markets llc analyst hi thanks for taking my question wondering if you could talk about the key factors driving the you mentioned an increase in the potential earnings power that is supporting the increase in the base quarterly dividends this year and how much of that would be dependent on any movement within the libor rates thanks joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi yeah it s s a good question so first of all let s take a step back i don t think the increase in the dividend from 0 39 to 0 41 is more of a resetting what the dividend should have been years back i think on a last year in supplemental dividends we paid out 0 19 and so there was and by the way and we grew nav even though we paid out 0 19 and so if you divide do simple math 19x4 that s what 0 47 0 46 a quarter rather than 0 39 and so the business last year which was slightly a little bit of a higher libor environment would have supported with still growing nav a basically a dividend around 0 44 to 0 45 per share ian simmonds chief financial officer with still over earning supplemental joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi with growing nav so i it s more a function of that the dividend was undersized for years and years and years and then there was a change in the asset coverage ratio which would allow for greater financial leverage which obviously boosted roes and so it s the combination of those two things when we look at the when we look at our ability to earn the dividend or even our ability to earn the dividend with coverage which is how we think about it we take the dividend as a cash liability we don t look at spot libor today we look at the forward libor curve that will be a headwind but the earnings as a business we ve already massively over earning the dividend and so even if you walk forward a year or two years out and look at the spot libor curve you still feel very good about the newly sized dividend for the existing power of the business kenneth lee rbc capital markets llc analyst got you that s very helpful just one follow up if i may you mentioned within your prepared remarks seeing a slight uplift in asset yields on new investments wondering if you could just elaborate what s driving the uplift in yields despite the movement in libor rates in the quarter thanks joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi yeah look i think it s pretty idiosyncratic quarter to quarter things bump around so what i would say is the overall trend of the industry continues to remain super competitive i mean i think yields on new investments were 12 3 in q4 a large function of that was little over 21 in q3 was 10 4 and q2 was 11 4 and q1 was 10 7 and so again i think it s idiosyncratic the industry continues to be very very competitive but my hope is that the industry is going to start trying to take spread back as libor falls and realize that they need to provide an acceptable return given where we ve seen the cost structure to shareholders kenneth lee rbc capital markets llc analyst understand very helpful thank you operator thank you our next question comes from robert dodd with raymond james your line is open robert dodd raymond james analyst hi guys good morning and thought was exactly the point you just made josh in terms of the industry the hope maybe the industry will try and take spread back for lack of a better term is you intend to kind of put a stake in the ground on spread on your front because right now it looks like the industry really isn t doing that forward curve is down spreads don t really seem to be widening and that broader markets are still tightening so i mean any color you can give us on your willingness to hold that ground if everybody else loses their minds around you if you will joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi yeah look we re willing to give up growth for the manager and for the platform to protect shareholder economics and the again it has to work for shareholders and have to work for private lps the watch out is that i think people are ignoring the forward libor curve either they re ignoring it or they re making a bet against the forward libor curve overall the industry earnings power if they don t take back spread is going to go down absent massive changes of leverage given the forward libor curve that compounded with a lot of people fix their funding costs and so that s going to compound the issue and so you can t manage the business here in the moment you ve got to manage the business and look at your cost of capital and look at shareholders expectations and what the market is telling you about interest rates and your cost of funding and quite frankly we re positioned much better because we have we have libor floors and floating rate libor floor in our assets and floating rate liabilities and so at some point if you continue to see libor drift below our floors we ll have net interest margin expansion but i think the watch up for the industry is people better people should start thinking about that forward libor curve and thinking about what that means for their economic reality and overlay that into what their funding mix looks like robert dodd raymond james analyst got it i appreciate that josh one more if i can on the abl side obviously you ve got a ton of experience the abl brick and mortar problem has been going on a while you ve gotten great returns out of that one of the newer areas of softness if you will i think is in grocery food retail things like that where i think people thought grocery stores were more defensive against some of the brick and mortar retail trends and that s not working out can you give us any color on your appetite do those kind of deals given a perishable versus non perishable collateral if that changes the dynamic so if you d be willing to look at those kind of deals joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi yeah so look you re exactly right it s a very good point so we did great american and pacific tea company back in 2014 which was a grocery store deal and there are packing considerations typically don t impact grocery but there are packing consideration there are also the perishable and so you have to be much more conservative and be much more constructive in your borrowing base and how that works right now we have to save a lot but that has some of those similar dynamics but well i think people never realize about the grocery segment was it was much it was levered to inflation given the large fixed cost structure and so i think people that inflation would come in and when you have a fixed cost structure that s good you ve had deflation and you ve had a lot of disruptive competition and so there will be some opportunities but i think we ll be very careful robert dodd raymond james analyst i appreciate it thank you operator thank you our next question comes from ryan lynch with kbw your line is open ryan lynch keefe bruyette woods analyst hey good morning thanks for taking my questions just have a couple remaining as part of at least from my understanding as part of the partnership engine between tpg and sixth street from my understanding you guys are not able each of the parties are not able to start up competing businesses or overlapping strategies for one year but then after that you are free to do such just curious has sixth street thought about once that one year clock period lapses that you guys will look to pursue other strategies besides credit joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi yeah thanks ryan again there s been no agreement reached and so i know there s been stuff reported out there i think it s a little bit premature i think your construct is probably roughly right i don t think this decision was driven by the desire to for either part to expand into white space that belongs to the other party and so i think this decision if it does come to fruition it was just about the natural evolution and that people will have their own relationships with lps and people were managing their own separate businesses and there were synergies that existed any longer given the evolution of both businesses so i think your concept is roughly right although no agreement has been reached i would also say that that wasn t the primary factor of this process ryan lynch keefe bruyette woods analyst okay that makes sense and then i wanted to follow up on your response to chris question regarding the dividend and the special dividend payment i think you mentioned three reasons one of the reasons were for paying a special dividend is that you guys were potentially going to bump up to some of these ric payout requirements in 2021 you also mentioned that you don t love paying special dividends so i m curious as you guys still kept the supplemental dividend policy at a 50 payout ratio it feels like you guys could run into the same issue again a year or two from now as you guys have put up really strong results so is there any consideration to increasing the supplemental payout ratio to something higher like 75 or 100 to avoid these special dividends which you guys said you don t really love paying joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi yeah were you at the board meeting by the way i mean yeah you hit it on the head which was look we re going to have a ric problem even if we had running the supplemental at 75 we re at 100 quite frankly because how the supplemental was calculated was based on nii and did it pick up realized cap gains and so we were going to have the ric issue no matter what and quite frankly on an accrual basis although you had until 2021 to solve that you were going to have it effectively in q1 this year so we did think about the other levers increasing it to 75 that s on the table quite frankly if the business continues to perform we ll have this issue again the excise tax kills me because it s pure friction and so those things will continue to be on the table as we go forward but quite frankly it was a combination of the size of the special not if you could if you needed to do the special the percentage of the supplemental and the base dividend and what we did was we hit two of the three we want to continue to build nav and so we didn t change the percentage but we hit two of the three levers ryan lynch keefe bruyette woods analyst okay that makes sense those are all my questions i appreciate the time today and really nice quarter guys joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi great thanks ryan operator thank you and i m currently showing no further questions at this time i d like to turn the call back over to joshua easterly for closing

full year december 31 2019 as a reminder this call is being recorded for replay purposes i will now turn the call over to joshua easterly chief executive officer of tpg specialty lending inc joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi thank you good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today let me start off by reviewing our full year and fourth quarter 2019 highlights and then i ll hand it off to my partner and our president bo stanley to discuss our portfolio activity and metrics our cfo ian simmonds will review our financial results in more detail and i will conclude with final thoughts before opening the call to q a after the market closed yesterday we reported fourth quarter net investment income per share of 0 51 and net income per share of 0 57 this result this resulted in full year net investment income per share of 1 94 which corresponds to a return of equity of 12 the full year net income per share of 2 34 which corresponds to a return on equity of 14 5 supported by the earnings power of our portfolio we generated earnings in excess of our base dividend more on this in a moment the difference between this quarter s net investment income and net income per share was primarily driven by unrealized gains from both the impact of net tightening credit spreads on the valuation of our portfolio and portfolio company specific events at year end our reported net asset value per share reached another high record of 16 83 compared to 16 72 and the prior quarter and 16 25 at year end 2018 yesterday our board approved a 5 increase to our quarterly base dividend from 0 39 to 0 41 per share to shareholders of record as of march 30 payable on april 15 our board also declared a q4 supplemental dividend of 0 06 per share to shareholders of record as of february 28 payable on march 31 finally our board declared aggregate special cash dividends of 0 50 per share that will be paid to shareholders during q2 statistically 0 25 per share will be payable on april 30 to shareholders of record as of april 15 and 0 25 per share will be payable on june 30 to shareholders of record as of june 15 there s been a couple of changes to our dividend policy this quarter so let me take a few moments to discuss these in detail starting with the increase in our base dividend as we said many times in the past we view our base dividend as an ongoing cash liability and therefore we set it at a level that we believe with the high degree of confidence will be supported by the earnings power of our portfolio this is evidenced by our track record of strong base dividend coverage to net investment income which through the end of 2019 has averaged 127 since our march 2014 ipo nearly three years ago in may 2017 we introduced a variable supplemental dividend framework as a way enhanced cash distributions to our shareholders and slow the growth of our excise tax while preserving the stability of our net asset value since that time and given the change in the regulatory framework in the form of lower asset coverage requirement we believe that fundamental earnings power of our business has increased slightly offset by the decrease in libor over the course of 2018 taken into account our go forward expectations for balance sheet leverage asset level yields and potential for credit losses we believe again with a high degree of confidence that our portfolio will be able to support a higher base dividend as for the 0 50 per share special dividends that our board had just declared those who know us know we ve historically stayed away from paying specials given our focus on building net asset value and our desire to foster a long term shareholder base while our philosophy hasn t changed our consistent over earning of our dividends combined with our expectation of near term capital gains from portfolio realizations will likely result in ric distribution requirement issues that we wanted to proactively address while these special dividends were a tax driven decision all in all all else equal we expect that our return on equity will experience a slight uplift as a result of capital efficiency gains and the reduction in excise tax on our undistributed income and the slight increase in financial leverage since we ve recalibrated our base dividend to correspond with our view of earnings power of the portfolio in the intermediate term we don t expect any ric distribution requirement issues for the foreseeable future for avoidance of doubt there will be no changes to the calculation of our quarterly variable supplemental dividends except to note that the impact of the special dividend will be excluded from the purposes of the nav constraint which ensures that our nav declines by no more than 0 15 per share over the current and preceding quarter pro forma for the impact of the supplemental dividends before passing over to bo to talk about our portfolio activity i d like to quickly highlight the broader market backdrop and its impact on how we think about our business this past year was characterized by periods of volatility a divergence in sector performance and their corresponding credit spreads investor preference for high quality pay growth was driven by a mixed macro backdrop deteriorating underwriting standards and growing concerns around loan downgrades a flight to quality was observable and rising lcd spread deltas between first lien and second lien loans between bb and b credits rated credits in between cyclical and non cyclical industries this trend was particularly notable in the second half of the year it is the peak in november before moderating at year end as shared on our last call given the low cyclical exposure in our portfolio the volatility in credit spread movements throughout the year had a relatively muted impact on the valuation of our portfolio when we took into account industry when we took into industry specific comps for each of our investments looking ahead although we may see volatility related to the u s presidential election and the unfolding economic impact of the coronavirus fundamentally we think the near term u s economy remains in good shape supported by deescalating trade tensions accommodative monetary policy and low inflation however we believe economic cycles do exist as such we will continue to focus on being at the top of the capital structure limiting our exposure at cyclicals and finding strong risk adjusted returns for secondary source of repayment as it relates to our financial policy given the competitive late cycle environment we expect that we will continue to operate below the top end of our targeted leverage range of 0 9 to 1 25 this allows us to preserve our reinvestment option and create higher risk adjusted returns in next market dislocation as a result of our recent efforts on the liability management side which ian will discuss in detail we have ample and diverse funding sources with long dated maturities for our capital needs across market cycles with that i d like to turn the call over to bo who will walk you through our portfolio activity and metrics in more detail robert stanley president thanks josh the competitive environment for direct lending in 2019 continue to be challenging but we re starting to see signs of stabilization compared to record 2018 levels capital raise for middle market direct lending in 2019 was down over 35 and private debt dry powder at year end albeit still elevated at nearly 260 billion was down over 10 from the prior year given this ample dry powder and the credit bifurcation in the broadly syndicated market that josh mentioned one of the main themes over the past few quarters has been the growing market share of direct lenders and large syndicated sponsor financing our decision on whether to pursue a particular opportunistic investment strategy is informed by the risk reward dynamics in that market for us we found that in the current environment the best risk adjusted returns continue to transpire from our sector themes by partnering with sponsors and companies only in situations where we have a differentiated view of the business or the sector or the ability to provide creative solutions for complex situations we ve been able to command better pricing and terms compared to the broadly syndicated markets to give you a flavor of our investment activity over 25 of total commitments this year on a dollar basis were in retail asset based loans that we underwrite based on liquid collateral values instead of enterprise values which tend to fluctuate with market cycles our robust deal activity in retail abl in 2019 is reflective of the particularly challenging year for brick and mortar retailers which saw a record high 9 300 store closings we believe there will be continued there will continue to be disruptions in the traditional retail model and therefore the ongoing need for capital solutions in the space given our platform s relationships and core expertise in retail abl as illustrated by an average gross unlevered irr of 23 fully realized retail abl investments we expect this to continue to be one of our investment themes for the period ahead outside of retail just under 50 of total commitments in 2019 were sponsored transaction within our specialized sector sub themes such as business services and fintech where we believe we have a competitive advantage and where the underlying businesses have attractive revenue characteristics high quality customer bases and strong returns on invested capital overall we had a productive q4 with total commitments of 329 million and total fundings of 289 million across nine new investments and upsizes to four existing investments this quarter we were aging on eight of nine of our new investments which we believe is valuable in our ability to control the loan structuring and monitoring process compared to the record repayment activity of 383 million in q4 of last year this quarter was relatively quiet with 104 million of repayments from one full and six partial investment realizations resulting in net portfolio growth of 185 million for q4 for full year 2019 we generated 1 2 billion of commitments and 1 1 billion of fundings we had total repayments of 575 million for the year resulted in net portfolio growth of 512 million to get a more accurate snapshot of our portfolio s growth trend it s best to look at it over a longer 18 month period given the strong repayment levels we experienced in late 2018 over the last 18 months our portfolio grew by 291 million or a modest 10 on an annualized basis looking at the year over year portfolio trends as the portfolio grew in 2019 we kept our average investment size steady resulting in an improvement in the diversification of our portfolio our top 10 borrower exposure decreased to 33 of portfolio at fair value down from 39 in the prior year similarly our portfolio cyclical exposure which excludes our asset based loans in retail and our reserve and asset based loans in energy decreased from 4 1 to 2 9 of the portfolio year over year on a fair value basis at december 31 our top two industry exposures on a fair value basis were business services at 16 8 and retail and consumer products consisting predominantly of retail asset based loans at 14 9 from a credit statistics standpoint we continued to improve the interest coverage and net leverage profile of our portfolio at year end across our core portfolio companies our average net attachment point was 0 2 times and our average last dollar leverage was 4 2 times compared to 0 4 times and 4 4 times a year ago and the average interest coverage ratio for our core portfolio companies improve from 2 8 times to 3 2 times year over year we had no investments on non accrual status at year end and the overall performance of our portfolio remains steady at 1 15 on our assessment scale of one to five with one being the highest compared to 1 14 in q4 of last year we continue to have limited junior capital exposure with 96 of first lien exposure at year end on the underwriting side we source 99 of our portfolio through non intermediated channels this has supported our ability to structure effective group voting control on 80 of our debt investments and an average two financial covenants per credit agreement it has also supported our ability to structure call protection across our debt portfolio which provides fee income in periods of high portfolio turnover to support our roes as for portfolio year yields at year end the weighted average total yield on our debt and income producing securities at amortized cost was 10 7 compared to 10 8 in the prior quarter breaking down the drivers of this yield movement there was 30 basis points of downward impact from the decrease in the effective libor across our debt investments which was partially offset by 20 basis points of uplift from the yield impact of new versus exited investments the yield at amortized cost on new investments this quarter was 12 3 compared to 12 on exited debt investments with that i d like to turn it over to ian ian simmonds chief financial officer thanks bo as josh and bo mentioned this quarter was strong from both an earnings and originations perspective in q4 we generated net investment income per share of 0 51 which put our 2019 full year net investment income per share at 1 94 at year end we had total investments of 2 2 billion total debt outstanding of 1 1 billion and net assets of 1 1 billion or 16 83 per share which is prior to the impact of the 0 06 per share supplemental dividend that will be paid during q1 given our increased net funding activity this quarter our average debt to equity ratio moved into our revised target leverage range for the first time increasing from 0 86 times in the prior quarter to 0 97 times our average debt to equity ratio for the full year was 0 84 times consistent with our prior year and our leverage at december 31 was 1 times following our inaugural index eligible unsecured notes offering in q4 that we discussed on our novemberearnings call last month we made further enhancements to our capital structure and liquidity profile by increasing the commitments under our revolving credit facility from 1 245 billion to 1 315 billion and extending the final maturity by approximately a year to january 2025 in addition in january we opportunistically reopened our 2024 notes increasing the total principal amount outstanding from 300 million to 350 million we were able to execute the reopening at a price above par which implied a spread to five year treasuries of 195 basis points 50 basis points tighter than the implied spread on our original transaction this reopening allowed us to increase our unsecured funding mix with negligible impact on our weighted average cost of debt and therefore our roe given our risk management principle of mitigating interest rate risk across our floating rate portfolio we entered into a fixed to floating interest rate swap on the 50 million of new notes consistent with the rest of our fixed rate debt pro forma for the revolver amendment and the use of net proceeds from the notes reopening we had 870 million of undrawn revolver capacity at year end we feel very good about our capital position and the significant amount of liquidity we have to support our reinvestment option in environments where we can generate outsized roes for our shareholders turning to our presentation materials slide 9 is the nav bridge for the quarter walking through the main drivers of this quarter s nav growth we added 0 51 per share from net investment income against the base dividend of 0 39 per share there was a positive 0 04 per share impact from credit spread movement on the valuation of our portfolio and a negative 0 03 per share impact from net unrealized mark to market losses on the interest rate swaps on our fixed rate securities given movements in the forward libor curve other changes in net realized and unrealized gains primarily driven by portfolio specific events contributed a positive 0 07 per share impact to this quarter s nav moving on to our operating results detail on slide 11 total investment income for the fourth quarter was 66 5 million compared to 70 1 million from the previous quarter breaking down the components of income interest and dividend income was 57 6 million up 1 5 million from the previous quarter as a result of the increase in the average size of our debt portfolio other fees which consist of prepayment fees and accelerated amortization of upfront fees from unscheduled paydowns were lower at 1 8 million compared to 11 2 million in q3 given quieter prepayment activity this quarter other income was 7 1 million compared to 2 7 million in the prior quarter net expenses excluding management and incentive fees for the quarter was 16 5 million up from 16 1 million in the prior quarter due to higher interest expense from an increase in the average quarterly debt outstanding our weighted average interest rate on average debt outstanding decreased 24 basis points quarter over quarter primarily from the decrease in the effective libor across our debt instruments given the one quarter timing lag on the libor reset date on our interest rate swaps and the downward movement in libor during q4 we expect a continued tailwind to our weighted average cost of debt in next quarter s results let me take a moment to wrap up on the roes of our business after record repayments at the end of 2018 we steadily rebuilt the portfolio increasing our financial leverage from 0 59 times to 1 times while maintaining a strong return on assets of 12 5 with an average debt to equity ratio that was consistent with the prior year at 0 84 times we generated roe on net investment income of 12 and an roe on net income of 14 5 looking at year over year trends our roe on net investment income decreased from 14 in 2018 mostly resulting from record 2018 repayment levels which corresponded with elevated activity related fees the increase in our roe on net income from 11 6 in the prior year to 14 5 was partially driven by an increase in portfolio valuations resulting from a reversal of the q4 2018 credit spread widening it was also driven by net unrealized gains related to certain portfolio investments and net unrealized gains on our interest rate swaps resulting from changes in the shape of the forward libor curve i d like to quickly flag that as per our adoption of recent hedge accounting guidance we ve applied hedge accounting treatment to our 2024 unsecured notes and the related interest rate swaps as a result changes in the fair value of this particular interest rate swap will be offset by changes in the carrying value of the 2024 notes there will be no unrealized gains or losses recognized in our income statement related to this hedging relationship and therefore changes in the fair value of the swap will not impact our roe on net income going forward as we look ahead to full year 2020 based on our expectations over the intermediate term for our net asset level yields cost of funds and financial leverage we expect to target a return on equity of 11 to 12 based on our pro forma year end book value per share of 16 77 which includes the impact of the q4 supplemental dividend this corresponds to a range of 1 84 to 2 01 for full year 2020 net investment income per share with that i d like to turn it back to josh for concluding remarks joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi thank you ian our fourth quarter results supported another year of strong roes for our shareholders for the year ahead our objective continues to be generating attractive risk adjusted returns for our shareholders for our direct origination strategy the differentiated human capital expertise across our platform and capital allocation decisions that serve in the best long term interest of our stakeholders before moving to q a i d like to address the pending topic regarding our broader tpg sixth street partners investment platforms relationship with tpg holdings our sixth street business was started in 2009 as a strategic partnership with tpg sixth street currently manages 33 billion across the platform with over 250 people and nine global offices in the past 10 years our sixth street business and tpg have each grown and evolved thoughtfully and in productive ways likewise so has a relationship with tpg my partners and i at sixth street have been having a series of discussions with tpg about the next step in the evolution of our relationship including the option of operating the independent organizations with tpg continuing to maintain a minority stake in the sixth street business given sixth street scale sector expertise market presence and the fact that we have already been operating autonomously a potential next phase as an independent organization is going to be business as usual for tslx there would be no changes to the dedicated management personnel of our business and our shareholders will continue to benefit from the same sourcing underwriting and operational capabilities of the platform they have experienced with tslx since inception as of today no formal agreement has been finalized and there s no guarantee that one will be reached in either case or we business as usual for us those who know us know that our northstar has always had make decisions in the best interest of our shareholders with that i d like to thank you your continued interest and for your time today operator please open up the line for questions questions and answers operator our first question comes from rick shane with j p morgan your line is open richard shane j p morgan analyst hey guys thanks for taking my questions this morning josh you partially addressed my first question in your final comments related to the separation of sixth street from tpg but i am curious do you think one of the things that has worked well at tslx over the years is good response to incentives do you think your incentives are going to change as you separate from tpg joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi no hey rick thanks for the question i think we re both on the same time schedule which is pretty early in the morning so excuse me i m down with a little bit of the cold look we tend to remain exactly the same all the team s economic group based in the sixth street business and the focus of the team has always been able to create long term value for both our private lps and our public shareholders and we effectively had very limited economics coming from the activities across the firm so i think the incentives remain exactly the same and actually probably a little bit stronger on a go forward basis if we come to a conclusion that we re going to operate as an independent entities but it s basically business as usual and the focus was again has always been you take care of your shareholder you take care of your private lp everything else kind of falls in place focus on your client focus on your customer richard shane j p morgan analyst got it thank you for that and then sort of on a more portfolio related question when we look at the portfolio on a year over year basis of the top 10 investments today for our new investments two of those being abls which typically are shorter have a shorter time on the balance sheet is that the type of rotation that we should continue to expect on an ongoing basis and the reason i asked that is that as you as the company continues to scale do you expect to do slightly larger transactions and drive higher rotation of that top 10 joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi yeah those are very good questions so let me break it down i think there has been a and part of our late cycle focus has always been that you can manage being the late cycle in our mind kind of four different ways one is move up the capital structure the second is being defensive industries where you have sources of repayment that are not related to the economic cycle the third is to create more diversity in your portfolio and the fourth is to have run lower balance sheet leverage so i think the we ve created year over year a lot more diversity in our top 10 investments and you ll also see things that have less correlation to the economic cycle and that could be things that have strong secondary sources of repayment from asset values that are not related to the economic cycle or shorter duration investments so i think that will be continued theme for us on managing how we think about the how we think about beating the late cycle so i don t know if i answered your question i hope i did richard shane j p morgan analyst no you did i mean i think i would have in some ways expected greater concentration of new investments in the top 10 typically that sort of ratchets up over time but i was in part curious if it was not increasing is a function of that sort of late cycle defense more defensive approach joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi that is correct richard shane j p morgan analyst great that s it for me thank you guys joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi great thank you operator our next question comes from fin o shea with wells fargo your line is open finian o shea wells fargo securities analyst hi good morning thanks for taking my question just a couple on portfolio names i ll start with a small investment avidxchange which was recapitalized this quarter you re in the debt equity now but can you give context on how this fits into your platform structure there was a post quarter announcement that you had a funding round i don t know if that news was in january i don t know if that was this same deal but i m mainly asking in the purpose of is this a name that sort of migrates to your from the debt platform to the capital solutions strategy joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi yeah hey fin let me start off first with the industry and then i ll put i ll turn it over to bo to talk about the investment so avidxchange we ve been around i guess probably for four or five years it fits squarely in our theme of b2b payments and payment ecosystems so it provides it s a company that has a ecosystem that provides payments across that ecosystem mostly in property management in the property management sector so it fits squarely in our theme the business has continued to grow significantly it has it continues to reinvest and grow at a significant rate the latest investment we did quite frankly was had a larger suite had a larger structured equity investment and so we de risked because it was less appropriate to fit inside the that tslx platform and in that series of transactions where they raised junior equity to our structured equity they also redeemed us out of our original equity investment i ll turn it over to bo if i missed anything robert stanley president no i think you touched on everything this has been a long term relationship and part of the theme that we ve been pursuing over the last five years and the numbers of the b2b payments you picked up the announcement of the there was a junior capital raise a series upraise of 125 million in late december in addition to our debt and our prep solution so that s what was picked up in the press finian o shea wells fargo securities analyst okay thanks for the context on that and so some a question on forever 21 being an abl that s a very rich spread you attained and i think as we speak it might have been paid off given the acquisition of the brand by strategics but can you give us context on was that can we not see an abl spread these days how much of that was for just the short amount of time you would hold it or the risk of going probably a deep stretch second lien abl for example joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi yeah so a great question and forever 21 i would say at this point 97 98 resolved but i ll walk through it so first of all you can t beat irr and people don t understand when i say that but look if you hold if you have a 30 irr and you hold for a day you really have no mom to compensate you for risk to the downside so the spread was to compensate for a minimum return given that we were actually allocating real capital to the situation it was a dip financing and where our thesis was you had asset value in the brand you had two core real estate warehouses in the center of l a that we thought were very very valuable and that we had a real view on and then you had the inventory what i would say is forever 21 is pretty well noted in the press had a very very rocky december as of december 31 we actually had kept our mark basically consistent with our with the cost basis versus what you would have expected you would have expected it to migrate up to the effectively the coal price or coal plus the access fee that would obviously that we will get our active fee and we would get all of our economics and in retrospect that mark was very conservative but it was a very difficult december for the company but look our thesis was it was a little bit too big to fail it was one of they biggest rent payers in the mall ecosystem i think calvin centers was 2 5 or 2 2 5 of the rents and so it was a little bit too big to fail that it had a real brand name and then it had real underlying asset value in the form of inventory and real estate as of yesterday with the proceeds we have about 9 million outstanding against a real estate property that s basically under contract for i think 19 5 million so again it s basically revolved but december was it was we had a very conservative mark and again it goes to the expertise of our platform of understanding component parts of underlying asset values of these companies finian o shea wells fargo securities analyst okay got it that s all for me thanks so much operator thank you our next question comes from mickey schleien with ladenburg your line is open mickey schleien ladenburg thalmann analyst yes good morning everyone and josh thanks for getting up early and battling through your cold i wanted to ask a high level question to what extent do you believe the volatility in the more liquid loan markets may benefit your direct lending platform going forward given that we re hearing more and more borrowers are migrating away from bsl toward direct lending joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi yeah so it s a great question mickey look i think that i would start up and saying that there s been some volatility in the broadly syndicated market that the broadly syndicated markets have been really differentiated by the have and have not that s kind of diverse course so the correlations will no longer won across credit spreads that s reversed course a little bit and there s the correlations are getting tighter my deep overall concern is that for the industry is that given where the industry sits on the cost curve i e when you look at our base management fees and our incentive fees that we better be a little careful or better be a lot careful of being a pure substitute to the broadly syndicated market where people can access the broadly syndicated market at 50 basis 25 basis points to 50 basis points through a closed end fund or a clo structure and us effectively creating the same risk return and because we sit so much higher on the cost curve this has actually been a theme for me mickey that you and i have discussed probably now over five or six years which was my problem with ticc which was they basically brought broadly syndicate loans and brought other people s clo equity and didn t manufacture their own and so where they sat on the cost curve they were basically taking 1 and destroying the 1 of providing something we less than 1 value to the shareholders given where they sat on the cost curve so my hope is that if the industry will see volatility as a way to create solutions and certainty and get paid for that providing that certainty to issuers if the industry is effectively substituting and providing the same risk reward at higher on the cost curve the industry is going to be in deep trouble mickey schleien ladenburg thalmann analyst i understand and i thank you for that color that s really helpful josh your firm is well known for doing deep dives on a sector basis and obviously with some particular specialties i m curious to understand what you re thinking in terms of the alternative energy sector we get everybody talks about oil and gas and how to favor it is but there s a flip side obviously as to what s going to replace that so are there borrowers in that space that are of the right size with the right balance sheets and cash flow profiles that are starting to look interesting to you joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi yeah so good question so as you i think you re exactly right i think there s going to be quite frankly given the disruption in energy and how much capital has been destroyed and upstream e p and quite frankly the demand probably for traditional carbon products going down there s going to be opportunity for people who have deep knowledge on where asset is in the cost curve what their decline is what the unit economics are there s going to be opportunity given the lack of capital of the industry the energy industry will attract over time for people who are net debt return as it relates to the alternative energy space the answer is we actually have a very we have a great team sitting in new york focused on all energy and infrastructure project run on energy they typically fit better in a private fund format because they typically were typically buying assets or cash flow from assets versus winding the corporate borrowers and so we ve done a lot of stuff in renewables in spain and italy where the take or pay contracts and so they typically have not hit the typical corporate loan that is required under the 40 act of the good asset and they ve typically taken another form which is buying street the cash flows or buying asset with little or no merchant risk that being said we have the expertise and so if a corporate loan does pop up that will be a great opportunity for us but your entities again are i think are right i think generally the energy space is a little bit of a mess start back in 2015 i guess but it s continued most forward and it s structured enough people got the decline goes wrong demand for overall carbon products going down the equity markets and the high yield markets and then you have emerging disruptive technologies in all synergy and so i think over a period of time that it can be a unique spot for us to take the expertise of our platform and create value that being said we have you have some commodity price risk and so we re going to be very careful when we do that mickey schleien ladenburg thalmann analyst thank you for that and if i could just finish with a couple of sort of housekeeping questions just to gauge risk in the portfolio can you give us a sense of what the portfolios average debt to ebitda ratio is joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi yeah i think bo covered in the prepared remarks i think it s gone down year over year so our last dollar on average our last dollar attachment point is 4 2 times that compares to that on average last year of 4 5 times on an interest coverage basis it s i think also got better that s effectively and i m giving exact numbers i think it was 3 2 this year compared to 2 8 last year i mean and some of that quite frankly is earnings growth a mix between earnings growth and that continues to be having a comment at that mickey schleien ladenburg thalmann analyst okay and lastly maybe for ian just at a high level ian on a portfolio company basis what were the main drivers of the realized loss and the unrealized gains this quarter ian simmonds chief financial officer on the unrealized there s no major driver it s i don t want to describe as cats and dogs but there s probably about 12 names that contribute to that overall so nothing specific stands out there s a small realized gain on a liquid name that we have but it s less than 0 05 there s really nothing major to highlight joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi yeah i mean look i think curriculum which i think has publicly announced that got refinanced in q1 so the remarkable update basically up to the call price that was 0 02 but there was nothing that will contribute more than 0 02 on a single basis right mickey schleien ladenburg thalmann analyst and that s also the case with the realized loss joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi yeah mickey schleien ladenburg thalmann analyst okay that s great that s all for me this morning i appreciate your time thank you very much joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi great thanks mickey ian simmonds chief financial officer thanks mickey operator our next question comes from chris york with jmp securities your line is open christopher york jmp securities analyst good morning guys and thanks for taking my questions this one may be for ian so other income was a record this quarter can you breakdown some of the drivers there whether that was led by higher structuring or syndication fees joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi yeah so we actually didn t have any syndication fees in the quarter chris and i ll just give you a little bit of context if you look at our call it an activity basis fee so accelerated oid from prepayments which there wasn t that much of this quarter and obviously we didn t have that many prepayments in general if you look at that plus syndication fees which was zero and then our other income collectively those items were 0 14 per share for the quarter if i look at what those items collectively have been over the last four years the average has also been 0 14 per share so in aggregate we re basically the same as what we ve experienced historically in the other income items this particular quarter it was really driven by an amendment that i think was known to the market with ferrellgas and then we had a couple of other items that were we re calling them work fees because they involved some service and input on our part that drove that other income line christopher york jmp securities analyst very helpful i noticed that you did put in the k that it was an amendment fee so how much was that amendment fee specifically in the fourth quarter joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi look ferrell is a publicly traded company i don t want to get into details i think the total other income is dollar wise ian simmonds chief financial officer 7 million joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi 7 million and farrell was a own pay it was a smallest piece of that so but people should look at the farrell k or their public reporting and what they disclosed christopher york jmp securities analyst got it okay and then in your prepared remarks you said that some of your decision to issue a special dividend this year was driven by expected gains i think in maybe the first half of this year does that include ferrellgas or curriculum or what are the specific drivers there joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi let s take a if we take a step back and i mean it turns a little ian is the greatest tax person but i do kind of play on every once a while we had about 1 60 per share in undistributed income and we barely made and by the way this is all manageable but our tax year ends in march and we were basically only had about 1 8 million or 2 million of room against the minimum distribution requirement of 0 90 we got 90 and so for us and again that could have been that s all solvable and would have been solved but if you look forward at where our base is and where our kind of recurring special no we don t call special ian simmonds chief financial officer supplemental joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi supplemental dividends are through the year effectively on an accrual basis in q1 we would have been out of compliance with the minimum distribution requirements now we have until march 20 march 21 to solve that but on an accrual basis we would no longer be and that s a function of both net investment income and cap gains and so that played a big part of it which is we knew we are going to have to make a large special dividend by march 2021 it was known we are in an effective accrual basis we would have been out of compliance in q1 we barely made it in q for this tax year so that s one piece of it the second piece of it is that the excise tax was continuing to grow and continuing to burden shareholder returns and was just a pure friction cost and so we were able to minimize we basically are reducing that by a third on a pro forma basis and that will grow again quite frankly but we re reducing that by a third and so and then the third piece of it was that there is capital efficiency in that we re saving we re effectively reducing our equity and that has a associated cost of capital and borrowing which has a associated cost of capital that s a lot and so when you put all those three things together which is we knew we were going to have to be in compliance on a ric basis in 2021 we knew we weren t going to be in compliance in 2021 that this is actually on a net income basis accretive because you re saving the excise tax you re saving a little bit of management fee given that you go into the break which has been reduced by interest expense and reduced by a little bit of infinity but it s positive about 0 01 a share on a net income basis given the excise tax and you re generating higher roes it seems like although it was not consistent with the past actions the fact that circumstances have changed christopher york jmp securities analyst color is extremely helpful and josh you played the role well as a ric expert ian simmonds chief financial officer the only thing i would add chris and we read your report that came out last night and you referenced the growth in undistributed income year over year and i think that was actually pretty good as a way to think about one of the inputs into how we sized the special dividend so this time last year our undistributed income was we estimated at about 1 22 top for the year we re now at 1 60 so there s 0 38 of growth over that period so that was one of the inputs into how we size that josh referenced the potential to save say excise tax which is important to us because that s loss to the system and then we re also very focused on preserving nav and so the other way we thought about sizing especially we looked at a year on year growth that we had achieved through operating results in 2019 we backed off the impact of the swaps with the tailwind that we got from mark to market movements in the swaps so that s sort of triangulated to 0 50 special dividend that s what we re thinking behind it as we had discussions with the public christopher york jmp securities analyst sure it makes a lot of sense i was just trying to i mean when i was looking at undistributed income growth the comments you had in the prepared remarks were just what i was focused on so i ll switch gears the last one was on your potential separation agreement so i think investors had generally thought the bdc and then tssp had received some halo benefits from its association with tpg so given the recent change at the advisor with tpg why would it be wrong for investors to think either the informational advantages or maybe even the future capital raising with lps seem to be consolidating relationships could be impacted going forward joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi yeah look i mean i think if there was a halo benefit if you look back nine years ago today the tssp platform is 33 billion of aum these conversations we had conversations obviously with our private lps they ve known about the changing relationship over the last nine years when we started the business there was 10 people today there s 250 people we ve built out industry expertise we haven t relied on the firm for any informational advantages for years so i don t again i think it s business as usual that cap again i would say that nothing is done but it was in the press and surely that our revolver lenders the minimum was done post to being in press the revolving lenders didn t care our cost of capital and change we did a tap on the bond deal our cost of capital didn t change quite frankly went down and so it is and it s been very well known in both the lp market and i think with our shareholders this has really been a jv controlled by the tssp class 3 partners and manage nobody s ever done our investment committee nobody s ever referred the deal to us in the bdc and so it is really the business as usual christopher york jmp securities analyst that s a good answer and obviously your comments on the debt capital mitigate our concerns there so good perspective last one just following up on that so i know the fee was very nominal but and the separation agreement is pending right now but will there be a suspension of the licensing fee to tpg for the use of your name would that expire joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi yeah so there is look again there is no there hasn t been any actual fee related to the tpg specialty lending so and that either the management company has paid or the shareholders have paid obviously on a go forward basis i think to be determined but quite frankly it s really sixth street partners branded business sixth street partners managed business and again there hasn t been a deal we haven t come to a deal with all that reflects christopher york jmp securities analyst got it that s it for me thanks guys operator thank you our next question comes from kenneth lee with rbc capital your line is open kenneth lee rbc capital markets llc analyst hi thanks for taking my question wondering if you could talk about the key factors driving the you mentioned an increase in the potential earnings power that is supporting the increase in the base quarterly dividends this year and how much of that would be dependent on any movement within the libor rates thanks joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi yeah it s s a good question so first of all let s take a step back i don t think the increase in the dividend from 0 39 to 0 41 is more of a resetting what the dividend should have been years back i think on a last year in supplemental dividends we paid out 0 19 and so there was and by the way and we grew nav even though we paid out 0 19 and so if you divide do simple math 19x4 that s what 0 47 0 46 a quarter rather than 0 39 and so the business last year which was slightly a little bit of a higher libor environment would have supported with still growing nav a basically a dividend around 0 44 to 0 45 per share ian simmonds chief financial officer with still over earning supplemental joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi with growing nav so i it s more a function of that the dividend was undersized for years and years and years and then there was a change in the asset coverage ratio which would allow for greater financial leverage which obviously boosted roes and so it s the combination of those two things when we look at the when we look at our ability to earn the dividend or even our ability to earn the dividend with coverage which is how we think about it we take the dividend as a cash liability we don t look at spot libor today we look at the forward libor curve that will be a headwind but the earnings as a business we ve already massively over earning the dividend and so even if you walk forward a year or two years out and look at the spot libor curve you still feel very good about the newly sized dividend for the existing power of the business kenneth lee rbc capital markets llc analyst got you that s very helpful just one follow up if i may you mentioned within your prepared remarks seeing a slight uplift in asset yields on new investments wondering if you could just elaborate what s driving the uplift in yields despite the movement in libor rates in the quarter thanks joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi yeah look i think it s pretty idiosyncratic quarter to quarter things bump around so what i would say is the overall trend of the industry continues to remain super competitive i mean i think yields on new investments were 12 3 in q4 a large function of that was little over 21 in q3 was 10 4 and q2 was 11 4 and q1 was 10 7 and so again i think it s idiosyncratic the industry continues to be very very competitive but my hope is that the industry is going to start trying to take spread back as libor falls and realize that they need to provide an acceptable return given where we ve seen the cost structure to shareholders kenneth lee rbc capital markets llc analyst understand very helpful thank you operator thank you our next question comes from robert dodd with raymond james your line is open robert dodd raymond james analyst hi guys good morning and thought was exactly the point you just made josh in terms of the industry the hope maybe the industry will try and take spread back for lack of a better term is you intend to kind of put a stake in the ground on spread on your front because right now it looks like the industry really isn t doing that forward curve is down spreads don t really seem to be widening and that broader markets are still tightening so i mean any color you can give us on your willingness to hold that ground if everybody else loses their minds around you if you will joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi yeah look we re willing to give up growth for the manager and for the platform to protect shareholder economics and the again it has to work for shareholders and have to work for private lps the watch out is that i think people are ignoring the forward libor curve either they re ignoring it or they re making a bet against the forward libor curve overall the industry earnings power if they don t take back spread is going to go down absent massive changes of leverage given the forward libor curve that compounded with a lot of people fix their funding costs and so that s going to compound the issue and so you can t manage the business here in the moment you ve got to manage the business and look at your cost of capital and look at shareholders expectations and what the market is telling you about interest rates and your cost of funding and quite frankly we re positioned much better because we have we have libor floors and floating rate libor floor in our assets and floating rate liabilities and so at some point if you continue to see libor drift below our floors we ll have net interest margin expansion but i think the watch up for the industry is people better people should start thinking about that forward libor curve and thinking about what that means for their economic reality and overlay that into what their funding mix looks like robert dodd raymond james analyst got it i appreciate that josh one more if i can on the abl side obviously you ve got a ton of experience the abl brick and mortar problem has been going on a while you ve gotten great returns out of that one of the newer areas of softness if you will i think is in grocery food retail things like that where i think people thought grocery stores were more defensive against some of the brick and mortar retail trends and that s not working out can you give us any color on your appetite do those kind of deals given a perishable versus non perishable collateral if that changes the dynamic so if you d be willing to look at those kind of deals joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi yeah so look you re exactly right it s a very good point so we did great american and pacific tea company back in 2014 which was a grocery store deal and there are packing considerations typically don t impact grocery but there are packing consideration there are also the perishable and so you have to be much more conservative and be much more constructive in your borrowing base and how that works right now we have to save a lot but that has some of those similar dynamics but well i think people never realize about the grocery segment was it was much it was levered to inflation given the large fixed cost structure and so i think people that inflation would come in and when you have a fixed cost structure that s good you ve had deflation and you ve had a lot of disruptive competition and so there will be some opportunities but i think we ll be very careful robert dodd raymond james analyst i appreciate it thank you operator thank you our next question comes from ryan lynch with kbw your line is open ryan lynch keefe bruyette woods analyst hey good morning thanks for taking my questions just have a couple remaining as part of at least from my understanding as part of the partnership engine between tpg and sixth street from my understanding you guys are not able each of the parties are not able to start up competing businesses or overlapping strategies for one year but then after that you are free to do such just curious has sixth street thought about once that one year clock period lapses that you guys will look to pursue other strategies besides credit joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi yeah thanks ryan again there s been no agreement reached and so i know there s been stuff reported out there i think it s a little bit premature i think your construct is probably roughly right i don t think this decision was driven by the desire to for either part to expand into white space that belongs to the other party and so i think this decision if it does come to fruition it was just about the natural evolution and that people will have their own relationships with lps and people were managing their own separate businesses and there were synergies that existed any longer given the evolution of both businesses so i think your concept is roughly right although no agreement has been reached i would also say that that wasn t the primary factor of this process ryan lynch keefe bruyette woods analyst okay that makes sense and then i wanted to follow up on your response to chris question regarding the dividend and the special dividend payment i think you mentioned three reasons one of the reasons were for paying a special dividend is that you guys were potentially going to bump up to some of these ric payout requirements in 2021 you also mentioned that you don t love paying special dividends so i m curious as you guys still kept the supplemental dividend policy at a 50 payout ratio it feels like you guys could run into the same issue again a year or two from now as you guys have put up really strong results so is there any consideration to increasing the supplemental payout ratio to something higher like 75 or 100 to avoid these special dividends which you guys said you don t really love paying joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi yeah were you at the board meeting by the way i mean yeah you hit it on the head which was look we re going to have a ric problem even if we had running the supplemental at 75 we re at 100 quite frankly because how the supplemental was calculated was based on nii and did it pick up realized cap gains and so we were going to have the ric issue no matter what and quite frankly on an accrual basis although you had until 2021 to solve that you were going to have it effectively in q1 this year so we did think about the other levers increasing it to 75 that s on the table quite frankly if the business continues to perform we ll have this issue again the excise tax kills me because it s pure friction and so those things will continue to be on the table as we go forward but quite frankly it was a combination of the size of the special not if you could if you needed to do the special the percentage of the supplemental and the base dividend and what we did was we hit two of the three we want to continue to build nav and so we didn t change the percentage but we hit two of the three levers ryan lynch keefe bruyette woods analyst okay that makes sense those are all my questions i appreciate the time today and really nice quarter guys joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi great thanks ryan operator thank you and i m currently showing no further questions at this time i d like to turn the call back over to joshua easterly for closing remarks joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer

four democratic candidates are running for their party s nomination in illinois 7th congressional district here are their responses to questions from the chicago tribune editorial board ahead of the march 17 primary ai2html blurb iframe min width 100 width 280px var pymparent new pym parent blurb gfx about why should voters nominate you and not your opponents i decided to run for congress because i know the issues plaguing my district are deeply rooted systemic and must be addressed at a national level in il 7 the unemployment rate is over two times the national level and is a food desert in addition high levels of gun violence not to mention non stop persistent divestment has led to the district leading the state in outward migration constituents in the 7th are clamoring for an end to gun violence for criminal justice system reform and community policing what they re also waiting for is a candidate who finally acknowledges the devastation brought upon them by austerity what they want is a candidate who has real plans for job creation investment in education infrastructure investment what the district needs to increase its voter turnout is a candidate bold enough to promise to tax the rich and who will fight for healthcare and housing to all as a human right danny davis has not been that candidate for the many years he s been in office why should voters believe he ll address these issues in his 24th year in office when he hasn t to date in addition danny and i differ on ice i want to abolish ice and danny voted yes on 12 17 19 to a congressional budget which includes significant funding for ice and cpb in addition what danny s missing is what i will fight for legalization of marijuana on a federal level with a focus on racial justice to make sure inequities caused by our racist war on drugs are addressed danny only supports the legalization of marijuana at the state level and he only begrudgingly provides even that limited support but our biggest difference is our view on corporate america while danny happily accepts donations from corporate donors i do not i believe we must fight white supremacy and inequality at their root causes as fred hampton said you can t fight capitalism with capitalism what are your highest priorities for illinois and the nation i am a strong supporter of an economic bill of rights that means i believe housing healthcare education and a job that pays a livable wage are human rights in addition i believe that all people are entitled to justice and sanctuary to correct the current inhumane status quo will require real change including among other things reform of the criminal justice system legalization of marijuana with a focus on racial justice expansion of civil rights for lgbtqia members enactment of gun safety laws an abolishment of ice and a pathway to citizenship these actions are the stepping stones toward solving the intertwined issues that have plunged my district and many others throughout the country into an existential crisis it s time for congress to take action on that basis ai2html blurb iframe min width 100 width 280px var pymparent new pym parent nav list immigration if you could fix longstanding problems with this country s immigration system what would you do our campaign is crystal clear in our belief that it is time to abolish ice create a clear path to citizenship reunite torn apart families and protect the rights of families to remain together locally i have fought for the passing of welcoming village and sanctuary city ordinances to ensure greater protections for our undocumented populations the immigration and customs enforcement agency was created in 2003 in the same suite of post 9 11 legislation as the patriot act and the iraq war its founding was part of an unchecked expansion of executive powers that led to the widespread erosion of americans civil rights unlike prior immigration enforcement under the ins ice operates outside the scope of the department of justice and is unaccountable to our nation s standards of due process now we see the consequences young children are being ripped from their parents and kept in detention centers without due process and without accountability to congress as overseen by the trump administration ice operates with virtually no accountability ripping apart families and holding our friends and neighbors indefinitely in inhumane detention centers scattered across the united states we believe that if we are to uphold civic justice we must abolish ice and see to it that our undocumented neighbors are treated with the dignity and respect owed to all people regardless of citizenship status entitlement programs are you prepared to take up real reform to social security and medicare to ensure their future solvency what specific reforms and cuts to entitlements would you be willing to support i do not support cuts to entitlements i do support adoption of the social security expansion act proposed by bernie sanders this legislation would both provide a badly needed increase in social security benefits and extend the solvency of social security the lowest primary insurance amount pia factor in the benefit formula would increase from 90 percent of a worker s first 11 000 of average income roughly to 105 percent by 2040 increasing benefits for most workers by about 2 200 per year in 2040 the increase would be about 1 000 per year if in place today and among other things adopt a faster growing cost of living adjustment for benefits and create a minimum benefit of 125 of the poverty line for people who have worked 30 years or more among other things this would be accomplished by increasing the level of income on which the current 12 9 percent payroll tax is applied and applying a new 6 2 tax on net investment income and most business income in excess of 200 000 for single filers and 250 000 for married couples filing jointly health care what is the government s obligation if any to help american workers secure health insurance do you support the creation or continuation of a program such as medicare for all or obamacare do you have a different idea if you support a government related insurance plan how would you pay for it i strongly believe that healthcare is a human right and fully support medicare for all the private healthcare industry is an unnecessary middle man that rakes in billions of dollars in profits each year while hundreds of thousands of americans go through medical bankruptcies no one should go bankrupt because they need a medical procedure under a true single payer system the american people would save money by expanding the risk pool eliminating the administrative overhead which drives up the cost of coverage medicare for all to me means a single health insurance program free at the point of use no copays premiums deductibles that covers all aspects of healthcare requiring a medical professional including hearing vision dental mental health and long term care our campaign fully supports bernie sanders medicare for all policy as well as his plans to lower the price of prescription drugs by enacting the medicare drug price negotiation act which would allow medicare to negotiate with drug companies for lower prices and well as enacting the affordable and safe prescription drug importation act which would allow patients and pharmacists to purchase prescription drugs from outside of the country finally we support the enactment of the prescription drug price relief act which would cut prescription drug prices in half by basing prices on the median prices of five major countries including canada the united kingdom france germany and japan i support bernie sanders options for paying for medicare for all which would include a tax increase but because people will pay 0 in premiums 0 in co pays and 0 in co insurance for their health care the american people will be in a better financial position even with the tax increase and won t have to worry about large medical bills medical related bankruptcies or choosing between food or expensive prescription drugs foreign policy what security role should the u s play in world affairs the united states must dramatically alter its conduct toward the rest of the world in order to rejoin the international community on good faith we must acknowledge that our government intelligence agencies military have used rhetoric about promoting democracy to justify ruthless acts of imperialism often involving interventions into the politics of other nations our continued insistence on regime change in venezuela not to mention obvious involvement in the recent coup in bolivia is a quintessential example of this instead of stifling their movements the u s should ally with progressive leaders like lula de silva brazil s popular former president who was recently jailed under dubious pretenses to prevent his contention for president or andrÃ©s manuel lÃ³pez obrado the president of mexico i have pledged to oppose military intervention in venezuela and iran and will work to end u s involvement in military actions around the world such as in afghanistan and syria including ending u s support for the saudi war against yemen economy unemployment is at a 50 year low and economic growth is steady assess the state of the economy and tell us how you would improve economic prospects for americans i believe that every american has the right to a job that pays a livable wage with decent benefits our campaign supports a federal jobs guarantee which would create a baseline standard for employment that includes a 15 minimum wage tied to inflation fair scheduling requirements full healthcare and child and sick leave for all this proposal would dramatically upgrade the quality of employment in the united states by providing training and experience to workers while bringing much needed public services to our communities in areas such as parks service childcare and environmental conservation a federal jobs guarantee will allow people to serve their communities and help to rebuild the social fabric of our nation investing in our workforce is investing in our nation helping to ensure millions are lifted out of poverty the 7th congressional district s unemployment rate is 16 5 many times the national average so a federal jobs guarantee would have a direct impact on the health of our community this threat of unemployment and joblessness is what gives employers all their negotiating power over low wage workers therefore the right to a public job will increase workers bargaining power over things like benefits hours and wages however we know that no single policy is a panacea it must be paired with higher wages and labor law reforms to produce better outcomes for example i gig economy employers like uber lyft etc must be forced to recognize workers as employees and not self employed contractors to increase access to better wages and benefits ii public employees must be given the right to bargain and federal employees must have the right to strike iii a ban on state right to work laws should be adopted iv changes are needed to permit sectoral bargaining and v no domestic or farm workers should be exempt from protection of labor laws who could collectively bargain through sectoral bargaining i also support increasing workers democracy by requiring that 50 of the seats of the board of certain large privately held corporations and all publicly traded corporations be directly elected by the company s workers and enacting legislation ending at will and adopting just cause employment in addition requiring companies to give employees the right of first refusal to collectively purchase the company or facility when it s for sale is critical as a method to keep jobs in the community and help reject unwanted displacement i will use my platform to speak in strong opposition to the right to work movement and will be a vocal advocate for full collective bargaining rights climate change what measures if any to combat climate change do you support this campaign is committed to the green new deal a program to build a sustainable green energy infrastructure that will generate millions of jobs this campaign supports transitioning the united states to a carbon free 100 renewable energy system and a fully modernized electrical grid by 2035 we believe renewable fuels must be produced in a way that achieves our environmental and energy security goals so we can move beyond oil responsibly in the fight against climate change by encouraging the electrification of vehicles sustainable home heating distributed rooftop solar generation and the conversion of the power grid to zero emissions energy sources we believe we can be 100 free of fossil fuels by 2035 we recognize the importance of approaching climate change as an issue of race and poverty as well the negative effects of climate change are primarily felt in communities of color and high poverty rates people living in these communities are more likely to be exposed to industrial pollution for example chicagoans in minority neighborhoods on the west side and south side have the greatest exposure to toxic air pollution and other environmental health hazards in the city according to recent studies when i think of the green new deal i imagine a future in which community planning is based not around profit or the whims of corporate monopolies but around the needs of the community to that point it s critical that we municipalize basic utilities such as energy the democratize comed fight here in chicago to municipalize the city s electrical grid is a perfect example we cannot allow the financial incentives of private companies like comed to dictate the price quality of service of the things we need to survive gun laws describe briefly your position on how to balance the 2nd amendment and gun safety common sense gun control and an assault weapons ban are extremely important issues for me in 2007 i was a direct victim of gun violence and in my nine years of teaching i have lost several students to gun violence gun violence is a pervasive issue that terrorizes children and families on a daily basis and annually more than 15 000 americans die due to gun violence excluding suicides while gun violence often goes ignored in black brown and poor communities politicians paying attention to mass shootings simply send thoughts and prayers instead of fighting to save american lives politicians bend over backwards to protect the billionaire backed gun lobby and propose measures that would actually increase gun sales such as the incredulous proposal to arm teachers illinois is a state with extremely stringent gun laws yet gun crimes continue to plague communities like chicago this is because the issue of gun violence is an interconnected issue that requires interconnected solutions racial segregation wealth inequality gangs and the inability of law enforcement to solve crimes have fueled the gun violence epidemic and a handful of minority impoverished neighborhoods many in the 7th congressional district have received the brunt of the impact gun violence must be recognized as a public health issue it will take a comprehensive public health approach to addressing this growing crisis to ensure our families and communities are safe we must place a renewed emphasis on improving gun injury and violence research congress must take the following actions repeal the dickey amendment which stopped research into gun violence because it prohibited funds made available for injury prevention and control at the centers for disease control and prevention to be used to advocate or promote gun control ban assault weapons high capacity magazines and ensure the ban on bump stocks prevents illegal manufacture trade and sales require domestic abusers and stalkers to surrender their firearms mandate universal and improved background checks for firearm purchases prohibit congresspeople including candidates from taking money from the gun lobby or private equity companies that invest in the firearms industry promote the concept that nothing stops a bullet like opportunity if we want to truly address gun violence we also must provide greater investment in our communities which leads to greater opportunities for community members community policing case management community centers public school investment mental health support living wages job creation and employment counseling all lead to greater legal pathways to individuals supporting themselves and their families more when have you shown independence from your party on an issue of major import my disagreement with the democratic party comes from my view of what ought to be their opposition to president trump almost the entire party voted for trump s budget and his increase in military spending as an active duty military veteran who served 6 years alongside soldiers of all backgrounds i 100 condemn the extrajudicial killing of general soleimani by president trump this decision not only is counter to the president s expressed pledge to stop sustained u s involvement in foreign wars it directly endangers the lives of iraqi iranian american civilians our military industrial complex incentivizes profit over peace anyone looking for the true motives behind this action need look no further than the fact that in the aftermath of this attack lockheed martin s stock is up 2 raytheon company s is up 1 5 and northrop grumman corporation s 5 45 without any evidence to justify this killing this act can lead to a war fought by the children of working class families not those of the wealthy whose interests fuel acts of imperialism and militarism by our government i support senator sanders rep ro khana legislation to block pentagon funding for unilateral actions the president takes to wage war against iran without congressional authorization i also support the immediate repeal of the 2001 aumf by voting on the war powers resolution and believe that congress should reintroduce and immediately vote on the national defense authorization act amendment which would block the funding for further attacks on iran without congressional approval the trillions of dollars spent on destabilization regime changes war would be better spent on our healthcare education housing combating climate change if you are an incumbent tell us the most significant accomplishment of your current term if you are a newcomer tell us how you as a rookie would keep from being a backbencher partial highlights of davis legislation in 116th congress we believe the newest wave of progressive democratic representatives have shown how a small but vocal minority can have an impact we are inspired by the way they vote as a block and use their platform and their influence on discourse to impact the democratic party i believe my election would be an opportunity for chicago to make a statement and help push the party in their direction away from wall street and machine politics this is a small dollar grassroots campaign we don t accept corporate pac money so i will not be subject to corporate influence this will give me license to be bold and to stay true to my beliefs

grade during the fourth quarter of 2019 18 5 million tonnes of material were mined a decrease of 3 compared to the third quarter of 2019 due to a long shovel move and variance to planned haulage cycles a new leach pad cell was commissioned on schedule with material stacking commencing in the fourth quarter during the fourth quarter of 2019 we delivered approximately 6 7 million tonnes of ore

for the year ended december 31 2018 primarily due to the higher cash costs referred to above offset partially by an increase in the number of ounces sold in the fourth quarter of 2019 cash costs per payable ounce of gold sold were 778 a decrease of 5 compared to the previous quarter primarily due to lower leach pad opening inventory unit costs in the fourth quarter resulting from higher grades mined in the third quarter total mining costs of 1 83 per tonne in the fourth quarter of 2019 were 6 higher than the previous quarter due to 3 fewer tonnes mined and 3 higher total mining costs total mining costs were higher in the fourth quarter of 2019 mainly due to the timing of haul truck tire replacements processing unit costs were 12 lower in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the previous quarter mainly due to 6 higher ore tonnes mined and 7 lower total processing costs total processing costs were lower in the fourth quarter of 2019 mainly due to lower cyanide consumption and lower power unit rates general and administrative unit costs in the fourth quarter of 2019 were consistent with the previous quarter as higher ore tonnes mined were offset by higher labor costs in the fourth quarter of 2019 aisc per payable ounce of gold sold was 1 117 compared to 1 104 in the third quarter of 2019 due to higher planned sustaining capital expenditures primarily related to the

an average realized gold price of 1 481 per ounce during the third quarter of 2019 exploration the main focus of the 2019 exploration program at marigold was to convert red dot mineral resources into mineral reserves during previous quarters we conducted exploration drilling for additional mineral resources along areas that were north and south of red dot within the mackay pit and on valmy target areas such as crossfire and east basalt during the fourth quarter of 2019 we completed a total of 64 reverse circulation rc drill holes for 20 682 meters on these targets during the year ended december 31 2019 our red dot exploration program focused on geotechnical drilling and engineering with the goal of declaring additional mineral reserves in the fourth quarter of 2019 we completed the second phase of confirmation drilling which included nine core holes for 3 700 meters based on the results of these evaluations we converted mineral resources to mineral reserves and red dot is anticipated to extend the marigold mine life into the early 2030s without requiring expansion of the haul fleet or the associated expansion capital exploration at marigold for the year ended december 31 2019 was successful in replacing mined depletion and growing mineral reserves compared to the year ended december 31 2018 including leach pad inventory year over year probable mineral reserves

operations produced a total of 7 7 million ounces of silver 24 0 million pounds of lead and 8 4 million pounds of zinc after declaring commercial production at the chinchillas mine in december 2018 2019 represented the first full year of puna operations milling chinchillas open pit ore during the year ended december 31 2019 ore was milled at an average of 3 819 tonnes per day and contained an average silver grade of 184 g t the average silver recovery was 93 2 a 29 improvement as compared to 2018 when the operation milled primarily low grade stockpiled ore in the fourth quarter of 2019 silver production was 2 1 million ounces an increase of 28 compared to the third quarter of 2019 due mainly to increased mill throughput and processing of higher grade ore during the fourth quarter of 2019 ore was milled at an average of 4 349 tonnes per day processed ore in the fourth quarter of 2019 contained an average silver grade of 174 g t a 5 increase compared to the third quarter of 2019 the average silver recovery in the fourth quarter of 2019 was 95 1 as mill performance continues to benefit from our operational excellence initiatives mine operating costs cash costs and aisc per

10 38 a decrease of 35 compared to the year ended december 31 2018 the decrease is mainly due to increased production as the chinchillas mine achieved steady state operations driven by higher silver mill feed grades and recoveries partially offset by higher unit processing costs driven by a re start of the zinc circuit in 2019 the pumping of tailings for in pit disposal at the pirquitas plant and higher ore haulage costs for the year ended december 31 2019 aisc per payable ounce of silver sold was 14 06 a decrease of 27 compared to the year ended december 31 2018 the decrease is mainly due to lower cash costs per payable ounce of silver sold offset partially by higher capital expenditures including capital stripping costs of which the majority were incurred in the first half of 2019 in the fourth quarter of 2019 cash costs per payable ounce of silver sold were 8 90 a decrease of 37 compared to the third quarter of 2019 the decrease is mainly due to lower per unit operating costs as a result of higher mill throughput and higher by product credits during the fourth quarter of 2019 driven by higher production resulting from an increase in mill throughput feed grades and recoveries in the fourth quarter of 2019 aisc per payable ounce of silver sold was 11 18 a decrease of 36 compared to the third quarter of 2019 the decrease is mainly due to lower cash costs per payable ounce of

please see cautionary note regarding non gaap measures for the year ended december 31 2019 silver sales totaled 7 7 million ounces an increase of 105 compared to the year ended december 31 2018 lead sales totaled 24 1 million pounds and zinc sales totaled 14 1 million pounds the increase in concentrate sales is mainly due to an increase in production as 2019 represented the first full year of production at the chinchillas mine for the year ended december 31 2019 realized silver price was 16 26 per ounce an increase of 2 compared to the previous year in the fourth quarter of 2019 silver sales totaled 2 6 million ounces an increase of 72 compared to the third quarter of 2019 lead and zinc sales totaled 9 4 million pounds and 3 1 million pounds respectively representing increases of 128 and 51 respectively compared to the previous quarter the increase in concentrate sales is mainly due to higher production in the fourth quarter of 2019 driven by higher throughput feed grades and recoveries as well as the timing of concentrate sales exploration during the fourth quarter of 2019 we completed 2 074 meters of diamond drilling exploring the granada target the granada target is the projected intersection of the north dipping past producing historic potosi vein and the south dipping cortaderas breccia vein which hosts much of the current underground mineral resources at pirquitas we anticipate completing the drilling in 2020 and reporting these results in the first half of 2020 chinchillas project argentina the chinchillas project was completed in the fourth quarter of 2019

expect to produce on a consolidated basis at the midpoint of guidance approximately 425 000 gold equivalent ounces at gold equivalent cash costs of 740 per payable ounce sold at the marigold mine gold production is expected to increase in 2020 compared to 2019 marigold is well positioned for another record production year as the mine benefits from an additional hydraulic loading unit purchased in 2019 expected to be commissioned in the first quarter of 2020 and continued operational efficiencies production is weighted toward the second half of the year as a result of mine sequencing and access to higher grade ore capital investments are expected to total 60 million including 12 million for two replacement haul trucks and 15 million for an additional leach pad to be built in 2020 the continuous build of leach pad capacity will ensure the operation can maintain leach cycle times and gold recoveries at higher ore stacking rates capitalized stripping is expected to total 20 million with the majority incurred through the first three quarters of the year exploration expenditures totaling 12 million are expected to focus on drill programs at mackay basalt valmy and trenton canyon with the goals of adding mineral reserves and defining additional mineral resources within these areas exploration expenditures include 2 million for drill testing trenton canyon s sulphide targets at the seabee gold operation we expect to deliver another record gold production year in 2020 as we continue executing our plan of increasing mining rates to support higher sustained mill throughput production is weighted to the first half of the year due to access to higher grade ore cash costs are expected to remain low between 460 and 500 per payable ounce of gold sold sustaining capital investments remain focused on mining equipment and ventilation with 5 million planned for underground and surface equipment to enable higher mine production due to continued exploration success at seabee in 2019 we commenced an expansion of tailings storage capacity at the mine in 2020 investment in the tailings facility expansion is estimated to total 12 million as phase 1 of the project is completed and phase 2 is initiated with completion expected in 2021 once completed seabee is expected to have tailings capacity for current mill throughput levels into the early 2030s non tailings facility related capital expenditures are concentrated in the first quarter of 2020 as equipment is delivered over the ice road expected capitalized development expenditures of 12 million support higher mining rates and reflect the development strategy for the santoy complex exploration expenditures at seabee are estimated to total 12 million with a focus on expansion and definition of santoy gap hw and surface drill programs at the seabee and fisher properties following up on targets identified in 2019 at puna operations we expect to produce between 6 0 and 7 0 million ounces of silver at cash costs net of by products of between 10 50 and 12 00 per payable silver ounce sold production is weighted to the first half of the year due to higher grades with the majority of capital stripping expected in the second half of the year sustaining capital investments of 15 million relate principally to maintenance of mine mill and power generating equipment a 6 million investment to replace contracted ore transportation is also planned as the operation focuses on lowering unit operating costs at the pitarrilla project located in mexico we plan to spend 4 million in 2020 as part of a two year 10 million exploration program related to extending an existing decline to provide drill access to the underground mineral resources an improved geological model from work completed in 2019 indicates strong potential to better define known high grade mineralized veining associated with steeply dipping rhyolite dyke contacts extending the underground ramp provides access for tighter spaced drilling at better orientations to test the rhyolite dykes and veins for continuity if infill drilling confirms the continuity of high grade mineralized structures there would be potential to enhance the grades of existing mineral resources at the san luis project located in peru we expect to commence a detailed mapping program in the area of the existing high grade gold silver mineral

marigold mine the seabee gold operation and puna operations have been determined based on prices of 1 250 per ounce of gold and 18 00 per ounce of silver these prices are unchanged from those used to determine the mineral reserves estimate at december 31 2018 at the marigold mine our 2019 exploration program led to an increase in mineral reserves probable mineral reserves increased to 3 9 million ounces of gold 228 8 million tonnes at an average gold grade of 0 49 g t at the year ended december 31 2019 an increase of 18 compared to the year ended december 31 2018 after consideration of mining depletion in 2019 of 330 000 ounces 912 000 ounces 51 9 million tonnes at an average gold grade of 0 55 g t of probable mineral reserves were added in 2019 the increase in probable mineral reserves is mainly attributable to our successful infill and exploration drilling programs which converted mineral resources at phases 2 and 3 of red dot and mackay we added 874 000 ounces 53 0 million tonnes at an average gold grade of 0 51 g t of gold probable mineral reserves at red dot in phases 2 and 3 indicated mineral resources inclusive of mineral reserves totaled 4 9 million ounces of gold 301 8

classification terms that comply with reporting standards in canada and the mineral reserves and the mineral resources estimates are made in accordance with ni 43 101 ni 43 101 is a rule developed by the canadian securities administrators that establishes standards for all public disclosure an issuer makes of scientific and technical information concerning mineral projects these standards differ significantly from the requirements of the sec set out in sec industry guide 7 consequently mineral reserves and mineral resources information included in this news release is not comparable to similar information that would generally be disclosed by domestic u s reporting companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the sec under sec standards mineralization may not be classified as a reserve unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made in addition the sec s disclosure standards normally do not permit the inclusion of information concerning measured mineral resources indicated mineral resources or inferred mineral resources or other descriptions of the amount of mineralization in mineral deposits that do not constitute reserves by u s standards in documents filed with the sec u s investors should understand that inferred mineral resources have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility moreover the requirements of ni 43 101 for identification of reserves are also not the same as those of the sec and reserves reported by us in compliance with ni 43 101 may not qualify as reserves under sec standards accordingly information concerning mineral deposits set forth herein may not be comparable with information made public by companies that report in accordance with u s standards cautionary note regarding non gaap measures this news release includes certain non gaap performance measures throughout this document these performance measures are employed by us to measure our operating and economic performance internally and to assist in decision making as well

and gentlemen thank you for standing by and welcome to the ternium fourth quarter 2019 results conference call at this time all participants are in a listen only mode after the speakers presentation there will be a question and answer session i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today sebastian marti director of investor relations thank you please go ahead sebastian marti investor relations and compliance director good morning and thank you for your time and participation in our conference call my name is sebastian marti i m ternium s investor relations and compliance director yesterday ternium issued a press release containing its financial results for 2019 this call is complementary to that presentation joining me today are maximo vedoya ternium s ceo and pablo brizzio ternium s cfo who will discuss ternium s business environment and performance at the conclusion of our prepared remarks there will be a q a session before we begin i would like to remind you that this conference call contains forward looking information and that actual results may vary from those expressed or implied factors that could affect results are contained in our filings with the securities and exchange commission and on page 2 in today s webcast presentation with that i ll turn the call over to mr vedoya maximo vedoya chief executive officer thank you sebastian good morning and thank you all for joining us today as we always do i will briefly go through some prepared remarks and then pablo will review the quarterly result at the end we ll have a q a session let me begin with performance 2019 was a challenging year for the steel industry steel consumption in the americas decreased and steel prices went down during most of the year under these difficult circumstances we were able to report an ebitda of 1 5 billion on shipments of 12 5 million tons and an ebitda margin of 15 again among the highest in the region this performance led to earnings per ads of 2 87 even though we doubled capex in 2019 reaching a peak of 1 1 billion we were able to generate free cash flow of 595 million and to reduce net debt to 1 5 billion or a net debt to ebitda ratio of only 1 considering the strength of our balance sheet the performance in the year and our current expansion program in mexico and colombia the board of director proposed an annual dividend of 1 20 per ads this is equivalent to a dividend yield of 6 at the current stock price and to a payout ratio of 42 as anticipated in our last call result recorded in the fourth quarter showed a rather low margin in part as a result of unusual development in the steel markets over the year especially in the last quarter i ll ask pablo to expand on this during his presentation but i expect the fourth quarter to be the lowest point and the trend to change from the first quarter onwards turning now to what is happening in the steel markets in the americas in the last couple of years we were we had significant uncertainly coming from section 232 tariffs the renegotiation of nafta and the trade war between the united states and china this together with strong fluctuations in inventory levels in north america due in 2019 brought a great deal of volatility to steel prices we believe steel prices should move in a narrower range in 2020 as uncertainty caused by global and regional trade renegotiations appears to have moderated in addition our apparent consumption in the americas is expected to increase in brazil and colombia and to a lesser extent in the u s and in mexico something to also consider for the performance of our steel market in 2020 is the coronavirus outbreak for the time being we are not seeing any significant impact on our steel value change in the region if the epidemic is contained and declines over the next few months there could be no major effect on steel markets in the america although this is not clear yet let me review mexico the steel market in mexico was weak last year steel apparent consumption went down 6 mainly due to a decrease in the commercial market as a result of a very weak construction activity there was also a decline in investment by our industrial customers in mexico after several years of continued growth of their production capacity driven by the high level of uncertainty related to the trade issues i have just mentioned our shipments in the country decreased by 4 last year reflecting this lower steel demand environment nevertheless we were able to increase our market share in mexico so our shipments decreased less than the reduction of the steel consumption looking forward i believe there are conditions for a slightly better steel market sentiment in mexico public construction is beginning to show signs of activity although slow as mexico s government has proved to be very cautious with government spending on the macro side the mexican peso has recently appreciated and interest rates are declining and no doubt that one of the most important development in the year has been the ratification of the usmca agreement by the u s and the mexican government after several years of intense negotiations we are now very close to enact this new trade agreement this is a very positive development for the steel industry in north america region it s wholly value changed and i think particularly for ternium rules of origin for steel have been strengthened and this means that value change from other regions will have an incentive to invest or relocate capacity to the usmca countries this agreement will bring will certainly bring a reduction in trade uncertainties which should readily foster investment and economic activity in mexico in the years to come turning to argentina in 2019 shipments in the southern region decreased 16 compared to 2018 in this market the economy has been weakening over the past few years as a result of public finance imbalances and their consequent infection on inflation interest rate and local currency value we reacted to this difficult environment and over the last couple of years we have been adjusting the operational setting of our industrial facility in the country for efficient production at continuously lower levels of the months so we can sustain our profitable operation looking forward the performance of argentina steel markets will be very dependent on the country s macroeconomic situation we believe steel shipments in argentina which are already at a very low level could remain relatively stable in 2020 subject to the argentina government being able to achieve a successful restructuring of the public debt as a first necessary step to normalize the public finance let me now give you a quick review of the performance of our slab facility in brazil after a very profitable year in 2018 there was a significant increase of iron ore prices in 2019 together with the record levels of pellet premium due to the effect of the world s iron ore supply of vale s dam collapse and the subsequent closure of iron ore capacity these difficult situation coupled with a decrease of slab prices to multi year lows put pressure on the profitability of our facility consequently during the second half of last year we adjusted brazilian mill production level to achieve an overall lower production cost minimizing the use of iron ore pellet and purchased coke as well as putting in place other cost cutting initiatives steel market conditions have improved since then with an increase in seaborne slab prices and a decrease in iron ore and coking coal cost to more reasonable level in these better context we are bringing production back to its normal level this is an example of how we can move to adapt our operations with sequential change so we can protect profitability in difficult times and maximize it when things improve another point is that the brazilian economy is turning and steel consumption is improving there this is positive for ternium as local companies in brazil will increase slab purchases from our facilities there okay let me wrap up my remarks with some final comments in 2019 we were able to show industry level margins in a difficult market environment in 2020 i expect to see our margins gradually improving in the quarters to come with a reversion of the downward trend we had seen during 2019 at the same time we will continue growing our business with the completion of our expansion projects in the second half of last year we started the new painting line in mexico and in december we started the new galvanize line also there for this year in april we will have the start up of the new rebar mill in colombia and by the end of the year the commissioning of the new hot rolling mill at the pesqueria facility the new hot rolling mill will enable a significant integration of our facility in brazil and will consolidate our world class production system with the latest technology to maximize efficiency and productivity this line was set up to start in december of this year but we are working hard to get it ready a couple of months earlier than our initial estimation we cannot wait to take advantage of all the opportunities for improvement of our product range and related services that these new facilities will provide okay i ll stop here so pablo please take over to comment over the performance in pablo brizzio chief financial officer thanks maximo good morning to all let me review our performance together with the webcast presentation in page 3 you can see there in 2019 we reported ebitda of 1 5 billion on shipments of 12 5 million tons shipments were somewhat low reflecting weak demand conditions in argentina and to a lesser degree in mexico ebitda margin at the bottom left chart decreased to 15 within a more sustainable level after returning the year in 2018 let s now review the next page our result in the last reported period ternium ebitda was 263 million in the fourth quarter and ebitda margin decreased to 12 of net sales or 90 per ton a low figure that reflected the low prevailing price environment in north america during the second half of 2019 and some first in first out effect of higher cost inventories the fourth quarter of this last year should be the lowest point as it had among other things a seasonally lower volume in mexico and low production rate in brazil a low realized steel price level in mexico that did not reflect yet the recovery in prices in november due to the contract price lag the cost per ton that did not decrease yet as i mentioned as a result of the first in first out accounting of purchasing slabs together with a particular margin squeeze in brazil that is now fading out as maximo explained and finally some negative impact related to inflation adjustment in argentina so we now expect ebitda to increase sequentially in the first quarter of 2020 with higher shipments and some recovery in steel margins mainly as a result of slightly lower costs we expect it to further recover in the second quarter of this year as for net income in the fourth quarter we reported 90 million or 0 36 per ads when compared to the third quarter earning per ads decreased 0 13 reflecting a lower operating income partially offset by lower effective tax rates that i will discuss later on on page 5 we can review our segments performance in each region as you can see in the fourth quarter shipments in mexico decreased sequentially and increased slightly versus the same quarter in the previous year after this seasonally weak fourth quarter we anticipate an increase in shipments in the first quarter of 2020 with stable industrial market and demand and some help from restocking after a very low level of inventory in the other market region we can see that shipment decreased 4 the main driver behind this decrease was a 65 000 tons decrease in slab sales to third parties as we have already stated partially offset by higher finished steel shipments as maximo mentioned ternium brasil facilities will bring this lagged production back to its normal level after the decrease in the end of 2019 supported by improved margins for the production of steel slabs in the southern region shipments decreased 4 sequentially in the fourth quarter and also decreased 4 compared to the same period in the previous year steel demand in the argentine market remains low looking forward to the seasonally low first quarter shipments in argentina are expected to decrease to a level similar to those recorded in the same period of 2019 turning to page 6 we can see the total steel shipment decreased 5 sequentially in the fourth quarter and 2 on a year over year basis looking forward and considering what we have already discussed we expect the steel shipments in the first quarter to sequentially increase going now to steel prices we can see the areas realized price continue decreasing in the fourth quarter of the year as expected driven by the weak price environment in north america in the second half of 2019 although as the price is revived from the lows as of october this last year in the first quarter 2020 we should not be fully reflected yet in our revenue per ton in mexico as higher realized price on the spot market will be offset by the lag effect of lower contract prices finally we can see in the lower left hand side chart that net sales decreased sequentially 8 reflecting the 5 decrease in shipments together with a 3 decrease in revenue per ton already discussed let s turn now to page 7 to review in more detail the driver of ebitda and net results in the fourth quarter of the year ternium ebitda the upper chart shows that main changes where the decrease in ebitda per ton mostly as a result of a lower revenue per ton and to a lesser extent the decrease in shipments and higher sg a on the second chart we can see that the lower operating income was partially offset by a lower effective tax rate and better results from usiminas the effective tax rate in the fourth quarter included a non cash positive effect on deferred taxes due to the appreciation of the mexican peso against the u s dollar the opposite has happened in the previous quarter and the mexican peso depreciated before going into the next slide of the presentation i would like to comment about the change in the functional currency of our subsidiary in argentina from january 1 2020 ternium argentina will use the u s dollar as its functional currency instead of the local currency as it used to do until then this is a prospective change so it does not affect the previously issued number until december 31 2019 the change in functional currency of ternium argentina will significantly reduce the volatility of the company s earnings that was due to the foreign exchange movements and the application of inflation adjustments let s now turn to page 8 to finish our presentation we can see free cash flow in 2019 reached 595 million with capital expenditure reaching a strong 1 1 million as our expected program progressed as planned capital expenditure should remain high during 2020 to a level approximately of 800 million and we still have at hand of course the completion by year end of the new hot rolling mill in our pesqueria unit in mexico as maximo mentioned ternium s net debt continued decreasing in 2019 it went down by 282 million to 1 5 billion at the end of december and the 1 20 per ads dividend proposed for the year is equivalent to a free cash flow yield of 15 so thanks very much for your time and now we are ready to take any questions you may have please operator let s proceed with the q a session questions and answers operator our first question is from thiago lofiego with bradesco bbi your line is open thiago lofiego bradesco bbi analyst hi thank you good morning everyone maximo i have two questions the first one more medium to long term thinking about the company s strategy so you do guide you guys have do have organic growth on the pipeline but we also know that there may be some m a opportunities especially in mexico so could you comment on capital allocation and how the company expects to spend money in the coming years thinking about the different regions and different opportunities that you do you guys see or in other words do you see more room for further organic expansions in the next five years or do you think that we might see some m a down the road the second question is on mexico what is your expectation regarding when construction activity infrastructure begins to rebound so do you see that as more of a 2021 story at this point or could we see a more consistent rebound already underlining 2020 and also do you see as a concern the new capacities coming on stream i know we ve discussed this in the past but just to get an update on your view about the new capacities coming on stream in the mexican market vis a vis demand growth thank you maximo vedoya chief executive officer thiago thank you very much let me start by the second question about the construction activity in mexico as you know i mean the trends of the construction in mexico has two sides for the last several years i think at least four or five years infrastructure which was led by the government decreased every year i think for the last four or five years but it was compensated and even was a little bit higher by construction by the private sector but this changed last year so the private sector now decreased also so both main drivers of construction were back in 2019 i think there are two sides i think 2020 is going to be a little bit better than 2019 but i think that we in 2021 will be a little bit better and we will see the trend by then investment of the government has started to improve but then this is going to take some time there are some project i mean in mexico every time the government change there is a stop in all the infrastructure projects it happened in 2012 and it happened in 2019 with the change of the government but i think that this is getting a little bit it s not going to be huge but it s going to be a change in trend regarding the event in the private sector the stoppage was a lot in the industry i mean most of the investment coming to the steel industry were relocated in mexico stopped because of the nafta renegotiation and this is going to start changing it s going to take a while but some of that effect we are also going to see this year so overall it s not going to be a huge improve but there is going to be an improve and i think in 2021 as you said this improve is going to be stronger even stronger regarding the capacity in mexico which was your third question i don t see a problem in mexico import s almost 8 million tons of steel and we are putting a capacity we import almost 1 million of that we are increasing capacity a little bit less than 4 million tons so and there is another project i don t know when it s going to be completed of 2 million tons so we have the capacity to fight all those imports which i think we have a very competitive structure of cost to fight that imports and to supply all the customers that today we cannot and that there are customers that need to be supplied by a usmca country after the sign of the usmca treatment so i think we are in a perfect situation to put the perfect timing to put this capacity on the market in mexico so i am not very much concerned of the increase of capacity of course we have to fight for the customers but i think that we have a very good cost structure very great commercial team and we know all the customers so i think they are eager to accept us and that we supply that volume to them again we don t have capacity today to do it and with this we are going to have the capacity to do it so i think again it s a very very good timing and the signing of the usmca was perfect for us because it s going to start in july or august depending on when canada sign in and so we are going to be just in the moment to start supplying these customers that would that are going to be in need of north american steel now to the first part of the questions and the long term strategy we discussed it along sometimes in some of the calls we were focused we are focused today in finishing this investment 1 1 billion of capex this year and as a pablo said 800 million of capex next year is a record height for ternium in all the history so we were much focused on that what are the next step for ternium clearly there are going to be some organic growth we have projects that we are analyzing in mexico in colombia in brazil also again brazil is a country that is going to grow and we have a very solid industrial base in brazil so but those are coming after the completion and the start up of all our projects m a i mean m a we are always looking for acquisitions i mean and if those acquisitions are in the americas we are going to look for them so that could be a possibility but we don t have anything today that i can say we are going to do that acquisition or that other and but and regarding acquisitions it s also important that i add it that although the market is looking better in 2020 there are currently a lot of uncertainties in the market so we need to be extremely cautious when we analyze any m a acquisitions and we are going to be extremely cautious when analyzing an m a acquisition i hope this answered everything you asked thiago i don t know if i forgot something thiago lofiego bradesco bbi analyst it did it did just a very quick follow up maximo you mentioned a potential future investments in mexico colombia and brazil so when we think about brazil are we thinking about potential new roll like new rolling facilities tied to csa ternium brasil there or would that be like the rationale to just sell into the maximo vedoya chief executive officer no no no i think that no brazil has rolling capacity in excess as you know we are investor in usiminas and usiminas has rolling capacity very near our plant in ternium brasil our plant is very very near and so one of the growth opportunities is to supply more slabs to the cubatao facility which has an excess capacity i mean which has a capacity that is not using and i think those are the growing opportunity that we should analyze in brazil thiago lofiego bradesco bbi analyst okay that s clear okay thank you maximo maximo vedoya chief executive officer no thank you too thiago operator our next question is from alex hacking with citi your line is open alexander hacking citi analyst yeah good morning thanks for the question i just have one question which is around the new facility in colombia how are you thinking about ebitda per ton through the cycle for that facility or i guess kind of a range of ebitda per ton i m not particularly familiar with columbia rebar market so i m not sure how margin structures there operate and i guess actually let me ask one more you mentioned you re potentially pulling pesqueria forward by a couple of months so congratulations on that any indication about how much volume you would expect to ship from that facility at the end of this year and any indication about what utilization rate you would kind of be targeting by the end of 2021 would you be looking to be at 100 utilization rate by the end of the year or it ll be a more gradual ramp up thank you very much maximo vedoya chief executive officer thank you alex i ll answer the second question and i ll leave the difficult one to pablo the first one pesqueria is going to start i mean the timing the official timing is still december so not much production from that from the hot steel mill this year but we are very confident that we can start late in october these are going to be only two months for this year and remember these are it s a 1 1 billion investment so it has a long a long start up so not much and the first two months they are dedicated to making the test for all the different products that these hot steel mill has to do so all the running tests for the different products and that takes a lot of time for the commissioning of the hot steel mill but by the end of 2021 we expect to be 100 that s for sure there s a long curve of stop but by the end of 2021 i think it s a little bit earlier it should be by october or september should be by 100 pablo brizzio chief financial officer okay thanks max for some of the question let me so alex the columbia facility basically is in line with pesqueria we have like csa at the moment of acquisition which is increasing the participation and the value chain of the production of steel up to now we have excess capacity in colombia in the long product market and we were limited with the local production that we had and we were importing some product to supply the market so what we are doing with this facility is not only expand the market reach that we got and substitute imports as we did in all the markets where we are but also take advantage of further increasing the margin that we can extract out of our production because we will be moving from finished product to build it as an input for the production of our facility so this clearly should improve the margins of the colombian operation and moving the margin of the columbia operation closer to the areas margin of ternium as a whole so clearly that s the valuation that we want to follow that s the target of these investment and again though the volume in comparison to ternium ternium has last year produced and sold 12 2 million tons here we are thinking of an expansion or talking of an expansion of around 0 5 million ton not a minor one but this will contribute to sustain and to get the margins of ternium in the range that we always want to be which is we re doing 15 and 20 and clearly these type of expansion or these type of projects are putting ternium in a better position to sustain these level of profitability alexander hacking citi analyst perfect very helpful thanks pablo and also maximo pablo brizzio chief financial officer you re welcome maximo vedoya chief executive officer you re welcome operator our next question is from rodolfo angele with j p morgan your line is open rodolfo de angele j p morgan analyst hey good morning everyone my i just have one question i would like to hear your thoughts on working capital it was one of the reasons why the cash flow was strong last year so just wanted to hear from you what is a sustainable level if there should be a hike in the first quarter or any thoughts on working capital thanks guys pablo brizzio chief financial officer okay let me let me take this question rodolfo clearly as you mentioned a key contributor to the free cash flow generation was the reduction in working capital and there are two sides of this reduction in working capital the first one was a real volume reduction in working capital as we always manage on and i think maximo made it very clear at the beginning of the year one of the target of the company was to be more efficient in the decision of working capital and the second one which is clear and of course is the price of the raw materials and the finished products that we have in our inventories the negative side of that is the review the positive side of that is that the reviews the value of our inventories clearly the second part will not be present there anymore because we are not expecting to see there ll be fluctuation of prices that we saw during last year so the we will continue to work in the efficiencies in the management of our inventories but also we need to take into consideration that we are expanding production during this year 2020 we have one facility that will be fully utilized by the end of the year which is the colombia one but we will start working with the mexican facility in pesqueria which is a significant one that will require some level of inventory so all in all the initial expectation is that should not fluctuate that much the level of inventories and probably will not be a contributor to the generation of free cash flow during 2020 rodolfo de angele j p morgan analyst okay thanks pablo pablo brizzio chief financial officer you re welcome operator your next question is from thiago ojea with goldman sachs your line is open thiago ojea goldman sachs analyst hi good morning thanks for the questions my first question is regarding the long term strategy of ternium for years ternium was very successful in being short on its slabs and have an excess capacity on rolling then after the csa acquisition it became the opposite you were longer on the slabs and now with the new pesqueria mill you will be slightly short again how do should we think in ternium view this would you clearly that you mentioned that you are going to invest in your projects would steel be more toward like rolling capacity and specifically on pesqueria and your new mill after this is online how should we consider costs going forward how the structure on cost will shift in mexico thank you maximo vedoya chief executive officer thank you very much thiago i ll answer the first one and then as usual the difficult one for pablo i mean we as we always said we want the flexi we like the flexibility and before our acquisition of the plant in rio de janeiro the csa plant we said we have the three we have the natural gas reduction for one side we have blast furnace for one third the natural gas one third was blast furnace and then one third a little bit more we were short on slabs and we buy slabs from the market and that was gave us a lot of flexibility with the increase of the complexity of the mexican market and the complexity of the product being so short on slabs let me put it this way being so short of slabs started to develop some problems because we couldn t have the capacity of developing the steel for the needs of our more sophisticated customers so i think the acquisition of csa which brought us long on slabs was very good for the timing and of course for the price we pay it was much smaller the investment and we have to build that capacity and second gave us the ability to work with our sophisticated customers in the development of all these things that we are doing today now that we are investing in the hot steel mill this is going to be even better because we are going to be able to produce the full range of all the products of the most sophisticated steels that are produced around the world and give us the facility to work in the development of the customers with that but we are going to be short of slabs of at least 2 million tons to 3 million tons which for us is quite a comfortable level so if you have to think of what we are going to do forward or what we are thinking i said we like this arrangement and if we grow we are going to grow given space that we do have to buy slabs in the market and remain a little bit flexible especially for the downturn of the market that could happen sometimes pablo brizzio chief financial officer okay let me let me take the second question clearly the pesqueria project has different effects we understand all of them are positive in respect to the margins of the company the first one is the one that maximo mentioned which is we will be able to substitute or produce in our own facilities the high end products that up to now we are not able to produce so this is improving the margin of our own production the second one is substituting of imports that we are doing of some products that then will be produced in the new facility in pesqueria and this is not a minor amount even maximo during the opening remarks mentioned that it is close to 1 million tons so there we ll be gaining the margin of instead of buying the finished product producing that product and gaining the transformation part of the product and of course the third portion is that we will increase our product offering because we will be having a higher level of production and the total level of shipments in the mexican market should increase quite a lot so putting all the three things together clearly there should be an increase in margins in our operation in mexico clearly you will like to have a number to that but the only thing i can say is that this is again in the same line of improving the margins of the company and sustaining the profitability level within the range that we consider that ternium should have which is between the famous 15 to 20 thiago ojea goldman sachs analyst thank you pablo brizzio chief financial officer you re welcome operator our next question is from carlos de alba with morgan stanley your line is open carlos de alba morgan stanley analyst yeah good morning everyone so the first question is on brazil you mentioned maximo that you expect the company to ternium brasil to go back to higher levels of production is this around 1 2 million tons or higher on a quarterly basis and then just to clarify if you could clarify the comments on brazil potential investment i understood that the company is not interested in adding rolling capacity to csa so does that mean that the company could potentially expand only the slab production or do you want to do something with usiminas in cubatao if you could clarify that will be great and then still on the capital allocation and investment plans do you how do you see the expansions in mexico going forward do you expect that after this current cycle is completed and is fully ramped up ternium mexico would add more downstream or perhaps it is time to also add upstream capacity in the country and then final question on dividends and the company or the board decided to maintain the dividend payment of 1 20 per ads this is the first year in several where the company does an increased dividend you could argue that the company has a space or had a space to pay more certainly the balance sheet remains strong even though net debt to ebitda increased a little bit but quarter on quarter and you are arguably past the current peak of the ongoing cycle capex cycle so if you could maybe put in context what was the rationale you think that the board had when they decided to keep the dividend flat maximo vedoya chief executive officer okay thank you carlos long question so i ll try to not forget anything but please interrupt me if i do i ll start with brazil as you know brazil produce and i m going to talk about yearly basis because of the how the brazilian operation the brazilian mill has to go into the realigning of the competitors talking about quarters one quarter can change with another because it has these realigning so it s very difficult to talk quarter by quarter so i ll put the production in years 2018 was 4 6 million tons 2019 we produced 4 4 million tons what we expect to produce again in 2020 is 4 7 million tons which was what we did expect in 2019 remember we did we increased the production and that by 2021 2022 we are expecting to reach near the 5 million tons which is very hard but that s our goal but in 2019 we were expecting to produce 4 7 million tons and we produced 4 4 million tons because of this downtrend of the market so 2020 our new estimation is 4 7 million tons i hope with this i answered the question but we are at full capacity in our brazilian operation carlos de alba morgan stanley analyst that s clear maximo vedoya chief executive officer yeah and regarding the investment in brazil let me be clear because i don t want to mislead you we have nothing concrete yet i mean what we have is that we have an investment in usiminas we are one of the main shareholders of usiminas and usiminas is doing better brazil is growing so that s a very good it s very good for us we have a huge facility one of the most modern facility for slab production in brazil and i think that this grow of the market this improvement in brazil and the brazilian economy we are going to take advantage of that and so we want a presence in brazil but we don t have any concrete as what are the next steps in the brazilian operation we are analyzing different projects some of them are based on reduction of costs huge reduction of costs like ones that we made in mexico but again they are very initial step of analyzing the different alternatives of the different views of the brazilian market so don t expect anything in our balance sheet in 2020 about brazil and then you asked about the investment in mexico upstream or downstream i mean i think the mexican market has still a great opportunity for us i mean there are still growth opportunity for growth and the opportunity for growth in both upstream and downstream i think that we are looking for some downstream future investments again i don t think that in 2020 we re going to start any of those but we are looking and then in the upstream i mean you know the usmca when it is approved it s very good because the rule of origins are much stronger and it benefits us a lot but for some part of the market the terminal how you say it in english the automobile manufacturers in seven years from the time it s signed the rule of origin has to change and it has to be melted and poured for only that part of the market and so today we in seven years we are going to accomplish part of that with our facility in guerrero but not all so thinking about an expansion upstream is also a logical situation for us but again we are not going to see anything of that in 2020 we are going to think of that through this year but yes it s one of the projects we are analyzing in a very small scale only to provide that melted and pour to this automobile customers in seven years so we have a lot of time to analyze and see what our best option is and the last part the last one was the dividend that you said no carlos i don t think i answered the first three didn t carlos de alba morgan stanley analyst yeah you did maximo vedoya chief executive officer so the dividend and this is a question that usually pablo answers but i m not going to let pablo brizzio answer it now pablo brizzio chief financial officer okay maximo vedoya chief executive officer i mean i think the dividend yield or the dividend ratio that we are paying is higher i do acknowledge that we have a discussion if we have to increase it or not but i think that the numbers i mean having a dividend yield of 6 i think is one of the highest in the industry no doubt about or a payout ratio of 42 is also i think a payout ratio very high so i know we don t have a dividend yield a dividend policy but with these we want to say now that we are continue committed to paying dividends every year i think with the decrease of the margins of ebitda of this year and i understand next year will be probably better but i think with this decrease maintaining the dividends is a very good sign for all our investors and we are continue committed with that carlos de alba morgan stanley analyst all right thank you very much maximo vedoya chief executive officer i hope i answered your question with that carlos de alba morgan stanley analyst yeah very clear thank you very much operator our final question is from caio ribeiro with credit suisse your line is open caio ribeiro credit suisse analyst yes good morning and thank you for the opportunity so my first question is regarding the outlook that you mentioned for first quarter of 20 and the second quarter 20 you mentioned that you expect ebitda to increase sequentially mainly as a function of stronger shipments and a slightly lower costs but i wanted to see what you re expecting in terms of prices right there had been a recent pickup in hrc prices in the u s even though that seems to have somewhat reversed lately but i was just wondering if you expect to be able to somewhat reflect that recent increase in the u s in your prices in mexico as well and then secondly i just wanted to see if you could provide a little bit more details on the sg a increase that you had in this quarter on a sequential basis and on a yearly basis as well just if you could explain what was the main driver for that thank you maximo vedoya chief executive officer thank you caio i ll start with the first one outlook and you mentioned prices there are simply different prices prices i mean in the in our first quarter you are going to be reflecting the increase in prices in slabs the sales of slabs from our brazilian operation and low prices in the u s are increasing as you said not the full effect is going to be seen in the shipments of mexico because remember in mexico we have i d say half and half but half our shipments are industrial customers so they re a little bit more and usually those are contract based prices on a quarterly basis so the prices of those customers are probably going to decrease from the fourth quarter to the first quarter but the customers of the spot basis the other 50 are going to increase in the first quarter so the net debt would be highly a little bit better but not much better in the second quarter the contract based prices are going to be higher so you re going to see the full effect in the second quarter of this increase volumes though are going to be higher in mexico that s for sure i mean as i said mexico fourth quarter and the whole year was not a very good year for apparent consumption of steel consumption in mexico but in the first quarter we are seeing an increase in our customer orders and we expect to continue that way in the second quarter so volumes are going to increase and prices not that much in the first quarter but we are going to take advantage in the second quarter i think i don t know if i answered pablo do you have the second part pablo brizzio chief financial officer yeah i have the second part hi caio and thanks for your question because it s important for us to clarify these points in fact we didn t have an increase in normal sg a we have specific of particular issues that reflected a number that is higher than the previous quarter and the two of them are the first one is the increase of an asset tax in argentina up to last year this or before the interest of the new government this asset tax was 0 25 and the new government passed a law increasing this or doubling this tax to 0 5 so 4 million of that increase is related to that so we need it to register so this will not be registered as an item in the following quarters and the second one you know that we have a contract that we acquired together with the acquisition of csa now ternium brasil to supply slabs to the calvert facility of metal in the u s since it was a long term contract we needed to account it for in our purchase price allocation so after that we need to amortize this contract by the volume that we shipped since we have higher volume in the fourth quarter in comparison to the

tx earnings call for the period ending december 31 2019 ternium shs sponsored american deposit receipt repr 10 shs tx 2 44 q4 2019 earnings call 8 30 a m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks operator ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by and welcome to the ternium fourth quarter 2019 results conference call at this time all participants are in a listen only mode after the speakers presentation there will be a question and answer session i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today sebastian marti director of investor relations thank you please go ahead sebastian marti investor relations and compliance director good morning and thank you for your time and participation in our conference call my name is sebastian marti i m ternium s investor relations and compliance director yesterday ternium issued a press release containing its financial results for 2019 this call is complementary to that presentation joining me today are maximo vedoya ternium s ceo and pablo brizzio ternium s cfo who will discuss ternium s business environment and performance at the conclusion of our prepared remarks there will be a q a session before we begin i would like to remind you that this conference call contains forward looking information and that actual results may vary from those expressed or implied factors that could affect results are contained in our filings with the securities and exchange commission and on page 2 in today s webcast presentation with that i ll turn the call over to mr vedoya maximo vedoya chief executive officer thank you sebastian good morning and thank you all for joining us today as we always do i will briefly go through some prepared remarks and then pablo will review the quarterly result at the end we ll have a q a session let me begin with performance 2019 was a challenging year for the steel industry steel consumption in the americas decreased and steel prices went down during most of the year under these difficult circumstances we were able to report an ebitda of 1 5 billion on shipments of 12 5 million tons and an ebitda margin of 15 again among the highest in the region this performance led to earnings per ads of 2 87 even though we doubled capex in 2019 reaching a peak of 1 1 billion we were able to generate free cash flow of 595 million and to reduce net debt to 1 5 billion or a net debt to ebitda ratio of only 1 considering the strength of our balance sheet the performance in the year and our current expansion program in mexico and colombia the board of director proposed an annual dividend of 1 20 per ads this is equivalent to a dividend yield of 6 at the current stock price and to a payout ratio of 42 as anticipated in our last call result recorded in the fourth quarter showed a rather low margin in part as a result of unusual development in the steel markets over the year especially in the last quarter i ll ask pablo to expand on this during his presentation but i expect the fourth quarter to be the lowest point and the trend to change from the first quarter onwards turning now to what is happening in the steel markets in the americas in the last couple of years we were we had significant uncertainly coming from section 232 tariffs the renegotiation of nafta and the trade war between the united states and china this together with strong fluctuations in inventory levels in north america due in 2019 brought a great deal of volatility to steel prices we believe steel prices should move in a narrower range in 2020 as uncertainty caused by global and regional trade renegotiations appears to have moderated in addition our apparent consumption in the americas is expected to increase in brazil and colombia and to a lesser extent in the u s and in mexico something to also consider for the performance of our steel market in 2020 is the coronavirus outbreak for the time being we are not seeing any significant impact on our steel value change in the region if the epidemic is contained and declines over the next few months there could be no major effect on steel markets in the america although this is not clear yet let me review mexico the steel market in mexico was weak last year steel apparent consumption went down 6 mainly due to a decrease in the commercial market as a result of a very weak construction activity there was also a decline in investment by our industrial customers in mexico after several years of continued growth of their production capacity driven by the high level of uncertainty related to the trade issues i have just mentioned our shipments in the country decreased by 4 last year reflecting this lower steel demand environment nevertheless we were able to increase our market share in mexico so our shipments decreased less than the reduction of the steel consumption looking forward i believe there are conditions for a slightly better steel market sentiment in mexico public construction is beginning to show signs of activity although slow as mexico s government has proved to be very cautious with government spending on the macro side the mexican peso has recently appreciated and interest rates are declining and no doubt that one of the most important development in the year has been the ratification of the usmca agreement by the u s and the mexican government after several years of intense negotiations we are now very close to enact this new trade agreement this is a very positive development for the steel industry in north america region it s wholly value changed and i think particularly for ternium rules of origin for steel have been strengthened and this means that value change from other regions will have an incentive to invest or relocate capacity to the usmca countries this agreement will bring will certainly bring a reduction in trade uncertainties which should readily foster investment and economic activity in mexico in the years to come turning to argentina in 2019 shipments in the southern region decreased 16 compared to 2018 in this market the economy has been weakening over the past few years as a result of public finance imbalances and their consequent infection on inflation interest rate and local currency value we reacted to this difficult environment and over the last couple of years we have been adjusting the operational setting of our industrial facility in the country for efficient production at continuously lower levels of the months so we can sustain our profitable operation looking forward the performance of argentina steel markets will be very dependent on the country s macroeconomic situation we believe steel shipments in argentina which are already at a very low level could remain relatively stable in 2020 subject to the argentina government being able to achieve a successful restructuring of the public debt as a first necessary step to normalize the public finance let me now give you a quick review of the performance of our slab facility in brazil after a very profitable year in 2018 there was a significant increase of iron ore prices in 2019 together with the record levels of pellet premium due to the effect of the world s iron ore supply of vale s dam collapse and the subsequent closure of iron ore capacity these difficult situation coupled with a decrease of slab prices to multi year lows put pressure on the profitability of our facility consequently during the second half of last year we adjusted brazilian mill production level to achieve an overall lower production cost minimizing the use of iron ore pellet and purchased coke as well as putting in place other cost cutting initiatives steel market conditions have improved since then with an increase in seaborne slab prices and a decrease in iron ore and coking coal cost to more reasonable level in these better context we are bringing production back to its normal level this is an example of how we can move to adapt our operations with sequential change so we can protect profitability in difficult times and maximize it when things improve another point is that the brazilian economy is turning and steel consumption is improving there this is positive for ternium as local companies in brazil will increase slab purchases from our facilities there okay let me wrap up my remarks with some final comments in 2019 we were able to show industry level margins in a difficult market environment in 2020 i expect to see our margins gradually improving in the quarters to come with a reversion of the downward trend we had seen during 2019 at the same time we will continue growing our business with the completion of our expansion projects in the second half of last year we started the new painting line in mexico and in december we started the new galvanize line also there for this year in april we will have the start up of the new rebar mill in colombia and by the end of the year the commissioning of the new hot rolling mill at the pesqueria facility the new hot rolling mill will enable a significant integration of our facility in brazil and will consolidate our world class production system with the latest technology to maximize efficiency and productivity this line was set up to start in december of this year but we are working hard to get it ready a couple of months earlier than our initial estimation we cannot wait to take advantage of all the opportunities for improvement of our product range and related services that these new facilities will provide okay i ll stop here so pablo please take over to comment over the performance in pablo brizzio chief financial officer thanks maximo good morning to all let me review our performance together with the webcast presentation in page 3 you can see there in 2019 we reported ebitda of 1 5 billion on shipments of 12 5 million tons shipments were somewhat low reflecting weak demand conditions in argentina and to a lesser degree in mexico ebitda margin at the bottom left chart decreased to 15 within a more sustainable level after returning the year in 2018 let s now review the next page our result in the last reported period ternium ebitda was 263 million in the fourth quarter and ebitda margin decreased to 12 of net sales or 90 per ton a low figure that reflected the low prevailing price environment in north america during the second half of 2019 and some first in first out effect of higher cost inventories the fourth quarter of this last year should be the lowest point as it had among other things a seasonally lower volume in mexico and low production rate in brazil a low realized steel price level in mexico that did not reflect yet the recovery in prices in november due to the contract price lag the cost per ton that did not decrease yet as i mentioned as a result of the first in first out accounting of purchasing slabs together with a particular margin squeeze in brazil that is now fading out as maximo explained and finally some negative impact related to inflation adjustment in argentina so we now expect ebitda to increase sequentially in the first quarter of 2020 with higher shipments and some recovery in steel margins mainly as a result of slightly lower costs we expect it to further recover in the second quarter of this year as for net income in the fourth quarter we reported 90 million or 0 36 per ads when compared to the third quarter earning per ads decreased 0 13 reflecting a lower operating income partially offset by lower effective tax rates that i will discuss later on on page 5 we can review our segments performance in each region as you can see in the fourth quarter shipments in mexico decreased sequentially and increased slightly versus the same quarter in the previous year after this seasonally weak fourth quarter we anticipate an increase in shipments in the first quarter of 2020 with stable industrial market and demand and some help from restocking after a very low level of inventory in the other market region we can see that shipment decreased 4 the main driver behind this decrease was a 65 000 tons decrease in slab sales to third parties as we have already stated partially offset by higher finished steel shipments as maximo mentioned ternium brasil facilities will bring this lagged production back to its normal level after the decrease in the end of 2019 supported by improved margins for the production of steel slabs in the southern region shipments decreased 4 sequentially in the fourth quarter and also decreased 4 compared to the same period in the previous year steel demand in the argentine market remains low looking forward to the seasonally low first quarter shipments in argentina are expected to decrease to a level similar to those recorded in the same period of 2019 turning to page 6 we can see the total steel shipment decreased 5 sequentially in the fourth quarter and 2 on a year over year basis looking forward and considering what we have already discussed we expect the steel shipments in the first quarter to sequentially increase going now to steel prices we can see the areas realized price continue decreasing in the fourth quarter of the year as expected driven by the weak price environment in north america in the second half of 2019 although as the price is revived from the lows as of october this last year in the first quarter 2020 we should not be fully reflected yet in our revenue per ton in mexico as higher realized price on the spot market will be offset by the lag effect of lower contract prices finally we can see in the lower left hand side chart that net sales decreased sequentially 8 reflecting the 5 decrease in shipments together with a 3 decrease in revenue per ton already discussed let s turn now to page 7 to review in more detail the driver of ebitda and net results in the fourth quarter of the year ternium ebitda the upper chart shows that main changes where the decrease in ebitda per ton mostly as a result of a lower revenue per ton and to a lesser extent the decrease in shipments and higher sg a on the second chart we can see that the lower operating income was partially offset by a lower effective tax rate and better results from usiminas the effective tax rate in the fourth quarter included a non cash positive effect on deferred taxes due to the appreciation of the mexican peso against the u s dollar the opposite has happened in the previous quarter and the mexican peso depreciated before going into the next slide of the presentation i would like to comment about the change in the functional currency of our subsidiary in argentina from january 1 2020 ternium argentina will use the u s dollar as its functional currency instead of the local currency as it used to do until then this is a prospective change so it does not affect the previously issued number until december 31 2019 the change in functional currency of ternium argentina will significantly reduce the volatility of the company s earnings that was due to the foreign exchange movements and the application of inflation adjustments let s now turn to page 8 to finish our presentation we can see free cash flow in 2019 reached 595 million with capital expenditure reaching a strong 1 1 million as our expected program progressed as planned capital expenditure should remain high during 2020 to a level approximately of 800 million and we still have at hand of course the completion by year end of the new hot rolling mill in our pesqueria unit in mexico as maximo mentioned ternium s net debt continued decreasing in 2019 it went down by 282 million to 1 5 billion at the end of december and the 1 20 per ads dividend proposed for the year is equivalent to a free cash flow yield of 15 so thanks very much for your time and now we are ready to take any questions you may have please operator let s proceed with the q a session questions and answers operator our first question is from thiago lofiego with bradesco bbi your line is open thiago lofiego bradesco bbi analyst hi thank you good morning everyone maximo i have two questions the first one more medium to long term thinking about the company s strategy so you do guide you guys have do have organic growth on the pipeline but we also know that there may be some m a opportunities especially in mexico so could you comment on capital allocation and how the company expects to spend money in the coming years thinking about the different regions and different opportunities that you do you guys see or in other words do you see more room for further organic expansions in the next five years or do you think that we might see some m a down the road the second question is on mexico what is your expectation regarding when construction activity infrastructure begins to rebound so do you see that as more of a 2021 story at this point or could we see a more consistent rebound already underlining 2020 and also do you see as a concern the new capacities coming on stream i know we ve discussed this in the past but just to get an update on your view about the new capacities coming on stream in the mexican market vis a vis demand growth thank you maximo vedoya chief executive officer thiago thank you very much let me start by the second question about the construction activity in mexico as you know i mean the trends of the construction in mexico has two sides for the last several years i think at least four or five years infrastructure which was led by the government decreased every year i think for the last four or five years but it was compensated and even was a little bit higher by construction by the private sector but this changed last year so the private sector now decreased also so both main drivers of construction were back in 2019 i think there are two sides i think 2020 is going to be a little bit better than 2019 but i think that we in 2021 will be a little bit better and we will see the trend by then investment of the government has started to improve but then this is going to take some time there are some project i mean in mexico every time the government change there is a stop in all the infrastructure projects it happened in 2012 and it happened in 2019 with the change of the government but i think that this is getting a little bit it s not going to be huge but it s going to be a change in trend regarding the event in the private sector the stoppage was a lot in the industry i mean most of the investment coming to the steel industry were relocated in mexico stopped because of the nafta renegotiation and this is going to start changing it s going to take a while but some of that effect we are also going to see this year so overall it s not going to be a huge improve but there is going to be an improve and i think in 2021 as you said this improve is going to be stronger even stronger regarding the capacity in mexico which was your third question i don t see a problem in mexico import s almost 8 million tons of steel and we are putting a capacity we import almost 1 million of that we are increasing capacity a little bit less than 4 million tons so and there is another project i don t know when it s going to be completed of 2 million tons so we have the capacity to fight all those imports which i think we have a very competitive structure of cost to fight that imports and to supply all the customers that today we cannot and that there are customers that need to be supplied by a usmca country after the sign of the usmca treatment so i think we are in a perfect situation to put the perfect timing to put this capacity on the market in mexico so i am not very much concerned of the increase of capacity of course we have to fight for the customers but i think that we have a very good cost structure very great commercial team and we know all the customers so i think they are eager to accept us and that we supply that volume to them again we don t have capacity today to do it and with this we are going to have the capacity to do it so i think again it s a very very good timing and the signing of the usmca was perfect for us because it s going to start in july or august depending on when canada sign in and so we are going to be just in the moment to start supplying these customers that would that are going to be in need of north american steel now to the first part of the questions and the long term strategy we discussed it along sometimes in some of the calls we were focused we are focused today in finishing this investment 1 1 billion of capex this year and as a pablo said 800 million of capex next year is a record height for ternium in all the history so we were much focused on that what are the next step for ternium clearly there are going to be some organic growth we have projects that we are analyzing in mexico in colombia in brazil also again brazil is a country that is going to grow and we have a very solid industrial base in brazil so but those are coming after the completion and the start up of all our projects m a i mean m a we are always looking for acquisitions i mean and if those acquisitions are in the americas we are going to look for them so that could be a possibility but we don t have anything today that i can say we are going to do that acquisition or that other and but and regarding acquisitions it s also important that i add it that although the market is looking better in 2020 there are currently a lot of uncertainties in the market so we need to be extremely cautious when we analyze any m a acquisitions and we are going to be extremely cautious when analyzing an m a acquisition i hope this answered everything you asked thiago i don t know if i forgot something thiago lofiego bradesco bbi analyst it did it did just a very quick follow up maximo you mentioned a potential future investments in mexico colombia and brazil so when we think about brazil are we thinking about potential new roll like new rolling facilities tied to csa ternium brasil there or would that be like the rationale to just sell into the maximo vedoya chief executive officer no no no i think that no brazil has rolling capacity in excess as you know we are investor in usiminas and usiminas has rolling capacity very near our plant in ternium brasil our plant is very very near and so one of the growth opportunities is to supply more slabs to the cubatao facility which has an excess capacity i mean which has a capacity that is not using and i think those are the growing opportunity that we should analyze in brazil thiago lofiego bradesco bbi analyst okay that s clear okay thank you maximo maximo vedoya chief executive officer no thank you too thiago operator our next question is from alex hacking with citi your line is open alexander hacking citi analyst yeah good morning thanks for the question i just have one question which is around the new facility in colombia how are you thinking about ebitda per ton through the cycle for that facility or i guess kind of a range of ebitda per ton i m not particularly familiar with columbia rebar market so i m not sure how margin structures there operate and i guess actually let me ask one more you mentioned you re potentially pulling pesqueria forward by a couple of months so congratulations on that any indication about how much volume you would expect to ship from that facility at the end of this year and any indication about what utilization rate you would kind of be targeting by the end of 2021 would you be looking to be at 100 utilization rate by the end of the year or it ll be a more gradual ramp up thank you very much maximo vedoya chief executive officer thank you alex i ll answer the second question and i ll leave the difficult one to pablo the first one pesqueria is going to start i mean the timing the official timing is still december so not much production from that from the hot steel mill this year but we are very confident that we can start late in october these are going to be only two months for this year and remember these are it s a 1 1 billion investment so it has a long a long start up so not much and the first two months they are dedicated to making the test for all the different products that these hot steel mill has to do so all the running tests for the different products and that takes a lot of time for the commissioning of the hot steel mill but by the end of 2021 we expect to be 100 that s for sure there s a long curve of stop but by the end of 2021 i think it s a little bit earlier it should be by october or september should be by 100 pablo brizzio chief financial officer okay thanks max for some of the question let me so alex the columbia facility basically is in line with pesqueria we have like csa at the moment of acquisition which is increasing the participation and the value chain of the production of steel up to now we have excess capacity in colombia in the long product market and we were limited with the local production that we had and we were importing some product to supply the market so what we are doing with this facility is not only expand the market reach that we got and substitute imports as we did in all the markets where we are but also take advantage of further increasing the margin that we can extract out of our production because we will be moving from finished product to build it as an input for the production of our facility so this clearly should improve the margins of the colombian operation and moving the margin of the columbia operation closer to the areas margin of ternium as a whole so clearly that s the valuation that we want to follow that s the target of these investment and again though the volume in comparison to ternium ternium has last year produced and sold 12 2 million tons here we are thinking of an expansion or talking of an expansion of around 0 5 million ton not a minor one but this will contribute to sustain and to get the margins of ternium in the range that we always want to be which is we re doing 15 and 20 and clearly these type of expansion or these type of projects are putting ternium in a better position to sustain these level of profitability alexander hacking citi analyst perfect very helpful thanks pablo and also maximo pablo brizzio chief financial officer you re welcome maximo vedoya chief executive officer you re welcome operator our next question is from rodolfo angele with j p morgan your line is open rodolfo de angele j p morgan analyst hey good morning everyone my i just have one question i would like to hear your thoughts on working capital it was one of the reasons why the cash flow was strong last year so just wanted to hear from you what is a sustainable level if there should be a hike in the first quarter or any thoughts on working capital thanks guys pablo brizzio chief financial officer okay let me let me take this question rodolfo clearly as you mentioned a key contributor to the free cash flow generation was the reduction in working capital and there are two sides of this reduction in working capital the first one was a real volume reduction in working capital as we always manage on and i think maximo made it very clear at the beginning of the year one of the target of the company was to be more efficient in the decision of working capital and the second one which is clear and of course is the price of the raw materials and the finished products that we have in our inventories the negative side of that is the review the positive side of that is that the reviews the value of our inventories clearly the second part will not be present there anymore because we are not expecting to see there ll be fluctuation of prices that we saw during last year so the we will continue to work in the efficiencies in the management of our inventories but also we need to take into consideration that we are expanding production during this year 2020 we have one facility that will be fully utilized by the end of the year which is the colombia one but we will start working with the mexican facility in pesqueria which is a significant one that will require some level of inventory so all in all the initial expectation is that should not fluctuate that much the level of inventories and probably will not be a contributor to the generation of free cash flow during 2020 rodolfo de angele j p morgan analyst okay thanks pablo pablo brizzio chief financial officer you re welcome operator your next question is from thiago ojea with goldman sachs your line is open thiago ojea goldman sachs analyst hi good morning thanks for the questions my first question is regarding the long term strategy of ternium for years ternium was very successful in being short on its slabs and have an excess capacity on rolling then after the csa acquisition it became the opposite you were longer on the slabs and now with the new pesqueria mill you will be slightly short again how do should we think in ternium view this would you clearly that you mentioned that you are going to invest in your projects would steel be more toward like rolling capacity and specifically on pesqueria and your new mill after this is online how should we consider costs going forward how the structure on cost will shift in mexico thank you maximo vedoya chief executive officer thank you very much thiago i ll answer the first one and then as usual the difficult one for pablo i mean we as we always said we want the flexi we like the flexibility and before our acquisition of the plant in rio de janeiro the csa plant we said we have the three we have the natural gas reduction for one side we have blast furnace for one third the natural gas one third was blast furnace and then one third a little bit more we were short on slabs and we buy slabs from the market and that was gave us a lot of flexibility with the increase of the complexity of the mexican market and the complexity of the product being so short on slabs let me put it this way being so short of slabs started to develop some problems because we couldn t have the capacity of developing the steel for the needs of our more sophisticated customers so i think the acquisition of csa which brought us long on slabs was very good for the timing and of course for the price we pay it was much smaller the investment and we have to build that capacity and second gave us the ability to work with our sophisticated customers in the development of all these things that we are doing today now that we are investing in the hot steel mill this is going to be even better because we are going to be able to produce the full range of all the products of the most sophisticated steels that are produced around the world and give us the facility to work in the development of the customers with that but we are going to be short of slabs of at least 2 million tons to 3 million tons which for us is quite a comfortable level so if you have to think of what we are going to do forward or what we are thinking i said we like this arrangement and if we grow we are going to grow given space that we do have to buy slabs in the market and remain a little bit flexible especially for the downturn of the market that could happen sometimes pablo brizzio chief financial officer okay let me let me take the second question clearly the pesqueria project has different effects we understand all of them are positive in respect to the margins of the company the first one is the one that maximo mentioned which is we will be able to substitute or produce in our own facilities the high end products that up to now we are not able to produce so this is improving the margin of our own production the second one is substituting of imports that we are doing of some products that then will be produced in the new facility in pesqueria and this is not a minor amount even maximo during the opening remarks mentioned that it is close to 1 million tons so there we ll be gaining the margin of instead of buying the finished product producing that product and gaining the transformation part of the product and of course the third portion is that we will increase our product offering because we will be having a higher level of production and the total level of shipments in the mexican market should increase quite a lot so putting all the three things together clearly there should be an increase in margins in our operation in mexico clearly you will like to have a number to that but the only thing i can say is that this is again in the same line of improving the margins of the company and sustaining the profitability level within the range that we consider that ternium should have which is between the famous 15 to 20 thiago ojea goldman sachs analyst thank you pablo brizzio chief financial officer you re welcome operator our next question is from carlos de alba with morgan stanley your line is open carlos de alba morgan stanley analyst yeah good morning everyone so the first question is on brazil you mentioned maximo that you expect the company to ternium brasil to go back to higher levels of production is this around 1 2 million tons or higher on a quarterly basis and then just to clarify if you could clarify the comments on brazil potential investment i understood that the company is not interested in adding rolling capacity to csa so does that mean that the company could potentially expand only the slab production or do you want to do something with usiminas in cubatao if you could clarify that will be great and then still on the capital allocation and investment plans do you how do you see the expansions in mexico going forward do you expect that after this current cycle is completed and is fully ramped up ternium mexico would add more downstream or perhaps it is time to also add upstream capacity in the country and then final question on dividends and the company or the board decided to maintain the dividend payment of 1 20 per ads this is the first year in several where the company does an increased dividend you could argue that the company has a space or had a space to pay more certainly the balance sheet remains strong even though net debt to ebitda increased a little bit but quarter on quarter and you are arguably past the current peak of the ongoing cycle capex cycle so if you could maybe put in context what was the rationale you think that the board had when they decided to keep the dividend flat maximo vedoya chief executive officer okay thank you carlos long question so i ll try to not forget anything but please interrupt me if i do i ll start with brazil as you know brazil produce and i m going to talk about yearly basis because of the how the brazilian operation the brazilian mill has to go into the realigning of the competitors talking about quarters one quarter can change with another because it has these realigning so it s very difficult to talk quarter by quarter so i ll put the production in years 2018 was 4 6 million tons 2019 we produced 4 4 million tons what we expect to produce again in 2020 is 4 7 million tons which was what we did expect in 2019 remember we did we increased the production and that by 2021 2022 we are expecting to reach near the 5 million tons which is very hard but that s our goal but in 2019 we were expecting to produce 4 7 million tons and we produced 4 4 million tons because of this downtrend of the market so 2020 our new estimation is 4 7 million tons i hope with this i answered the question but we are at full capacity in our brazilian operation carlos de alba morgan stanley analyst that s clear maximo vedoya chief executive officer yeah and regarding the investment in brazil let me be clear because i don t want to mislead you we have nothing concrete yet i mean what we have is that we have an investment in usiminas we are one of the main shareholders of usiminas and usiminas is doing better brazil is growing so that s a very good it s very good for us we have a huge facility one of the most modern facility for slab production in brazil and i think that this grow of the market this improvement in brazil and the brazilian economy we are going to take advantage of that and so we want a presence in brazil but we don t have any concrete as what are the next steps in the brazilian operation we are analyzing different projects some of them are based on reduction of costs huge reduction of costs like ones that we made in mexico but again they are very initial step of analyzing the different alternatives of the different views of the brazilian market so don t expect anything in our balance sheet in 2020 about brazil and then you asked about the investment in mexico upstream or downstream i mean i think the mexican market has still a great opportunity for us i mean there are still growth opportunity for growth and the opportunity for growth in both upstream and downstream i think that we are looking for some downstream future investments again i don t think that in 2020 we re going to start any of those but we are looking and then in the upstream i mean you know the usmca when it is approved it s very good because the rule of origins are much stronger and it benefits us a lot but for some part of the market the terminal how you say it in english the automobile manufacturers in seven years from the time it s signed the rule of origin has to change and it has to be melted and poured for only that part of the market and so today we in seven years we are going to accomplish part of that with our facility in guerrero but not all so thinking about an expansion upstream is also a logical situation for us but again we are not going to see anything of that in 2020 we are going to think of that through this year but yes it s one of the projects we are analyzing in a very small scale only to provide that melted and pour to this automobile customers in seven years so we have a lot of time to analyze and see what our best option is and the last part the last one was the dividend that you said no carlos i don t think i answered the first three didn t carlos de alba morgan stanley analyst yeah you did maximo vedoya chief executive officer so the dividend and this is a question that usually pablo answers but i m not going to let pablo brizzio answer it now pablo brizzio chief financial officer okay maximo vedoya chief executive officer i mean i think the dividend yield or the dividend ratio that we are paying is higher i do acknowledge that we have a discussion if we have to increase it or not but i think that the numbers i mean having a dividend yield of 6 i think is one of the highest in the industry no doubt about or a payout ratio of 42 is also i think a payout ratio very high so i know we don t have a dividend yield a dividend policy but with these we want to say now that we are continue committed to paying dividends every year i think with the decrease of the margins of ebitda of this year and i understand next year will be probably better but i think with this decrease maintaining the dividends is a very good sign for all our investors and we are continue committed with that carlos de alba morgan stanley analyst all right thank you very much maximo vedoya chief executive officer i hope i answered your question with that carlos de alba morgan stanley analyst yeah very clear thank you very much operator our final question is from caio ribeiro with credit suisse your line is open caio ribeiro credit suisse analyst yes good morning and thank you for the opportunity so my first question is regarding the outlook that you mentioned for first quarter of 20 and the second quarter 20 you mentioned that you expect ebitda to increase sequentially mainly as a function of stronger shipments and a slightly lower costs but i wanted to see what you re expecting in terms of prices right there had been a recent pickup in hrc prices in the u s even though that seems to have somewhat reversed lately but i was just wondering if you expect to be able to somewhat reflect that recent increase in the u s in your prices in mexico as well and then secondly i just wanted to see if you could provide a little bit more details on the sg a increase that you had in this quarter on a sequential basis and on a yearly basis as well just if you could explain what was the main driver for that thank you maximo vedoya chief executive officer thank you caio i ll start with the first one outlook and you mentioned prices there are simply different prices prices i mean in the in our first quarter you are going to be reflecting the increase in prices in slabs the sales of slabs from our brazilian operation and low prices in the u s are increasing as you said not the full effect is going to be seen in the shipments of mexico because remember in mexico we have i d say half and half but half our shipments are industrial customers so they re a little bit more and usually those are contract based prices on a quarterly basis so the prices of those customers are probably going to decrease from the fourth quarter to the first quarter but the customers of the spot basis the other 50 are going to increase in the first quarter so the net debt would be highly a little bit better but not much better in the second quarter the contract based prices are going to be higher so you re going to see the full effect in the second quarter of this increase volumes though are going to be higher in mexico that s for sure i mean as i said mexico fourth quarter and the whole year was not a very good year for apparent consumption of steel consumption in mexico but in the first quarter we are seeing an increase in our customer orders and we expect to continue that way in the second quarter so volumes are going to increase and prices not that much in the first quarter but we are going to take advantage in the second quarter i think i don t know if i answered pablo do you have the second part pablo brizzio chief financial officer yeah i have the second part hi caio and thanks for your question because it s important for us to clarify these points in fact we didn t have an increase in normal sg a we have specific of particular issues that reflected a number that is higher than the previous quarter and the two of them are the first one is the increase of an asset tax in argentina up to last year this or before the interest of the new government this asset tax was 0 25 and the new government passed a law increasing this or doubling this tax to 0 5 so 4 million of that increase is related to that so we need it to register so this will not be registered as an item in the following quarters and the second one you know that we have a contract that we acquired together with the acquisition of csa now ternium brasil to supply slabs to the calvert facility of metal in the u s since it was a long term contract we needed to account it for in our purchase price allocation so after that we need to amortize this contract by the volume that we shipped since we have higher volume in the fourth quarter in comparison to the third quarter the amortization level was higher and this is the other effect that showed a higher sg a but the real sg a or the expenditure of sg a basically were in line in both quarters caio ribeiro credit suisse analyst i see that s very clear thank you pablo brizzio chief financial officer you re very welcome operator i will now turn our call over to our chief executive officer for closing remarks maximo vedoya chief executive officer okay thank you all very much for being part of our conference call today please give us a call for any questions or comments or anything and if not we ll see you next conference call thank you very much operator duration 57 minutes

commentary with the 2020 election season officially upon us the democratic candidates are all keen to distinguish themselves by what they re promising to deliver to voters many if not most of those voters would consider themselves middle class even though middle class is defined much differently today than two or three decades ago but president donald trump s economy hasn t yet restored the middle class to where it once was of course by most popular measures the u s economy is doing incredibly well from record low unemployment across all demographics to a record high stock market and rising wages americans are definitely better off than they were four years ago but in other important areas quality of life for the middle class as a whole remains tenuous but wait this is the best economy in half a century right well in some areas that s definitely true in general the cost of living may be somewhat more affordable with the booming economy but in others as annie lowery of the atlantic points out in a recent article there are some disturbing realities that have drastically undercut the american middle class those negative trends are the three big pillars of the u s middle class housing health care and education today about half of the so called middle class can t afford any of those in fact 40 percent of american adults don t have an extra 400 in the bank to cover even a minimal unexpected expense and as you might expect many also carry heavy amounts of credit card debt it didn t use to be this way meaning of middle class has changed the reality of the middle class has changed and not for the better it used to be that middle class american families could live comfortably with one wage earner in the home own two cars put their kids through college and enjoy their retirement on a small pension and social security it seems almost surreal to think about it but there was a time when the paycheck from middle class professions such as teaching nursing engineering business management and the like was more than sufficient to allow families to live comfortably even trade occupations such as carpentry plumbing or electrical would more than cover mortgage payments and other monthly expenses furthermore health care insurance was affordable because medical care was too college was also affordable parents saved money on the side to pay for college educations without worrying about saddling their kids with debts the size of mortgages federal policies gutted the middle class but the days of the comfortable middle class are definitely behind us coincidentally or perhaps not so much the decline of the american middle class tracked rather closely the imposition of globalism on the u s economy for instance the imposition of nafta on american workers in the mid 1990s led to factories moving from the united states to mexico and a rise in immigrants mainly illegal flooding into the country this drove wages downward turning formerly decent paying middle class trade occupations into low to minimum wage jobs dominated by cheap illegal labor a few years later the normalization of u s china relations led to a further mass exodus of u s manufacturing jobs to china and the influx of labor kept wages low while the social burden of immigrants from unpaid medical care subsidized housing food education and other expenses went skyward consequently so did taxes to help pay for those costs the real cost of living and who paid the bulk of those taxes not the poor and not the rich either it was of course the american middle class meanwhile middle class wage rates stalled in the mid 1990s and stayed flat for the next two decades and why wouldn t they federal trade and immigration policies had destroyed the economic conditions that had for more than a century allowed the middle class to thrive but as the u s population and demand for college degrees continued to grow amid three recessions from 1991 to 2010 college space didn t keep up and as the wages of former occupations that were once the backbone of the middle class continued to stall the need and demand for a college education went up but the supply of college classrooms didn t and continually fell behind it s only since 2012 that demand has fallen costs however continue to rise increasing by 25 percent in the past decade this college education supply shortage was made worse by the u s government offering student loans to help middle and lower class students pay for the ever rising costs of a college education it enabled more students legal and illegal to be able to afford a college education but drove costs and demand up even more what s more double digit health care inflation means that fewer americans can afford quality care in fact medical bills are the top cause of bankruptcy and financial hardship for the middle class saving the middle class must be a top priority the sad irony today is that the three metrics of life that used to be the pillars of the middle class are increasingly out of reach for most americans that must change and sooner rather than later without a vibrant and solvent middle class the united states ceases to be the great land of opportunity and political stability that it has almost always been and of course education costs continue to skyrocket as a result so does the level of student debt among the middle class this puts an additional burden on their ability to save for a house retirement or just for a rainy day the sad irony today is that the three metrics of life that used to be the pillars of the middle class are increasingly out of reach for most americans that must change and sooner rather than later without a vibrant and solvent middle class the united states ceases to be the great land of opportunity and political stability that it has almost always been the question is if it can be done which party will have the vision and political will to do what needs to be done to do it is what bernie biden buttigieg bloomberg or klobuchar offering the american people the answer given the statist agendas of these left wing and outright socialist candidates it isn t likely that any of them have the desire or policies that will help the american middle class their answers differ mainly in rhetoric but not so much in substance all will continue similar policies that have led to the destruction of the middle class over the past three decades higher taxes on the middle class to fund more low quality health care for those who don t belong here globalization that sends jobs out of the country porous borders to deepen their voter base and more state benefits for people who don t pay into the system that leaves a massive opportunity for the current administration presuming trump is re elected he must focus his efforts on restoring the middle class that goes well beyond the stock market and a ready military he must restore those three middle class pillars of affordable home ownership health care and education that means further and permanently lowering individual tax rates breaking the health care provider cartels to drive market competition and allowing individuals and family the same low group rates through any affiliation as for wages it means stopping u s firms from hiring illegal labor or importing labor to replace u s skilled workers in the high paying high tech industry will these policies resurrect the middle class overnight of course not but they would be steps in the right direction james gorrie is a writer and speaker based in southern california he

gross margin was 476 6 million compared to 492 8 million a decrease of 3 3 over the prior year driven by the commodity deflation impact on net sales mostly offset by an improved product mix and our continued focus on pricing discipline gross margin percentage remained relatively steady at 27 0 versus 27 1 in the prior year period selling general and administrative expenses sg a was consistent with the fourth quarter of 2018 as operational efficiencies fully offset increased variable expenses related to higher sales volume sg a as a percentage of net sales was 22 8 an increase of 60 basis points primarily the result of the impact of commodity price deflation on our net sales interest expense interest expense was 27 5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 an increase of 4 1 million from the fourth quarter of 2018 this increase was primarily attributable to one time charges of 3 5 million related to the partial repayment of the term loan in that period in addition interest expense for the fourth quarter 2018 included a 3 2 million gain on debt extinguishment however these increases were partially offset by reduced interest expense attributable to lower outstanding debt balances in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 income tax expense income tax expense was 6 3 million or an effective tax rate of 13 2 compared to 15 0 million or an effective tax rate of 22 4 in the prior year the year over year decrease was mainly driven by one time items impacting the rate in the quarter adjusted net income net income was 41 4 million or 0 35 per diluted share compared to 52 0 million or 0 45 per diluted share in the same period a year ago adjusted net income was 47 2 million or 0 40 per diluted share compared to 53 1 million or 0 46 per diluted share in the prior year quarter the decrease was primarily driven by the deflationary impact of commodity prices on net sales adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda declined 15 7 million to 109 3 million a decrease of 12 6 the decrease was primarily driven by lower gross margin dollars due to the impact of commodity price deflation on net sales as a result adjusted ebitda declined to 6 2 of sales in the fourth quarter from 6 9 in the same period a year ago full year december 31 2019 financial information net sales net sales were 7 3 billion a 5 8 decrease compared to the prior year driven by the impact of commodity price deflation sales volume increased by an estimated 6 5 driven by increased volumes across all of our product categories led by growth in value added product categories gross margin gross profit increased 53 9 million to 2 0 billion our gross margin percentage increased to 27 2 from 24 9 in the prior year period a 230 basis point improvement the increase was primarily attributable to an improved product mix the decline in the cost of commodities relative to our customer pricing commitments and continued pricing discipline in addition sales growth from our higher margin value added product categories contributed to increased gross profit dollars and percentage compared to the prior year period interest expense interest expense was 109 6 million in 2019 an increase of 1 3 million from 2018 the increase was due to lower outstanding debt balances offset by 10 2 million in one time charges related to the debt transactions executed during the year in

or 1 90 per diluted share in the year ago period representing an increase of 0 19 per diluted share the year over year increase in adjusted net income of 23 9 million or 10 8 was primarily driven by the higher gross margin adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda grew 14 5 million to 516 1 million or 7 1 of net sales compared to 501 6 million or 6 5 of sales attributable to higher gross margin dollars partially offset by increases in variable compensation related to the growth in estimated sales volume and profitability the 2 9 increase in adjusted ebitda and the 60 basis points improvement in ebitda margin were primarily due to the factors described above capital structure leverage and liquidity information net debt was 1 285 9 million as of december 31 2019 the net debt to adjusted ebitda

irrigation sales greater precipitation and more moderate spring and summer temperatures in idaho power s service area led agricultural irrigation customers to use 12 percent less energy per customer to operate irrigation pumps during 2019 compared with 2018 to a lesser extent sales volumes on a per customer basis in 2019 were negatively affected by lower per customer commercial and industrial sales the net decrease in retail revenues per mwh reduced operating income by 2 8 million in 2019 compared with 2018 as provided by the settlement stipulation approved by the idaho public utilities commission ipuc in 2018 related to income tax reform retail revenues per mwh in 2019 were reduced by 7 4 million of non cash accruals for future amortization related to regulatory deferrals that would otherwise be a future liability of idaho customers compared with a 1 5 million revenue reduction in 2018 in 2018 a corresponding 4 0 million of non cash accruals were recorded as other o m expense for the amortization of specified deferrals the decrease in retail revenues per mwh from these non cash accruals was partially offset by changes in the customer sales mix as volumes sold to residential customers in 2019 made up a greater portion of the customer sales mix compared with 2018 residential customers generally pay a higher per mwh rate than other customers during 2019 transmission wheeling related revenues decreased 5 3 million compared with 2018 idaho power s oatt rates decreased 10 percent in october 2018 and 13 percent in october 2019 to a lesser extent lower volumes also reduced transmission wheeling related revenues other o m expenses were 8 7 million lower in 2019 compared with 2018 as idaho power s continued focus on managing other o m expenses resulted in lower expenses across a number of areas lower bad debt expense reduced other o m expenses by 1 1 million due primarily to enhanced collection efforts and a strong economy also other o m expenses in 2018 included 4 0 million of non cash amortization expense of regulatory deferrals pursuant to the settlement stipulation approved by the ipuc in 2018 related to income tax reform based on its 2019 idaho roe idaho power recorded no additional aditc amortization or provision against current revenues for sharing of earnings with customers in 2019 under the idaho regulatory settlement stipulation approved in october 2014 in 2018 idaho power recorded a 5 0 million provision against revenues for sharing of earnings with customers non operating income and expenses net increased 9 9 million in 2019 compared with 2018 a temporary deviation from an idaho power substantive postretirement plan resulted in a 4 2 million charge in 2018 that did not recur in 2019 allowance for equity funds used during construction increased 2 8 million in 2019 as the average construction work in progress balance was higher throughout 2019 compared with 2018 also investment income from the rabbi trust associated with idaho power s nonqualified defined benefit pension plans increased 2 2 million based on stronger asset returns in 2019 compared with 2018 during 2018 idaho power recorded tax benefits for a 5 7 million remeasurement of deferred taxes resulting from income tax reform and 1 3 million for tax deductible bond redemption costs incurred in 2018 there was no such remeasurement or bond redemption in 2019 these items combined with higher pre tax net income in 2019 resulted in higher income tax expense in 2019 compared with 2018 amortization of vintage investment tax credits that became available in 2019 lowered income tax expense by 3 4 million most of which is not expected to recur at ifs a 3 0 million increase in distributions from the sale of low income housing properties led to higher ifs net income in 2019 compared with 2018 2020 annual earnings guidance and estimated key operating and financial metrics idacorp is initiating its earnings guidance estimate for 2020

itaÃ£Âº unibanco holding s a itau unibanco nyse nyse itub is one of the largest non state owned financial institutions in brazil along with a growing presence across latin america while itau has faced a difficult operating environment over the past decade given the weak macro conditions in brazil we highlight stronger operational trends more recently supporting a positive outlook the company just reported its latest quarterly results that showed continued growth and profitability one of the favorable themes has been an ongoing digital transformation with more of the banking business moving online driving efficiency gains we think the stock presents some compelling value at the current level and is set to benefit from improving economic conditions in brazil source finviz com itub q4 and 2019 earnings recap itau reported its fiscal 2019 q4 earnings on february 11 with eps of brl 0 77 revenue of brl 31 8 billion increased 11 8 year over year while net income in the quarter of brl 7 3 billion was up by 12 6 year over year highlights in the quarter include 20 basis point expansion in roe to 23 7 at the consolidated level and 50bps for brazil operations loans portfolio increased by 11 year over year and 2 6 quarter over quarter non performing loans have been relatively stable at 3 0 across the firm while declining by 30bps to 3 4 in brazil from 3 7 in the quarter last year margin with clients the company s financial metric based on a combination of net interest margin and related credit spreads reached brl 18 1 billion up 2 9 quarter over quarter and 11 7 year over year source company ir overall this was a solid quarter although some line items were on the lower range of previous guidance the cost of credit was slightly higher than expected driven by the increase in the loan portfolio and higher provisions for loan losses outside of brazil for the year the margin with clients grew by 8 6 and slightly below estimates between 9 and 12 in 2019 service fee revenue was a strong point increasing by 5 9 year over year source company ir digital transformation one of the trends we are looking at as a positive is an improving efficiency ratio that reached 44 in q4 from 48 7 in q4 2018 this metric is the non interest expense as a proportion of net income with a lower number being better in brazil and latin america as more customers are using online services itau has been able to reduce costs with reduced headcount and less need for brick and mortar branches the share of total payments transactions in value conducted online reached 81 in 2019 from 68 in 2017 source company ir the company ended the year with 94 6k employees down 5 4 from 100 3k to end 2018 the company also closed 372 branches in the year the result is that non interest expense increased by just 2 5 which was below the inflation rate and also lower than previous guidance the company notes that its digital platform is a higher margin business and a continued transition of customers towards the online services will support earnings going forward source company ir 2020 guidance for the year ahead the management does not offer earnings guidance but instead provides target ranges for various operational and financial metrics on a consolidated basis the company sees the total credit portfolio increase between 8 5 and 11 5 which compares to 10 9 in 2019 targeted growth in financial margin with clients between brl 5 7 billion and brl 6 7 billion for 2020 at the midpoint compares to brl 6 2 billion in 2019 what stands out in the 2020 guidance is an estimate for non interest expenses between a decline of 2 and an increase of 1 at the consolidated level the implication here is that higher earnings would be driven by lower costs and expenses overall this is a continuation of the trend observed in 2019 supported by another improvement in the efficiency ratio source company ir at the macro level an expectation for gdp growth in brazil to rebound to 2 2 in 2020 from 1 2 in 2019 is also positive for the business outlook the economy is seen benefiting from a benign interest rate environment and accelerating job creation an estimate of 938k formal jobs to be added in brazil in 2020 up from 641k if confirmed would be the highest since 2013 source company ir dividend it s important to note that itau is also an interesting dividend stock the company distributes a small fixed monthly dividend of brl 0 015 per share or approximately 0 0035 per adr at the current exchange rate there is also a larger semi annual dividend that is variable according to a targeted payout ratio range depending on return on equity roe and risk weighted asset rwa growth levels for 2019 roe of 23 7 with rwa growth of 9 dictated payout ratio on earnings between 60 and 65 source company ir the dividend yield noted by the company for shares trading in the local brazil market is currently 5 5 considering the depreciation of the brazilian real currency over the past year the effective yield on the distribution is closer to 8 8 we calculate this by considering usd 0 655 per adr share in total dividends paid over in the calendar year 2019 assuming a flat fx rate and the share price at the current level we estimate a forward yield of about 6 for 2020 given a recent decline in the share price the table below presents the dividend data for itub over the past year itub adr share distribution history from dr bank source bnymellon analysis and forward looking commentary we like itub s leadership position in various banking segments and think the efficiency gains with continued progress at cost cutting measures support a positive operational and earnings outlook that being said itub in many ways is a macro trade and a bet on the future of brazil for itub adr shareholders continued weakness in the brazilian real remains a risk and has pressured the share price in terms of u s dollars indeed the current exchange rate represents a record low for the brazilian currency as it now trades at brl 4 35 per usd source xe com the trend of depreciation over the past several years has been based on a combination of economic growth below expectations and a technical consequence of the narrowing spread between brazil s interest rates and u s dollar yields essentially as inflation in brazil trended lower the central bank was able to cut the monetary policy rate known as selic to record low levels currently at 4 5 the effect has been to diminish the relative yield spread advantage in brazil s interest rates compared to dollar debt markets thereby pressuring the currency on the other hand there are reasons to believe that depreciation in the brl will be more limited going forward the central bank has signaled a pause to the rate cutting cycle with a view that the lagged effect of last year s cuts should begin to support economic growth going forward in our view there is no reason to suspect brazil is vulnerable to a currency crisis type scenario that has gripped other emerging markets in recent years like argentina or turkey favorably brazil continues to generate a trade surplus narrow current account deficit and improve fiscal indicators in 2019 the level of gross public debt to gdp declined for the first time since 2014 in december s p ratings changed the outlook on brazil s bb sovereign credit to positive citing improving economic conditions for itub the stock would benefit from a stronger brl going forward on better than expected economic growth in brazil gains in the labor market suggest continued credit growth and higher demand for related banking services supporting its operating profile the other consideration here is valuation for the year ahead current market consensus estimates eps of 0 73 representing a forward p e multiple of 11x and about flat compared to the 2019 result total revenue forecasts at 27 8 billion represent a 2 9 year over year increase and a forward p s multiple of 2 8x source seeking alpha premium for context the average p e ratio over the past three years is 12 5x while itub traded with a p e ratio as high as 15x as recently as early 2019 we rate shares of itub as a buy based on the combination of an improving macro outlook for brazil favorable trends in operating metrics and relative value in valuations a strengthening brl from current levels would drive the earnings estimates in usd comparatively higher representing more upside for the stock price the stock s forward dividend yield at 6 0 is also compelling data by ycharts takeaway despite challenging macro conditions in recent years brazil s itau has delivered consistent growth and profitability we think the stock will benefit going forward as it consolidates its market leadership position with earnings supported by continued improvements in efficiency as it shifts to more online and digital services while the brazilian real has been weak we think further depreciation from current levels should be limited and a reversal stronger from here would represent further upside for itub adrs apart from risks such as a global cyclical slowdown or weaker than expected macro data in brazil monitoring points going forward include trends in credit growth and non interest expenses as key metrics

information and are available free of charge by calling toll free at 1 800 621 1675 or visiting www ftportfolios com a prospectus should be read carefully before investing past performance is no assurance of future results investment return and market value of an investment in a fund will fluctuate shares when sold may be worth more or less than their original cost principal risk factors a fund s shares will change in value and you could lose money by investing in a fund an investment in a fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other governmental agency there can be no assurance that a fund s investment objectives will be achieved an investment in a fund involves risks similar to those of investing in any portfolio of equity securities traded on exchanges the risks of investing in each fund are spelled out in its prospectus shareholder report and other regulatory filings an index etf seeks investment results that correspond generally to the price and yield of an index you should anticipate that the value of an index fund s shares will decline more or less in correlation with any decline in the value of the index an index fund s return may not match the return of the index unlike a fund the indices do not actually hold a portfolio of securities and therefore do not incur the expenses incurred by a fund investors buying or selling fund shares on the secondary market may incur customary brokerage commissions investors who sell fund shares may receive less than the share s net asset value shares may be sold throughout the day on the exchange through any brokerage account however unlike mutual funds shares may only be redeemed directly from the fund by authorized participants in very large creation redemption units if the fund s authorized participants are unable to proceed with creation redemption orders and no other authorized participant is able to step forward to create or redeem fund shares may trade at a discount to the fund s net asset value and possibly face delisting one of the principal risks of investing in a fund is market risk market risk is the risk that a particular security owned by a fund fund shares or securities in general may fall in value an actively managed etf is subject to management risk because it is an actively managed portfolio in managing such a fund s investment portfolio the portfolio managers management teams advisor or sub advisor will apply investment techniques and risk analyses that may not have the desired result a fund that is concentrated in securities of companies in a certain sector or industry involves additional risks including limited diversification an investment in a fund concentrated in a single country or region may be subject to greater risks of adverse events and may experience greater volatility than a fund that is more broadly diversified geographically certain funds may invest in small capitalization and mid capitalization companies such companies may experience greater price volatility than larger more established companies an investment in a fund containing securities of non u s issuers is subject to additional risks including currency fluctuations political risks withholding the lack of adequate financial information and exchange control restrictions impacting non u s issuers these risks may be heightened for securities of companies located in or with significant operations in emerging market countries a fund may invest in depositary receipts which may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market investments in sovereign bonds involve special risks because the governmental authority that controls the repayment of the debt may be unwilling or unable to repay the principal and or interest when due in times of economic uncertainty the prices of these securities may be more volatile than those of corporate debt obligations or of other government debt obligations preferred securities high yield securities corporate bonds government bonds municipal bonds and senior loans are subject to credit risk call risk income risk interest rate risk inflation risk and prepayment risk credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable or unwilling to make dividend interest and or principal payments when due and that the value of a security may decline as a result credit risk is heightened for floating rate loans and high yield securities call risk is the risk that if an issuer calls higher yielding debt instruments held by a fund performance could be adversely impacted income risk is the risk that income from a fund s fixed income investments could decline during periods of falling interest rates interest rate risk is the risk that the value of the fixed income securities in a fund will decline because of rising market interest rates inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money prepayment risk is the risk that during periods of falling interest rates an issuer may exercise its right to pay principal on an obligation earlier than expected this may result in a decline in a fund s income senior floating rate loans are usually rated below investment grade but may also be unrated as a result the risks associated with these loans are similar to the risks of high yield fixed income instruments high yield securities or junk bonds are subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss than securities with higher ratings and therefore may be highly speculative these securities are issued by companies that may have limited operating history narrowly focused operations and or other impediments to the timely payment of periodic interest and principal at maturity the market for high yield securities is smaller and less liquid than that for investment grade securities income from municipal bonds held by a fund could be declared taxable because of among other things unfavorable changes in tax laws adverse interpretations by the internal revenue service or state tax authorities or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer convertible securities have characteristics of both equity and debt securities and as a result are exposed to certain additional risks the values of certain synthetic convertible securities will respond differently to market fluctuations than a traditional convertible security because such synthetic convertibles are composed of two or more separate securities or instruments

daniel greenfield a shillman journalism fellow at the freedom center is an investigative journalist and writer focusing on the radical left and islamic terrorism why do people live in california the weather is nice and so are the property taxes unlike a lot of blue states where property taxes make home ownership all but impossible for working class and even middle class families california has the 16th lowest property taxes in the country these low rates have allowed california homeowners and businesses who predated the dot com boom to survive in a state and in municipal areas that are rapidly becoming unaffordable to all but a small few while housing prices are skyrocketing property taxes are fixed at the time of sale with assessments limited to 2 increases a year due to proposition 13 or the people s initiative to limit property taxation the 1978 proposition dates back to a time when the state s taxpayers protected their own financial interests after a string of successful tax increases and debt hikes proposition 13 is on the chopping block the choppers have been clever enough to introduce a partial repeal that will remove protections for commercial real estate while for now promising to preserve them for homeowners but it goes without saying that proposition 13 protection for homeowners will be the final stage of the assault splitting the assault on commercial and residential real estate in two divides the opposition and allows it to be picked off separately by the oligarchy of unions non profits and dot coms that run california that s why every other commercial on local television is either for michael bloomberg or the push to tax commercial properties at market value the commercials are almost comically misleading the most frequent offender features a supposed firefighter with a soul patch who claims that the money is needed to stop natural disasters from affecting schools there are also ridiculous claims that the 11 billion in projected revenue is needed to save children from school drinking fountains tainted with lead seven years ago the los angeles unified school district spent 1 3 billion to hand out 650 000 ipads to all its students but for some reason didn t get around to removing those lead pipes california schools keep blowing through enough billions to finance a dozen small countries while always crying poverty and the guy behind many of those ads facebook s mark zuckerberg is the 4th richest man in the world with a net worth of over 79 billion zuckerberg could replace every pipe in california and not even notice the cost but instead the chan zuckerberg initiative the name of the charity and political organization of one of the world s wealthiest couples has spent 2 1 million to raise other people s taxes even after facebook had used ireland as a tax shelter to avoid paying taxes in the united states zuckerberg s assault on proposition 13 could wipe out small businesses in california as the tax increases from commercial real estate get passed down to small business tenants meanwhile facebook is fighting the irs in court over its irish tax scam to avoid paying the 9 billion in taxes that it owes facebook falsely claimed that its international headquarters was in dublin even as an email by sheryl sandberg its coo admitted that it was a tax shelter and the international headquarters would be tiny instead of paying its taxes facebook s ceo wants to raise taxes for small businesses despite claims that this initiative is philanthropic shifting the tax base from income tax to property tax would be personally profitable the facebook ipo was big enough to have had a significant impact on california s budget zuckerberg was personally on the hook for 200 million other employees and investors were good for over 2 billion in state taxes additional stock sales the next year reportedly cost the facebook boss billions in federal and state taxes the chan zuckerberg initiative gets its funding from zuckerberg s facebook shares czi is going to war against small business for its own profit so much for mark s charity california s middle class gets wiped out while mark zuckerberg gets closer to that fabled 100 billion schools and communities first the pac funded by millions in dirty facebook money touts the backing of unions the aclu joe biden cory booker and assorted radical leftist groups but czi is the one that really matters the unions and politicians two sides of the same crooked coin are obviously in it for all the money that they can squeeze out of embattled california taxpayers and in its own way so is czi wiping out property tax protections won t hurt the big dot com firms like facebook but it will make it even harder for any prospective rivals to function in an area with impossible rents and the highest housing costs in the country that s why one startup was charging 1 200 in rent for bunk beds for aspiring zuckerbergs who want to focus on their startups but can t actually afford to live there the pressures of commercial rents are already catastrophically punishing zuckerberg s move to crush commercial real estate protections will significantly raise the cost of doing business for competitors without facebook s deep pockets potentially reduce future income tax impacts on his own vast fortune and those of many facebook employees and leave behind chaos as facebook expands elsewhere the dot com has shifted its strategy in the last two years from massive expansion in menlo park and san francisco to zuckerberg s announcement to facebook employees last year that the area is tapped and that the company would be expanding outside the bay area and now that the area is tapped zuckerberg can nuke it from orbit and make sure that other companies will have trouble affording it meanwhile zuckerberg and facebook get props for their social justice that s czi s mission statement the collateral damage from this silicon valley civil war will extend far beyond helping zuckerberg s net worth hit eleven figures and the pressure cooker of the bay area which is on the verge of exploding the downward pressure of commercial property tax hikes will turn much of the rest of california into the bay area with impossible rents squeezing out small businesses and the people that depend on them if you want to see the future of california imagine a handful of dot coms satellite startups and the businesses owned by them from whole foods to the leftovers of the entertainment industry and gig economy delivery services making up the leftovers of the economy and a whole lot of poor people living in housing subsidized by dot coms like facebook which dumped 1 billion into affordable housing and taking tech vans for hundreds of miles to do grunt work for the tech masters of the universes the california schools and local communities funding act is a dot com trojan horse that would turn the state into a silicon valley ghetto while wiping out the protections that made a middle class life possible facebook has already transformed the virtual geography of social relationships the proposition 13 modification would have an equally devastating effect on the physical geography of california and it s a potential testbed for zuckerberg s initiatives that will extend far beyond california s borders the chan zuckerberg initiative draws on nearly limitless funding and its subset chan zuckerberg advocacy has seen only limited use of its power to back a pro crime initiative in ohio and tax hikes in california but fully unleashed czi could fundamentally reshape states and cities for the power and profit of one of the wealthiest men in the world it s already reshaping california for the worse

non gaap measures are described in more detail below management uses these financial measures to assess teleflex s financial performance make operating decisions allocate financial resources provide guidance on possible future results and assist in its evaluation of period to period and peer comparisons the non gaap measures may be useful to investors because they provide insight into management s assessment of our business and provide supplemental information pertinent to a comparison of period to period results of our ongoing operations the non gaap financial measures are presented in addition to results presented in accordance with gaap and should not be relied upon as a substitute for gaap financial measures moreover our non gaap financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies tables reconciling changes in historical constant currency net revenues to historical gaap net revenues are set forth above under net revenue by

respectively are set forth above under 2020 outlook constant currency revenue growth this non gaap measure is based upon net revenues adjusted to eliminate the impact of translating the results of international subsidiaries at different currency exchange rates from period to period the impact of changes in foreign currency may vary significantly from period to period and such changes generally are outside of the control of our management we believe that this measure facilitates a comparison of our operating performance exclusive of currency exchange rate fluctuations that do not reflect our underlying performance or business trends adjusted diluted earnings per share this non gaap measure is based upon diluted earnings per share from continuing operations the most directly comparable gaap measure adjusted to exclude depending on the period presented the items described below management does not believe that any of the excluded items are indicative of our underlying core performance or business trends restructuring restructuring related and impairment items restructuring programs involve discrete initiatives designed to among other things consolidate or relocate manufacturing administrative and other facilities outsource distribution operations improve operating efficiencies and integrate acquired businesses depending on the specific restructuring program involved our restructuring charges may include employee termination contract termination facility closure employee relocation equipment relocation outplacement and other exit costs associated with the restructuring program restructuring related charges are directly related to our restructuring programs and consist of facility consolidation costs including accelerated depreciation expense related to facility closures costs to transfer manufacturing operations between locations and retention bonuses offered to certain employees as an incentive for them to remain with our company after completion of the restructuring program impairment charges occur if due to events or changes in circumstances we determine that the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value impairment charges do not directly affect our liquidity but could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results acquisition integration and divestiture related items acquisition and integration expenses are incremental charges other than restructuring or restructuring related expenses that are directly related to specific business or asset acquisition transactions these charges may include among other things professional consulting and other fees systems integration costs legal entity restructuring expense inventory step up amortization amortization through cost of goods sold of the increase in

divestiture transaction the carrying value of the divested business or assets on our financial statements and other costs we incur as a direct result of the divestiture transaction we may recognize a gain or loss in connection with the divestiture related activities other items these are discrete items that occur sporadically and can affect period to period comparisons see footnote c to the reconciliation tables set forth below european medical device regulation the european union eu has adopted the eu medical device regulation mdr which replaces the existing medical devices directive mdd and imposes more stringent requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices in the eu including requirements affecting clinical evaluations quality systems and post market surveillance manufacturers of currently marketed medical devices will have until may 2020 to meet the mdr requirements although certain devices that previously satisfied mdd requirements can continue to be marketed in the eu until may 2024 subject to certain limitations significantly the mdr will require the re registration of previously approved medical devices as a result teleflex will incur expenditures in connection with the new registration of medical devices that previously had been registered under the mdd therefore these expenditures are not considered to be ordinary course expenditures in connection with regulatory matters in contrast no adjustment has been made to exclude expenditures related to the registration of medical devices that were not registered previously under the mdd intangible amortization expense certain intangible assets including customer relationships intellectual property distribution rights trade names and non competition agreements initially are recorded at historical cost and then amortized over their respective estimated useful lives the amount of such amortization can vary from period to period as a result of among other things business or asset acquisitions or dispositions tax adjustments these adjustments represent the impact of the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations for prior year returns the resolution of

started in china knocked the s p 500 off its record high the market had started the day off higher following another round of stronger than expected reports on the u s economy but it slumped suddenly in the late morning the s p 500 was down as much as 1 3 at one point treasury yields fell and the price of gold rose before the moves moderated in the afternoon by the close of trading the s p 500

trade war when stocks would swing sharply following tweets from president donald trump you have this push and pull between good u s economic data and coronavirus fears said brent schutte chief investment strategist at northwestern mutual wealth management you re playing that back and forth almost as you were during the trade war where people were reacting to changes minute by minute stocks had been pushing higher for weeks as investor belief hardened that stimulus and other efforts by central banks and governments around the world could limit the economic pain created by the virus china s central bank on thursday cut its one year prime rate to 4 05 from 4 15 but critics said stocks may have run too high too fast given how uncertain covid 19 s full impact on the global economy will be south korea s fourth largest city far from the center of the viral outbreak in china urged residents to stay inside the worry is that the number of new cases which has been falling could re accelerate until we get a more definitive sign that the top is in you re going to have volatility back and forth and trades off coronavirus headlines schutte said one measure of fear in the stock market which shows how much traders are paying to protect themselves from future swings in the s p 500 was up nearly 20 at one point in midday trading before more than halving the gain the increased caution pushed up the price of gold which touched its highest price since early 2013 investors also piled into the safety of u s government bonds which in turn weighed on their yields the 10 year treasury s yield sank to 1 52 from 1 57 late wednesday besides the toll on human lives investors worry about how much economic damage the virus will cause it s already led to sharp drop offs in manufacturing travel and other economic activity in china and the fear is how long that will last and how far it will spread in the interconnected global economy the world s largest shipping company denmark s a p moller maersk said thursday it expects a weak start to the year due to the virus air france meanwhile said that covid 19 could mean a hit of up to 200 million euros or 220 million for its operating results

basis the constant currency presentation which is a non gaap financial measure excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we believe providing constant currency revenue information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our growth consistent with how we evaluate our performance as this statistic removes the translation impact of exchange rate fluctuations which are outside of our control and do not reflect our operational performance constant currency revenue results are calculated by translating prior year revenue in local currency using the current year s currency conversion rate this non gaap financial measure has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported under gaap our use of this term may vary from the use of similarly named measures by other issuers due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation and differences due to items subject to interpretation in addition not all companies that report revenue growth on a constant currency basis calculate such measure in the same manner as we do and accordingly our calculations are not necessarily comparable to similarly named measures of other companies and may not be appropriate measures for performance relative to other companies the following unaudited table

of capital expenditures future production expenses future cash flow future debt levels and future production volumes since forward looking statements address future events and conditions by their very nature they involve inherent risks and uncertainties actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors and risks these include but are not limited to the risks associated with the oil and gas industry in general e g operational risks in development exploration and production delays or changes in plans with respect to exploration or development projects or capital expenditures the uncertainty of reserve estimates the uncertainty of estimates and projections relating to production costs and expenses failure to obtain necessary regulatory

results are not necessarily indicative of future performance the forward looking statements contained herein are made as of the date hereof and the company does not intend and does not assume any obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise unless expressly required by applicable securities laws there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of oil natural gas and ngls reserves and the future net revenue attributed to such reserves including many factors beyond the control of kelt the reserves and associated future net revenue information set forth in this press release are estimates only in general estimates of economically recoverable oil natural gas and ngls reserves and the future net revenue therefrom are based upon a number of variable factors and assumptions such as historical production from the properties production rates ultimate reserves recovery the timing and amount of capital expenditures marketability of oil natural gas and ngls royalty rates the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies and future operating costs all of which may vary materially from actual results for these reasons estimates of the economically recoverable oil natural gas and ngls reserves attributable to any particular group of properties the classification of such reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net revenue associated with reserves prepared by different engineers or by the same engineer at different times may vary kelt s actual production revenue taxes and development and operating expenditures with respect to its reserves will vary from estimates thereof and such variations could be material it should not be assumed that the undiscounted or discounted net present value of future net revenue attributable to the corporation s reserves estimated by the corporation s independent qualified reserves evaluators represent the fair market value of those reserves there is no assurance that the forecast prices and costs assumptions will be attained and variances could be material actual oil natural gas and ngls reserves may be greater than or less than the estimates provided herein and variances could be material with respect to the disclosure of reserves contained herein relating to portions of kelt s properties the estimates of reserves and future net revenue for individual properties may not reflect the same confidence level as estimates of reserves and future net revenue for all properties due to the effects of aggregation in this press release unless otherwise stated all references to reserves are to kelt s gross company reserves before deduction of royalties and without including and royalty interests of kelt certain information set out herein is financial outlook within the meaning of applicable securities laws the purpose of this financial outlook is to provide readers with disclosure regarding kelt s reasonable expectations as to the anticipated results of its proposed business activities readers are cautioned that this financial outlook may not be appropriate for other purposes non gaap financial measures and other key performance indicators this press release contains certain financial measures as described below which do not have standardized meanings prescribed by gaap in addition this press release contains other key performance indicators kpi financial and non financial that do not have standardized meanings under the applicable securities legislation as these non gaap financial measures and kpi are commonly used in the oil and gas industry the company believes that their inclusion is useful to investors the reader is cautioned that these amounts may not be directly comparable to measures for other companies where similar terminology is used net bank debt is equal to bank debt net of working capital net bank debt is calculated by adding the working capital deficiency to bank debt the working capital deficiency is equal to total current assets net of total current liabilities the company uses a net bank debt to annualized quarterly adjusted funds from operations ratio as a benchmark on which management monitors the company s capital structure and short term financing requirements management believes that this ratio which is a non gaap financial measure provides investors with information to understand the company s liquidity risk the net bank debt to annualized quarterly adjusted funds from operations ratio is also indicative of the debt to ebitda calculation used to determine the applicable margin for a quarter under the company s credit facility agreement though the calculation may not always be a precise match it is representative operating income is calculated by deducting royalties production expenses and transportation expenses from petroleum and natural gas p ng revenue net of the cost of purchases and after realized gains or losses on associated financial instruments the company refers to operating income expressed per unit of production as an operating netback management believes that operating netback per boe is a key industry benchmark and is a useful measure of operating performance which assists management and investors in assessing kelt s profitability adjusted funds from operations is calculated as cash provided by operating activities before changes in non cash operating working capital and adding back if applicable transaction costs associated with acquisitions and dispositions provisions for potential credit losses and settlement of decommissioning obligations adjusted funds from operations per common share is calculated on a consistent basis with profit loss per common share using basic and diluted weighted average common shares as determined in accordance with gaap adjusted funds from operations annualized quarterly adjusted funds from operations and operating income are non gaap measures used by management as a key measure to assess the ability of the company to fund operating activities capital expenditures and the repayment of debt however it is not intended to be viewed as an alternative to cash provided by operating activities profit or other measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with gaap finding development and acquisition fd a cost is the sum of capital expenditures incurred in the period and the change in future development capital fdc required to develop reserves fd a cost per boe is determined by dividing current period net reserve additions into the corresponding period s fd a cost readers are cautioned that the aggregate of capital expenditures incurred in the year comprised of exploration and development costs and acquisition costs and the change in estimated fdc generally will not reflect total fd a costs related to reserves additions in the year recycle ratio is a measure for evaluating the effectiveness of a company s re investment program the ratio measures the efficiency of capital investment by comparing the operating netback per boe to fd a cost per boe net asset value per share is calculated by adding the net present value of p ng reserves undeveloped land value and proceeds from exercise of stock options less the net present value of decommissioning obligations and net bank debt and dividing by the diluted number of common shares outstanding the calculation of proceeds from exercise of stock options and the diluted number of common shares outstanding only include stock options that are in the

includes common shares to be issuable upon conversion of the convertible debentures common shares to be issued upon conversion are calculated based on the conversion price if the convertible

boe basis natural gas volumes have been converted to oil equivalence at six thousand cubic feet per barrel and sulphur volumes have been converted to oil equivalence at 0 6 long tons per barrel the term boe may be misleading particularly if used in isolation a boe conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet per barrel is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at

analysis there is renewed concern about the sustainability of rising debt levels in many african countries much of this debt is being incurred through foreign currency denominated eurobonds issued on international financial markets the total value of eurobonds issued between 2018 and 2019 was more than the value of all bonds sold between 2003 to 2016 african governments are issuing and listing their eurobonds on established international debt markets usually london and irish stock exchanges african governments would venture offshore a lot less if domestic bond markets were active and liquid but besides south africa african bond markets are largely underdeveloped with inactive and illiquid secondary markets this makes it difficult to attract international investor participation locally

to operate irrigation pumps during 2019 compared with 2018 to a lesser extent sales volumes on a per customer basis in 2019 were negatively affected by lower per customer commercial and industrial sales the net decrease in retail revenues per mwh reduced operating income by 2 8 million in 2019 compared with 2018 as provided by the settlement stipulation approved by the idaho public utilities commission ipuc in 2018 related to income tax reform retail revenues per mwh in 2019 were reduced by 7 4 million of non cash accruals for future amortization related to regulatory deferrals that would otherwise be a future liability of idaho customers compared with a 1 5 million revenue reduction in 2018 in 2018 a corresponding 4 0 million of non cash accruals were recorded as other o m expense for the amortization of specified deferrals the decrease in retail revenues per mwh from these non cash accruals was partially offset by changes in the customer sales mix as volumes sold to residential customers in 2019 made up a greater portion of the customer sales mix compared with 2018 residential customers generally pay a higher per mwh rate than other customers during 2019 transmission wheeling related revenues decreased 5 3 million compared with 2018 idaho power s oatt rates decreased 10 percent in october 2018 and 13 percent in october 2019 to a lesser extent lower volumes also reduced transmission wheeling related revenues other o m expenses were 8 7 million lower in 2019 compared with 2018 as idaho power s continued focus on managing other o m expenses resulted in lower expenses across a number of areas lower bad debt expense reduced other o m expenses by 1 1 million due primarily to enhanced collection efforts and a strong economy also other o m expenses in 2018 included 4 0 million of non cash amortization expense of regulatory deferrals pursuant to the settlement stipulation approved by the ipuc in 2018 related to income tax reform based on its 2019 idaho roe idaho power recorded no additional aditc amortization or provision against current revenues for sharing of earnings with customers in 2019 under the idaho regulatory settlement stipulation approved in october 2014 in 2018 idaho power recorded a 5 0 million provision against revenues for sharing of earnings with customers non operating income and expenses net increased 9 9 million in 2019 compared with 2018 a temporary deviation from an idaho power substantive postretirement plan resulted in a 4 2 million charge in 2018 that did not recur in 2019 allowance for equity funds used during construction increased 2 8 million in 2019 as the average construction work in progress balance was higher throughout 2019 compared with 2018 also investment income from the rabbi trust associated with idaho power s nonqualified defined benefit pension plans increased 2 2 million based on stronger asset returns in 2019 compared with 2018 during 2018 idaho power recorded tax benefits for a 5 7 million remeasurement of deferred taxes resulting from income tax reform and 1 3 million for tax deductible bond redemption costs incurred in 2018 there was no such remeasurement or bond redemption in 2019 these items combined with higher pre tax net income in 2019 resulted in higher income tax expense in 2019 compared with 2018 amortization of vintage investment tax credits that became available in 2019 lowered income tax expense by 3 4 million most of which is not expected to recur at ifs a 3 0 million increase in distributions from the sale of low income housing properties

financial health of our business and which supports continued growth investments earlier this week we were particularly pleased to announce our latest acquisition which we expect to close in march tekra and trient are high quality assets that add new processing capabilities and bolster our market presence in medical graphics and automotive and offer long term top line synergy potential ams segment profits grew 20 in 2019 as we delivered continued organic sales growth drove operational efficiencies and benefited from a more favorable resin input cost environment transportation filtration

positions in these high growth specialty applications ep segment profits increased slightly for the year as we continued to deliver stable operating profits despite the backdrop of the tobacco industry dynamics and volatile input costs over the past several years 2019 results showed the benefits of our consistent focus on high value products cost controls and innovation positive price mix performance nearly offset our volume decline from strategic exits of low margin paper business and tobacco market attrition nevertheless our margins increased due to our higher value product mix cost reduction activities and lower wood pulp input costs dr kramer concluded our 2020 adjusted eps guidance of 3 50 to 3 75 which excludes the pending tekra and trient transaction accretion implies organic earnings growth of up to 6 we believe our expected profit growth combined with a robust dividend results in compelling total return potential for shareholders while we are closely monitoring

two republican candidates are running for their party s nomination in illinois 6th congressional district here are their responses to questions from the chicago tribune editorial board ahead of the march 17 primary ai2html blurb iframe min width 100 width 280px var pymparent new pym parent blurb gfx about why should voters nominate you and not your opponents the 2020 election will decide the direction of our nation for decades to come the choice is simple do you want more freedom in your life or more government do you want leaders who represent you or leaders who rule over you i stand on the side of more freedom because i think you are capable of making the best decisions for yourself and your family i have a long track record as a state legislator of standing up for my constituents whether the issue was taxes unnecessary regulations government transparency or corruption i stood with my district even when it meant standing alone my democrat opponent stands on the side of more government when he looks at the challenges our nation faces like the high cost of healthcare he believes more government control and higher taxes will solve the problem he wants the government to make choices for you instead of you making choices for your family i know that with the talented individuals successful businesses great schools and innovative social service providers we have in our district we could be a national policy leader however having what works reflected in our laws only comes with leadership that is willing to look past labels to work with those who share our interests in state government i worked with democrats on issues like health care access and opposed both parties when they passed unbalanced budgets and tax hikes i stand on my reform record of breaking up scams being run on taxpayers and holding government accountable like my college of dupage reform bills that passed with democrat and republican support i never wavered from standing up to the special interests and the big government politicians in both parties i will do the same when elected to congress what are your highest priorities for illinois and the nation my highest priority is to preserve our nation our constitution and our shared american values for future generations that should be the goal of every generation of political leaders we are the greatest nation on earth because our constitution is focused on preserving individual rights and liberty backed up by the rule of law whereby everybody gets treated equally and fairly securing our nation s future will require us to support and train the best fighting force in the world secure our border encourage a thriving economy that all can participate in and reform government to balance the interests of those funding government with the interests of those served by government this means limiting the special interests that are pulling the levers of government i want to see both illinois and our nation right size their budgets overtime the illinois state legislature and the us congress both have unfairly indebted future generations both public entities need caps on spending i have endorsed the penny plan at the federal level to bring the budget to balance over five years by cutting one percent of the budget every year my other priorities are healthcare access and affordability college technical training access and affordability a strong defense abroad and at our border and a robust economy that provides full employment ai2html blurb iframe min width 100 width 280px var pymparent new pym parent nav list immigration if you could fix longstanding problems with this country s immigration system what would you do our immigration system is broken we must act swiftly to ensure we keep the american people safe and enforce the rule of law border security must come first enough is enough let s enforce our laws i will approach border security holistically with solutions that make sense for each stretch of the border if a border wall doesn t make sense for particular expanses of land then let s look at the technical solutions available including monitoring those who overstay their visas implementing border security and visa controls will lead to a legal immigration system in which all americans can have confidence and then we can then talk about next steps for immigration reform america is the shining city on the hill and the american dream is alive and well migrants should enter legally and we should welcome them and their contributions to society entitlement programs are you prepared to take up real reform to social security and medicare to ensure their future solvency what specific reforms and cuts to entitlements would you be willing to support while pro growth policies have stimulated this economy we cannot ignore the necessary reforms to our entitlement programs which account for nearly two thirds of our annual budget outlays we must reform programs like medicare and social security to save them they are insolvent our seniors deserve and earned these benefits we will ensure they will receive the benefits promised as our runaway debt continues to grow exponentially however we must make our retirement systems sustainable in our modern economy for future generations in illinois the state universities retirement system has a defined contribution plan that provides a secure retirement in lieu of social security that plan should be considered to replace social security for new workers and optional for those currently in social security when a thriving stock market is generating double digit returns it is criminal to have employer and employee money going to social security which returns only 1 percent after 44 years health care what is the government s obligation if any to help american workers secure health insurance do you support the creation or continuation of a program such as medicare for all or obamacare do you have a different idea if you support a government related insurance plan how would you pay for it we only have to look at the experience of being a patient in the va system to know what universal healthcare would look like over 300 000 died waiting for care in our va hospitals this is an atrocity when no one is held accountable and there s no competition quality of care suffers and costs passed onto taxpayers skyrocket we need a free market patient centered health care system that gets the government out of your doctor s office our goal should be to implement a healthcare system that puts patients first encourages competition allows consumers to buy health insurance across state lines and expands health savings accounts our vision for healthcare should be centered on choice customizability and innovation with sensible safety nets that ensure those with pre existing conditions are not left behind foreign policy what security role should the u s play in world affairs the best deterrent to war is a strong and ready military america must always be the most militarily prepared power in the world our deterrence capability works best however with a strong system of alliances collectively through military economic and political means we must fight the international terrorists that seek to do harm around the world especially we need to isolate iran a state sponsor of terrorism in the middle east we will continue to have a military presence around the world we are still in germany after 70 years our role is not to enforce international law but to partner with and train our regional allies when it serves our national security interests we need to find and i believe we are finding a sustainable balance between nation building on one extreme which has failed and pulling out of iraq and afghanistan entirely on the other we saw what happened in 2011 in iraq we left a power vacuum that turned out to be disastrous as quickly as possible we need to bring our troops home keeping only a residual force that prevents of the resurgence of isis and more terrorist attacks on the homeland economy unemployment is at a 50 year low and economic growth is steady assess the state of the economy and tell us how you would improve economic prospects for americans our economy thrives when government and bureaucracy get out of the way of innovation and entrepreneurship lower taxes deregulation and pro growth policies are the best way to boost our economy which in turn creates more jobs and higher wages for the middle class we in illinois all know that taxes and regulation impede growth as we have watched our residents and businesses bleed across state lines for better opportunities the policies of the last few years have demonstrated just how effective a pro growth agenda is for the american economy the unemployment rate is lower than it s been in 50 years more americans are joining the workforce and average wages are increasing the stock market is at an all time high helping to secure retirement income for a broad swath of americans a strong economy is crucial to lifting americans out of poverty we must continue to embrace policies that provide more jobs and create a brighter future for all climate change what measures if any to combat climate change do you support i do not dispute that the climate is changing but we need smart solutions that deal in reality not crazy deals premised on the irrational idea that the world is ending there are multiple relevant questions related to this issue 1 has the earth generally warmed since 1800 an overwhelming majority of scientists assent to this 2 has that warming been caused primarily by human activity and if the earth is warming and human activity has caused that warming to what extent is anthropogenic global warming a problem so significant that we ought to take action the climate has been changing for all of earth s history geologic evidence shows that we have had many periods of warmer and colder temperatures in the past when human emissions were negligible in fact geologic evidence shows that global temperatures were naturally warmer than today 1 000 2 000 4 000 and 7 000 years ago long before we had suvs and power plants my opponent states that the sea levels are rising this is true however representative casten arrogantly thinks he knows how to stop the oceans from rising no scientist or politician can tell you when natural sea level rise ended and man made sea level rise began according to tide gauge data oceans are rising on average about 7 8 inches per century there is no evidence that any amount of taxes regulations or renewable energy will have the slightest effect on sea levels my opponent s climate alarmism like his colleague alexandria ocasio cortez 14 page green new deal are symbolic of the problems with leftist politicized environmentalism the reason so many american s don t heed their warning is because when the policies attached to those warnings are rolled out it becomes clear that progressivism is the priority not the environment to be clear i believe that the climate is changing sober minded cost benefit analyses of proposed environmental policies are often lost in the avalanche of alarmist rhetoric like casten s like many of my friends and neighbors having a clean environment above all else should be our focus america has made great strides since the 1970 s clean air and clean water acts to clean up our environment i support those efforts wholeheartedly i find alarmist rhetoric disingenuous arrogant and decidedly political nobody has to be a progressive to be concerned about the environment there s a need for a serious discussion about our climate but sean casten s alarmism like the green new deal is not it gun laws describe briefly your position on how to balance the 2nd amendment and gun safety as a mom i think safe homes schools and streets are critically important i am also adamant about protecting our constitutional right to bear arms this right must not be infringed upon first we have an obligation to try to prevent gun violence this means we have to do a better job of enforcing current laws so that guns stay out of the wrong hands democrat tim kaine introduced a plan to strictly enforce gun laws in richmond va when he was mayor their plan called project exile reduced gun homicides by 41 percent in 10 months by contrast in chicago states attorney kim foxx released a repeat gun offender on bail last year while on bail he was arrested and charged with murdering a teen in a drive by shooting the contrast could not be more clear second we need fail safe reporting systems that are already in law in the cases of the mass school shooting in florida the mass shooting in aurora and many others the reporting system broke down at some point these systems should be reviewed and reformed the federal government also has a role to play by providing funding for mental health services like nami dupage as identifying and treating mental illness is the logical place to start to prevent gun violence additionally my democrat opponent would like to ban certain firearms the challenge we have is that there is no evidence that bans have worked regardless whatever his proposal is it is never going to be enough as soon as we ban one scary sounding gun he will find another that is because he is looking at the politics i am looking at the evidence more when have you shown independence from your party on an issue of major import i served as a state legislator for six years in that time i stood up to my own party on a myriad of issues which i will outline the biggest challenge we have in illinois and likely in washington isn t as much ideological differences as it is that legislators run on independence get elected and can t jump in the springfield or dc hot tub fast enough instead of being an opportunity to advance a policy agenda rooted in first principles winning elections is a means to distribute jobs contracts and other prizes to friends and political allies i appreciate the opportunity to discuss my record of standing up for the people i represented rather than falling in with the government s ruling class in 2017 nearly one third of house republicans including caucus leaders voted for the largest structural income tax increase in history i spoke out against the tax increase most of the house republican caucus voted for a bailout of exelon on the backs of rate payers i spoke out against the bailout in 2018 a coalition of house republicans voted for an anti business anti second amendment gun bill i stood up for small businesses and law abiding gun owners house leader durkin joined nine other republicans in voting for the pro abortion equal rights amendment i opposed the bill i am one of only a few house republicans who have been willing to tackle structural or entitlement reforms i advanced meaningful pension reform property tax reform education reform and right to work legislation in 2014 illinoisans elected bruce rauner on the promise of an illinois turnaround the pro choice republican also swore to voters that he had no social agenda in the end rauner betrayed every promise he made he didn t enact even one of his 44 promised reforms he bailed out chicago pensions on the backs of schools and families in suburban districts i opposed him on the bailout he bailed out public utility companies on the backs of ratepayers he enacted sanctuary state legislation with the help of republican leadership i opposed them and the knife in the heart of his conservative base rauner made illinois the first state in the nation via the governor s signature to force taxpayers to fund abortion on demand not only did i oppose him on the bill i gave up a safe seat in the illinois house to primary bruce rauner in 2018 i stood up when it was important to stand up not when it was popular to stand up if you are an incumbent tell us the most significant accomplishment of your current term if you are a newcomer tell us how you as a rookie would keep from being a backbencher while i am not an incumbent i have served as a state legislator i think the tribune editorial board would agree i may be a lot of things but a back bencher is not one of them it took me about a month after being inaugurated in 2013 to realize that as a member of the super minority i wouldn t have a lot of control over what legislation came to the floor each day so i made sure that i talked about what was going on in state government as often as possible i consistently communicated to the families i served to keep them in the loop on the legislation that was pending the arguments that were being made and the implications of success or defeat i shared with them what i was reading and my thoughts on different policy ideas after just two years my email list had grown to about 5 times its original size and after six years my ideas had been published in the chicago tribune daily herald wall street journal and the federalist i also worked across the aisle to get legislation that directly impacted my constituents passed including my reform bills and the audit passed in the wake of the college of dupage spending scandal i called for ethics reform in the state capitol before it was popularized by the metoo movement and the legislation i

what do you do if you find your country in the midst of a currency war for brazil s finance minister in early 2011 the response seemed clear enough after all it had been guido mantega who had made the initial declaration back at the end of september 2010 once it became very clear ben bernanke s fed was about to launch a second round of massive money printing mantega had gone before the world s microphones and stated his outrage we re in the midst of an international currency war a general weakening of currency this threatens us because it takes away our competitiveness from his perspective one shared by many around the emerging market em world the purpose was textbook the united states or europe would attempt to get back up from the great recession on the backs of those other systems at that early recovery stage it was becoming obvious that something wasn t right to begin with how could it have been quantitative easing what everyone assumes is money printing if it had to be done twice to the brazilians and a great many more the federal reserve was going to start beggaring all its neighbors to make up for its growing economic shortfall the economics textbook says that a lower currency exchange rate equals stimulus it makes your exports relatively less expensive against others on world markets particularly when your currency is falling against the us dollar as a consequence your neighbors goods are disadvantaged the same textbook also claims that the offended party isn t without recourse a local central bank or finance ministry is presumed able to strike back that s the war part of any currency war the issue at least in convention isn t getting the thing to move it is the same such as it is for any war estimating prospective costs and chances for success in order to judge whether or not it is worth the fight from brazil s perspective if ben bernanke wanted to drop the dollar then brazilian monetary officials including those at the central bank banco central do brasil would indeed fight back these specific countermeasures are described as currency swaps when they are in fact rate swaps brazil s opening salvo had consisted of 20 000 reverse swap contracts whose ultimate goal was to stimulate local bank behavior no dollars were bought by the central bank none were sold instead for each contract banco offered to pay the counterparty the overnight rate in reals the local currency against a fixed rate in dollars the idea was to influence this future spread called the cupom cambial increasing the future rate therefore price of dollars against reals which would then influence the activities of banks operating in foreign currency markets in january 2011 utilizing reverse swaps the goal was to make that spread increasingly unprofitable for banks obtaining dollars on global markets the more costly the cupom cambial the less they would sell dollars to buy reals thereby counteracting the wicked force of ben bernanke s printing press but if the fed was tanking the dollar why didn t the dollar tank you can argue that such wasn t the goal of us qe still there must be something wrong with the textbook view whether intentional or not by all established accounts the dollar should have fallen and fallen further that s why when minister mantego showed up on tv and all over the internet everyone just nodded their heads what s truly interesting about this is how different it was from brazil s response to qe3 and 4 only a year and a half later in september of 2012 again confronted by what was actually the same false dawn bernanke s fed responded to mounting pressures falling interest rates rising eurodollar futures prices curve distortions even some repo problems etc unlike 2010 and qe2 however there were no howls of foreign protest the third time around once damned as the aggressor in sparking a global currency war the official world seemed to have moved on from it without explaining why it had data from google trends shows that over the last fifteen years search volume for the term currency war was highest in september 2010 as you would expect courtesy of brazil s finance minister second highest was february 2013 in addition to two more qe s in the us the europeans had their ltro s and were acting toward keeping mario draghi s promise and the japanese were moving ever closer to the launch of qqe and its supposedly end of world turbo charged everything money printing a developed world full of central banks promising to be irresponsible in 2013 more so than at any time before in light of what everyone said was so much heavyweight action what chance did any em s stand their currencies were doomed to rise and wipe out the fragile recoveries in those places yet as for guido mantega no burst of outrage was forthcoming early in 2013 brazil s officials were busy winding down all their previous efforts despite a proliferation of what only a few years earlier were taken as currency war measures aimed squarely at brazil mantega had changed his tune completely in an interview conducted during the month when the global public was pinging google with searches about the currency war mantega declared that he had succeeded in protecting domestic manufacturers by pushing the real almost 20 lower since banco had started up its reverse swaps no need to worry about foreign central banks he said brazil s easily got it covered take that ben bernanke five months later though in august 2013 suddenly swaps no longer of the reverse variety banco would start to auction 500 million a day desperate to influence local bank behavior in the opposite direction from what it was doing just months before to motivate the cupom cambial positively to make it more profitable for the country s banks to import dollars brazil s currency had gone from too high to just right and then screamed right on by just right into holy crap take that guido mantega but it wasn t bernanke s revenge though today some still conclude that it was the summer of the so called taper tantrum didn t actually end with that summer in brazil by march 2015 banco had racked up a stunning 114 9 billion with a b in outstanding rate swaps essentially subsidizing its banks dollar raising activities and still those weren t nearly enough for all that had been done the currency was at best a little lower and over more recent months that fateful second half of 2014 falling in more determined fashion faced with the reality of the real s situation officials pulled the plug and the currency cratered in 2015 making 2013 s crisis seem like a minor speedbump the economic effects in brazil were mind bogglingly devastating somehow what was once a textbook currency war had been turned completely around rather than having protected brazilian manufacturers as mantega boasted in february 2013 they had been decimated as the currency dropped further and further it wasn t just brazil you might recall all its neighbors were stunned and stung by the rising dollar the upending of the economics textbook was pretty near universal you probably even remember the violence of another falling currency china s in august of 2015 and that was only the midpoint in the yuan s downward odyssey king dollar wrecks everything or as i wrote last week with regard to russia s experience with it all the way back in 1998 a rising dollar is the world s biggest bear to bear unlike in 2010 2013 or even 2015 global officials have finally started to come around this rethinking began i suppose in its most primitive form when guido mantega intriguingly sat silent as qe3 was launched in the us and qqe in japan central banks had been well on their way to establishing that the dollar therefore their local currency isn t theirs to command and that most definitely includes the us central bank academic and official scholarship has more and more validated this obvious correlation the dollar goes up the global economy goes down neighbors don t beggar each other because there s nothing to gain nor lose everyone gets whacked by their own falling currencies if not equally than at least in the same manner but what makes the dollar rise that s the real question establishing how its upward trend is harmful was the easy part figuring out the method to this madness will be the long march for the world s monetary authorities and it s already twelve and a half years since august 9 2007 brazil s role in this global dollar system this eurodollar system and its unique setup teaches us something important about the way in which all this actually works for banco influencing the cupom cambial is effectively either a subsidy for acquiring dollars on global markets swaps or a penalty reverse swaps the currency s exchange rate is nothing more than a barometer of these conditions are dollars easily obtained or more difficult if the latter the central bank subsidy futilely attempts to address the symptoms of the more important dollar imbalance the inevitable devaluation is far from the stimulus described in the textbook global banks must always have dollar balances available that s the reserve currency s role its entire purpose the widespread availability so that the dollar can become the medium for exchanging goods as well as financial intentions linking often vastly different systems to be a good reserve currency it must be easily and readily available everywhere as it had been throughout most of the eurodollar market s history globalization wouldn t have happened without the sharp rise in eurodollar size and scope there had to have been the global money behind the more and more interconnected global economy the eurodollar was that connection russia s 1998 episode along with the whole asian financial crisis had been both an outlier and a warning it had been widespread but still isolated in systemic terms the warning came in realizing what could happen if the whole system ran aground instead of one at the time small region contained within it for that august 9 2007 when the system broke however being so far in the shadows has meant no alternative to it nothing to replace the eurodollar to cure the actual disease central bankers keep promising to fix each s local symptoms coming up short every single time that s another primary lesson from brazil you may or may not be aware that brazilian authorities last week intervened in local currency markets again nothing huge just what looks like an opening round of testing the waters and the market s resolve no not the reverse swap type either though that is what mainstream commentary would have you believing the real is falling to record lows brazil s current finance minister paulo guedes now styled the minister of the economy how quaint surely wishes the fed would try to spark some new textbook currency war even if it was called not qe this time according to the latest narrative one that began last autumn the world is getting better after an unexpected bout with what fed vice chairman richard clarida termed global headwinds and disinflationary pressures the former the consequences of the latter those being the more obvious financial symptoms the rising dollar always brings with it falling interest rates rising eurodollar futures prices curve distortions maybe even some repo problems etc what clarida was trying to say was that in his view one shared by the rest of the fed s policymakers the global financial problem seemed to have run its course the dollar s uptrend broken it was a belief widely shared among all the prominent currency experts who remain steadfastly bearish on the us currency though it is clear for reasons that have nothing to do with what we are talking about here the real shame is that there are any number of ways to check on these assumptions starting with interest rates eurodollar futures prices curve positions and even the repo market all the things that describe the liquidity situation and therefore availability within this global monetary system not just as it pertains to brazil it is true that curves last summer were all screaming toward the ground indicating the approach of a seeming global abyss it is also true that they stopped late in august the problem is how many especially those in official capacities took that to mean something it did not the way the bond market had behaved was misinterpreted as if it had been an imminent all or nothing alarm it had sounded and then went silent so for those who took this view the transition was a pretty clear sign of better days ahead a scare and nothing more the curves themselves however haven t really changed all that much in the past five months and that in itself isn t unusual we ve seen this happen before including that period in the middle of 2015 up until that july and the few weeks preceding cny what had really happened was the bond market all the way back in the middle of 2018 began to price a non trivial chance of global liquidity problems which could be seen in the dollar s sudden turnaround leading to a global downturn of some unknown proportion these disinflationary pressures developing into strong enough headwinds which could blow the global economy into dangerous territory falling interest rates rising eurodollar futures prices curve inversions and repo problems together said the probability of such a fate was growing with these the further they went the greater the implied chance as well as its downside potential it was that way in august and contrary to the official assessment is much the same today take a look at the us treasury curve or eurodollar futures both are pricing for more fed rate cuts to come not only is that by the textbook supposed to be dollar negative it is once more dead set against what jay powell and richard clarida thinks if a recession scare had caused him three rate cuts he didn t foresee nor want what s going on in the global economy that pulls some more out of the reluctant chairman over the months ahead he might want to avoid looking at europe and japan and that s all before the coronavirus the dollar is rising sharply and causing all sorts of immediately negative consequences as we can easily see via brazil again the disinflationary pressures are being expressed all over the place the economic headwinds already intensified the main dollar exchange index dxy this week very nearly touched 100 for the first time in almost three years when guido mantega had originally complained about ben bernanke s sinister dollar devaluation plan the fed s second round of money printing the index was 79 5 and by the time banco had conducted the first reverse swaps it was 77 5 when the world was googling about currency wars in february 2013 though dxy was 80 despite two more qe s and a twist in between it hasn t been a straight line by any means but there s a reason dxy s lowest point came on march 17 2008 the day bear stearns fate was announced to the world for the dollar and for the globalized economy no matter how many monetary policy adjustments and qe s or whatever trillions in bank reserves they create it just hasn t been the same since it s not currency wars this is the currency war jeffrey snider is the head of global research at alhambra partners

gibraltar produced 125 9 million pounds of copper compared to 125 2 million in 2018 copper grade for the year averaged 0 245 copper slightly below the life of mine average grade copper recovery for 2019 was 86 2 an improvement over 2018 as a result of processing improvements and processing less oxidized ore a total of 100 4 million tons were mined in 2019 a 10 decrease over the prior year due to the mining deeper within granite pit resulting in longer haul distances waste stripping costs of 22 9 million 75 basis were capitalized in 2019 compared to 48 8 million in 2018 as more waste stripping was performed in the granite pit in the prior year site operating costs for the year were us 1 95 per pound of copper produced an increase from 2018 due primarily to the greater capitalization of stripping costs in the prior year there was also higher mining costs per ton mined in 2019 arising from greater haulage distances molybdenum production for 2019 was 2 7 million pounds compared to 2 4 million pounds in 2018 this additional production was offset by a decrease in the average molybdenum price which was us 11 36 per pound in 2019 compared to us 12 20 per pound in 2018 the resulting by product credits per pound of copper produced of us 0 20 remained consistent with the prior year off property costs were us 0 31 per pound of copper produced consistent with us 0 33 per pound produced in 2018 the decrease was attributed to improved tcrcs on spot tenders in 2019 compared to 2018 total operating costs c1 were us 2 06 per pound of copper produced for the year compared to 1 93 per pound in 2018 due to the difference in site operating costs as noted above fourth quarter results copper production in the fourth quarter was 33 4 million pounds copper grade for the quarter averaged 0 253 which was in line with the life of mine average grade copper recovery in the mill was 84 5 during the quarter which was lower than the first three quarters as a higher percentage of oxide ore was processed the decrease in recovery was offset by an increase in mill throughput during the quarter a total of 25 8 million tons were mined during the period an increase of 1 1 million tons over the previous quarter and the ore stockpile increased by 0 5 million tons the strip ratio for the fourth quarter was 2 1 to 1 as more mining took place in granite this resulted in less overall waste stripping of pollyanna in the quarter capitalized stripping costs totaled 4 3 million 75 basis compared to 8 6 million in the prior quarter and 18 9 million in q4 2018 the capitalized stripping costs are substantially attributable to advancement into the pollyanna pit and associated waste stripping costs while no ore from pollyanna has been mined yet total site spending including capitalized stripping costs was slightly lower than the previous quarter the remaining decrease in site operating cost per ton milled which was 10 46 for the quarter was due to greater throughput molybdenum production was 728 thousand pounds in the fourth quarter molybdenum prices averaged us 9 67 per pound over the fourth quarter compared to us 11 83 per pound in the prior quarter and us 12 04 per pound in q4 2018 by product credits per pound of copper produced was us 0 16 in the fourth quarter off property costs per pound produced were us 0 32 for the fourth quarter of 2019 and consist of concentrate treatment refining and transportation costs these costs are in line with recent quarters relative to pounds of copper sold health safety and environment health and safety have always been a high level commitment for taseko gibraltar and florence management taseko is committed to operational practices that result in improved efficiencies safety performance and occupational health nothing is more important to the company than the safety health and well being of our workers and their families taseko places a high priority on the continuous improvement of performance in the areas of employee health and safety at the workplace and protection of the environment in 2019 gibraltar had five loss time incidents and a loss time frequency of 0 68 per 200 000 hours worked this is lower than the british columbia industry average loss time frequency of 0 78 per 200 000 hours worked the company remains committed to a culture of safety first ensuring safety is the first consideration in all actions taken the same priority on health safety and environmental performance as well as the methods and culture at gibraltar are being imported and implemented at florence copper non gaap performance measure see end of news release gibraltar outlook gibraltar is expected to produce approximately 130 million pounds 5 on a 100 basis in 2020 the fundamentals for copper remain strong and despite short term volatility caused by global events including the coronavirus most industry analysts are projecting a continued supply constraint and higher copper prices than current levels in the coming years expansion of overseas copper smelting capacity and tighter supply conditions resulted in a reduced benchmark for 2020 for concentrate treatment and refining charges tcrc which were set 23 below 2019 benchmark levels on november 6 2019 the company published an updated ni 43 101 technical report on the gibraltar mine based on this updated technical report sufficient mineral reserves exist to support an approximate 19 year production plan out to 2038 with annual average copper production of 130 million pounds mineral resource potential exists to potentially further extend the mine life beyond the known reserves review of projects taseko s strategy has been to grow the company from the operating cash flow and credit quality of the gibraltar mine to assemble and develop a pipeline of projects we continue to believe this will generate long term returns for shareholders our development projects are focused primarily on copper and are located in stable mining jurisdictions in british columbia and arizona our current focus is on the near term development of the florence copper project florence copper project the production test facility ptf operated as planned during 2019 steady state operation was achieved and the focus turned to testing different wellfield operating strategies including adjusting pumping rates solution strength flow direction and the use of packers in recovery and injection wells to isolate different zones of the ore body the florence copper technical team is using physical and operating control mechanisms to adjust solution chemistry and flow rates and is successfully achieving targeted copper concentration in solution the ptf wellfield is performing to its design and the sx ew plant continues to produce lme grade a copper cathode the main focus of the ptf phase is to demonstrate to regulators and key stakeholders that hydraulic control of underground leach solutions can be maintained and provide valuable data to validate the company s leach model as well as optimize well design and performance and hydraulic control parameters successful operation of the in situ leaching process will allow permits to be amended for the full scale commercial operation which is expected to produce 85 million pounds of copper cathode annually for 20 years two permits are required to commence construction of the commercial scale wellfield at florence copper these are the aquifer protection permit app from the arizona department of environmental quality adeq and the underground injection control uic permit from the u s environmental protection agency epa in june 2019 the company submitted the app application for the phase 2 commercial facility to the adeq the uic permit application for the phase 2 commercial facility was submitted to the epa in august 2019 both permits are advancing through the technical review process the company is in active dialogue with the regulators and targeting to have permitting for the commercial facility completed in 2020 the company has continued to advance various project financing options from debt providers royalty companies and potential joint venture partners for the phase 2 commercial development of the florence copper project management is targeting to have the project finance funding committed in advance of both the app and uic permit amendments being issued by the adeq and epa respectively total net expenditures at the florence project for the year ended december 31 2019 were 16 0 million including the ptf operation and other

shanghai china cut the benchmark lending rate on thursday as widely expected as the authorities move to lower financing costs for businesses and support an economy jolted by a severe coronavirus outbreak the epidemic has upended global supply chains and caused widespread disruption to businesses and factory activity in china prompting authorities to deliver a steady stream of policy measures over recent weeks to cushion the blow to growth the one year loan prime rate lpr the new benchmark lending gauge introduced in august was lowered by 10 basis points to 4 05 from 4 15 at the previous monthly fixing the five year lpr was lowered by 5 basis points to 4 75 from 4 80 all 51 respondents in a reuters snap survey had expected a reduction in the lpr with 38 respondents or about 75 of participants tipping a 10 basis points cut to both tenors the lpr cut followed a similar move in the central bank s medium term lending rate on monday investors are betting the authorities will roll out more monetary easing and fiscal stimulus in the near term to help smaller businesses that are struggling to tide over the crisis mayank mishra macro strategist at standard chartered bank in singapore said the lpr cut may not be enough to overcome the economic impact of the virus the chinese authorities are sending a message that easing will happen but it will happen at a measured pace they do not want fuel expectations that they will be easing aggressively mishra said we expect more monetary easing in the form of 100 basis points in the reserve requirement ratio rrr and 10 basis points in the medium term lending facility mlf in addition to what we ve already seen china s yuan weakened to a more than two month low against the dollar after the lpr cut mainly pressured by further easing expectations jacqueline rong senior china economist at bnp paribas in beijing said she had expected a deeper cut to one year lpr especially as interbank market rates have already posted sharp declines in the past month banks are already setting lending rates well below the benchmark and if government subsidies are taken into account some borrowers may not pay any interest at all sources told reuters some analysts say the minor cut to the 5 year lpr likely signalled that authorities wanted to avoid stoking a property bubble and causing more damage to the economy in the longer run smaller firms squeezed the people s bank of china pboc has pledged to use tools such as targeted reserve requirement cuts relending and rediscount to support key sectors affected by the outbreak having already injected over 200 billion in liquidity in a bid to help lower financing cost china reported a dramatic drop in new cases in the province at the heart of the coronavirus outbreak on thursday though the death toll so far at over 2 000 has made it one of the biggest global health emergencies in recent decades the world s second biggest economy already grappling with growth at its weakest in almost three decades as a trade war with the united states took its tool had shown some signs of stabilisation just before the epidemic hit when compared with a year earlier first quarter growth could slump to 4 5 from 6 0 in the fourth quarter according to the latest reuters poll some analysts warn of even lower growth closer to the 3 mark underlining the widespread business disruption caused by the virus the lpr is a lending reference rate set monthly by 18 banks the pboc revamped the mechanism to price lpr in august 2019 loosely pegging it to the medium term lending facility rate julian evans pritchard senior china economist at capital economics warned that policy easing steps will only be of modest help for small firms a key part of the economy while more easing is likely in the coming weeks this alone won t change the fortunes of the millions of small firms suffering from the coronavirus outbreak he said surveys suggest that one third of these firms may run out of cash in the coming two weeks unless activity normalizes

together helped drive a 3 year over year reduction in controllable costs in 2019 while improving our cost profile we also remain successful in leveraging our revenue management tools and local field expertise to capture favorable supply and demand fundamentals in our top line performance for the full year 2019 this translated to a same store revenue growth of 4 5 with respect to acquisitions and dispositions we far exceeded our initial capital recycling goals for the year accelerating portfolio activity that should drive better long term growth and risk adjusted returns in total we sold 900 million of homes that no longer fit our long term strategy and used proceeds to buy approximately 650 million of homes with higher expected total returns and to repay debt while this acceleration of capital recycling resulted in some short term earnings dilution we expect it to be accretive to earnings over the long term our capital recycling in 2019 also included successful bulk transactions in the first half of the year we acquired a portfolio of 463 homes in infill submarkets of atlanta and las vegas for 115 million creating incremental value by leveraging our scale and platform in december we completed a 210 million bulk sale in our smallest market nashville we made a strategic decision to exit nashville as the size of our portfolio there did not allow for the same scale efficiencies we are able to achieve in our other 16 markets where we average approximately 5 000 homes per market by leveraging strong investor demand for single family rentals in nashville we were able to opportunistically sell 90 of that portfolio in one efficient transaction finally we had another successful year in capital markets we opened a new financing channel by closing our first ever loan from a life insurance company using proceeds to repay higher cost debt we also reduced our net debt by over 700 million in 2019 bringing net debt to ebitda from 9 times at the beginning of the year to 8 times at the end of the year as proud as i am of our team for what we accomplished together in 2019 i m even more excited as i look ahead several months ago we explained at our investor day why we feel ready to run industry growth fundamentals are favorable we have a strategically located high quality portfolio and scale that enhanced growth opportunities we have a refined platform that is positioned better than ever to optimize execution we have an innovative team that is committed to the resident experience and we have a clear set of goals to run toward to drive both organic and external growth we are no longer just ready to run we are now running and expect to make significant progress toward many goals in 2020 which i d like to address in more detail first same store growth in 2020 we expect to grow same store noi by 4 25 at the midpoint of our guidance this expectation is supported by strong market fundamentals across our unique footprint household formation rates have been running at over twice the u s average and many of these households have demonstrated a preference to lease invitation homes makes the opportunity to lease even more attractive by curating a leasing lifestyle that includes 24 7 professional service convenient features like smart home technology and family friendly spaces and locations where residents want to live furthermore we believe our business has built in cyclical hedges and regardless of what happens in the broader economy demographics should become more of a tailwind as the leading edge of the millennial cohort approaches invitation homes average resident age of 40 years beyond capturing positive fundamentals we will focus on enhancing same store growth through reduction in days to reresident and further improving our procare service efficiencies in addition we will move the ball forward on several ancillary service initiatives while the dollar impact of these initiatives on ancillary income in 2020 will likely be small we are laying the foundation for a more significant ancillary income growth in future years and continue to expect an incremental 15 million to 30 million of run rate noi from ancillary services by 2022 moving on from internal initiatives another 2020 priority is accretive external growth today we are seeing many opportunities to buy homes to enhance growth in earnings and nav per share in many cases these opportunities are presenting themselves in markets where we own less than 4 000 homes today which can benefit more significantly from economies of scale as homes are added for example seattle denver las vegas and dallas we also see attractive opportunities in markets of greater scale like phoenix orlando and atlanta should the opportunity persist as expected in 2020 to buy homes accretively relative to our cost of capital we plan to be a net acquirer of homes also on the external growth front we will seek to expand our value enhancing capex program whereby we invest in upgrades to existing homes to enhance resident loyalty improve asset durability and increase risk adjusted returns i couldn t be more excited to kick off the new year and tackle these 2020 initiatives with our best in class portfolio platform and team we are grateful for your support as we continue running toward another year of outstanding service for our residents and value creation for our shareholders with that i ll turn it over to charles young our chief operating officer to provide more detail on our fourth quarter operating results charles d young executive vice president and chief operating officer thank you dallas we finished 2019 strong we were pleased with our financial performance as both same store revenue growth and noi growth came in at the high end of their respective guidance ranges more importantly i m proud of the strides we continue to make with our resident service evidenced by our residents survey scores in the fourth quarter that reached new heights i ll now walk you through our fourth quarter operating results in more detail same store noi growth of 3 8 in the fourth quarter brought our full year 2019 same store noi growth to 5 6 same store core revenues in the fourth quarter grew 4 3 year over year the increase was driven by average monthly rental rate growth of 4 and a 10 8 increase in other property income net of resident recoveries average occupancy was 96 for the quarter consistent with prior year this brought our same store revenue growth of 4 5 for the full year 2019 same store core expenses in the fourth quarter overall were in line with our expectations growing 5 3 year over year primary drivers of the increase were property taxes and repairs and maintenance expenses year over year increases in r m opex were partially offset by decreases in r m capex turnover spend increased more moderately than r m spend before moving on from expenses i d like to take a moment to expand on the drivers of the 3 3 decrease in full year controllable expenses that dallas mentioned in his opening remarks efficiency initiatives beginning in the summer of 2018 prompted a quick and sustainable turnaround on repair and maintenance efficiency that helped limit the increase in cost to maintain to only 1 in 2019 this performance in cost to maintain was better than our expectation coming into the year in addition platform refinements helped to drive a 9 reduction in personnel costs in 2019 finally record low turnover rates coupled with process improvements drove turnover costs down 9 and leasing and marketing costs down 6 next i ll cover leasing trends in the fourth quarter of 2019 and january 2020 our revenue management and field teams worked well together in positioning our portfolio for the seasonally slower months of leasing in the fourth quarter and january we prioritized maintaining higher occupancy to ensure favorable positioning heading into the upcoming peak leasing season blended rent growth was 3 4 for the fourth quarter with renewals coming in at 4 5 and new leases at 1 6 in january which is seasonally slower for leasing blended rent growth was 3 with renewals of 4 5 and new leases of 0 3 occupancy increased throughout the fourth quarter and january with january averaging 96 5 this is 20 basis points higher than last year s january occupancy and should position us well for when peak leasing season kicks off in the spring with fundamental tailwinds at our back we are confident as we start 2020 our operating teams are focused not only on executing to capture positive fundamentals but also on operating more efficiently to drive down days to reresident and offset cost inflation i m excited to go after these opportunities in 2020 with the best in class team of local partners in the field and central support in our corporate offices with that i ll turn the call over to our chief financial officer ernie freedman ernest m freedman executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you charles today i will cover the following topics one balance sheet and capital markets activity two financial results for the fourth quarter and three 2020 guidance first i ll cover balance sheet and capital markets activity we continue to make meaningful progress in reducing our overall quantum of debt and improving our leverage metrics as we strive to become an investment grade company in 2019 we reduced our overall net debt by over 700 million reduced net debt to ebitda to 8 times down 1 full turn from where we started the year this deleveraging was accelerated in the fourth quarter through capital markets activity tied to our investment efforts first we used proceeds from our nashville bulk sale as well as other cash on hand to repay almost 200 million of secured debt in the quarter these payments also benefited our weighted average interest rate as we directed voluntary prepayments toward higher cost debt second we raised 38 million via our atm program during the quarter to over equitize acquisitions 2020 we will continue to focus on both leverage reduction and external growth balancing the two opportunistically i ll now cover our fourth quarter 2019 financial results core ffo and affo per share for the fourth quarter increased 6 1 and 10 8 year over year to 0 32 and 0 28 respectively this was primarily driven by higher same store noi lower adjusted g a and property management expense and lower cash interest expense partially offsetting the increases in core ffo and affo were lower non same store noi resulting from disposition activity including our nashville bulk sale and higher share count due to atm issuance the last thing i will cover is 2020 guidance as dallas and charles discussed we believe we have strong fundamental tailwinds at our back we expect to grow same store core revenue 3 75 to 4 25 we expect same store core expense growth in the range of 3 25 to 4 25 we expect to sustain the efficiency gains we achieved in 2019 as a result controllable expenses net of recoveries which are comprised of expenses such as personnel costs and the opex portion of cost to maintain are anticipated to grow at an inflationary rate of approximately 3 at the midpoint of our guidance fixed expenses which represent about 60 of our total core expenses are expected to grow at a higher rate than controllable expenses anticipating a larger increase in our property insurance expense as our last property insurance renewal was in 2015 with respect to real estate taxes we expect to our growth rate to moderate from 2019 levels with an anticipated increase in the 4s this brings our expectation for same store noi growth of 3 75 to 4 75 from a timing perspective we expect same store noi growth to be higher in the second half of the year than in the first half year over year revenue growth comps are more challenging in the first half of 2020 we also expect year over year expense growth rates to moderate over the course of 2020 full year 2020 core ffo per share is expected to be in the range of 1 27 to 1 35 and affo per share is expected to be in the range of 1 04 to 1 12 included in this guidance is an assumption that we will be a net acquirer of homes in 2020 we will take an opportunistic approach with acquisition volume ultimately dictated by how attractive the buying opportunity is relative to our cost of capital as the year progresses most recently we have been buying at a pace of approximately 200 million per quarter we have multiple tools available with which to fund acquisitions and would expect a portion to be funded with proceeds from the sale of lower tier homes albeit at a more moderate disposition pace than in 2019 a detailed bridge of 2019 core ffo per share to the midpoint of 2020 guidance can be found in our earnings release as a result of our anticipated growth in affo per share in 2020 we have increased our quarterly dividend by 15 4 to 0 15 per share we continue to target a low dividend payout ratio as we prioritize deleveraging and accretive external growth i ll wrap up by reiterating that we are excited to run toward the 2020 priorities that dallas discussed in his opening remarks the client demand fundamentals are in our favor and we re in position to capitalize on these fundamentals with the strategic locations and scale we ve assembled within our portfolio we are prepared to execute efficiently with our refined platform and our entire team is focused on widening our lead by pursuing strategic initiatives to drive both organic and external growth with that operator would you please open up the line for questions questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session the first question today comes from nick joseph with citi please go ahead nick joseph citi analyst thanks ernie maybe just starting on guidance in the fourth quarter you did 0 32 of core ffo which annualized gets you to 1 28 so above the low end and i recognize there is transaction activity and some refinancing or paying down of debt but just wondering if you can walk through the right run rate to start and any adjustments to the fourth quarter number that gets you to the 2020 guidance ernest m freedman executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i ll take it more at a high level approached nick with regards to for the full year and then we can try to tie it back to the fourth quarter so for the full year we laid out in the supplemental growing from where we ended 2020 at 1 25 and walking to the midpoint of our guidance range which is 1 31 first off the expected noi growth rate of 4 25 at our midpoint of guidance adds 0 08 we have a couple of things that are acting as headwinds for us as we go from 2019 to 2021 as we thought it was a wise decision in terms of exiting the nashville market but that was dilutive to us with regards to the noi contribution that we gave up compared to the use of proceeds which i think was a good use of proceeds for us to delever the balance sheet further but that s going to cost us about 0 01 and certainly in the fourth quarter of 2020 2019 excuse me nike we basically had a full contribution from the nashville portfolios as we sold that in the middle of december so there s certainly a little bit of noise from that and secondly when you look at in one of the items we pointed out in that walk was the fact that financing costs are going to be a 0 03 i addressed about half of that comes from just what we have in place today in terms of our forward step up swaps those were put in place a few years ago by the company we merged with with regards to similar when invitation homes it was toward fixing our long term cost and these forward step up swaps which we ve disclosed in our 10 qs and our 10 ks over the last many years a number of swaps expired during 2020 just like they did in 2019 and the replacement swap that is already it was in place for the last few years is at a higher rate and so that s going to cost us about 0 015 in terms of our dilution that s kind of spread out through the entire year so again a little of that impacts back to the fourth quarter number and number that you pointed out as well when you factor that in and then our expectations around being a net acquirer this year which we hope to do that also that s the other part of the 0 03 i talked about there those are kind of the big drivers that take us from 1 25 to 1 31 if we didn t have that dilution if we didn t have a little bit of noise from the cost of funds you would have seen an ffo growth rate that would have been closer to the higher single digits versus what we re projecting again at the midpoint of our guidance that s closer to 5 nick joseph citi analyst thanks it s very helpful and then maybe just on the net acquirer comment can you quantify that what guidance assumes for acquisitions and dispositions in 2020 ernest m freedman executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah sure so what we re expecting to do and we hope to do is to be able to acquire a similar pace that we finished out the second half of 2019 and that pace was anywhere between high 100 million almost 200 million up to about 225 million 250 million so we re hopeful that we ll be able to continue at a pace similar to that in 2020 and typically what you ve seen in our years on the acquisitions front that ramps up throughout the year the first quarter typically is a little bit lighter you see us ramp up in the second quarter we usually see some great opportunities in the third quarter as peak buying season by end users winds down there s opportunities for us to jump in and then it kind of slows down again in the fourth quarter so it wouldn t be ratable across the year so we ll see if we can maintain that pace it all depends on what the market conditions are and where our cost of capital is at that time on the dispo front you ll see a drop off in the amount of dispositions we ve done relative to what you saw in 2019 the guidance certainly doesn t consider any bulk sales or any market exits like you saw in nashville and the guidance assumes that we re going to have dispositions more in the range of probably 250 million to 400 million of dispositions a little more front weighted on that one than not but generally spread out across the year but maybe a little more front weighted as you think about where the 250 million to 400 million of proceeds may come in nick joseph citi analyst thank you ernest m freedman executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks nick operator the next question comes from shirley wu with bank of america please go ahead shirley wu bank of america analyst hey guys thanks for taking the questions so my first question has to do with your 20 guidance so you do assume of around 50 bps in acceleration at the midpoint on revenues so i m just curious as the building blocks of that and what you re seeing in terms of demand from a consumer ernest m freedman executive vice president and chief financial officer sure yeah sure let me talk about the guidance and i can let charles weigh in about what we re seeing currently from the demand from the consumer in 2019 our revenue growth came in at our high end of guidance and we re pleased to report that came in at 4 5 at the midpoint of our guidance as you pointed out for 2020 we re assuming 4 not dissimilar to what we did last year last year our midpoint of guidance i think was 4 1 and we ended at 4 5 so we re certainly hopeful we ll have a similar track record in 2020 compared to 2019 but we ll just have to see how it plays out but embedded in that assumption at the midpoint of guidance of 4 we re assuming occupancy stays relatively flat compared to the prior year we re assuming that other income improves a little bit relative to the other in terms of the other income growth rate and likely at a rate that s slightly higher than our overall revenue growth so higher than 4 but offsetting that as we are expecting that from a rate perspective that will decelerate a little bit from what you saw in 2019 we had a similar thought as we entered 2019 and it turned out we were able to do a little bit better and that s what got us to where we did with a 4 5 growth rate just when you think about the numbers on a year over year basis last year shirley to get to our 4 5 in the 2019 numbers we had 50 basis point increase in occupancy as i mentioned we think that s going to be more flattish this year so you take that out you re kind of comparing a 4 to a 4 we hope to do a little bit better maybe a little bit better on occupancy and maybe a little bit better on rate that s built into our numbers we certainly see the opportunity for that but we want to make sure we came out with reasonable expectations to start the year charles do you want to talk about where we re seeing demand lies right now charles d young executive vice president and chief operating officer yeah high level hey shirley overall fundamentals are strong supply demand remains a significant tailwind as we look across the market as i said in my opening comments we took the fourth quarter to make sure we re focused on occupancy and in january we re in good shape we re year over year above where we were last year trying to hold that occupancy in q1 so we can go into peak season to capture that strong demand that we re still seeing out there shirley wu bank of america analyst got it that s helpful so my next question has to do with the recent announcements whether that s the jonathan litt minority stake in amh or the merger for front yard i was curious as to your thoughts on what that means for an industry and just overall thoughts on a major platform dallas b tanner president and chief executive officer director shirley this is dallas i m happy to talk high level from an industry perspective i prefer not to get into specifics about any competitors on this call from an industry perspective though as you look at the consolidation that you see happening whether it s with the recently announced resi amherst transaction or some of the smaller things that we see in the marketplace that happened it s all good generally speaking for the industry we would expect that this industry over time and some distance will have many operators with considerable scale we look at it as a good thing for the space in terms of ancillary companies other opportunities things that will develop around the industry as well as the ability to offer quality experience for residents which will only help the industry mature over time so we view all of these kind of moments of consolidation as a real opportunity for the companies that are involved in the industry as a whole shirley wu bank of america analyst okay thanks for the color operator the next question comes from drew babin with baird please go ahead drew babin baird analyst hey good morning building on shirley s question looks like one of the leasing spreads for 2019 overall were about 4 6 and you mentioned so far in january occupancy is trending ahead year over year i guess kind of putting it all together you d have to be assuming a pretty significant deceleration in the leasing pace early in the year at least to hit the very low end of guidance and so i guess filtering that down is there anything that you re actually seeing on the ground anywhere that would point to this deceleration in blending leasing spreads or is it just a product of it being early in the year and kind of just waiting to see how things come together as peak leasing season approaches ernest m freedman executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah drew i think it s definitely much much more the latter and remember this is guidance when we provide a range and you re right to point out when you factor in and understand that a lot of our revenue is sort of baked in already based on the leases we signed in 2019 and it would take a significant deceleration for us to get to the low end and we certainly hope just not see that i ll also caution that both the fourth quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020 are light leasing months for us the brunt of the year in terms of we need to achieve for 2020 leasing activity will occur in the second quarter and the third quarter as it does across all the residential space so i m always cautious not to draw too much to get too excited if its december or january early your numbers are great and also not get too worried if they re not where you might want it to be because you re not doing a whole lot of leasing activity at that time of the year we want to provide a range for guidance as to what are our possibilities but it certainly we feel good where we re starting the year we feel good where things are at and we certainly see a path that could play out similar to what we saw in 2019 that we re able to later in the year as peak season did well in 2019 if we had that opportunity in 2020 to increase guidance as we go drew babin baird analyst okay appreciate the color and on the expense side you talked about real estate tax growth kind of moderating to somewhere in the 4s which is obviously good news and i know there s a lot of work that goes into the thousands of appeals that you need to do i guess how much wood is there left to chop as far as appeals that will impact this year both to assessments and millage rates legislation and tax is changing with municipal revenue guidelines and then i guess is there anything on the variable expense side r m or anything like that where you could see maybe a little bit of extra benefit as the year goes on but like the revenue guide it might just be a little too early to predict ernest m freedman executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah on the real estate tax you said it right drew there s always a lot of wood to chop when it comes to appeals and our guidance does not assume a whole lot of success in appeals so if we have continued to have better and better years and we had a pretty good year in 2019 there s an opportunity to potentially perform to the upside there we do expect some success but again it s moderate levels but in states like texas its normal course to appeal basically everything we still have a number of outstanding appeals in georgia that we got our fingers crossed on and hopefully we have some good news on and of course if you go across different jurisdictions you see different opportunities and florida is always a big one for us one of the nice things we re seeing is again with our exposure to california and the fact that real estate taxes are locked in at 2 growth rate there because of prop 13 that certainly helps over time moderate our real estate tax exposure and so again we re confident that we re going to do something in the 4s as we discussed i discussed in the prepared remarks and again we ll see opportunities potentially to do a little bit better than that across the broader expense environment you re also right drew and that it s early days january was a good month for us january came in meeting our expectations with regard to expenses and is doing slightly better than what we might have expected on the revenue side but not enough to get too excited about but also it s one month and we ll see how the year plays out with regards to how things go there we certainly built in some level of contingency in our expense numbers in some years you need it in some years you don t and unfortunately some years you might not have built in enough and we do our best to try to factor that into our guidance and similarly last year we had a big outperformance in expenses as the year went around went through and we ll hope to do the same this year but it s too early to give with any confidence where that may hit drew babin baird analyst great appreciate the thoughts that s all for me ernest m freedman executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks drew operator the next question comes from jason green with evercore please go ahead jason green evercore analyst good morning on the rental rate growth side i understand these numbers can bounce around but just curious what you re seeing given both new and renewal leases showed a slight deceleration in the quarter year over year is that kind of product mix or is there less room today to push rate charles d young executive vice president and chief operating officer hey jason this is charles thanks for the question as i said fundamentals are strong in the markets and we re seeing it on the ground supply and demand still a tailwind when you step back and you look 2019 in aggregate we had a great year on occupancy and rate growth both were up year over year and we had our best peak leasing season ever in retrospect it s as we look back though it s clear that we may have held the new lease rate maybe a little too long into the season and it started to slow down our leasing velocity in q4 and as we talked about q4 q1 are slowing leasing seasons and we wanted to focus on occupancy and so what you re seeing across the markets in some of the markets we had to push a little bit down on rates to get back to occupancy and we got to 96 in q4 and in january we re running north of 96 which is great we re above where we were last year and we re keeping that momentum going in so the whole idea here is to set ourselves up for peak leasing season where all the action happens q1 q4 things are a little slower we want to capture the peak leasing season to make sure that we can have our best foot forward jason green evercore analyst got it and then i know you guys had talked about hoping to do call it 200 million per quarter in acquisitions but in today s market with today s pricing are you able to quantify the total dollar amount of potential acquisitions you see in the marketplace today that makes sense from a pricing perspective dallas b tanner president and chief executive officer director well i mean and again this is dallas good question i think as we look think about growth and we think about acquisitions and we said this ernie mentioned this in his earliest comment in the q a we feel that that 200 million per quarter run rate is pretty achievable in today s environment given where the supply and demand kind of meet each other in the markets that we re really focused in if we saw more opportunity we would certainly try to lean in and find a bit more external growth while we weigh out everything including what our cost of capital at that point is it s hard to quantify everything that you re missing on top of what you re acquiring but at the end of the day we feel pretty good about those estimates somewhere between 175 million and 250 million a quarter feels pretty doable in today s environment and we d certainly look for more opportunity to come in front of us jason green evercore analyst got it thank you very much operator the next question comes from hardik goel with zelman associates please go ahead hardik goel zelman associates analyst hey guys thanks for taking my question i guess just to round out sources and uses of the capital can you give us an update on where you expect leverage to be at the end of the year ernest m freedman executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah absolutely and a lot will depend on our capital activity that we do with regards to acquisitions and dispositions but we expect that we ll continue to be able to bring our excuse me improve our net debt to ebitda numbers and based on kind of where our guidance is and where we see ebitda coming in and our plans around capital allocation i would expect net debt to ebitda to be somewhere between 7 times and 7 5 times by the end of the year hardik goel zelman associates analyst got it thank you that s all for me ernest m freedman executive vice president and chief financial officer okay operator the next question comes from richard hill with morgan stanley please go ahead ronald kamdem morgan stanley analyst you got ronald kamdem on for richard just a couple of quick ones from me the first is just on going back to sort of the market exit any other markets that could potentially we could see down the road as an exit opportunity and if not what are the markets that are going to be mostly targeted for dispositions that we should be thinking about dallas b tanner president and chief executive officer director yeah in terms of how we look at the portfolio as a whole from an asset management perspective we re always going to be measuring ourselves against performance and some of the other macro factors that we see in markets so as ernie mentioned in his guidance comments at the beginning for the year we re not pricing in any bulk sales or market exits in any of our plans for 2020 i think that our selling will center around traditionally what we ve always looked at which are non performers geographic outliers parts of the portfolio that aren t just making a ton of sense for us over the long term and as we weigh that out in terms of our global view of where we can find the best risk adjusted returns that s where we re typically selling on the margin and you see that we re a little bit more active in the middle part of the year as we re turning more properties and having the ability to look and review some of the assets that are on our questionable lists and things that we re thinking about but i wouldn t expect anything outside the norm from a market mix perspective than what we ve done in the past ronald kamdem morgan stanley analyst great and just a quick follow up going back to the control of expense question just digging in a little bit i think about the 3 growth that you re targeting is it fair to think about maybe r m growing above that and some of the other line items maybe growing below that and getting us to that average or are they sort of all uniformly distribute it any other color there would be helpful ernest m freedman executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so when we talk about r m i d rather broaden it ron and just talk about the overall cost to maintain it s just the opex side of it it s the capex side of it as well this year in terms of we do expect both opex and capex to scope in similar amounts and then we think all that line item is going to be in right around that same inflationary increase ronald kamdem morgan stanley analyst thank you operator the next question comes from jade rahmani with kbw please go ahead jade rahmani kbw analyst thanks very much with about 50 of revenue coming from california and florida i wanted to ask about how an issue like climate change factors into your thinking and considerations thinking about the current asset base as well as when you re making new investments and just in terms of a practical import when do you think an issue like climate change would start to affect insurance costs and other operating factors how far ahead are you looking at this issue dallas b tanner president and chief executive officer director thanks jade i ll take the first question i ll let ernie talk about the insurance question on your second comment question in terms of how we think about climate change and you referenced california and florida obviously both very warm weather markets for us high growth lots of things going on in those markets we re focused on a couple of areas so first of all as you start to look at the portfolio as a whole and which assets you want to own and why for the launch you want to be sensitive around things like flood plain and things where you could have potential exposure which also doves in your pricing on your insurance question which ernie can comment on and then we re also doing some things we ve actually got we re doing some what i call early work to try to get smart around what opportunities are available to us around things that fall into the esg buckets such as solar and things like that now are those sustainable strategies for us for the long haul we re not in a position today where we feel that we ve got that completely figured out but it s certainly something we re focused on we want to be an environmentally friendly company there s things we do already whether it s around hardscape landscaping and things like that that can add to that narrative and that mission which is part of being active in our community but there s still a lot of room to grow and things are changing consistently so i think making sure that from a risk profile we re being smart around which assets where and why and then also from a service perspective what are the things that we can do to enhance that experience and also be environmentally friendly along the way are all focus for us right now ernest m freedman executive vice president and chief financial officer on the expense side it s certainly something we re very cognizant of even on the investment side as we think about risk adjusted returns across our entire portfolio we re very focused on thinking about putting the correct premiums that would be required because of that from a california perspective jade the risk for us from a climate perspective would be around wildfires and we ve been very specific about where we re investing in california and had been very fortunate to date based on where we are where our geographies are the wildfires the power outages that have been impacting california really haven t impacted us so when you take that to an insurance perspective really the risk we re insuring for in california is quake which is separate risk from climate change with florida we ve been very specific to make sure where we re investing in florida that we re not exposed exactly to the coast we re very careful on flood plains and what insurers like about our risk compared to other residential is that our risk is spread out across thousands of assets across many many miles and we don t have a 100 million single asset in one location that could be impacted very significantly by something that happening from a storm perspective so it s a little bit more dispersion of risk but clearly anyone who has exposure to florida and we have exposure to florida has seen pressure on cost when it comes to insurance but we have some good mitigants offsetting that that probably put us in a little bit better position relative to other residential and commercial real estate because of the nature of our asset type jade rahmani kbw analyst thanks for that just turning to the investment outlook and acquisitions how far are you looking out in terms of cap rates because it can make a big difference based on your growth assumptions for example buying at a 5 cap might seem attractive but if the market is only growing at a 2 same store organic rent growth rate that gets to about 5 5 five years out but buying at a 4 5 cap with the market growing 5 6 similar to where say phoenix and vegas were growing gets to 6 or higher five years out so how far are you underwriting in terms of your investment criteria dallas b tanner president and chief executive officer director it s a great question jade and you re spot on going in cap rate doesn t tell you the whole story on any acquisition so we would agree and remember we re total return investors so to really emphasize the point you made we look at obviously ingoing yields and what the cash flow s going to look like but we really care about what s going to happen around the asset over the long haul and so our models are typically anywhere between three and five years as we look at markets and there s a couple of ways we do it looking at kind of different return profiles but we completely agree i mean we care as much about what our year three noi yield is going to look like as much as we do our year one and coupling that with where we think we re going to see that outperformance and growth and if you look at where we have been active specifically in 2019 i mean you ll notice that the majority of the 2 000 plus acquisitions we made last year were on the west coast and that s indicative of the type of growth we re seeing it s evidenced in the renewal rates the new lease growth that charles has talked about i mean you see markets like phoenix for example in the fourth quarter and we had blended lease rates of 7 which are really really strong and it really emphasizes the types of growth you re seeing in those parts of the market so we would agree it s all relative it s all important as it goes into our models and how we think about growth and as we mentioned earlier in the call and in my opening remarks we are as focused on trying to grow accretively through external measures in markets where we already have significant scale like phoenix and orlando those are great markets for us going forward jade rahmani kbw analyst thanks for taking the questions operator the next question comes from douglas harter with credit suisse please go ahead sam choe credit suisse analyst hi this is actually sam choe on for doug today just going back to jade s question about climate i mean we ve had a milder winter this year compared to the historical average so when we re thinking about maintenance strategy how does weather impact when to make the capex spending to kind of maintain the rental portfolio charles d young executive vice president and chief operating officer yeah i mean we have a couple of cold weather markets in denver and chicago we ve been operating there for a while and we re always conscious of how we treat the homes especially when they re vacant to make sure that we re being conscious of any freezing pipes and stuff like that and our smart home technology helps us with that and being highly occupied is another benefit so we try to pay attention to that the reality is it has been a little more mild but there s seasonality that comes with it our experience and talent on the ground that s why we re local we have eyes on assets that gives us a good comfort that we re making sure we re maintaining the homes that are vacant and occupied by our residents sam choe credit suisse analyst got it on a similar line i mean you guys talked about the lowering of days to reresident how smart home other tech kind of impact that just curious how that has changed compared to last year and how we should expect that going forward charles d young executive vice president and chief operating officer yeah well the last couple of years we really haven t moved down this metric as much as we want we re in the mid 40s right now and our goal this year it s a real focus is to try to take two or three days off that in 2020 as you mentioned there s a lot that goes into it looking at turn times utilizing technology to try to lease better and faster and just having an overall focus is the real cross functional metric that we re looking at so there s no reason long term that we d like to get that number down into the 30s we have several markets that are there right now and so we re going to continue to push there s real benefit in getting that economic occupancy down sam choe credit suisse analyst perfect thank you operator the next question comes from john pawlowski with green street advisors please go ahead john pawlowski green street advisors analyst thanks charles curious for your thoughts on a few of your florida markets which saw outsized revenue deceleration take south florida for instance which the comps weren t all that difficult and you still saw outsized pressure on the new leases so on the demand side what are you seeing in terms of employment shifts and then or is it more of a supply issue with single family construction starting to add pricing power charles d young executive vice president and chief operating officer yeah good question on south florida it s really more of a supply issue and it s not necessarily the new single family supply specifically but there s a lot of condo vacancy a lot of options for the consumer to choose from and given that and it s really happening in certain submarkets where we re seeing the supply impact and our field teams and asset management teams have done a really good job of selectively pruning out of those submarkets so we ll think we ll be in good shape long term but because of that we ve been focused on occupancy if you look at look back over the year we actually went up in occupancy to 95 4 versus 95 2 in 2018 and we ll take that same approach in 2020 with a little bit of supply out there you may see some pressure on rates but we ve been able to maintain occupancy and we ll focus there until we can start to get some pricing power john pawlowski green street advisors analyst i guess how much overlap between your tenant base and a condo occupier is there is that i wouldn t assume there s a ripple effect in terms of your tenant base maybe a bit lower credit quality versus a mom and pop that would occupy a condo charles d young executive vice president and chief operating officer yeah there typically is not south florida is a very unique market and i think it really comes down to just having lots of options for the consumer in a market like that our rents are a little higher in south florida condos are out there if people are trying to move them it just gives options so it s to your point it s not typical but in that market it s kind of unique and it s showing up john pawlowski green street advisors analyst okay and then last one for me ernie or charles hoping you could humor a hypothetical i m trying to disentangle in terms of the next few years the natural aging of homes and the impact on the total cost to maintain versus pretty robust above inflation growth we re seeing on the labor side and the material side so if labor costs and material costs literally printed 0 growth over the next few years what s a reasonable cadence of total cost to maintain we should expect as your homes just naturally age ernest m freedman executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah john just i don t want to speak off the top of my head and give you an answer we ll need to think through that a little bit because it is hard to disentangle those types of things we also take have the impact the fact that we re pivoting to external growth which means we ll be bringing more homes on that will get that initial upfront renovation relative to what we ve seen in the last few years so unfortunately it s not an answer i can give you spot on as we re sitting here but let s give it some thought and get back to you john pawlowski green street advisors analyst all right understood thanks operator next question comes from haendel st juste with mizuho please go ahead haendel st juste mizuho analyst thank you operator that was spot on good morning out there ernest m freedman executive vice president and chief financial officer is that the first time haendel haendel st juste mizuho analyst probably hey a question i guess going back to external growth for a second i guess i want to get more of a sense of the competitive dynamic you re seeing out there by our account there s at least three large private platforms looking to grow and one public peer so i guess i want to get at how large or how attractive are the opportunities today versus say a year or two ago that meet your quality and market requirement and more importantly are you seeing more competition for the deals you re looking at dallas b tanner president and chief executive officer director yeah it s a great question so i think your first question encompasses really just demand right like what s the demand feel like out there and i d say if you look at any of the new home builder data if you look at any of the resale data it all kind of point to the same direction in the first quarter this year which is resale supply is really tight consumers are buying homes leasing homes really quickly in the market which just generally talks about the supply is underserved and so we would see that the same way now to your specific question around what do we see specifically in our space with our competitors i think we got to be honest with ourselves and taking a step back and just remind ourselves there s no more than probably 400 000 homes that are professionally managed in the u s today which would represent less than 2 of the overall single family rental detached population so even among our peers whether they re public or private we represent a very small cohort of the people that are actively out acquiring single family homes either for ownership or for rental so we play in the same sandbox so to speak with the end users with other consumers new capital coming into the space what have you and so as i look at it this market has been really tight for the past three or four years there hasn t been a ton of new supply and then you go back to what i think is a differentiator for our business which is we generally earn a much tighter location band than most of our peers that we pay attention to in this single family rental space and that s indicative of where our rent values are today i think we re approaching almost 1 850 and if you look at the price points of our homes whether it be what we re buying or selling generally a much higher price point which means much closer in which lends itself to some of those overwhelming demand kind of factors that come into play so the demand side of it and that feels really active there s not a bunch of homes sitting on market and a company like invitation homes can just go in but when you re local when you re looking at everything all the time when you re active in the space both on the buy and the sell side it lends itself to opportunities we talked about that in our opening remarks we had an excellent bulk transaction in the first quarter on the buy side we had a really efficient sale on the bulk side in q4 so i would expect us to keep kind of running the same offense that we are which is being opportunistic not compromising location and i would expect that we can put up that 200 million per quarter number hopefully unless we see something different haendel st juste mizuho analyst great thank you for that dallas and i guess to follow up given those comments especially the low new supply dynamic i m wondering if there s been any rethink on your view on perhaps building out a development platform now that you re especially ready to run and grow dallas b tanner president and chief executive officer director no not really in terms of taking on balance sheet risk and being a builder that s not something we re focused on today i think being the best buyer of single family homes in the country that s what we are focused on today so if that s buying from a builder or buying from boutique builders and markets we ll look at that but we don t want to compromise my earlier point on location for the sake of growth it s just it s a doom loop if you buy further out if you re willing to chase what are what i would call paper yields you can get yourself in trouble if you are diligent and disciplined around sticking to what you know how to do which for our business has been paying up the curve and buying assets that are better located that are going to have some of those demand factors we talked about we believe that s a winning formula for us going forward haendel st juste mizuho analyst great thank you one more if i could a question on dallas the market occupancy there is just about looks like 89 well below your portfolio average and down looks like over 300 basis points year over year curious if that s some type of temporary dip perhaps seeing some supplier move out to the home buying there so curious what s going on your dallas portfolio and then more broadly as we step back and think about where you can deploy redeploy some of your nashville capital how high in your list are dallas and houston today in both markets where you have under 5 000 homes and what are the current yields or irr is broadly speaking in those markets today dallas b tanner president and chief executive officer director that s like three or four questions one more here haendel go ahead charles charles d young executive vice president and chief operating officer so i ll take the first part then i m going to turn it over to dallas to talk about the redeployment as i hear your question i think you may be looking at the total portfolio versus same store portfolio to get the occupancy focusing on same store for dallas and looking at the year over year we actually had a really good year occupancy is up to 95 5 again below kind of our average but it was up from 94 3 the year before so we made nice progress so good strides there we made some more changes in late 2018 and performance has responded well based on that and we were actually up on rate year over year in dallas as well so i think as those markets continue to grow we got a great team on the ground right now we re going to add more assets to it we get some even larger scale we ll continue to focus on occupancy and continue to grow the rate over time i ll turn it over to dallas do you want to talk about the redeployment of nashville dallas b tanner president and chief executive officer director yeah sure so haendel we ve been pretty clear about this probably in the last year and half we really want to grow in markets like dallas and denver and you ll see that in our 2019 numbers for dallas i think we bought 175 homes and we only sold i think less than 40 so we grew by 130 assets so that market itself we ve put a lot of thought into specifically where we want to grow what types of submarkets making sure that we re staffed up the right way we ve actually kind of built out both of those teams both dallas and denver in the last year so really good about where we are heading into 2020 and i would expect that your total portfolio vacancy will be a little bit lower as we re on boarding those new units over the next couple of years haendel st juste mizuho analyst got it thank you guys operator the next question comes from ryan gilbert with btig please go ahead ryan gilbert btig analyst hey thanks guys had a question on turnover and charles you said that you might have held rate just a little bit longer than you had might have liked in the second half of this year and i m wondering if that contributed to the tick up in turnover that we saw in the fourth quarter on a year over year basis or if there s been an increase in move outs to home purchase or anything else that might have driven the turnover rate higher charles d young executive vice president and chief operating officer yeah great question so taking your last part first we haven t seen any uptick in move out for home purchase it s been pretty flat throughout the year and in regards to turnover look the number is still really low and it ticked up a little bit but 30 is a number we like and a lot of that is a testament to our teams and what they re able to do and the customer service that we re providing it s hard to say where they re holding that rate was really an uptick that s really on the new lease side so those homes are already turned over and they stayed a little vacant longer than we wanted and that s why we had to give up on rate a bit so i don t think that contributed to it or maybe had a mild contribution but overall we re still really pleased with where we are in our trailing 12 turnover rate 30 is really strong ryan gilbert btig analyst okay got it and then just two quick ones what do you think you can earn from an operating cash flow perspective in 2020 charles d young executive vice president and chief operating officer i ll make sure i understand the question what will we earn from an operating cash flow ryan gilbert btig analyst sorry earn is not right word what do you think your operating cash flow will be in 2020 it looks like it s around 700 million in 2019 ernest m freedman executive vice president and chief financial officer well i just want to think about how you re defining operating cash flow with regards are you looking at core ffo or are you looking at affo after recurring capex ryan gilbert btig analyst just cash flow from operations on your cash flow statement ernest m freedman executive vice president and chief financial officer ryan let me get we ll have to get back to you on that after the call so i don t want to answer it incorrectly with this many people on the line ryan gilbert btig analyst okay understood and then just how have initial noi yields trended on acquisitions dallas b tanner president and chief executive officer director well ingoing cap rates for us for the most part have been kind of in the mid 5s in terms of what we re seeing is that am i answering your question right ryan gilbert btig analyst yeah no real change in acquisition cap rates then dallas b tanner president and chief executive officer director on today s environment no ryan gilbert btig analyst got it thank you operator the next question comes from buck horne with raymond james please go ahead buck horne raymond james analyst not quite but well close enough appreciate you guys now that we re in an election year i did want to circle back on the rent control topic and thoughts about just your california homes and given that there s just more rumblings for possibilities of enhanced rent control measures out there that could affect single family rentals whether they re owned by corporations or others how do you balance that into your equation of capital allocation and your thoughts about california investments going forward dallas b tanner president and chief executive officer director yeah you stay active on it is the short answer you make sure that you re part of the discussion that you re involved we work with a number of different organizations specifically in california to keep a surprise of anything that s going on and on top of that we participate at the state level with the governor s office and the housing authorities that are involved with the state of california we have buck we have actually in our 2020 guidance baked in that we think will be active in terms of making sure that we re getting the right messaging out and being focused on no on prop 10 what they re calling prop 10 2 0 now i think it s a little disappointing because i think the governor and the house and the senate done a nice job in trying to create some alignment around the rent cap measure that went in place last year we are also very realistic in our understanding that every two years or so this is going to be an election type of topic and so we ve got to stay active on it we believe that costa hawkins will or what they re calling prop 10 2 0 will have the similar effect that it did two years ago which was resoundingly defeated i think by a measure of 2 to 1 we believe that it s not good for the state of california to limit new development in rooftop formation and things that the state quite frankly needs my understanding is that the governor is on board with that approach and that that is generally widely seen as one that will pass in terms of being focused on other markets as well where some of those conversations coming up we re very active through the nhrc through some of the other efforts that we participate in to make sure that we re in the early stages involved with any discussions that are going on around rent control or anything like it fortunately it doesn t feel like as of yet in any of our other markets that there s anything of real substance moving through any floors whether it be at the state level or local levels and so california is always a little trickier it s one of the benefits of our portfolio as ernie mentioned before it s a great market with high demand but you get to inherit some of the fun governmental type of stuff that can come up as being an active owner of real estate in those markets and you ve got to participate in the process so for us we ll continue to stay active we believe that we re in a good position and we ll continue to support causes to get the messaging out buck horne raymond james analyst awesome thank you and my last quick one is going back to your comments about how many smaller private whether they re mom and pop investors out there that are buying up homes and the amount of capital that s getting invested in the single family rental those percentages seem to have increased and that s one of the reasons resell inventory seems to be so tight so how do you think about that going into leasing season do you think that the increased investor activity creates a near term supply headwind as they re trying to get those homes turned and leased or does it really just is it a function of that the overall housing market is just still supply demand imbalanced in your favor how do you think about that going in leasing season dallas b tanner president and chief executive officer director your last comment spot on overall the housing supply imbalance is definitely in the favor of anyone in the single family business whether you have home available for sale or homes available for lease we don t see that changing and i think it is important to remember the differentiation and i ll let charles speak to this as well but the macros on our industry whether we come into a market with 150 new homes in a given year or don t doesn t really change the macros particularly of that market in terms of how much overall product could be available for lease to your point we may have a little bit better visibility in what some of our maybe bigger institutional peers are doing because of their marketing and things like that but i ll let charles speak to that charles d young executive vice president and chief operating officer yeah macro dallas is spot on i think we will see in certain markets where there s a real focus on great fundamental markets like orlando where the competitors came in and bought up some product and put it on the market all at once that you may have a short term blip we saw that in orlando in q4 it s starting to moderate as you work through the product and if you look at our numbers our results in occupancy have rebounded immediately so if there is it s kind of a short term thing and then we get back to the fundamentals of the market that play out and that most of all of our markets are in our favor buck horne raymond james analyst very helpful guys thanks charles d young executive vice president and chief operating officer thanks buck operator this concludes our question and answer session i would now like to turn the conference back over to dallas tanner for any closing remarks dallas b tanner president and chief executive officer director we d like to thank everyone for joining us today we appreciate your interest in invitation homes and the team looks forward to seeing

np earnings call for the period ending december 31 2019 neenah inc np q4 2019 earnings call 11 00 a m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks operator good day and welcome to the neenah q4 and full year 2019 earnings call i would now like to turn the conference over to bill mccarthy vice president of investor relations please go ahead bill mccarthy vice president of investor relations thank you good morning and welcome to neenah s 2019 fourth quarter earnings call joining with me today on the call are chief executive officer john o donnell julie a schertell our chief operating officer and chief financial officer bonnie lind john julie and bonnie will provide comments on business and financial results for the fourth quarter and the past year and after these prepared remarks we ll open up the call for questions as usual i ll start with a few headlines fourth quarter sales were 214 million down from the prior year as a result of soft market demand the divestiture of a fine paper mill in late 2018 and a mid year change with a major fine paper distributor margins and earnings however increased significantly in the quarter adjusted earnings per share of 0 87 grew 64 from 0 53 a year ago while gaap earnings of 0 92 per share rose 21 details on adjusting items for both quarter and full year along with a reconciliation to comparable gaap figures are included in our press release in closing i ll note that our comments today include forward looking statements and actual results could differ from these statements due to uncertainties and risks outlined both on our website and in our sec filings with that i d like to turn things over to john john p o donnell president and chief executive officer thanks bill and good morning everyone looking back at 2019 i m very pleased with what our team has accomplished with external factors challenging demand in many of our markets our teams were focused on items within their control these included in implementing long term strategic decisions that will make us stronger in the years to come as well as actions that had a more immediate positive impact in the year the success of these activities can be seen in our results first and foremost we reinvigorated safety efforts and ended the year with our lowest quarterly recordable incident rate in almost two years we delivered record free cash flow of 76 million and used this to reduce debt by almost 40 million and returned 37 million of cash to shareholders through an increased dividend and modest share repurchases we carefully managed costs and pricing activities and exited the year as promised on a more normalized basis with operating margins increasing over 400 basis points and finishing the year at double digits and last but not least return on invested capital a key metric for us also improved rising about 30 basis points while this metric has been pressured it s always remained well ahead of our cost of capital and we re now near targeted double digit levels as we start off 2020 one of the things i m most encouraged about is the potential of our new organizational structure as you may recall in december we announced a functional reporting alignment with our global head of sales and marketing as well as our global head of operations reporting to julie as chief operating officer the intent of this change is to provide added focus to accelerate our top line growth rate and improve the speed and quality of our operational performance for example in sales this change will allow our r d teams to better utilize our many technical capabilities to unlock the potential of our global customers while in operations it will facilitate the global implementation of neenah operating system to drive continued improvements in safety customer satisfaction asset efficiencies and cost reductions you re probably aware there was another recent organizational announcement that there s a little closer to home for me i ll talk about that later in the call but now i m pleased to introduce our chief operating officer julie schertell julie a schertell senior vice president and chief operating officer thank you john it s my pleasure to join you and bonnie on today s call i d like to begin by talking about some of the results and activities under way in each of our business segments in fine paper and packaging our team took a number of actions to strengthen our leading market position restore and protect margins and position us better for the future these included the sale of an unprofitable and non strategic mill in brattleboro vermont at the end of 2018 and more recently a significant change in our relationship with a major distributor that was underperforming while both actions negatively impacted the top line in 2019 they were clearly the right long term moves regarding the distributor repositioning this began in the third quarter and we ve seen a positive response both from the market and in the performance of other distributors who represent our most valued fine paper brands this has reaffirmed our confidence that the change will result in better support of our brand and consequently better business results we ve got several other initiatives under way to drive the top line in this segment recent premium packaging innovation efforts have delivered more environmentally preferred products as customers increasingly look for alternatives to plastic we re seeing growing demand for our paper based gift cards and are well positioned in this category with a unique asset and innovative market solution we re also launching a recyclable wide format signage portfolio that is an environmental alternative to competitive made styrene products and provide lower cost and use for customers in addition to these packaging efforts we re making new commercial print products with sustainable fiber to meet market needs most recently introducing hemp based product and we are improving our supply chain capabilities to reduce lead times and improve order management engagement and efficiencies with all of our customers looking to the bottom line we ve continued to aggressively manage cost in all areas this included idling a fine paper machine early in the third quarter and moving volume to other available assets hoping to generate savings of roughly 1 million a year in the second half of 2019 profitability improved significantly with operating margins returning to historical mid teen levels for this segment turning to technical products with almost 60 of our sales outside of the us we saw top line challenges in 2019 with the weakness in global economies the biggest impact has been lower backings sales to asia as volumes were pressured by rising nationalism a strong us dollar and ongoing tariff concerns industrial backings remains a solid base load business for us though our focus is on categories and markets that provide more attractive growth in margin profiles filtration is certainly one of those attractive markets an important growth platform for neenah transportation is our largest filtration category while more than 80 of sales are recurring for replacement filters results in 2019 reflected caution by our customers due to the economic slowdown across europe and notably in the german auto industry our outlook for this business remains very positive and as we continue to ramp up north american capacity we expect to continue to deliver our historical above market top line growth rates supported by our best in class assets market leading portfolio and strategic customer relationships in 2019 our team made significant progress improving yields and operating efficiencies at our us operation and we utilized available machine time to begin developing and launching a new low emission filter media this new product is environmentally friendly and outperformed current regulatory requirement in anticipation of elevated future needs while still very early in qualifications we re seeing a very positive response from customers transportation filtration often gets the headlines but i d be remiss if i didn t mention water filtration this category had a great year in 2019 with revenues up 20 in 2020 we re making a small capital efficient investment to upgrade an existing asset that will almost double our available capacity our innovation efforts extend to other technical product categories besides filtration in 2020 we launched texcol our digital transfer brand that uses proprietary technology to transfer images on to natural fibers cotton through a waterless process this new process eliminates complex pre and post treatment of textiles reducing cost in use and carbon footprint while providing superior colors and printability we expect this technology to potentially double the size of our addressable market for digital transfer papers another example is our new dispersa performance label product this looks and feels like a traditional label but dissolves rapidly in water providing operational efficiencies primarily for customers and foodservice applications so while external market conditions were soft in 2019 our team was actively focused on doing the right things developing innovative new products to support future growth and continuing to closely monitor and manage costs and pricing activities we exited the year with good momentum and with products in place that position us well for the future i ll come back later in the call to discuss 2020 priorities and our outlook but now i ll turn things over to bonnie to cover financial results in more detail bonnie c lind senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thanks julie good morning everyone fourth quarter results again reflected improving margins and good cash generation i ll review financial results for each of our business segments and then finish with comments on corporate items and 2020 expectations in technical products quarterly sales of 124 million were down from 134 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 more than half of this decline was due to lower industrial backings in asia resulting from rising nationalism and trade disputes in 2019 currency translation due to a weaker euro also contributed 2 million to the decline partly offsetting these items were a higher value sales mix in higher net selling prices the improved sales mix reflected increased sales of our filtration products operating income was 11 3 million in 2019 up from 6 7 million in the prior year with margins increasing over 300 basis points after excluding adjusting items in both periods income in 2019 rose 3 6 million or almost 60 as a result of improved manufacturing efficiencies the more profitable mix and lower input costs now moving to fine paper and packaging quarterly sales of 90 million were down from 106 million in 2018 about a third of the decline resulted from the brattleboro mill divestiture with the rest due to lower commercial print volume which was impacted by weaker market demand and the distributor change we previously mentioned partly offsetting this were higher year on year selling prices and modest growth in premium packaging gaap operating income of 15 2 million increased from 14 1 million in 2018 which included a 3 million benefit from a favorable adjustment to the brattleboro impairment loss after excluding adjusting items operating income in 2019 was 15 6 million which is up 4 6 million from the prior year primarily due to the net favorable impact from input costs and selling prices adjusted operating margins in the quarter were 17 and on the upper end of our expected mid teen range moving on to your corporate items consolidated sg a was 23 million which is up 3 million from 2018 due mostly the timing and amounts of incentive accruals in 2018 the fourth quarter included a large decrease to our accrual as business results in the quarter weekend unallocated corporate sg a expense of 4 4 million was up around 1 million from the prior year and for the same reasons quarterly interest expense was 2 8 million consistent with the third quarter and down from 3 2 million in the prior year expense was lower due to both both to less outstanding debt and lower average interest rates in 2019 debt at the end of the year was just over 200 million that s down 4 million in the quarter and down almost 40 million from the start of the year most of our debt is made up of 175 million senior unsecured notes with the balance in short term euro denominated borrowings from our global revolving credit facility the senior note is due in may of 2021 and we ll refinance this in the next couple of months i ll talk more about that later in part of the outlook next our tax rate in the fourth quarter was 19 the rate increased versus 2018 when we benefited from a remeasurement of overseas tax liabilities following a reduction in rates in the netherlands our cash tax rate is a positive story it should be in the low teens in the near term primarily due to available prior period r d credits that we expect to consume over the next few years ongoing cash contributions and payments to our pension and retirement plans were up 2 million in the fourth quarter but down 8 million for the full year in 2018 we increased an accelerated cash contribution to take advantage of some tax benefits 2019 total cash outlays were approximately 13 million a level that reflects plans that are well funded and maintained this spending was about 4 million higher than expense cash from operations in the quarter was 23 million and capital spending was 8 million we continue to generate substantial free cash flow in the quarter and as john noted delivered record free cash flow for the full year now let s look at a few items that are likely to impact our 2020 results first we expect sg a to average 25 million per quarter and unallocated corporate cost to be around 5 million per quarter both of these are consistent with our past guidance as we grow we expect to realize scale efficiencies which along with top line growth initiatives and cost improvements should contribute to improving margins pension and other post retirement benefit expense will be about 1 million higher in 2020 as a result of lower discount rates used to calculate our liabilities and cash funding is also expected to be up by 1 million net interest expense may increase in 2020 when we renew our senior notes depending on the size and the interest rates and then finally our ongoing book tax rate should be around the 22 that we previously guided in 2019 our 17 rate was below this due to adjustments tax reserves following successful conclusion of tax audits and the expiration of limits while some of the items i mentioned maybe slight headwinds in 2020 i feel really good about the overall condition and direction of the businesses and the actions were taken to drive top and bottom growth and increase our return on capital we generated substantial cash flow which provides options and opportunities and we have cleared capital deployment priorities and disciplined internal processes that help us execute well in addition to supporting value added organic and m a investments our balanced capital deployment allows us to return cash to our shareholders through an attractive and growing dividend while maintaining our commitment to a strong balance sheet with that i d like to turn it back to you julie so you can talk about 2020 julie a schertell senior vice president and chief operating officer thank you bonnie i ll begin by recapping three of our top priorities as we start the year first is continued improvement in our safety performance as john noted we ended the year with one of our safest quarters in a long time however for the full year we were still far from our world class performance expectations in 2020 we ll continue to build out our safety management and hazard identification systems and we ll be engaging with dupont sustainable solutions to learn from and implement their proven methodologies nothing is more important than ensuring our coworkers return home injury free to their families each and every day next is accelerating our sustainable top line growth rate we ll continue to pursue the organic opportunities we have in attractive growing markets like filtration digital transfer and premium packaging i shared earlier some of the success from our innovation efforts and the new products that we re launching it s important to our organic growth efforts to maintain a vital innovation pipeline and i m very pleased with the progress we re demonstrating in this area in addition to organic activities we pursue acquisitions in growing and defensible categories that will add to our growth rate i ve been highly involved in our m a process which remains very active we re focused primarily in technical products where there are opportunities to broaden our portfolio of specialty materials and technologies to meet the needs of an expanding customer base with any potential acquisition we ensure there is a clear strategic fit and touch points with our core competencies and we have a disciplined process to make sure that our investment generates attractive financial returns our third strategic priority in 2020 is to deliver meaningful manufacturing performance improvements under the leadership of our global head of operations we re in the process of developing a neenah operating system and expect to implement a new continuous improvement approach at our two largest facilities by year end while neenah has always had programs to deliver cost savings every year i m confident that will unlock even more opportunities in the future with a consistent approach utilizing different tools and methodologies finally i d like to wrap up with a few comments on our outlook for this year first half of this year typically the first half of the year is typically seasonally stronger especially in technical products while year on year sales comparisons will be softened by the reduction in sales to asia that began in early 2019 and as we complete our transition of fine paper distribution bottom line comparison should benefit from today s lower input cost versus early 2019 currency translation appears to be a modest headwind with the euro our biggest exposure now trading around 1 08 down from 1 14 at the start of 2019 as noted in the press release each 0 05 differential reduces our annual sales by around 10 million with an associated eps impact of approximately 0 10 input costs are expected to gradually rise throughout 2020 though for the record we don t expect a significant run up in prices like we saw in 2018 as we ve demonstrated we can manage costs and pricing to offset variations in input costs over time and they ultimately aren t a meaningful driver of our results our focus on capital efficiency is unchanged and we continue to carefully manage both working capital and capital spending capital spending going forward is expected to be in the range of 2 to 4 of sales slightly lower than our previous guidance and more in line with recent levels maintenance capex is less than half of our total spending as we spend the majority of our capital on projects that deliver attractive return either through cost reduction or enabling profitable growth like the enhancements to the water filtration asset i mentioned earlier in 2020 we expect capital spending of approximately 30 million right in the middle of our stated range in closing i d like to say how excited i am about what i see ahead for neenah our employees our assets our culture and our products are first class and our strong financial position and disciplined approach allow us to act on opportunities that will add value for our shareholders i look forward to getting to know many of you on today s call better in the years ahead and we ll now turn it back to john to wrap up john p o donnell president and chief executive officer thank you julie i recently announced my retirement as president and ceo of neenah effective in may we ve diligently worked on succession planning activities during the past couple of years and i m extremely confident in julie s ability to successfully lead neenah i m committed to working closely with her over the next few months as we complete the final steps of the plan to ensure a seamless transition it s been an honor and a pleasure to lead this company the past 10 years over the past decade neenah has delivered returns to our shareholders of almost 20 annually as we execute our strategies to transform into a more profitable and growing specialty materials company while external conditions make some years more challenging than others as you saw in 2019 our teams continue to move forward as evidenced the record cash flows improved margins and enhanced innovation pipeline delivered in the past year did not just happen by accident neenah is in a very good place today our competitive standing is solid our financial position is strong and we have a number of catalysts and capabilities in place to propel growth into the future importantly neenah also has a deep and experienced leadership team and outstanding employees that have shown they understand what it takes to win i m grateful for my time here and for the support i ve received through the year from our shareholders our dedicated employees and our board of directors i ll be cheering for all of you as i watch julie and her team unlock neenah s endless potential in the years to come thanks for your time today and i ll now open up the call for questions questions and answers operator we will now begin the question and answer session our first question comes from steve chercover with d a davidson please go ahead steven chercover d a davidson analyst well thank you and congratulations to both of you john and julie john p o donnell president and chief executive officer thank you julie a schertell senior vice president and chief operating officer thank you steven chercover d a davidson analyst so i guess i ll start with the obligatory question about the coronavirus do you expect to impact either your sales or your supply chain julie a schertell senior vice president and chief operating officer i ll take that one steve i think the supply chain is really where we re seeing a little bit of an impact slowing in some of the ports but we re just managing it very closely we do very little revenue direct to china and so while it s contained right now we see very minimal impact steven chercover d a davidson analyst okay great well kind of keeping with china the trade dispute last year i think slowed global demand and do you see that reversing course or should we just refer back to question one which is not much impact julie a schertell senior vice president and chief operating officer last year in 2019 when you think about the impact that china had it was really in performance materials and in our backings category and we had a significant impact we re starting to lap that in the first quarter and in the second quarter of 2020 and would not expect that level of decline to continue we also were somewhat impacted in our packaging business premium packaging so when you think about luxury goods and the amount of those that go into hong kong that had a negative impact on our revenue steven chercover d a davidson analyst okay and then switching gears maybe this is more for bonnie but from the remarks in the press release you exit 2019 in much better shape than you started so can we infer that the q1 results for 2020 will have a similar improvement versus last year kind of similar to the q4 versus q4 comp john p o donnell president and chief executive officer i think the similar part is where she s hesitating there should be definitely an improvement bonnie c lind senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yeah steve as we mentioned in our prepared remarks the input costs are going to be in the inverse of what at least what we expect in the inverse in 2020 is where they were in 19 just like they were in the inverse of 19 versus 18 so we would expect that we would come in with significantly lower input costs in the first half versus the first half of 19 and then it ll flip steven chercover d a davidson analyst okay i want to get to that and then also in the press release i guess what john said that you ll recommence capital efficient growth and i guess julie kind of addressed it the end markets are growing so slowly we kind of need bolt on acquisitions in order to truly generate growth or maybe you can just elaborate some new product developments john p o donnell president and chief executive officer we ve talked about the catalyst for growth whether it s in transportation filtration digital transfer papers packaging and so on but you re absolutely right m a is a critical component of our strategy to change the growth trajectory and that process is we talked about also in our prepared remarks it s very active and you should definitely take into consideration that that s our big part of our future growth strategy so yes that s the short answer steven chercover d a davidson analyst okay and last question pulp is down so much year over year that i thought i guess it will be a tailwind but that said you re still talking about inputs higher year on year so what is it that should drive that maybe you could tell us what are the commodities you have real sensitivity to bonnie c lind senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer so steve when you say year on year so are you talking about 2020 versus 2019 steven chercover d a davidson analyst yeah i would say like the full year average for market pulp or even bonnie c lind senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer for 2020 steven chercover d a davidson analyst yeah it should be lower than 2019 bonnie c lind senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yeah no no we expect it to be a fairly neutral environment we don t expect an increase in input costs overall in 2020 versus 2019 we don t expect a big decrease either we do expect them to be lower in the first half relative to the first half of the other years and then higher in the second half relative to 2019 but overall neutral steven chercover d a davidson analyst got you okay thank you operator our next question comes from jon tanwanteng with cjs securities please go ahead jonathan tanwanteng cjs securities analyst good morning everyone john congrats on the retirement julie on promotion and looking forward to working with you julie a schertell senior vice president and chief operating officer thank you jonathan tanwanteng cjs securities analyst i wanted to drill down on the comments on the organizational changes in the projects you mentioned first on the r d kind of improvements and then synergy unlocking there and second the global operating system have you quantified what you think those benefits might be both in growth and profitability and are they just going to be costs associated with implementing those julie a schertell senior vice president and chief operating officer i would tell you we re still early in the process jon and from a neenah operating standpoint it s encompassing of more than just costs it s safety and quality and service and productivity as well as costs we ll be talking more about it as we get further along in the process but we re just now really starting that journey we ve always had cost reduction efforts in place and so while that s not new i do think this will unlock additional opportunities for us in the future but we ll spend more time on the details of that as we get further along jonathan tanwanteng cjs securities analyst okay great thanks and then bonnie can you quantify just the impact of the distributor transition in q4 if there was any and if that s completely done as you enter q1 bonnie c lind senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yeah so when you look at fine paper we break the decrease in the top line of fine paper we said basically a third a third a third so a third of that is attributable to the brattleboro divestiture a third of it is attributable to general market conditions lower weakness say in volumes and then the remaining third is the distributor change we do expect we ve got it before that we think it s about a 2 top line impact maybe 0 5 million ebit per quarter impact but when you think that what that s going to be is a more severe impact early on and then lessening as we go on until we wrap john p o donnell president and chief executive officer just as a reminder jonathan tanwanteng cjs securities analyst okay is that through 2020 i m sorry go ahead john p o donnell president and chief executive officer yeah just as a reminder jon we implemented that in the beginning of the third quarter so we have as bonnie said the first two quarters of this year will be taking effect but in the long run and the team was very very thoughtful about how they implement in the long run our expectation is that the financial results and our market strength will be enhanced jonathan tanwanteng cjs securities analyst okay great and then just the comment on fine paper margins i mean you ended the year on a really high note is that 17 sustainable as you head into the quarter given your comments on input costs and fx and other things that are going on just how we should think of it compared to q4 john p o donnell president and chief executive officer jon we ve talked a lot about the impact of input costs over time the expectations i think for fine paper was should be in that high mid teens so 14 to we ve said 14 to 16 bonnie c lind senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer 16 john p o donnell president and chief executive officer yeah 16 yeah they over delivered and i think that s a lot of this the verativ piece the team is doing a great job retaining the valuable brands in the marketplace and that might be temporarily helping their margins a bit but i would stick with the expectation of mid teen margins for this business and it ll move through that range given the timing of the input costs jonathan tanwanteng cjs securities analyst okay great and then the last one just in terms of the capital structure you mentioned refinancing with a higher principle but what are your capital structure targets and goals for the cash you raised is this just m a or was there other stuff that you re earmarking it for bonnie c lind senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer so our priority uses of our cash haven t changed and one it would be organic capital that would be returning both growth and cost savings then m a is a high priority for us we ve been delevering because we just want to get our balance sheet in the best possible position no surprise that we liked dry powder because m a again back to number two is super important to us and then we ve been increasing our total shareholder return so we don t we have 175 million of bonds right now we don t know until we actually hit the market what the actual rate is going to be we re thinking in the 5 to 6 range and then the sizing will also be determined by the when we hit the market jonathan tanwanteng cjs securities analyst okay great thanks a lot and congrats operator this concludes the question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to bill mccarthy for any closing remarks bill mccarthy vice president of investor relations great well i d like to thank everyone again for your interest in neenah today and as always please reach out to me at anytime if you

portfolio by 14 our portfolio is now a third smaller than it was after we completed the emeritus merger in 2014 our portfolio restructuring created numerous interim management agreements in 2019 we reduced managed communities by over 50 as we successfully provided smooth transitions to new operators and reduced management agreements where they don t fit our business model in october 2019 we announced an agreement with healthpeak to unlock significant value through the sale of our interest in the unconsolidated entry fee ccrc venture the deal closed at the end of january 2020 we will miss the long term relationships we had with many of the residents in particular i want to thank ken garretson who served as the chairman of our national resident advisory council i also want to thank our entry fee associates for their dedicated service and wish them the best as they move forward serving the healthpeak communities we successfully deployed a portion of the proceeds to convert leased assets to ownned communities which improved our owned to leased portfolio mix at the beginning of february 2020 60 of our consolidated units are owned the final update on our 2019 initiatives relates to our capital investment program to enhance the quality and protect the value of our portfolio and further supports our long term growth strategy 2019 was the first year of a two year incremental capex investment program as a reminder the incremental community level capex investments include major building infrastructure projects we completed 742 major projects in 2019 we invested a total of 236 million in non development capex as steve will discuss in the 2020 outlook section this year s investment will be smaller due to the significant progress we made in 2019 now let s turn to the performance of our ongoing operations in 2019 to provide you with some context at the beginning of 2019 new community openings outpaced demand and drove top line pressure across senior living industry a year ago we predicted that by the end of 2019 the industry would see supply demand equilibrium according to nic the industry equilibrium occurred in the second half of 2019 this is the first time independent and assisted living combined achieved equilibrium since the fourth quarter of 2015 assisted living is the largest part of our business therefore we were pleased that in 2019 the industry s assisted living absorption hit a record high and outpaced supply for the first time in seven years we expect this trend will continue in 2020 in addition more baby boomers are entering senior living communities the silver wave represents 9 of our residents and approximately 15 of our move ins for brookdale this represents a great opportunity for the next few years focusing on the fourth quarter 2019 nic s senior housing occupancy increased 20 basis points on a sequential basis brookdale again exceeded nic by increasing 30 basis points on a same community basis brookdale s revpar on a same community basis increased 20 basis points sequentially on a year over year basis revpar grew 2 1 for the fourth quarter and 1 9 for the full year this is strong evidence that our strategy to turnaround senior living operations drive top line growth and win locally has been and will continue to be successful turning to operating expenses we delivered on our commitment to enhance our underlying control of costs in the fourth quarter especially over time labor steve will provide the details so i ll only share two financial highlights fourth quarter 2019 same community labor expense was 50 basis points lower than in the third quarter which resulted in a full year labor growth of 5 5 coming back within our full year expectations as a result of our team s focus on operational efficiency our same community operating income increased 7 in fourth quarter on a sequential basis finally while our healthcare services business continue to face headwinds in the fourth quarter our new leadership team made crucial decisions to improve our business prepare for the new pdgm model and set the foundation to return to growth in summary for 2019 we have delivered positive sequential occupancy since the second quarter and outperformed the industry s occupancy for the second half of 2019 our financial performance has improved accordingly and now i ll turn to the guidance for 2020 and a few summary comments about this year s expectations we expect revpar growth of 3 to 4 on a same community basis which is at a higher rate than last year we expect adjusted ebitda to grow on a year over year basis the first time since the emeritus merger we plan to deliver significant improvement in adjusted free cash flow in 2020 even before the positive one time 100 million benefit from the healthy transaction with that i ll turn the call over to steve steven e swain executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you cindy last year we delivered on significant milestones this momentum will set us up for ebitda growth in 2020 i ll provide highlights as it relates to the fourth quarter and full year 2019 financial results then i ll provide you with the building blocks to deliver 2020 guidance starting with 2019 we achieved a full year financial results within or better than our original guidance ranges despite a very competitive market annual same community revenue grew 1 9 year over year and fourth quarter revenue increased both sequentially and on a year over year basis brookdale delivered the best in year occupancy improvement since before the emeritus merger five years ago as same community occupancy increased sequentially in the third and fourth quarters we obtained our real estate goal that was introduced in 2018 over the past two years we realized net proceeds of more than 250 million most notably on the transaction front in january 2020 we completed significant real estate deals we sold our interest in the unconsolidated ccrc venture and acquired 18 formerly leased communities from healthpeak and continuing with our strategy to own a higher percentage of our community portfolio we also acquired eight formerly leased properties from nhi turning to the fourth quarter results since the beginning of the fourth quarter 2018 and through the end of 2019 we divested 66 consolidated communities through sales and lease terminations to provide context to the financial results for the fourth quarter 2019 compared to the prior year quarter these dispositions resulted in 36 million less resident fee revenue 5 million less adjusted ebitda and 2 million less adjusted free cash flow keeping the portfolio changes in mind fourth quarter 2019 revenue excluding reimbursed costs on behalf of managed communities was 810 million compared to 825 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 this 1 8 decrease was the result of fewer communities due to planned asset sales and lease terminations i ll focus the rest of my senior housing fourth quarter and full year 2019 comments on same community results which exclude the impact of real estate transactions and the lease accounting change starting with senior housing same community fourth quarter revenue improved 2 1 compared to the prior year quarter and for the full year improved 1 9 our focus on improving rate growth in 2019 drove stronger financial results we passed through larger in place rent increases by linking them to higher labor investments we also maintained overall price discipline while flexing pricing in select markets when necessary to remain competitive because of these actions 2019 annual revpar increased 2 9 compared to last year s annual increase of 1 2 for the segments independent living revenue growth was 1 1 for the fourth quarter and 2 5 annually compared to the prior year periods this growth was largely driven by rate increases for the full year independent living occupancy increased 10 basis points while it remains a tough competitive environment for independent living we re excited that we were able to grow occupancy for assisted living and memory care revenue growth was 2 9 in the fourth quarter and 2 annually compared to the prior year periods largely driven by rate increases fourth quarter occupancy increased 50 basis points on a sequential basis and outperformed nic by 20 basis points this demonstrates that our operational strategy is delivering results the positive assisted living and memory care growth is especially important because this segment represents the majority of our portfolio notably for the first time since the emeritus merger current quarter al occupancy exceeded the prior year quarter this positive momentum supports our investment thesis which is built on a return to growth assisted living has been under pressure over the last several years we re looking forward to continued growth in capturing that value for shareholders in 2020 turning to same community operating expenses in the fourth quarter we took actions that resulted in a reduction of over time on a sequential basis as a result the full year compensation related expenses increased 5 5 which was in line with initial expectations and slightly better than expectations discussed during the third quarter earnings call i m also pleased that during the quarter voluntary turnover for full time associates improved 400 basis points sequentially the executive directors and health and wellness directors trailing 12 month retention rates have also remained around 70 for nearly three years other facility operating expense was approximately 10 million lower on a sequential basis the main drivers were seasonally lower repairs maintenance and utilities along with intentionally timing marketing investments to avoid the cost inflation due to the typical holiday marketing blitz for the full year other facility operating expense increases were primarily due to higher property remediation insurance premiums and investments in marketing and advertising to drive more leads looking at 2019 as a whole our data driven marketing investments successfully created a robust lead pipeline drove efficient conversions of visits and move ins and enabled better connectivity with our sales organization moving to the healthcare services segment revenue increased to 1 1 for the fourth quarter and 2 4 for the full year compared to the prior year periods while healthcare services didn t meet our expectations what stands out is the hospice business although less than a quarter of the segment s revenue hospice growth was so significant that it drove the segment s positive overall revenue growth for home health our new leaders evaluated the best go forward business model and executed a plan to reorganize the operations we ve been taking action to match our infrastructure to the communities and agencies we operate in 2019 we delivered annualized g a savings of approximately 25 million prior to normal costs inflation fourth quarter 2019 adjusted ebitda was 100 million compared to 115 million for the prior year quarter the primary drivers of lower adjusted ebitda were the result of three non core items a 5 million decline related to dispositions a 5 million reduction from eliminating management agreement and the 4 million impact from the lease accounting standard change adjusted free cash flow was 0 5 million in the fourth quarter compared to a negative 33 million in the prior year quarter the positive variance was driven by a 49 million change in working capital partially offset by lower ebitda of 15 million that i just described the key drivers of the working capital change were the benefit from the 2019 lease accounting standard change higher accrued insurance liabilities in the fourth quarter of 2019 and a decrease in receivables through improved collections as of december 31st 2019 total liquidity including the line of credit was 481 million an increase of 26 million from september 30th net proceeds from asset sales drove this increase in the fourth quarter we repurchased shares valued at approximately 5 6 million this brought the full year repurchase value to nearly 20 million over the five year strategic planning horizon we continued to have a steady debt maturities our total debt outstanding approximately 95 is non recourse asset backed mortgage debt after selling our interest in the unconsolidated ccrc venture and acquiring 18 formerly leased communities in january 2020 the net proceeds improved the company s capital structure flexibility we may use proceeds for increased opportunistic share repurchases to pursue potential lease restructuring opportunities and to make further investments to support our strategy turning to our 2020 guidance the turnaround efforts we made over the past two years have set the foundation to deliver growth in 2020 with the negotiated 100 million healthpeak management termination fee we received on january 31st adjusted ebitda is expected to be 510 million to 540 million significantly higher than 2019 we anticipate adjusted free cash flow including a significant termination fee to be in the range of a positive 70 million to 90 million excluding the 100 million healthpeak management termination fee we expect adjusted ebitda to be in the range of 410 million to 440 million a growth of between 2 and 10 compared to 2019 this aligns with the expectations we established in the five year outlook introduced late last year excluding the healthpeak management termination fee adjusted free cash flow is expected to be in the range of negative 10 million to negative 30 million the middle of the guidance range reflects an approximate 55 million improvement from 2019 which is better than the expected year over year capex reduction now let me provide you the key building blocks that support our guidance we listed more details on page 10 of the current investor presentation which you can find on our website with significant real estate transactions completed in january 2020 the pro forma on page 26 of our supplemental deck will also be important to reference the pro forma shows the annual impact of announced transactions which will help you understand continuing operations starting with senior housing revenue we expect revpar to increase 3 to 4 on a same community basis our occupancy expectations incorporate normal seasonality with high seasonal move outs occurring in first quarter our assumption is that the flu for our senior population will have a slightly higher impact compared to last year s season this assumption is based on our recent experience which is currently trending like the cdc data for the age 65 plus and 85 plus cohorts as referenced our 4q 2018 to 1q 2019 occupancy declined 90 basis points on a same community basis we expect to deliver revpar growth with strong rate increases the majority of our in place rent increases occur january 1st throughout the year we plan to maintain our price discipline while responding appropriately to competition in select markets where we see pressure for our healthcare services segment we expect to drive noi growth through our hospice business and successfully implement pdgm in home health as we rebuild our business we expect healthcare services revenue growth of up to 3 and slight margin improvement as the issues related to the centralized intake initiative will not repeat with pdgm becoming effective january 1st for our home health business we expect revenue growth to be back half weighted in 2020 there will be some noise in the first quarter with the implementation of a new reimbursement model with 30 day episodes and the recently announced organizational changes as such we expect segment noi to decline sequentially from the fourth quarter as we move through the year we expect to see the benefits of volume growth and higher operational efficiency for management service revenue in 2019 we transitioned over 100 managed communities we expect to transition more communities to new operators in 2020 including the recently completed healthpeak transaction this will enable us to continue to reduce the operational complexity of our business turning to operating expenses we expect total labor costs including benefits to grow in the range of 4 75 to 5 25 while the labor market continues to be tight our cost expectations are better than our 2019 increase due to two factors first we had unusually high over time and contract labor in the third quarter of 2019 and second 2019 was the final year of our three year plan of making above industry investments in our community associates we expect our 2020 g a expenses to be at or slightly above 5 of resident fee revenue including revenue under management this expectation is based on normalized cost inflation plus bonus and investments for growth partially offset by g a rationalization initiated after the sale of our unconsolidated ccrc interest and other portfolio reductions sequentially g a will step up from the fourth quarter 2019 to the first quarter 2020 primarily due to a normalized bonus accrual i also want to highlight a few items that will affect our adjusted free cash flow first we expect to lower interest expense and lease amortization combined primarily from our 2019 real estate transactions and those that occurred or are plan to occur in 2020 along with lower interest rates from refinancing second working capital is expected to be a use of cash of approximately 10 million to 15 million the 23 million one time benefit from the lease accounting change in 2019 will not reoccur in 2020 in addition pdgm is expected to negatively impact working capital as a reminder of the phasing within the year working capital is a significant use of cash in the first quarter due to the timing of payments the final significant part of our 2020 outlook is capex as highlighted a year ago 2019 capex was the high watermark and we expected 2020 capex to be significantly lower we are delivering on our capex commitment in 2019 non development capex was 236 million and we expect 2020 to be roughly 45 million less at approximately 190 million because we started many projects in 2019 that will finish in the first quarter and due to the timing of capex reimbursements we expect the first quarter capex spend to be the highest quarterly spend in 2020 and could be up to one third of this year s total net spending looking forward to 2021 we continue to believe community level capex will further reduce and stabilize in the range of between 2 000 and 2 500 per unit it is exciting to see the great progress our team has made over the past two years this momentum will set us up for ebitda growth in 2020 the first time since the emeritus merger i will now turn the call back over to cindy lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director we ve had many successes in 2019 and saw positive operational momentum across the business we are delivering on the targets that we have set for ourselves and we believe that 2020 will be a strong year for our business before leaving you today i would also like to comment on the global health situation regarding the coronavirus outbreak the safety of our seniors and associates will always be of the utmost importance at brookdale our teams across the country have been put on high alert have strong protocols for contagious viruses like the flu and other viruses and have been trained to look for the signs of infection early and take appropriate action i look forward to seeing you at our investor day on march 31st many of the new leadership team that i highlighted will share further insight into our business and on how we will execute our strategy kathy macdonald senior vice president investor relations phyllis this is kathy please open the line for questions questions and answers kathy macdonald senior vice president investor relations your first question comes from the line of frank morgan with rbc capital markets frank morgan rbc capital markets analyst good morning i guess steve mentioned commented on this about exploring additional lease restructuring opportunities but i guess with most of your divestiture opportunities already done how much do you see remaining on divestitures and then how much do you see available from lease restructuring lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director hi frank it s cindy thanks for the question we are almost done with our asset sales you can see that we just have a handful of assets held for sale on our balance sheet so that s largely behind us now going forward we will always do a little bit of capital recycling where there is a small percentage of our portfolio that we place up for sale and we buy new communities to replace for that but that s not going to be a significant portion of our strategy especially when you put that in the context of the prior year and if you think about capital allocation if i can just bridge to that for a minute i m really happy that we ve successfully deployed a portion of our proceeds to convert leased communities to owned communities which has improved our overall leased and owned portfolio mix after the completion of the healthpeak transaction at the end of january we started february with over 60 of our consolidated units being owned now if you think about the proceeds from the healthpeak transaction that gives us the chance to really improve our capital structure flexibility and i think that will likely increase our opportunistic stock repurchases but also to the extent that is possible we are very interested in pursuing potential lease restructuring opportunities and then having the cash on the balance sheet naturally deleverages the business just an example the nhi transaction is one example of a lease restructuring that was a strong use of capital we bought eight assets from nhi through a purchase option and the unlevered return on this transaction is greater than 12 and if you look at the levered return we re expecting a levered return in excess of 20 once the financing on these assets is complete frank morgan rbc capital markets analyst got you obviously in the near term you re having some success relative to the market and growing your occupancies but it seems like a lot of the growth has been driven on the rate side what you re able to do there are you seeing much feedback from residents or pushback from residents i should say in terms of your ability to pass on those rate increase i know you commented you attributed to labor but how much room do you think you still have to go on the rate side in the year ahead lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director so the first thing that i ll say is that we had a 20 improvement in our resident satisfaction scores our net promoter score since the last survey and that is a strong foundation of being able to demonstrate the value that we provide to our customers and we have had pretty good success with passing along rate to our residents as you know we believe that protecting the rate while responding appropriately to market competition is the best way to improve the bottom line and we ve really done a nice job of driving rate while also improving our occupancy performance let me just share a few details with you that shows the momentum that we re building in our same store portfolio if you go back to our same store portfolio in 2018 we had a revpar revenue per occupied room increase of 1 2 if you fast forward a year to 2019 this increased our revpar again revenue per occupied room growth to 2 9 so a nice increase and at the same time we were able to close the occupancy gap to the prior years and i m excited that we ended the fourth quarter within 20 basis points of q4 of 2018 then when you look into 2020 we re guiding to revpar revenue per available room growth of 3 to 4 demonstrating the improved trajectory of our business now we said that we really plan to lean heavily on rate to get there and the way that we do that is by connecting the rate increase that we re passing along to our residents to the labor investments that we ve made in the staff and we prepare our executive directors with very strong talking points as to why the rate increase is necessary and they get the value for the services frank morgan rbc capital markets analyst what about on the street rate side so in place rents what are you seeing and what are you doing on the street rates for new move ins to drive occupancy lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director no it s fair to say that there is a little bit of a tale of two cities you can see from our same store results that independent living was more competitive for us in the fourth quarter then assisted living but in the fourth quarter we did see that move in rates were 3 5 higher than move out rates we traditionally call that mark to market and this is because we increased our selling rates in the fourth quarter now clearly in the first quarter that s going to come more in line because what we try to do in q4 is in november and december for those move ins we try to pull forward our 2020 rate increases now that strategy is important for us for two reasons we know that there is going to be some impact on occupancy when we do that in q4 but our primary driver of top line is passing along rate increases to our in place residents so if you re doing a lot of discounting it s harder to hold the rates when you increase them on january 1st so we ve done a lot of analysis we ve looked at our strategy we re convinced that protecting the rate has been a winning strategy for us when we compare the total impact of occupancy and rate so it s a great question frank frank morgan rbc capital markets analyst okay i ll hop back in the queue thanks operator your next question comes from the line of josh raskin with nephron research lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director hi josh josh raskin nephron research analyst hi thanks hi good morning cindy i know you guys don t give quarterly guidance but i just want to make sure we re at least on the same page here as we look at the first quarter i think the consensus is about 110 million so clearly some understanding that despite ebit adjusted ebitda being up year over year for the full year it s fair to say that ebitda could be down pick a number 5 ish or so because of home health changes and seasonality and flu year over year and things like that i just want to make sure we re not sort of inconsistent with your messaging around what s going to happen early in the year lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director steve is going to take that for us steven e swain executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah morning josh you re right there is seasonality in our phasing of the quarterly ebitda three things on ebitda first senior housing revpor will be slightly or about the same as the 2019 2018 to 2019 increase but we will have seasonally high move outs due to the flu and as i mentioned already we are pacing a little bit worse than last year and then sequentially expenses should increase about the same dollar amount as last year plus we do have a leap year so that s another 3 million or so in expenses we also are now starting to accrue a normalized bonus in the field as well as g a and lastly as far as the senior housing goes we re going to turn back on our marketing spend because we didn t as already mentioned the marketing was turned down a bit because we didn t want to compete with the holiday clutter so that s for senior housing and healthcare services i did mention that there was going to be some noise in the first quarter phasing out the 60 day episodes we did have lower volume also in december as more people took the last couple weeks of the of december off just because of the way the holidays fell we are implementing the new reimbursement model with 30 day episodes and that equilibrium won t reach equilibrium until march and then lastly pdgm we have made some organizational changes announcements but we won t see that in the numbers until the really the second quarter so as such the noi for the hcs unit will be down sequentially and then lastly g a g a we are expecting a step up so we re going to be accruing for a normalized bonus in the first quarter so absolute g a spend might be in the same neighborhood as last year s first quarter lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director and then just when you think about your adjusted free cash flow remember that q1 is usually a use of working capital and then our capex we will spend about a third of our capex or up to a third of our capex in q1 and so there s a little bit of unusual cash activity that happens in q1 as well josh raskin nephron research analyst got you alright so if we put all that together the second question would be if you re starting ebitda i d say as much as 10 million year over year in the whole in 1q that s implying 20 million to sort of 50 million of improvement in the next three quarters so i heard a lot of the one timers etc but maybe you could just give us a little bit of further color on what you re thinking in terms of occupancy and some of the key metrics that are improving sort of once we get past the first quarter lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director yeah so at a high level we ve given guidance on revpar growth of 3 to 4 most of that will come from rate now you followed the story for a long time so you know that the first thing that you have to do is overcome the occupancy loss in the prior year and the good news for us this year is that our occupancy was only down year over year by 20 basis points on a same store basis in the fourth quarter so i think it s fair to say that our occupancy will be better during the year than our year over year comparisons for 2019 but we haven t really given more guidance on that because we really want to focus on revpar growth which is the combination of both availability and rate or occupancy and rate josh raskin nephron research analyst got you and then just a last one could you just give us a little more color on the competition you spoke to on sort of the fourth quarter what you were seeing in terms of discounting maybe how pervasive that was does it dissipate into the january time period and so any other color on the competition lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director yeah so on our investor presentation on page 7 we always put sort of the industry view as to what s happening in competition as well as the brookdale s view of what s happening in competition and you can see that there was an increase in competitive new openings around our communities between the third quarter and the fourth quarter and we know that when a new community opens the largest impact is that lease up which is most intense during the first 12 months now when we look at it it s important to note that our opens in q4 were down 30 from the peak which occurred in the second quarter of 2017 and the starts that we saw in the fourth quarter were down 71 from the peak that was in the second quarter of 2015 so that translates to a construction pipeline that s a full 20 lower than the first quarter 2018 peak now we have been in the center of the storm in assisted living in particular which is the vast majority of our portfolio and i personally am very excited about the improving competitive environment for assisted living in particular if you look at our supplement you can see on page 11 our same community results and for us our occupancy actually grew 20 basis points on our assisted living portfolio this is important because it s the vast majority of our portfolio and will really be the engine for profit growth that will drive our performance higher and so while i still think that there ll be some competition around our communities while communities lease up i expect it to be much better in 2020 than it was in 2019 and then just a reminder for 2019 as a whole nic basically showed the back half of the year absorption was in excess of supply and we would expect that to continue into 2020 josh raskin nephron research analyst perfect thank you operator your next question comes from the line of jason plagman with jefferies lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director hi jason jason plagman jefferies analyst hey good morning just wanted to ask about some of the metrics behind your sales effectiveness initiatives and productivity there how are things trending as far as leads visits move ins both in q4 and how you re feeling about those your sales pipeline as we start 2020 lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director yeah it s a great question so for 2019 we have delivered positive sequential occupancy since the second quarter and we outperformed the industry for the second half of 2019 in addition we have delivered the best in year occupancy improvement since the emeritus merger as a result of this we re confident that our strategy is taking hold and you can see the results in our occupancy improvement even though this is true it s probably helpful to give you just a few comments on what happened with our leading indicators in the fourth quarter in the fourth quarter on a year over year basis we saw higher leads which has been consistent with our experience during the rest of the year as expected we saw seasonally lower move ins and we are also happy that our controllable move outs returned to improvement and so that has been very good for us and then with regard to our people statistics our executive directors and health and wellness directors trailing 12 month retention rates they remained about 70 and this is for the third year straight what s important to note is that nearly 70 of our executive directors have been in their roles for more than two years which is a critical threshold for resident relationships and the financial success of our communities and these results are all consistent with us raising the performance bar on our team so we re very excited that now the hard work that we put into our leading indicators is translating into metrics that you see in terms of occupancy jason plagman jefferies analyst great that s helpful and then it seems like we re seeing both brookdale and the nic data is showing a little bit more pressure on independent living occupancy relative to assisted living so how are you feeling about the trajectory of occupancy and revpar for independent living in comparison to assisted living lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director well there s no question that the revpar growth in independent living was lower than assisted living for the fourth quarter we drove revpar which is revenue per available unit of on independent living and we drove revpar growth on assisting living at 2 9 now part of that is because we ve been kind of at that 90 ish level for a while so there wasn t as much opportunity for us to grow occupancy in independent living the other part of it is that independent living is one that can be much more rate sensitive because you don t have much services wrapped around the resident and so i think that we will focus on both of our communities our overall strategy which is proven to be successful is to protect the rate but we will discount selectively where necessary with our goal of being having every unit in service at the highest achievable rate jason plagman jefferies analyst got it that s it for me thanks lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director thank you operator your next question comes from the line of joanna gajuk with bank of america joanna gajuk bank of america analyst hi good morning thanks for taking the questions so in terms of the outlook for the year just the ebitda the range kind of costs in terms of the comparable numbers like for like 0 to 7 growth so can you talk us about the biggest seen factors that will bring you toward the lower or toward the higher end of the range in terms of the ebitda lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director yeah it s a really good question joanna and the one thing that i ll say before steve jumps in is we have a revenue opportunity at brookdale which is why we ve been so focused on quality whether it is quality within our healthcare services business or whether it s quality within our senior housing business as demonstrated by our improvement in net promoter score and we re really expecting that 2020 will be an acceleration of our revenue growth so that we can make good progress on the successful strategic plan well the longer term outlook that we announced but steve can you take joanna through the detail steven e swain executive vice president and chief financial officer sure morning joanna three things real quickly on ebitda first numbers that are essentially in the books so you ll see a bridge on slide 10 of the investor presentation it shows transactions and accounting that move ebitda from 401 million to 410 million so that s number 1 number 2 is senior housing noi as we ve mentioned now a few times the revpar will increase 3 to 4 occupancy will improve versus the negative 80 basis points we saw in 2019 and again one last time occupancy is seasonal we have because of our january 1 rate increase we have seen a strong rate increase and that should be as good or slightly better than last year s as we link labor growth to rent increases so bottom line occupancy is not projected to offset the rate increase like we ve seen in prior years nearly as much turning to expense labor i already mentioned is around 5 the labor market continues to be tight we think that 5 is reasonable versus our 5 5 in 2019 we have now finished our three year plan of making above industry investments in our community associates and generally if you make middle of the road assumptions in the senior housing space you ll get to kind of middle of the guidance but for me remember 2020 it s a huge inflection for senior housing we declined 4 6 last year and we re projected to grow in 2020 so that s a pivot point that really can t go unnoticed third and then i ll stop the healthcare services segment will return to noi growth in 2020 revenue growth of up to 3 with a slight margin improvement will lead to growth middle of the road assumptions lead to several million dollars in noi growth kind of depending on what you assume remember pdgm noise in the first quarter so expect noi to decline slightly in the first quarter but to grow throughout 2020 as the issues related to the centralized intake won t repeat and the new management team hits the ground and the improvements are seen in the results so what taking a step back what i look at and what i see 2020 is a big catalyst year as we pivot to growth i already mentioned noi growth ebitda growth of up to 30 million and that s down from over 100 million in 2019 so that s another pivot point inflection point that i look at and makes me excited about our valuation joanna gajuk bank of america analyst alright thanks for that so just to summarize so you say that growing organically senior housing 4 will yield a 7 ebitda growth essentially steven e swain executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah that s the kind of the top end of the guidance range for senior housing and that does generally put you in the top end of our guidance joanna gajuk bank of america analyst right because also you assume that you will be able to more than offset the labor cost inflation at that level right so i guess at the higher end you assume much lower than 5 labor cost expense steven e swain executive vice president and chief financial officer well just remember that you re multiplying the 3 to 4 by a 2 billion plus number and you re multiplying the labor expense by something that s 1 billion so joanna gajuk bank of america analyst no that s great and on the services so you d shared the comments obviously pdgm is a big change for the industry and i didn t hear you mentioning anything about hospice rebasing does that have any impact on your rent sorry on your pricing in 2020 lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director so the current thinking on that is less than a 1 impact on the hospice rebasing so it s not big and as you know our hospice business has just been growing nicely and we would expect that growth to continue the one point that i would make on healthcare services in general and i know this is obvious but i ll feel better if i say it the up to 3 annual growth that we re expecting but for the change to pdgm would be significantly higher and the reason that s the case is because in the first quarter we re rolling off those 60 day tts episodes while we re building new episodes at 30 days and so there s just a little bit of a lag in terms of getting to sort of a stabilized run rate and so it would be much higher without the change to pdgm joanna gajuk bank of america analyst and on this front and i guess steve had mentioned that there is an impact to cash flow in q1 because of the wrap or somewhat other changes that are happening in home health correct so we should expect even a bigger than usual drop in cash flow because of the timing of these prepayments correct steven e swain executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah the timing of free cash flow is a significant use of cash in the first quarter if you look at our past two years of first quarter working capital uses that averaging that is probably kind of a good ballpark joanna gajuk bank of america analyst great i appreciate the color thank you lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director thanks joanna operator your next question comes from the line of chad vanacore with stifel lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director hi chad tao qiu stifel analyst hi good morning this is tao for chad lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director hello tao tao qiu stifel analyst yeah good morning i have two questions the first one is about the independent living and assisted living divergence you mentioned that you had a tough environment in the fourth quarter due to like newly opened communities are there any differences in your revpar assumption for the two segments in 2020 and what are you doing differently between the two lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director we don t provide revpar guidance by segment what you can be sure of is that our goal is to maximize revpar for our entire portfolio and so we will look at each community its market position the new competition entering the market where it stands in terms of occupancy and set an appropriate strategy at the community level tao qiu stifel analyst so should we think that because il has higher occupancy you guys will be holding the rates steady pushing the rate a little bit more and for al the primary objective is to increase the occupancy and at the same time into revpar lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director no tao it s fair to say that when we have a community that has a low occupancy we do more discounting and we build occupancy before pushing rate that s a given where we have a community that has a high occupancy we are more aggressive on pushing rate because that s where the bigger opportunity is so i think you can translate that into what it means for the aggregate of our portfolio but it s definitely done on a community by community basis and even within the community assisted living independent living and memory care are all priced separately tao qiu stifel analyst okay got it and my second question is about marketing spend how much of an increase in marketing spend should we expect in the first quarter and also full year 2020 compared to 2019 and then given the investment you have made so far to drive new leads and conversion how much are you spending now and how reliant are you still on third party referral services such as a place for mom lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director so third party referral sources are a very important part of our business as it is for most senior living operators as i mentioned earlier we have a revenue opportunity in front of us and so our biggest opportunity is to get every unit leased at the highest achievable rate and so we are going to achieve that through a combination of driving our own internal marketing spend which we did last year and it was very effective as well as partnering closely with our large aggregators which we know will be effective i don t think we ve given specific guidance on any individual line of our p l but know that we evaluate our marketing using a very intense data driven analysis and our goal is to make sure that we ve got a good roi on our marketing spend and the increased investment that we started last year worked well for us and so that s the high level takeaway that you should have tao qiu stifel analyst but would you characterize your the percentage of leads from third party referral service as higher or lower than last year lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director i think that we are expecting a strong referral source from our aggregators and we expect that to continue and so as we grow occupancy we would love to see more leads from both our internal sources and from our aggregators tao qiu stifel analyst okay that s it for me thank you lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director thanks tao operator your next question comes from the line of steven valiquette with barclays lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director hello steven valiquette barclays analyst hey good morning everybody so i know we just touched on this topic a lot on this call but just again i mean there s always trade offs on rate versus occupancy as you discussed earlier just to summarize your view on brookdale s expected occupancy improvement this year is it in your mind driven more by brookdale s company specific sales and marketing initiatives or is it driven more by an expectation that overall market conditions may improve as the year progresses lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director it depends and so i think that we have operated in very different call it macroeconomic environment for the last several years we see that improving but at the same time we have worked very hard to make successful improvements in our operating model we ve done a lot of work on our sales and marketing we ve done a lot of work on our operations we ve invested a lot of capex in our communities to make sure that they are attractive to our current and new residents and so all of that working together will build to that 3 to 4 expected improvement in revpar steven valiquette barclays analyst okay and then just a quick question on the non development capex for this year just curious if you can remind us again which project areas categorically you re focusing that spend in 2020 and also are there any strict roi hurdles that you have built in around the spend steven e swain executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah sure steve the categories are similar to the ones in 2019 where we do major building systems and we also do renovations and both of those are projected to decrease into 2021 as i already mentioned on the call that we expect our long term our equilibrium to be at about 2 000 to 2 500 of capex per unit once we get through this kind of this incremental spend as far as the returns we do look at the returns we do a business case on the new economics projects as we call them that bucket and what projects that were approved for 2019 those numbers in that business case were added to that community s budget in 2020 so not only do we look at the returns but we also change the factors that go into the budgeting process steven valiquette barclays analyst okay perfect thanks lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director thank you at this time i don t think we have any additional questions in the queue so i just want to thank everyone for joining us today i think we had solid performance in q4 we demonstrated consistent progress on the execution of our strategic plan we ve introduced guidance for 2020 that will demonstrate significant improvement in our adjusted ebitda as well as our cash flow and we are on target to achieve that 7 long term noi growth thank you and i hope to see you at our investor day in

will also provide you with the highlights of our 2020 outlook starting with 2019 we delivered results within or better than our original guidance range in the fourth quarter on a same community basis we continued to see positive momentum of top line growth and improved cost control our strategy to win locally is working since we announced our turnaround strategy we have consistently delivered on our guidance targets we have successfully navigated transformational changes to reshape our business and better position brookdale for positive senior demographics and anticipated industry tailwinds i will summarize 2019 in three sections people portfolio and performance i will start with people at our core brookdale s business depends on people taking care of people i have enhanced the leadership team to make sure that we have the right team to drive near term and future growth cindy kent executive vice president and president of senior living is our most recent addition to the team cindy has a proven track record of collaboration with payers physician groups and hospitals to innovate and grow her business she was most recently at 3m s infection prevention division and before that she held global commercialization roles at medtronic and eli lilly given the rapid change in the healthcare industry cindy s strategic insights will prove invaluable as we look to accelerate our growth as healthcare systems continue to shift from a fee for service to a value based outcome driven model building deeper relationships with healthcare providers and payers will allow us to attract new residents more quickly and to improve the quality of our residents lives in her first month cindy has visited over 20 communities and has begun a deep immersion into our business her knowledge and skills will complement the deep bench strength of senior housing expertise over the past year we ve also strategically added leaders with specific skills that are critical to drive long term growth diane johnson may executive vice president of human resources has a strong consumer focus and significant experience attracting and motivating a large workforce across many locations anna gene o neal division president of health care services a proven hospice leader has brought an intense focus on patient centered care to our healthcare services business rick wigginton senior vice president of sales has 14 years of demonstrated success in senior housing sales chris bayham senior vice president of information technology has deep it experience within the healthcare industry and a proven track record of change management these leaders are part of our industry leading team of 58 000 associates who are devoted to taking care of residents and patients every day despite the tightest labor market in 50 years nearly 70 of our executive directors have been in their role for more than two years they are choosing to stay with brookdale we are pleased because two years is a critical threshold for resident relationships and financial success of our communities our 2019 success extended beyond the top leaders of our communities over 3 000 former associates returned to brookdale in addition forbes named brookdale as a best in state employer in tennessee for our corporate offices located these facts are proof that our culture and strategy of winning locally have taken hold i am very proud of our associates and the progress we ve made in building the best team in senior living in addition to having the right team driving the business forward brookdale s board has gone through a significant transformation in fact over 60 of our board members are new since we established our current strategy in early 2018 the board has added healthcare and hospitality experience to our strong base of real estate expertise and other skill sets together our board has the experience to provide valuable oversight as we execute our strategy and achieve strong returns for our shareholders as you know vicki freed and guy sansone are the most recent additions to our board having joined us last fall guy now serves as our non executive chair effective january 1st 2020 turning to our real estate portfolio we have significantly simplified our business and completed the vast majority of our portfolio restructuring we have achieved our initial goal of monetizing assets netting 250 million of proceeds and went beyond expectations with the sale of our unconsolidated ccrc venture in 2019 we reduced our community portfolio by 14 our portfolio is now a third smaller than it was after we completed the emeritus merger in 2014 our portfolio restructuring created numerous interim management agreements in 2019 we reduced managed communities by over 50 as we successfully provided smooth transitions to new operators and reduced management agreements where they don t fit our business model in october 2019 we announced an agreement with healthpeak to unlock significant value through the sale of our interest in the unconsolidated entry fee ccrc venture the deal closed at the end of january 2020 we will miss the long term relationships we had with many of the residents in particular i want to thank ken garretson who served as the chairman of our national resident advisory council i also want to thank our entry fee associates for their dedicated service and wish them the best as they move forward serving the healthpeak communities we successfully deployed a portion of the proceeds to convert leased assets to ownned communities which improved our owned to leased portfolio mix at the beginning of february 2020 60 of our consolidated units are owned the final update on our 2019 initiatives relates to our capital investment program to enhance the quality and protect the value of our portfolio and further supports our long term growth strategy 2019 was the first year of a two year incremental capex investment program as a reminder the incremental community level capex investments include major building infrastructure projects we completed 742 major projects in 2019 we invested a total of 236 million in non development capex as steve will discuss in the 2020 outlook section this year s investment will be smaller due to the significant progress we made in 2019 now let s turn to the performance of our ongoing operations in 2019 to provide you with some context at the beginning of 2019 new community openings outpaced demand and drove top line pressure across senior living industry a year ago we predicted that by the end of 2019 the industry would see supply demand equilibrium according to nic the industry equilibrium occurred in the second half of 2019 this is the first time independent and assisted living combined achieved equilibrium since the fourth quarter of 2015 assisted living is the largest part of our business therefore we were pleased that in 2019 the industry s assisted living absorption hit a record high and outpaced supply for the first time in seven years we expect this trend will continue in 2020 in addition more baby boomers are entering senior living communities the silver wave represents 9 of our residents and approximately 15 of our move ins for brookdale this represents a great opportunity for the next few years focusing on the fourth quarter 2019 nic s senior housing occupancy increased 20 basis points on a sequential basis brookdale again exceeded nic by increasing 30 basis points on a same community basis brookdale s revpar on a same community basis increased 20 basis points sequentially on a year over year basis revpar grew 2 1 for the fourth quarter and 1 9 for the full year this is strong evidence that our strategy to turnaround senior living operations drive top line growth and win locally has been and will continue to be successful turning to operating expenses we delivered on our commitment to enhance our underlying control of costs in the fourth quarter especially over time labor steve will provide the details so i ll only share two financial highlights fourth quarter 2019 same community labor expense was 50 basis points lower than in the third quarter which resulted in a full year labor growth of 5 5 coming back within our full year expectations as a result of our team s focus on operational efficiency our same community operating income increased 7 in fourth quarter on a sequential basis finally while our healthcare services business continue to face headwinds in the fourth quarter our new leadership team made crucial decisions to improve our business prepare for the new pdgm model and set the foundation to return to growth in summary for 2019 we have delivered positive sequential occupancy since the second quarter and outperformed the industry s occupancy for the second half of 2019 our financial performance has improved accordingly and now i ll turn to the guidance for 2020 and a few summary comments about this year s expectations we expect revpar growth of 3 to 4 on a same community basis which is at a higher rate than last year we expect adjusted ebitda to grow on a year over year basis the first time since the emeritus merger we plan to deliver significant improvement in adjusted free cash flow in 2020 even before the positive one time 100 million benefit from the healthy transaction with that i ll turn the call over to steve steven e swain executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you cindy last year we delivered on significant milestones this momentum will set us up for ebitda growth in 2020 i ll provide highlights as it relates to the fourth quarter and full year 2019 financial results then i ll provide you with the building blocks to deliver 2020 guidance starting with 2019 we achieved a full year financial results within or better than our original guidance ranges despite a very competitive market annual same community revenue grew 1 9 year over year and fourth quarter revenue increased both sequentially and on a year over year basis brookdale delivered the best in year occupancy improvement since before the emeritus merger five years ago as same community occupancy increased sequentially in the third and fourth quarters we obtained our real estate goal that was introduced in 2018 over the past two years we realized net proceeds of more than 250 million most notably on the transaction front in january 2020 we completed significant real estate deals we sold our interest in the unconsolidated ccrc venture and acquired 18 formerly leased communities from healthpeak and continuing with our strategy to own a higher percentage of our community portfolio we also acquired eight formerly leased properties from nhi turning to the fourth quarter results since the beginning of the fourth quarter 2018 and through the end of 2019 we divested 66 consolidated communities through sales and lease terminations to provide context to the financial results for the fourth quarter 2019 compared to the prior year quarter these dispositions resulted in 36 million less resident fee revenue 5 million less adjusted ebitda and 2 million less adjusted free cash flow keeping the portfolio changes in mind fourth quarter 2019 revenue excluding reimbursed costs on behalf of managed communities was 810 million compared to 825 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 this 1 8 decrease was the result of fewer communities due to planned asset sales and lease terminations i ll focus the rest of my senior housing fourth quarter and full year 2019 comments on same community results which exclude the impact of real estate transactions and the lease accounting change starting with senior housing same community fourth quarter revenue improved 2 1 compared to the prior year quarter and for the full year improved 1 9 our focus on improving rate growth in 2019 drove stronger financial results we passed through larger in place rent increases by linking them to higher labor investments we also maintained overall price discipline while flexing pricing in select markets when necessary to remain competitive because of these actions 2019 annual revpar increased 2 9 compared to last year s annual increase of 1 2 for the segments independent living revenue growth was 1 1 for the fourth quarter and 2 5 annually compared to the prior year periods this growth was largely driven by rate increases for the full year independent living occupancy increased 10 basis points while it remains a tough competitive environment for independent living we re excited that we were able to grow occupancy for assisted living and memory care revenue growth was 2 9 in the fourth quarter and 2 annually compared to the prior year periods largely driven by rate increases fourth quarter occupancy increased 50 basis points on a sequential basis and outperformed nic by 20 basis points this demonstrates that our operational strategy is delivering results the positive assisted living and memory care growth is especially important because this segment represents the majority of our portfolio notably for the first time since the emeritus merger current quarter al occupancy exceeded the prior year quarter this positive momentum supports our investment thesis which is built on a return to growth assisted living has been under pressure over the last several years we re looking forward to continued growth in capturing that value for shareholders in 2020 turning to same community operating expenses in the fourth quarter we took actions that resulted in a reduction of over time on a sequential basis as a result the full year compensation related expenses increased 5 5 which was in line with initial expectations and slightly better than expectations discussed during the third quarterearnings call i m also pleased that during the quarter voluntary turnover for full time associates improved 400 basis points sequentially the executive directors and health and wellness directors trailing 12 month retention rates have also remained around 70 for nearly three years other facility operating expense was approximately 10 million lower on a sequential basis the main drivers were seasonally lower repairs maintenance and utilities along with intentionally timing marketing investments to avoid the cost inflation due to the typical holiday marketing blitz for the full year other facility operating expense increases were primarily due to higher property remediation insurance premiums and investments in marketing and advertising to drive more leads looking at 2019 as a whole our data driven marketing investments successfully created a robust lead pipeline drove efficient conversions of visits and move ins and enabled better connectivity with our sales organization moving to the healthcare services segment revenue increased to 1 1 for the fourth quarter and 2 4 for the full year compared to the prior year periods while healthcare services didn t meet our expectations what stands out is the hospice business although less than a quarter of the segment s revenue hospice growth was so significant that it drove the segment s positive overall revenue growth for home health our new leaders evaluated the best go forward business model and executed a plan to reorganize the operations we ve been taking action to match our infrastructure to the communities and agencies we operate in 2019 we delivered annualized g a savings of approximately 25 million prior to normal costs inflation fourth quarter 2019 adjusted ebitda was 100 million compared to 115 million for the prior year quarter the primary drivers of lower adjusted ebitda were the result of three non core items a 5 million decline related to dispositions a 5 million reduction from eliminating management agreement and the 4 million impact from the lease accounting standard change adjusted free cash flow was 0 5 million in the fourth quarter compared to a negative 33 million in the prior year quarter the positive variance was driven by a 49 million change in working capital partially offset by lower ebitda of 15 million that i just described the key drivers of the working capital change were the benefit from the 2019 lease accounting standard change higher accrued insurance liabilities in the fourth quarter of 2019 and a decrease in receivables through improved collections as of december 31st 2019 total liquidity including the line of credit was 481 million an increase of 26 million from september 30th net proceeds from asset sales drove this increase in the fourth quarter we repurchased shares valued at approximately 5 6 million this brought the full year repurchase value to nearly 20 million over the five year strategic planning horizon we continued to have a steady debt maturities our total debt outstanding approximately 95 is non recourse asset backed mortgage debt after selling our interest in the unconsolidated ccrc venture and acquiring 18 formerly leased communities in january 2020 the net proceeds improved the company s capital structure flexibility we may use proceeds for increased opportunistic share repurchases to pursue potential lease restructuring opportunities and to make further investments to support our strategy turning to our 2020 guidance the turnaround efforts we made over the past two years have set the foundation to deliver growth in 2020 with the negotiated 100 million healthpeak management termination fee we received on january 31st adjusted ebitda is expected to be 510 million to 540 million significantly higher than 2019 we anticipate adjusted free cash flow including a significant termination fee to be in the range of a positive 70 million to 90 million excluding the 100 million healthpeak management termination fee we expect adjusted ebitda to be in the range of 410 million to 440 million a growth of between 2 and 10 compared to 2019 this aligns with the expectations we established in the five year outlook introduced late last year excluding the healthpeak management termination fee adjusted free cash flow is expected to be in the range of negative 10 million to negative 30 million the middle of the guidance range reflects an approximate 55 million improvement from 2019 which is better than the expected year over year capex reduction now let me provide you the key building blocks that support our guidance we listed more details on page 10 of the current investor presentation which you can find on our website with significant real estate transactions completed in january 2020 the pro forma on page 26 of our supplemental deck will also be important to reference the pro forma shows the annual impact of announced transactions which will help you understand continuing operations starting with senior housing revenue we expect revpar to increase 3 to 4 on a same community basis our occupancy expectations incorporate normal seasonality with high seasonal move outs occurring in first quarter our assumption is that the flu for our senior population will have a slightly higher impact compared to last year s season this assumption is based on our recent experience which is currently trending like the cdc data for the age 65 plus and 85 plus cohorts as referenced our 4q 2018 to 1q 2019 occupancy declined 90 basis points on a same community basis we expect to deliver revpar growth with strong rate increases the majority of our in place rent increases occur january 1st throughout the year we plan to maintain our price discipline while responding appropriately to competition in select markets where we see pressure for our healthcare services segment we expect to drive noi growth through our hospice business and successfully implement pdgm in home health as we rebuild our business we expect healthcare services revenue growth of up to 3 and slight margin improvement as the issues related to the centralized intake initiative will not repeat with pdgm becoming effective january 1st for our home health business we expect revenue growth to be back half weighted in 2020 there will be some noise in the first quarter with the implementation of a new reimbursement model with 30 day episodes and the recently announced organizational changes as such we expect segment noi to decline sequentially from the fourth quarter as we move through the year we expect to see the benefits of volume growth and higher operational efficiency for management service revenue in 2019 we transitioned over 100 managed communities we expect to transition more communities to new operators in 2020 including the recently completed healthpeak transaction this will enable us to continue to reduce the operational complexity of our business turning to operating expenses we expect total labor costs including benefits to grow in the range of 4 75 to 5 25 while the labor market continues to be tight our cost expectations are better than our 2019 increase due to two factors first we had unusually high over time and contract labor in the third quarter of 2019 and second 2019 was the final year of our three year plan of making above industry investments in our community associates we expect our 2020 g a expenses to be at or slightly above 5 of resident fee revenue including revenue under management this expectation is based on normalized cost inflation plus bonus and investments for growth partially offset by g a rationalization initiated after the sale of our unconsolidated ccrc interest and other portfolio reductions sequentially g a will step up from the fourth quarter 2019 to the first quarter 2020 primarily due to a normalized bonus accrual i also want to highlight a few items that will affect our adjusted free cash flow first we expect to lower interest expense and lease amortization combined primarily from our 2019 real estate transactions and those that occurred or are plan to occur in 2020 along with lower interest rates from refinancing second working capital is expected to be a use of cash of approximately 10 million to 15 million the 23 million one time benefit from the lease accounting change in 2019 will not reoccur in 2020 in addition pdgm is expected to negatively impact working capital as a reminder of the phasing within the year working capital is a significant use of cash in the first quarter due to the timing of payments the final significant part of our 2020 outlook is capex as highlighted a year ago 2019 capex was the high watermark and we expected 2020 capex to be significantly lower we are delivering on our capex commitment in 2019 non development capex was 236 million and we expect 2020 to be roughly 45 million less at approximately 190 million because we started many projects in 2019 that will finish in the first quarter and due to the timing of capex reimbursements we expect the first quarter capex spend to be the highest quarterly spend in 2020 and could be up to one third of this year s total net spending looking forward to 2021 we continue to believe community level capex will further reduce and stabilize in the range of between 2 000 and 2 500 per unit it is exciting to see the great progress our team has made over the past two years this momentum will set us up for ebitda growth in 2020 the first time since the emeritus merger i will now turn the call back over to cindy lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director we ve had many successes in 2019 and saw positive operational momentum across the business we are delivering on the targets that we have set for ourselves and we believe that 2020 will be a strong year for our business before leaving you today i would also like to comment on the global health situation regarding the coronavirus outbreak the safety of our seniors and associates will always be of the utmost importance at brookdale our teams across the country have been put on high alert have strong protocols for contagious viruses like the flu and other viruses and have been trained to look for the signs of infection early and take appropriate action i look forward to seeing you at our investor day on march 31st many of the new leadership team that i highlighted will share further insight into our business and on how we will execute our strategy kathy macdonald senior vice president investor relations phyllis this is kathy please open the line for questions questions and answers kathy macdonald senior vice president investor relations your first question comes from the line of frank morgan with rbc capital markets frank morgan rbc capital markets analyst good morning i guess steve mentioned commented on this about exploring additional lease restructuring opportunities but i guess with most of your divestiture opportunities already done how much do you see remaining on divestitures and then how much do you see available from lease restructuring lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director hi frank it s cindy thanks for the question we are almost done with our asset sales you can see that we just have a handful of assets held for sale on our balance sheet so that s largely behind us now going forward we will always do a little bit of capital recycling where there is a small percentage of our portfolio that we place up for sale and we buy new communities to replace for that but that s not going to be a significant portion of our strategy especially when you put that in the context of the prior year and if you think about capital allocation if i can just bridge to that for a minute i m really happy that we ve successfully deployed a portion of our proceeds to convert leased communities to owned communities which has improved our overall leased and owned portfolio mix after the completion of the healthpeak transaction at the end of january we started february with over 60 of our consolidated units being owned now if you think about the proceeds from the healthpeak transaction that gives us the chance to really improve our capital structure flexibility and i think that will likely increase our opportunistic stock repurchases but also to the extent that is possible we are very interested in pursuing potential lease restructuring opportunities and then having the cash on the balance sheet naturally deleverages the business just an example the nhi transaction is one example of a lease restructuring that was a strong use of capital we bought eight assets from nhi through a purchase option and the unlevered return on this transaction is greater than 12 and if you look at the levered return we re expecting a levered return in excess of 20 once the financing on these assets is complete frank morgan rbc capital markets analyst got you obviously in the near term you re having some success relative to the market and growing your occupancies but it seems like a lot of the growth has been driven on the rate side what you re able to do there are you seeing much feedback from residents or pushback from residents i should say in terms of your ability to pass on those rate increase i know you commented you attributed to labor but how much room do you think you still have to go on the rate side in the year ahead lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director so the first thing that i ll say is that we had a 20 improvement in our resident satisfaction scores our net promoter score since the last survey and that is a strong foundation of being able to demonstrate the value that we provide to our customers and we have had pretty good success with passing along rate to our residents as you know we believe that protecting the rate while responding appropriately to market competition is the best way to improve the bottom line and we ve really done a nice job of driving rate while also improving our occupancy performance let me just share a few details with you that shows the momentum that we re building in our same store portfolio if you go back to our same store portfolio in 2018 we had a revpar revenue per occupied room increase of 1 2 if you fast forward a year to 2019 this increased our revpar again revenue per occupied room growth to 2 9 so a nice increase and at the same time we were able to close the occupancy gap to the prior years and i m excited that we ended the fourth quarter within 20 basis points of q4 of 2018 then when you look into 2020 we re guiding to revpar revenue per available room growth of 3 to 4 demonstrating the improved trajectory of our business now we said that we really plan to lean heavily on rate to get there and the way that we do that is by connecting the rate increase that we re passing along to our residents to the labor investments that we ve made in the staff and we prepare our executive directors with very strong talking points as to why the rate increase is necessary and they get the value for the services frank morgan rbc capital markets analyst what about on the street rate side so in place rents what are you seeing and what are you doing on the street rates for new move ins to drive occupancy lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director no it s fair to say that there is a little bit of a tale of two cities you can see from our same store results that independent living was more competitive for us in the fourth quarter then assisted living but in the fourth quarter we did see that move in rates were 3 5 higher than move out rates we traditionally call that mark to market and this is because we increased our selling rates in the fourth quarter now clearly in the first quarter that s going to come more in line because what we try to do in q4 is in november and december for those move ins we try to pull forward our 2020 rate increases now that strategy is important for us for two reasons we know that there is going to be some impact on occupancy when we do that in q4 but our primary driver of top line is passing along rate increases to our in place residents so if you re doing a lot of discounting it s harder to hold the rates when you increase them on january 1st so we ve done a lot of analysis we ve looked at our strategy we re convinced that protecting the rate has been a winning strategy for us when we compare the total impact of occupancy and rate so it s a great question frank frank morgan rbc capital markets analyst okay i ll hop back in the queue thanks operator your next question comes from the line of josh raskin with nephron research lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director hi josh josh raskin nephron research analyst hi thanks hi good morning cindy i know you guys don t give quarterly guidance but i just want to make sure we re at least on the same page here as we look at the first quarter i think the consensus is about 110 million so clearly some understanding that despite ebit adjusted ebitda being up year over year for the full year it s fair to say that ebitda could be down pick a number 5 ish or so because of home health changes and seasonality and flu year over year and things like that i just want to make sure we re not sort of inconsistent with your messaging around what s going to happen early in the year lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director steve is going to take that for us steven e swain executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah morning josh you re right there is seasonality in our phasing of the quarterly ebitda three things on ebitda first senior housing revpor will be slightly or about the same as the 2019 2018 to 2019 increase but we will have seasonally high move outs due to the flu and as i mentioned already we are pacing a little bit worse than last year and then sequentially expenses should increase about the same dollar amount as last year plus we do have a leap year so that s another 3 million or so in expenses we also are now starting to accrue a normalized bonus in the field as well as g a and lastly as far as the senior housing goes we re going to turn back on our marketing spend because we didn t as already mentioned the marketing was turned down a bit because we didn t want to compete with the holiday clutter so that s for senior housing and healthcare services i did mention that there was going to be some noise in the first quarter phasing out the 60 day episodes we did have lower volume also in december as more people took the last couple weeks of the of december off just because of the way the holidays fell we are implementing the new reimbursement model with 30 day episodes and that equilibrium won t reach equilibrium until march and then lastly pdgm we have made some organizational changes announcements but we won t see that in the numbers until the really the second quarter so as such the noi for the hcs unit will be down sequentially and then lastly g a g a we are expecting a step up so we re going to be accruing for a normalized bonus in the first quarter so absolute g a spend might be in the same neighborhood as last year s first quarter lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director and then just when you think about your adjusted free cash flow remember that q1 is usually a use of working capital and then our capex we will spend about a third of our capex or up to a third of our capex in q1 and so there s a little bit of unusual cash activity that happens in q1 as well josh raskin nephron research analyst got you alright so if we put all that together the second question would be if you re starting ebitda i d say as much as 10 million year over year in the whole in 1q that s implying 20 million to sort of 50 million of improvement in the next three quarters so i heard a lot of the one timers etc but maybe you could just give us a little bit of further color on what you re thinking in terms of occupancy and some of the key metrics that are improving sort of once we get past the first quarter lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director yeah so at a high level we ve given guidance on revpar growth of 3 to 4 most of that will come from rate now you followed the story for a long time so you know that the first thing that you have to do is overcome the occupancy loss in the prior year and the good news for us this year is that our occupancy was only down year over year by 20 basis points on a same store basis in the fourth quarter so i think it s fair to say that our occupancy will be better during the year than our year over year comparisons for 2019 but we haven t really given more guidance on that because we really want to focus on revpar growth which is the combination of both availability and rate or occupancy and rate josh raskin nephron research analyst got you and then just a last one could you just give us a little more color on the competition you spoke to on sort of the fourth quarter what you were seeing in terms of discounting maybe how pervasive that was does it dissipate into the january time period and so any other color on the competition lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director yeah so on our investor presentation on page 7 we always put sort of the industry view as to what s happening in competition as well as the brookdale s view of what s happening in competition and you can see that there was an increase in competitive new openings around our communities between the third quarter and the fourth quarter and we know that when a new community opens the largest impact is that lease up which is most intense during the first 12 months now when we look at it it s important to note that our opens in q4 were down 30 from the peak which occurred in the second quarter of 2017 and the starts that we saw in the fourth quarter were down 71 from the peak that was in the second quarter of 2015 so that translates to a construction pipeline that s a full 20 lower than the first quarter 2018 peak now we have been in the center of the storm in assisted living in particular which is the vast majority of our portfolio and i personally am very excited about the improving competitive environment for assisted living in particular if you look at our supplement you can see on page 11 our same community results and for us our occupancy actually grew 20 basis points on our assisted living portfolio this is important because it s the vast majority of our portfolio and will really be the engine for profit growth that will drive our performance higher and so while i still think that there ll be some competition around our communities while communities lease up i expect it to be much better in 2020 than it was in 2019 and then just a reminder for 2019 as a whole nic basically showed the back half of the year absorption was in excess of supply and we would expect that to continue into 2020 josh raskin nephron research analyst perfect thank you operator your next question comes from the line of jason plagman with jefferies lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director hi jason jason plagman jefferies analyst hey good morning just wanted to ask about some of the metrics behind your sales effectiveness initiatives and productivity there how are things trending as far as leads visits move ins both in q4 and how you re feeling about those your sales pipeline as we start 2020 lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director yeah it s a great question so for 2019 we have delivered positive sequential occupancy since the second quarter and we outperformed the industry for the second half of 2019 in addition we have delivered the best in year occupancy improvement since the emeritus merger as a result of this we re confident that our strategy is taking hold and you can see the results in our occupancy improvement even though this is true it s probably helpful to give you just a few comments on what happened with our leading indicators in the fourth quarter in the fourth quarter on a year over year basis we saw higher leads which has been consistent with our experience during the rest of the year as expected we saw seasonally lower move ins and we are also happy that our controllable move outs returned to improvement and so that has been very good for us and then with regard to our people statistics our executive directors and health and wellness directors trailing 12 month retention rates they remained about 70 and this is for the third year straight what s important to note is that nearly 70 of our executive directors have been in their roles for more than two years which is a critical threshold for resident relationships and the financial success of our communities and these results are all consistent with us raising the performance bar on our team so we re very excited that now the hard work that we put into our leading indicators is translating into metrics that you see in terms of occupancy jason plagman jefferies analyst great that s helpful and then it seems like we re seeing both brookdale and the nic data is showing a little bit more pressure on independent living occupancy relative to assisted living so how are you feeling about the trajectory of occupancy and revpar for independent living in comparison to assisted living lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director well there s no question that the revpar growth in independent living was lower than assisted living for the fourth quarter we drove revpar which is revenue per available unit of on independent living and we drove revpar growth on assisting living at 2 9 now part of that is because we ve been kind of at that 90 ish level for a while so there wasn t as much opportunity for us to grow occupancy in independent living the other part of it is that independent living is one that can be much more rate sensitive because you don t have much services wrapped around the resident and so i think that we will focus on both of our communities our overall strategy which is proven to be successful is to protect the rate but we will discount selectively where necessary with our goal of being having every unit in service at the highest achievable rate jason plagman jefferies analyst got it that s it for me thanks lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director thank you operator your next question comes from the line of joanna gajuk with bank of america joanna gajuk bank of america analyst hi good morning thanks for taking the questions so in terms of the outlook for the year just the ebitda the range kind of costs in terms of the comparable numbers like for like 0 to 7 growth so can you talk us about the biggest seen factors that will bring you toward the lower or toward the higher end of the range in terms of the ebitda lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director yeah it s a really good question joanna and the one thing that i ll say before steve jumps in is we have a revenue opportunity at brookdale which is why we ve been so focused on quality whether it is quality within our healthcare services business or whether it s quality within our senior housing business as demonstrated by our improvement in net promoter score and we re really expecting that 2020 will be an acceleration of our revenue growth so that we can make good progress on the successful strategic plan well the longer term outlook that we announced but steve can you take joanna through the detail steven e swain executive vice president and chief financial officer sure morning joanna three things real quickly on ebitda first numbers that are essentially in the books so you ll see a bridge on slide 10 of the investor presentation it shows transactions and accounting that move ebitda from 401 million to 410 million so that s number 1 number 2 is senior housing noi as we ve mentioned now a few times the revpar will increase 3 to 4 occupancy will improve versus the negative 80 basis points we saw in 2019 and again one last time occupancy is seasonal we have because of our january 1 rate increase we have seen a strong rate increase and that should be as good or slightly better than last year s as we link labor growth to rent increases so bottom line occupancy is not projected to offset the rate increase like we ve seen in prior years nearly as much turning to expense labor i already mentioned is around 5 the labor market continues to be tight we think that 5 is reasonable versus our 5 5 in 2019 we have now finished our three year plan of making above industry investments in our community associates and generally if you make middle of the road assumptions in the senior housing space you ll get to kind of middle of the guidance but for me remember 2020 it s a huge inflection for senior housing we declined 4 6 last year and we re projected to grow in 2020 so that s a pivot point that really can t go unnoticed third and then i ll stop the healthcare services segment will return to noi growth in 2020 revenue growth of up to 3 with a slight margin improvement will lead to growth middle of the road assumptions lead to several million dollars in noi growth kind of depending on what you assume remember pdgm noise in the first quarter so expect noi to decline slightly in the first quarter but to grow throughout 2020 as the issues related to the centralized intake won t repeat and the new management team hits the ground and the improvements are seen in the results so what taking a step back what i look at and what i see 2020 is a big catalyst year as we pivot to growth i already mentioned noi growth ebitda growth of up to 30 million and that s down from over 100 million in 2019 so that s another pivot point inflection point that i look at and makes me excited about our valuation joanna gajuk bank of america analyst alright thanks for that so just to summarize so you say that growing organically senior housing 4 will yield a 7 ebitda growth essentially steven e swain executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah that s the kind of the top end of the guidance range for senior housing and that does generally put you in the top end of our guidance joanna gajuk bank of america analyst right because also you assume that you will be able to more than offset the labor cost inflation at that level right so i guess at the higher end you assume much lower than 5 labor cost expense steven e swain executive vice president and chief financial officer well just remember that you re multiplying the 3 to 4 by a 2 billion plus number and you re multiplying the labor expense by something that s 1 billion so joanna gajuk bank of america analyst no that s great and on the services so you d shared the comments obviously pdgm is a big change for the industry and i didn t hear you mentioning anything about hospice rebasing does that have any impact on your rent sorry on your pricing in 2020 lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director so the current thinking on that is less than a 1 impact on the hospice rebasing so it s not big and as you know our hospice business has just been growing nicely and we would expect that growth to continue the one point that i would make on healthcare services in general and i know this is obvious but i ll feel better if i say it the up to 3 annual growth that we re expecting but for the change to pdgm would be significantly higher and the reason that s the case is because in the first quarter we re rolling off those 60 day tts episodes while we re building new episodes at 30 days and so there s just a little bit of a lag in terms of getting to sort of a stabilized run rate and so it would be much higher without the change to pdgm joanna gajuk bank of america analyst and on this front and i guess steve had mentioned that there is an impact to cash flow in q1 because of the wrap or somewhat other changes that are happening in home health correct so we should expect even a bigger than usual drop in cash flow because of the timing of these prepayments correct steven e swain executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah the timing of free cash flow is a significant use of cash in the first quarter if you look at our past two years of first quarter working capital uses that averaging that is probably kind of a good ballpark joanna gajuk bank of america analyst great i appreciate the color thank you lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director thanks joanna operator your next question comes from the line of chad vanacore with stifel lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director hi chad tao qiu stifel analyst hi good morning this is tao for chad lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director hello tao tao qiu stifel analyst yeah good morning i have two questions the first one is about the independent living and assisted living divergence you mentioned that you had a tough environment in the fourth quarter due to like newly opened communities are there any differences in your revpar assumption for the two segments in 2020 and what are you doing differently between the two lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director we don t provide revpar guidance by segment what you can be sure of is that our goal is to maximize revpar for our entire portfolio and so we will look at each community its market position the new competition entering the market where it stands in terms of occupancy and set an appropriate strategy at the community level tao qiu stifel analyst so should we think that because il has higher occupancy you guys will be holding the rates steady pushing the rate a little bit more and for al the primary objective is to increase the occupancy and at the same time into revpar lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director no tao it s fair to say that when we have a community that has a low occupancy we do more discounting and we build occupancy before pushing rate that s a given where we have a community that has a high occupancy we are more aggressive on pushing rate because that s where the bigger opportunity is so i think you can translate that into what it means for the aggregate of our portfolio but it s definitely done on a community by community basis and even within the community assisted living independent living and memory care are all priced separately tao qiu stifel analyst okay got it and my second question is about marketing spend how much of an increase in marketing spend should we expect in the first quarter and also full year 2020 compared to 2019 and then given the investment you have made so far to drive new leads and conversion how much are you spending now and how reliant are you still on third party referral services such as a place for mom lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director so third party referral sources are a very important part of our business as it is for most senior living operators as i mentioned earlier we have a revenue opportunity in front of us and so our biggest opportunity is to get every unit leased at the highest achievable rate and so we are going to achieve that through a combination of driving our own internal marketing spend which we did last year and it was very effective as well as partnering closely with our large aggregators which we know will be effective i don t think we ve given specific guidance on any individual line of our p l but know that we evaluate our marketing using a very intense data driven analysis and our goal is to make sure that we ve got a good roi on our marketing spend and the increased investment that we started last year worked well for us and so that s the high level takeaway that you should have tao qiu stifel analyst but would you characterize your the percentage of leads from third party referral service as higher or lower than last year lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director i think that we are expecting a strong referral source from our aggregators and we expect that to continue and so as we grow occupancy we would love to see more leads from both our internal sources and from our aggregators tao qiu stifel analyst okay that s it for me thank you lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director thanks tao operator your next question comes from the line of steven valiquette with barclays lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director hello steven valiquette barclays analyst hey good morning everybody so i know we just touched on this topic a lot on this call but just again i mean there s always trade offs on rate versus occupancy as you discussed earlier just to summarize your view on brookdale s expected occupancy improvement this year is it in your mind driven more by brookdale s company specific sales and marketing initiatives or is it driven more by an expectation that overall market conditions may improve as the year progresses lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director it depends and so i think that we have operated in very different call it macroeconomic environment for the last several years we see that improving but at the same time we have worked very hard to make successful improvements in our operating model we ve done a lot of work on our sales and marketing we ve done a lot of work on our operations we ve invested a lot of capex in our communities to make sure that they are attractive to our current and new residents and so all of that working together will build to that 3 to 4 expected improvement in revpar steven valiquette barclays analyst okay and then just a quick question on the non development capex for this year just curious if you can remind us again which project areas categorically you re focusing that spend in 2020 and also are there any strict roi hurdles that you have built in around the spend steven e swain executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah sure steve the categories are similar to the ones in 2019 where we do major building systems and we also do renovations and both of those are projected to decrease into 2021 as i already mentioned on the call that we expect our long term our equilibrium to be at about 2 000 to 2 500 of capex per unit once we get through this kind of this incremental spend as far as the returns we do look at the returns we do a business case on the new economics projects as we call them that bucket and what projects that were approved for 2019 those numbers in that business case were added to that community s budget in 2020 so not only do we look at the returns but we also change the factors that go into the budgeting process steven valiquette barclays analyst okay perfect thanks lucinda m baier president chief executive officer and director thank you at this time i don t think we have any additional questions in the queue so i just want to thank everyone for joining us today i think we had solid performance in q4 we demonstrated consistent progress on the execution of our strategic plan we ve introduced guidance for 2020 that will demonstrate significant improvement in our adjusted ebitda as well as our cash flow and we are on target to achieve that 7 long term noi growth thank you and i hope to see you at our investor day in march operator duration 64 minutes call participants kathy macdonald senior vice president investor relations lucinda m baier president chief executive officer

by george welton executive director of amcham georgia georgia has long aspired to be at the heart of europe as the eu s ambitious goals on climate change have given georgia a great opportunity by pledging to achieve carbon neutrality by 2040 or 10 years ahead of the rest of europe georgia could assume a leadership role demonstrate the business case for climate reform stimulate investment growth and jobs increase the country s security and create a rallying point for national renewal how would georgia set out to achieve the goal of carbon neutrality for a start the country should aim to produce enough electricity from renewable sources to cover 100 of its own consumption within the next five years this is achievable as recently as 2010 the country produced more hydropower than its entire electricity consumption for the year it now depends on more non renewable production due to expanded demand but there are ample opportunities for energy efficiency according to the world bank georgia consumes about three times the electricity per capita of other countries of a similar income level this reflects historical inefficiencies that could easily be improved and bitcoin mining which accounts for at least 10 15 of consumption there is lots of scope for state supported efficiency raising and local production solar city a company started by elon musk was able to massively expand home solar use in california by offering free solar cell installation charging for the electricity that was produced but reducing electricity bills overall the georgian state could do something similar with solar cells and insulation cladding renewable electricity production would also have to go up georgia s hydro production opportunities are well known but there are also opportunities in solar and wind these have not developed so far because of the challenges of grid management for renewables and because the georgian government has been concerned about the cost of providing the support needed to make these projects viable both problems would be alleviated by efforts to increase efficiency and to grow household level electricity production commitments to green energy production could be a huge stimulus for fdi in other sectors this will be particularly important for exports oriented to the eu one of the key components of the eu s new climate change agenda will be a new carbon tax on imports therefore a carbon neutral country with an eu deep and comprehensive free trade agreement could be a natural place to open eu oriented production facilities independence in electricity generation would also be good for security while georgia is no longer significantly dependent on russia around one third of georgia s electricity production comes from the enguri dam which is vulnerable as it straddles the boundary of russian occupied abkhazia the next step in achieving carbon neutrality should be a push to increase the efficiency of transportation with the aim of full electrification in cars this is already happening tbilisi s dramatic increase in the use of toyota priuses results from a 2017 change in the customs code that gave hybrid cars a 60 reduction in import taxes that same year imports of hybrid cars went from zero to 84 million increasing again to 138 million or a quarter or all car imports in 2018 with similar volumes in 2019 this is great for the georgian environment but also shows that in this price sensitive market price signals work if taxes were increased on car imports georgia could shift to importing almost entirely hybrid fully electric cars a decade from now with the aim at fully electric cars a decade after that this would of course push up electricity consumption and thus the need for more green energy production but would reduce carbon output and improve air quality across the country the other crucial element of low carbon transport is to get vehicles off the roads by providing better public transportation and a strong push to get freight transport onto trains this is clearly the future anyway georgia will never be a transit route for goods to from china if that transit occurs on trucks since it is too slow and too expensive if georgia could offer a low carbon tourist experience it could also stimulate interest from high end tourists looking for a guilt free holiday for the most diligent environmentalist a voluntary green tax paid at the point of entry could be used by the government to offset the carbon footprint of the flight by planting trees or increasing conservation areas a sustainability agenda would create multiple paths for job creation and economic growth infrastructure improvements increases in the insulation of houses installation of solar panels and new equipment would all create direct short term economic stimulus increases in fdi towards eu export oriented investment and increases in green tourism would have a more long term positive impact but perhaps most interestingly it would put georgia at the forefront of a range of key new industries we could call these industries carbon neutral on the cheap georgia used to be a major import export country for second hand cars these weren t just transit goods but included considerable value addition since georgians would often import damaged cars before repairing and exporting them this took advantage of georgia s lower labor costs to fix vehicles that would be too maintenance intensive for the west one could imagine similar opportunities in green technology from renewal of battery systems for electric cars to insulation to solar maintenance if georgia could become expert in the development repair and maintenance of second hand or low cost renewable and low carbon technology that could be a huge niche market the costs of this strategy would be considerable but would mostly take the form of long term investments and could be financed cheaply from international sources the risk sharing involved in encouraging large scale electricity production would require subsidies or price guarantees from the government this can only be justified if the electricity produced is being used to support local industry that creates jobs in the country it would also be crucial to make sure that low value added activity like bitcoin mining if allowed at all should not consume subsidized electricity and should pay taxes modifications to the national grid to make it smarter and more capable of dealing with fluctuating renewable supply incentives to encourage insulation and energy efficiency government supported solar and a push to hybrid electric car use would also have potentially high costs however not only would all of these costs generate economic benefit they should be easy to cheaply finance the international financial institutions ifis are all keen to be heavily involved in renewable energy investment the european investment bank has recently announced a new climate strategy and energy lending policy which plans to unlock eur 1 trillion of climate action and sustainable investment in the decade to 2030 the ebrd similarly plans to have 40 of its portfolio in green investments the world bank and asian development bank both have large green funds georgian leadership in this area could also be important because developing countries are going to be the key to resolving the climate change emergency in the long term around 5 billion people or 70 of the world s population live in middle income countries compared to only 16 in high income countries it is therefore critically important that middle income countries develop strategies to cut emissions in ways that benefit their populations by taking a leadership role and showing how positive these changes can be for economic development georgia could have a disproportionate global impact perhaps most importantly this would be a project around which georgia could regain its reputation and pride as a global leader in business oriented reform georgia s self perception is not just as a place for hospitality and wine but for unspoiled nature natural produce and pristine water building on this image to clean up the country and to cement it in the international consciousness as a center for green rejuvenation would have a whole host of positive knock on effects it would create jobs and make people richer but perhaps best of all it would make georgia a nicer place to live the unabridged version of this article is available at investor ge

paige black is a 24 year old from northeast philadelphia with a college degree in biochemistry and exactly the job she was aiming for as a hospital lab technician but she s also forced to live at home with her parents middle class retirees and has no idea when she ll ever get a place of her own all because of one thing she failed to calculate that is calculate in the most literal sense of the word her student debt a whopping 130 000 worth black told me in a twitter interview that it wasn t until she graduated from chestnut hill college that she realized the full impact of the 12 interest on the sallie mae student loan that financed her tuition it s impossible for me to move out she said even after renegotiating the monthly payments down to 600 a month which essentially just covers the interest i have a car payment car insurance health insurance bills etc so it s just ridiculous read more what pete buttigieg doesn t get about how college has ripped america in two will bunch advertisement ridiculous yet black s plight is shared albeit maybe not to that extreme degree by millions of american voters many though not all are in their 20s or 30s and many are found in the expensive to live urban areas where desirable jobs are increasingly clustered they work but struggle to find an affordable apartment or child care or to pay off staggering student loans they re often one medical emergency away from wiping out any minimal savings the existence of these voters helps to explain one of the greatest riddles of the 2020 presidential campaign why is there so much anxiety around pocketbook issues when the dow sits at a once unthinkable record high and the jobless rate sits at a once unthinkable record low in 1992 when a seemingly popular president in george h w bush was felled by a recession the victor bill clinton s chief strategist had a famous sign in his office the economy stupid now 28 years later can the democrats take back the white house again with a slogan that amounts to it s the affordability stupid for a number of years america s growing yet hidden affordability crisis has been a little like the feminist betty friedan s famous 1960s description of the patriarchy as the problem that has no name this despite the fact that concern over america s 1 4 trillion and growing student debt housing prices and out of pocket medical expenses had fueled the rise of 2016 candidate bernie sanders and sparked increased interest in socialism from young voters in 2020 though the problem is too big to ignore in a recent piece for the atlantic titled the great affordability crisis breaking america writer annie lowrey tied the threads together with some mind blowing stats on the extent of the problem from her piece home prices have been rising faster than wages in 80 of the nation s metro areas which has resulted in a lower home ownership rate for millennials the generation generally defined as people now in their 20s and 30s than their baby boomer predecessors even though rent has also been rising faster than income for two decades more than 50 million americans including one of three people in their 20s are seeing their earnings eroded by their college loan debts which increased by an astronomical 116 as tuition soared and young people embraced the idea that they would be unemployable in today s economy without a diploma lowrey s piece also calls attention to the less noticed affordability crises in child care costs up 2 000 that s not a typo over four decades and preventing many low income women from working and out of pocket medical expenses the result of skyrocketing deductibles that means even those covered by medicare or medicaid may pay thousands of dollars in a typical year how is this not a national emergency part of the problem may be to employ an overused 21st century buzzword branding lowrey s atlantic piece was groundbreaking in seeing college debt rents and other expenses as one common crisis when they are typically discussed in their separate silos and most financial and political journalists and analysts have grown up with a different 20th century worldview of what makes a great economy but the rising stock market is to some degree a barometer of how well corporations have steered growth toward shareholders at the expense of everyday workers and the low unemployment rate has been pushed downward by jobs in the gig economy like uber drivers that typically aren t paying a living wage let alone benefits in the cities where these gigs are concentrated this week i posted on twitter looking for young adults in the philadelphia region who struggle with rent college debt and other costs of trying to survive in a large metro area i was surprised by the number of people who wanted to share their stories i heard from the 33 year old in south kensington whose student loan repayments were equal to her mortgage payments the 32 year old who still needs two roommates in order to live in the city and the cyclist with the broken wrist who was bruised again months later by a surprise 800 out of network charge the idea of putting a down payment on a house seems much more intimidating for people my age barry tomasetti a 26 year old engineer working at the philadelphia navy yard told me he and his fiancee will be sharing the 1 600 a month cost of renting in northern liberties but the american dream of home ownership remains exactly that a dream the affordability crisis could be the secret sauce in the presidential race sanders laserlike focus on making both health care and higher education universal and free in many cases and on increasing middle class wages has been echoed in the 2020 race by sen elizabeth warren who also wants to wipe away all existing college debt and to make child care more widely available through a wealth tax on millionaires and billionaires young voters have taken notice in the democratic primaries so far sanders has a huge lead with under 35 voters while warren has been placing second northeast philadelphia s black with her 130 00 student debt told me she s followed both campaigns she applauded sanders for protesting the closure of hahnemann university hospital where she worked and was laid off before her current job but also said that warren is a lot more smarter and can get done she added i ve radically accepted that i m going to die with my loans so in a perfect world there would be no student loan debt talk for just a few minutes to these young voters and you start to understand the disconnect between america s young adults and the mostly older pundit and politico class which struggles to understand why sanders is now the solid democratic front runner and also wonders how trump despite his impeachment his corruption and myriad abuses of power can be beaten with the economy doing so incredibly well read more bernie sanders is on the trump track to the white house here s why he s not a leftist trump will bunch but the democratic nominee in november even if it s not sanders or warren can take back the economic conversation if she or he can successfully rebrand what s happening to the average american household with that one word affordability because what good is the dow at 30 000 or the slow and steady rise of the gross domestic product gdp when those dollars are hoarded by large corporations their shareholders and their ceos while their average employee lives in the cramped equivalent of a college dorm room one bike crash away from insolvency what s more the young and urban voters who suffer the most from the affordability crunch are the ones who historically vote in lower numbers a surge in under 35 voter turnout would guarantee the election of a democratic president no matter how many russian bots are posting pro trump memes on your great aunt s facebook page if the opposition party is truly serious about making trump a one term president it should embrace the 2020 equivalent of it s the economy stupid which would be a blue hat reading make america affordable again

for the first three quarters of 2018 have been revised for certain immaterial adjustments as discussed in tenneco s form 10 k for the year ended december 31 2018 1 tenneco presents debt net of total cash balances because management believes it is a useful measure of tenneco s credit position and progress toward reducing leverage the calculation is limited in that the company may not always be able to use cash to repay debt on a dollar for dollar basis 2 ebitda including noncontrolling interests represents income before interest expense income taxes noncontrolling interests and depreciation and amortization ebitda including noncontrolling interests is not a calculation based upon gaap the amounts included in the ebitda including noncontrolling interests calculation however are derived from amounts included in the historical statements of income data in addition ebitda including noncontrolling interests should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss attributable to tenneco inc or operating income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to operating cash flows as a measure of liquidity tenneco has presented ebitda including noncontrolling interests because it regularly reviews ebitda including noncontrolling interests as a measure of the company s performance in addition tenneco believes its investors utilize and analyze the company s ebitda including noncontrolling interests for similar purposes tenneco also believes ebitda including noncontrolling interests assists investors in comparing a company s performance on a consistent basis without regard to depreciation and amortization which can vary significantly depending upon many factors however the ebitda including noncontrolling interests measure presented may not always be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in the components of the calculation 3 adjusted ebitda including noncontrolling interests is presented in order to reflect the results in a manner that allows a better understanding of operational activities separate from the financial impact of decisions made for the long term benefit of the company and other items impacting comparability between the periods similar adjustments to ebitda including noncontrolling interests have been recorded in earlier periods and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be expected to be recorded in future periods the company believes investors find the non gaap information helpful in understanding the ongoing performance of operations separate from items that may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the company s financial results in any particular period 4 tenneco presents the above reconciliation of the ratio of debt net of total cash to ltm adjusted ebitda including noncontrolling interests to show trends that investors may find useful in understanding the company s ability to service its debt for purposes of this calculation adjusted ltm and pro forma adjusted ltm ebitda including noncontrolling interests is used as an indicator of the company s performance and debt net of total cash is presented as an indicator of the company s credit position and progress toward reducing the company s financial leverage this reconciliation is provided as supplemental information and not intended to replace the company s existing covenant ratios or any other financial measures that investors may find useful in describing the company s financial position see notes 1 2 and 3 for a description of the limitations of using debt net of total cash ebitda including noncontrolling interests and adjusted ebitda including noncontrolling interests 5 tenneco is providing pro forma adjusted ltm ebitda and the ratio of debt net of cash balances to pro forma adjusted ltm ebitda to show the company s adjusted ltm ebitda as if federal mogul had been consolidated with tenneco for the entirety of 2018 and the resultant impact on the net debt ratio tenneco believes this supplemental information is useful to investors who are trying to understand the results of the entire enterprise including federal mogul for 2018 and 2019 and the ability of the company to service its debt 6 costs related to cost reduction initiatives 7 costs related to acquisitions and costs related to expected separation 8 charge related to warranty although tenneco regularly incurs warranty costs this specific charge is of an unusual nature in the period incurred 9 costs to achieve synergies related to federal mogul acquisition 10 this primarily relates to a non cash charge to cost of goods sold for the amortization of the inventory fair value step up recorded as part of the acquisitions 11 non cash asset impairment charge related to goodwill and intangibles 12 charge due to process harmonization 13 charge due to retroactive application of anti dumping duty on a supplier s products 14 reduction in estimated antitrust accrual 15 recovery of value added tax in a foreign jurisdiction 16 inventory losses attributable to prior periods 17 environmental charge related to an acquired site whereby an indemnification reverted back to the company resulting from a 2009 bankruptcy filing of mark iv industries 18 loss on debt modification 19 charges related to pension derisking and other adjustments

accepted accounting principles 2 tenneco presents pro forma revenues and earnings measures to show what the company s performance would have been had federal mogul been consolidated with tenneco for each quarter of 2018 we believe this supplemental information is useful to investors who are trying to understand the results of the entire enterprise including federal mogul the motorparts segment reflects the company s historical aftermarket segment plus the motorparts aftermarket business acquired in the federal mogul acquisition the ride performance segment reflects the company s historical ride performance segment plus the motorparts oe business acquired in the federal mogul acquisition 3 tenneco presents the above reconciliation of revenues in order to reflect value add revenues separately from substrate sales substrate sales include precious metals pricing which may be volatile substrate sales occur when at the direction of its oe customers tenneco purchases catalytic converters or components thereof from suppliers uses them in its manufacturing processes and sells them as part of the completed system while tenneco original equipment customers assume the risk of this volatility it impacts reported revenue excluding substrate sales removes this impact tenneco uses this information to analyze the trend in revenues before these factors tenneco believes investors find this information useful in understanding period to period comparisons in the company s revenues 4 ebitda including noncontrolling interests represents income before interest expense income taxes noncontrolling interests and depreciation and amortization we have also presented ebitda including noncontrolling interests to give effect to the reclassification of financing charges on sale of receivables that took place in the first quarter 2019 and to give effective to the impact of the segment changes that occurred in the first quarter of 2019 ebitda including noncontrolling interests is not a calculation based upon gaap the amounts included in the ebitda including noncontrolling interests calculation however are derived from amounts included in the historical statements of income data in addition ebitda including noncontrolling interests should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss attributable to tenneco inc or operating income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to operating cash flows as a measure of liquidity tenneco has presented ebitda including noncontrolling interests because it regularly reviews ebitda including noncontrolling interests as a measure of the company s performance in addition tenneco believes its investors utilize and analyze the company s ebitda including noncontrolling interests for similar purposes tenneco also believes ebitda including noncontrolling interests assists investors in comparing a company s performance on a consistent basis without regard to depreciation and amortization which can vary significantly depending upon many factors however the ebitda including noncontrolling interests measure presented may not always be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in the components of the calculation 5 adjusted ebitda is ebitda including noncontrolling interests after giving effect to the reclassification and segment change described above and is presented in order to reflect the results in a manner that allows a better understanding of operational activities separate from the financial impact of decisions made for the long term benefit of the company and other items impacting comparability between the periods similar adjustments to ebitda including noncontrolling interests have been recorded in earlier periods and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be expected to be recorded in future periods the company believes investors find the non gaap information helpful in understanding the ongoing performance of operations separate from items that may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the company s financial results in any particular period 6 tenneco presents the above reconciliation in order to reflect adjusted ebitda as a percent of both value add revenues presenting adjusted ebitda as a percent of value add revenue assists investors in evaluating the company s operational performance without the impact of substrate sales which can be volatile attachment 2 tenneco inc reconciliation of gaap 1 revenue to pro forma 2 revenue and non gaap earnings measures 2018
