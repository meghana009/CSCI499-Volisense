1 introduction wash infrastructure projects can be divided into three basic categories production and treatment transmission and distribution of water production and treatment projects build or rehabilitate central water pumps or sewage treatment plants transmission projects build or rehabilitate systems that transmit water from central pumping stations to distribution systems distribution projects build or rehabilitate systems that deliver clean water to consumers in greater volumes on a more reliable basis and or connect new consumers to the system when distribution by pipeline is infeasible clean water can be distributed by digging wells or boreholes wash sanitation projects improve public sewer systems including building or rehabilitating sewage treatment plants connect households to sewer systems provide households with septic tanks or provide latrines donor interventions in wash projects can be justified on economic efficiency grounds by i market failures in the provision of clean water and sanitation due to information externalities related to hygiene and health and environmental externalities from water use and inadequate sanitation practices and or the natural monopoly characteristics of water and sanitation systems or ii government or public service failures resulting from poor sector or utility governance including mispricing of water and sanitation services costly and or unreliable service provision and or costly system losses health externalities occur because providing cleaner water to existing customers and extending access to clean water to new customers can lower the overall incidence of water borne diseases the private benefit to an individual investing in access to clean water is less than the total societal benefit of one more individual having access to clean water due to such externalities provision of wash investments tends to be lower than the socially optimal level i e the level at which the marginal cost of providing the infrastructure is equal to the marginal benefit to the society as a whole in addition countries may often misallocate their available water resources across uses and over time too much water may be used in low return activities and too little in high return activities when this results in rationing or threatens water scarcity in the near term the failure to address market failures adequately can result in a sub optimal growth trajectory insufficient quantity and quality of water and sanitation infrastructure sometimes combined with a lack of knowledge and practices of good hygiene has been identified as a binding constraint to economic growth in several mcc compact countries in other cases water scarcity has been identified as binding to growth due to a combination of low natural endowments and either conservation failures allocation inefficiencies or both specific indicators may include household and firm use of private labor private vendors or tanker services to obtain water at volumes and costs that are high relative to comparator countries high time use by households to collect water that imply a large opportunity cost of access large estimated disability adjusted life years dalys due to water borne illnesses particularly diarrhea and high collection inefficiencies and system losses combined with high unmet demand at a cost reflective price these indicators are often supported by an unfavorable level and trend in i water and sewage service coverage relative to benchmark countries ii firm perceptions that water is a constraint to investment iii evidence of poor sustainability of water service delivery due to underpricing or low fee collection with the resulting low maintenance and reinvestment in the system and iv country specific tax investment and regulatory problems to relieve the constraint compact countries typically request that mcc invest in infrastructure for delivering clean water and these are usually combined with sector reforms to improve system sustainability and sector performance in a more lasting systemic way to realize the benefits of wash projects beneficiary behavior often must change e g end user hygiene practices as a result wash projects are frequently accompanied by a local outreach strategy when feasible the outreach strategy is integrated into the project but at times it is done as a standalone project when integrated into the project a behavior change parameter must be included in the err informed by evidence or expert judgment that can be evaluated afterwards since one of the goals of wash projects is to reduce potential beneficiaries exposure to contaminated water drainage projects should be considered wash projects to the extent that drainage projects eliminate flooding they may also reduce property damage and value added lost to business closures as well as time lost in congested traffic via time consuming detours ideally the cost benefit analysis should be built around a simulation of likely flooding scenarios lastly recognizing the importance of addressing root causes activities to improve sector policy institutional capacity and governance play an increasing role in wash projects mcc compact countries frequently seek assistance in enhancing the performance of their wash utilities by improving sector governance the management commercial and financial viability service levels and sustainability of wash utilities and or changing beneficiary behavior typically hygiene related to maximize the benefits beneficiaries get from already existing wash infrastructure these guidelines will describe the typical project logic for wash projects and the associated costs and benefits as well as typical institutional reform issues this is a living document that will be updated periodically as necessary 2 simple taxonomy of wash project logics table 1 wash project taxonomy project main potential benefit streams central infrastructure upgrading central treatment and distribution centers decreased technical losses increased supply lower costs of service improved reliability and or lower all in water prices for consumers if consumption increases increased consumer surplus reform of sector governance utility governance and or ownership regulation financial arrangements decreased commercial losses more sustainable service or system expansion leading to higher future supply and or lower costs of service or substitution from higher cost sources for consumers infrastructure extension extending water and sewer pipes to unserved neighborhoods improved health outcomes decreased time gathering water for water extension projects other water infrastructure boreholes wells etc improved health outcomes decreased time gathering water greater production other sanitation infrastructure latrines septic tanks etc improved health outcomes as with all logics the particular operational context is paramount there is no such thing as a definitive or standard logic for example if evidence demonstrates that households generally do not practice safe hygiene then an accompanying activity may be required to address this and safe hygiene practices would become a medium term outcome targeted by the activity as opposed to an assumption a project logic is a living guide that should be responsive to feedback from the context in which it operates three examples of project logics are provided here for time savings health benefits and cost savings wash infrastructure provides clean water that combined with proper hygiene practices can significantly reduce the burden of water borne diseases in a country s population increasing the overall productivity of the country s endowment of labor it can also significantly lower the amount of time households must spend gathering water lastly policy and institutional reform wash projects can improve the productivity of capital invested in the sector e g by implementing a maintenance program to reduce physical leaks and thereby lower the cost of water delivery to the utility s customers and may increase service quality and expanded service depending on the context and the reform in question time savings from collecting water in some countries women and children are the main household members responsible for gathering water one of the main benefit streams from wash projects particularly in rural settings is reducing time spent gathering water absent data about children s wages and the opportunity cost of children s time not spent in education and other enrichment activities we assume that time spent by children getting water is substitutable with women s time if the children don t do this chore the women in the household have to do it for the time savings benefit stream of wash projects the project logic may look like that in table 2 table 2 example project logics for time savings from collecting water time savings for a networked wash system assumptions indicators infrastructure output new pipes connecting households to existing network installed length of pipe laid project output households that previously had to leave house to collect water are now connected to the new pipes last mile connections are either affordable or paid for by the local government and households choose to connect number of households connected short term outcome switching from other sources to tap water and time savings accrued tap water consumption time spent collecting water long term outcome time savings used in productive market or domestic or leisure activities no barriers to entry to labor markets leisure if chosen is chosen voluntarily value of time saved valued according to guidelines goal increase in household income value added from home production leisure good consumption household income or expenditures consumption when the provision of water to the populace is below the social optimum there may be health benefits from increasing access to clean water these health benefits depend on new water and sanitation users connecting to the system and or higher levels of water use per capita however the expense of accessing clean water is often prohibitive for poor households many of whom cannot access the necessary finance for a connection and utilities may be financially incapable of financing connections through user fees in many cases health benefits also depend on households adopting new hygiene practices the project logic must explicitly account for how new users will be connected to the new infrastructure and what will lead to changes in their hygienic practices if necessary to realize benefits it should be noted that water systems that do not maintain continuous 24 hour pressure can allow contamination from groundwater to seep in defeating the purpose of the project the economist should always ask water sector counterparts on the team if achieving 24 hour pressure is necessary and accounted for in the project logic table 3 example project logic for health benefits health benefits for a networked wash system assumptions indicators infrastructure output new pipes connecting households to existing network installed length of pipe laid project output households that previously had to leave house to collect water are now connected to the new pipes last mile connections are either affordable or paid for by the local government and households choose to connect number of households connected short term outcome households reduce consumption of contaminated water in favor of clean water households engage in safe water storage and handling practices so tap water is not contaminated tap water consumption tested water is not contaminated long term outcome incidence of water borne diseases declines incidence of infectious diarrhea stunting wasting goal decrease in dalys lost days spent suffering from caring for diarrhea declines under 5 deaths decline stunting wasting declines in some countries the main problem associated with water is its overall scarcity and the benefits associated with health or time savings are relatively low compared to reducing the cost of water in some cases benefits can be measured with revealed preferences estimates associated with reducing the costs of water using observations of consumer expenditures on marketed commodities like bottled water but in some cases the full benefits are better captured by measuring the increase in consumer surplus resulting from increased water consumption through a stated preference survey table 4 example project logic for cost reduction improved access cost reduction improved access assumptions indicators infrastructure output repair of partially and fully depreciated pipes length of targeted pipe repaired project output lower technical losses technical losses short term outcome increased revenue per unit of water supplied by utility increased water supply to customers is monetized utility revenue medium term outcome cost savings are passed on to shareholders consumers or government utility regulatory agency performing price setting function adequately households connect and stay connected to water and sanitation services and use their new household sanitary facilities accordingly water tariffs long term outcome lower beneficiary expenditure on water beneficiary expenditures on water goal increase in household income household expenditures an mcc wash project may have an institutional improvement subcomponent aimed at improving the financial sustainability of the wash sector for example the collections ratio may be a key indicator the ratio of water supplied that is actually paid for relative to the total volume of billable water the collections ratio is typically less than one for two reasons physical losses and commercial losses projects to reduce the two types of losses have qualitatively different project logics and therefore benefit streams physical losses result when water simply leaks out of the system reducing physical losses including efforts to track and manage the depreciation of assets in order to plan for future maintenance and replacement is essentially an engineering problem a reduction in physical losses results in more water reaching customers for the same costs effectively reducing the unit cost of water provision in some cases this benefit is calculated as the improvement in the utility s revenues resulting from the reduction in physical losses note that whether these cost savings will be passed on by the utility to beneficiary households will be a critical question for the beneficiary analysis the project logic for physical losses will look essentially the same as the one for cost reduction see table 4 commercial losses result when water is deliberately diverted from the system by non paying users or when billed users fail to pay their bills sometimes commercial losses result in technical losses when non paying users drill holes in pipes often the utility needs assistance in improving business practices so that non paying customers can be identified and their service shut off until they pay although it is often not this simple political level institution specific interventions in addition to the installation of pre paid meters may be required to address the problem the benefit of reducing commercial losses is more difficult to quantify water that is not paid for nevertheless reaches a consumer who benefits a commercial loss can be seen as a transfer from the utility to the non paying customer however the long run financial autonomy of any utility is important to its performance incentives and ability to meet demand and commercial losses often contribute significantly to a utility s poor financial performance often utilities require intervention because they are unable to fund maintenance requirements or acquire new assets the benefit of reducing commercial losses serves to improve a utility s long run financial performance and sustainability which can be modelled relative to the business as usual or baseline situation the ultimate expected outcomes are lower average user costs the economic value of reduced fiscal losses or the benefits of reinvestment and system expansion for businesses and households each case must be analyzed based upon the country sector context and benefit streams calibrated to available evidence on policy and institutional arrangements in the water sector a project logic for reducing commercial losses would look like the following table 5 project logic for reduction of commercial losses lower costs assumptions indicators mcc output institutional reform of utility business practices completed milestones of utility reform process project output more rigorous billing and collections practices billed vs collected consumption short term outcome increased revenue per unit of water supplied for utility institutional reform is sufficient to improve collections utility revenue cost recovery ratio medium term outcome utility is better able to fund asset maintenance and acquisition improved financial autonomy results in improved service delivery existence of and funding for long term maintenance and asset acquisition plan long term outcome lower beneficiary expenditure on water per unit of consumption greater reliability greater water use or lower tax donor support to utility regulatory agency ensures that any cost savings are passed on to consumers beneficiary expenditure on water from survey or utility records goal increase in household income household expenditures 3 general approaches to the economic analysis of potential wash projects the second approach is to model changes in consumer surplus a method which in principle combines all private benefits into a single metric depending on the logic and objectives of the proposed investment this may be the most feasible approach in both cases changes in producer surplus for domestic providers of wash services would also be captured in the analysis as described in mcc s general guidelines for cba and beneficiary analysis the estimation of benefits consists of a comparison of the benefit and cost streams with and without the investment or project as proposed there is a rich literature that describes the health benefits of supplying communities with clean water and sewage treatment facilities and a literature describing how to monetize time saved from improved access to water the magnitude of each benefit stream will depend crucially on the context and design of each project although more studies are needed some previous attempts to value both of these benefit streams find that on average time savings account for about three quarters of benefits with increased productivity from improved health accounting for the other quarter hutton and haller 2004 figures 7 8 the mcc experience has been varied while time savings were in fact about three quarters of benefits in the zambia compact wash project time savings were only 15 and 11 minutes per day per beneficiary in tanzania and ghana respectively for all benefit streams socio economic data should be gathered either from the beneficiary population directly or from the compact country s most recent socio economic survey which provide information on household income and relevant demographic data e g household size gender age and education level of household members etc for purposes of the beneficiary analysis the beneficiary data should be categorized by mcc s standard income categories if possible perhaps during the due diligence stage if compact country data is not available data should be gathered on time and monetary expenditure on the collection of water from various sources this baseline reference estimate can be improved if data on the availability and quality of water for the project beneficiaries is available because water can be contaminated at the source of collection between the source and the storage container at home and after it is drawn from the storage container the quality of water should be sampled from at least three sources the original source of the water the pipe faucet that delivers water to the end user storage containers in the home and after water is drawn from the storage container for drinking water cooking cleaning and laundry regarding the second approach estimated consumer surplus benefits may have to be estimated using a revealed or stated preference methodology depending on data availability for example beneficiaries expenditures on bottled water can be used to derive revealed willingness to pay for clean water if market data are not available to produce revealed preference estimates of wtp then either more indirect methods for estimating health and time savings estimates must be used or if even such indirect methods are infeasible a contingent valuation cv survey can be used to estimate stated preferences mcc has not developed separate internal guidelines for conducting cv surveys but adheres to noaa s 2001 guidelines noaa 2001 noaa conducts cba of the endangered species act which requires them to estimate the benefit of preventing the extinction of species on the endangered species list and have accumulated considerable experience in conducting cv surveys 3 1 potential health benefits infectious diarrhea is the water borne disease that leads to the most labor productivity loss and can be addressed with water quality and sanitation projects diarrhea s main impact is through child mortality if the victim survives and if severe stunting does not occur as a direct result there is no long lasting disability impact see table 6 intestinal nematodes and lymphatic filariasis have almost the opposite effect both are rarely fatal but have significant disability effects infectious diarrhea not only results in significant loss of life but significantly contributes to malnutrition in young children ages 0 5 thus increasing the risk of stunting in 2009 the international initiative for impact evaluation 3ie published a meta analysis of 65 impact evaluations of wash interventions aimed at reducing the incidence of childhood diarrhea the study categorized interventions into five types water supply water quality sanitation hygiene and combinations of water sanitation and hygiene esrey et al 1991 found that water supply and sanitation reduced the prevalence of schistosomiasis by 77 ascariasis by 29 and hookworm by 4 schistosomiasis can be more difficult to track than diarrhea the best known way to track diarrhea incidence is to conduct a survey which is relatively straightforward despite the usual weaknesses associated with relying on recall and etc in household surveys while tracking schistosomiasis incidence is harder for drainage projects the estimated malaria reduction can be derived from a study by castro et al 2010 that found restoring and maintaining drains in dar es salaam has the potential to eliminate more than 40 of all potential mosquito larval habitats the without project estimate of disease incidence requires data on incidence or prevalence of the disease of interest preferably the data should be sampled directly from the beneficiary population but more aggregated world health organization who data can be the default option if more disaggregated data are not available diarrheal disease prevalence is typically available at sub national levels importantly by urban rural status through dhs and mics surveys converting incidence reduction into income using the human capital approach to convert reductions in disease incidence into income we must estimate the effects of lowering death and disability on productivity and life expectancy for diarrhea we must also estimate the impact on income of reducing the stunting effect associated with diarrhea s contribution to malnutrition when it occurs among young children early estimates of benefits used in mcc errs focused on costs associated with hospital visits and ad hoc measurements of productivity losses the problem with this approach is it is not consistent across countries the disability adjusted life year is calculated by the who in a consistent manner across countries and is therefore one of the few current metrics associated with health related benefits that can guarantee consistency across wash projects in different countries the daly metric breaks the effects of disease into two components years of life lost due to death yll and equivalent years lost due to disability yld while not explicitly designed for converting health effects into income to the extent that the metric is a valid measure of productivity loss we can assign the value of the marginal productivity of labor to it assuming a perfectly competitive labor market we can use the opportunity cost of time see discussion above as the marginal productivity of labor we use this metric daly oct as the default unless we have specific knowledge of a particular case that allows us to construct a more accurate metric that is still meaningfully consistent across countries for stunting we estimate the lifetime impact that stunting has on education and labor market participation stunting is defined as having a height for age more than two standard deviations below the median of the nchs who growth reference who 1995 alderman et al 2006 find that stunted children enter school one and a half years later on average and enter the workforce 1 year later the lifetime income impact estimates rely on returns to education and work experience to estimate these returns we recommend using a mincer regression on which there is considerable literature described in detail in ea s guidelines for mincer regressions calculating and valuing dalys the main health benefits from wash projects come from lower incidences of infectious diarrhea wash projects also affect the incidence of other diseases schistosomiasis lymphatic filariasis intestinal nematodes in the first example below we will describe how the benefits from infectious diarrhea would be calculated since it is the most common target of mcc interventions the next example considers a disease that has a more significant disability component disability effects can also be estimated using days of work lost instead of the yld component of the daly counting both would be double counting the advantage of this metric is it is relatively easy to measure either by visiting clinics for administrative data or including relevant questions in a survey the tradeoff is it will tend to underestimate productivity losses that are not acute enough to result in missed work time in the case of diarrhea days of work lost to illness will be very small compared to days lost due to death especially for children under 5 the economist should use their judgement whether to invest resources in collecting days of work lost data ylls require some estimate of the expected number of beneficiaries expected to die each year and the age at death incidence rates number of cases per thousand in a given time period and mortality rates deaths per thousand of cases are typically calculated by the who sometimes by age group and can be used to generate these figures ylds require estimates of the duration of various diseases available on page 76 of mathers et al 2006 for diarrhea intestinal nematodes schistosomiasis and malaria and page 9 of ottesen et al 2008 the ylds use disability weights available from the who to account for years of life lived in states of less than full health due to a particular disease table 6 illustrative example of incidence case fatality rate and disease duration from zambia who data disease incidence 1000 case fatality rate 1000 duration years infectious diarrhea 138 2 20 0 016 intestinal nematodes 51 0 01 1 52 schistosomiasis 89 0 04 2 98 malaria 120 0 10 2 02 lymphatic filariasis 15 0 permanent i e expected lifetime but only 5 in urban lusaka infectious diarrhea because time spent actually ill is relatively short for infectious diarrhea usually a few days if the patient survives the main benefits from reducing incidence of infectious diarrhea can be measured simply through years of life lost ylls making the err calculation slightly simpler ylls due to infectious diarrhea can be estimated using a breakdown of the host country s population by age and death rates per 1000 broken down by age group where feasible next we need to estimate the reduction in infectious diarrhea incidence that will result from the project as mentioned above the current main source for this estimate is a 2009 meta analysis by the international initiative for impact evaluation 3ie water sanitation and hygiene interventions to combat childhood diarrhea in developing countries figure 5 on page 27 summarizes the effects of various wash interventions on the incidence of infectious diarrhea water quality interventions reduce infectious diarrhea incidence by about 42 while sanitation interventions reduce incidence by 37 although the 3ie study did not examine drainage interventions directly we currently apply the same incidence reduction estimates as for sanitation interventions 37 we will update this recommendation based on the impact evaluation for the zambia wash project we calculate the number of deaths in the baseline without project and the number of deaths with project incidence rates and death rates will vary by country the data are available from the who or the country s health ministry the value of deaths avoided each year becomes the benefit stream for health as a starting point the economist could base the yll calculation on the average characteristics of the beneficiary population when possible further disaggregation to incorporate age younger beneficiaries lose more years of life than older ones and incidence death rate by age is desirable to more accurately estimate benefits an example helps to clarify concepts suppose a wash project will improve availability of clean water to 10 000 beneficiaries the without project incidence of infectious diarrhea is currently 140 per 1000 the intervention is expected to reduce incidence by 40 so the with project incidence rate will be 84 per 1000 every case of infectious diarrhea has an associated 0 5 chance of death so the number of deaths without project is 0 5 140 0 7 deaths per thousand while deaths with project is 0 5 84 0 4 deaths per thousand thus the intervention will prevent 0 3 deaths per thousand of beneficiaries the present discounted value pdv of future earnings from the average beneficiary at the time of death multiplied by the number of deaths prevented is the annual benefit from the intervention if the project has 10 000 beneficiaries it will prevent 3 deaths each year if the pdv of future earnings is 100 000 then the benefit stream is 300 000 per year another commonly used method to assign value to life lost to disease and disability is to use the value of a statistical life vsl this method has the advantage of being derived from the value victims of disease put on their own life themselves rather than valuing people in terms of the income they earn putting a lower value on the lives of relatively poor people since using vsl has become standard practice in cba in high and middle income countries we are investigating some suggested approaches for adopting vsl for our purposes the results of our investigation will be described in the next iteration of this guidance other diseases the other diseases besides diarrhea can have labor productivity losses besides loss of life in cases where the lower labor productivity is primarily a result of work days lost the economist should assign a value to that using the beneficiary s opportunity cost of time in cases where the illness does not result in lost work days but rather lower labor productivity overall the economist can use the opportunity cost of time of years lost to disability yld calculating an additional yld component follows a methodology similar to that described above for the yll component the main difference is that we use the value of time spent with disability avoided instead of the value of deaths avoided as the annual benefit stream for example suppose the wash project described in the previous example is expected to significantly reduce schistosomiasis in the beneficiary population the without project incidence of schistosomiasis is currently 90 per 1000 the intervention is expected to reduce incidence by 40 so the with project incidence rate will be 54 per 1000 every case of schistosomiasis has an associated 0 004 chance of death so the number of deaths without project is 0 004 90 0 0036 while deaths with project is 0 004 54 0 0022 so the intervention prevents 0 0014 deaths per thousand if the project has 10 000 beneficiaries and the pdv of future earnings is 100 000 the benefit stream from deaths avoided is 1 400 furthermore each incidence of schistosomiasis lasts for 3 years with a disability weight of 0 006 resulting in the equivalent of 30 006 0 018 years of life lost reducing the incidence of schistosomiasis from 90 to 54 per thousand results in a reduction in ylds of 360 018 0 648 per thousand if the value of ylds is approximately equal to per capita income and per capita income is 10 000 then the reduction in ylds generates 64 800 in benefits each year from the 10 000 beneficiaries the benefits from reducing incidence of schistosomiasis clearly come mainly from reducing the disability side of the health effect in these examples the benefits from reducing incidence of schistosomiasis are significantly lower than those from reducing incidence of infectious diarrhea as other diseases tend to have even lower combinations of prevalence death rate and disability rates compared to schistosomiasis it may be sufficient to limit the err calculation to benefits associated with the top two or three most costly water borne diseases in the relevant context in some contexts substantial malaria benefits may accrue from a drainage project and including these would be important in those cases calculating and valuing lifetime earnings lost to stunting cases of infectious diarrhea that occur in young children aged 0 2 can produce stunting which typically leads to children entering the educational system a year later reducing their overall education and entering the workforce later reducing their lifetime earnings the core of this methodology is a mincer regression that can assign relative returns to extra years of work experience and education since mincer regressions are standard tools used in constraints analyses a mincer regression will already be available for most compact countries we recommend using mincer regressions that have applied the standard mcc methodology the returns to education are combined with the effect that infectious diarrhea cases have through malnutrition on stunting teshome et al 2009 find that children experiencing diarrhea were 2 3 times more likely to be stunted compared to the reference category i e children without diarrhea see appendix 3 for an example that uses the odds ratio in teshome et al 2009 to determine the expected reduction in stunting 3 2 time savings benefits in a standard household utility maximization model in an interior solution with no barriers to entry to the labor market the household will allocate time across leisure home production and time spent earning a wage such that the marginal value of all the activities is equal in that case the opportunity cost of time of a given family member is equal to the wage they would earn in the market when there are barriers to entry it may not be optimal for the utility maximizing household to assign family members with lower marginal labor productivity to wage earning activities even when the market wage is somewhat higher than the marginal value to the household of those family members engaging in home productivity or leisure since households typically assign the low productivity family members i e women and children to collecting water using the market wage may overestimate the value of time in the presence of significant barriers to entry employment indicators like the difference between genders in labor force participation rates could be an indicator of whether this is a problem in countries where the gender gap in labor force participation lfp is particularly wide the team economist should suggest the project also address women s access to the labor market it won t help the household as much if all the freed up time is spent involuntarily on leisure or low productivity household production because of exogenous barriers to working another way to reflect the relative size of exogenous barriers to entry for women is to use the difference in lfp rates between genders to discount market wages if the country team agrees this is necessary because the market wage for children is sometimes not collected by labor force surveys and the resulting wage probably does not reflect the opportunity cost of time spent in educational activities we recommend the economist value children s time as equivalent to the time of adult women in the household absent indicators of significant barriers to entry to the labor market women s time can be reliably measured by their wage the first best method to collect women s wage information is to conduct a wage survey of the beneficiary population targeted by the project although the compact development timeline typically does not allow enough time to do this the second best source of wage data would be from a recent labor force survey if available absent that the average wage of unskilled labor if available for women from a labor force publication can be used use caution in using an administratively set minimum wage since it often significantly overestimates the unskilled wage rate and is likely imperfectly enforced absent an estimate of targeted beneficiaries wages the economist should endeavor to construct a value of work from available sources that is a defensible proxy for the average income per hour of either the project s beneficiaries or of unskilled labor in similar economic activities to those in which they are already engaged 3 3 cost savings 3 4 consumer surplus approach there are two main methods of capturing changes in consumer surplus depending on whether the good is actively traded on a market if there is an established history of market transactions of the good in question the revealed preferences technique can be used to estimate willingness to pay for a marginal increase in supply of the product this is a fairly standard technique described in most microeconomics textbooks for example the willingness to pay for the reduction of noxious odors associated with a water treatment plan should be represented in the price tenants and owners are willing to pay to live in neighborhoods where such odors are present using differences in rent paid for various objectively measurable amenities the presence or absence of toilets electricity water connections proximity to sources of noxious odors is called a hedonic regression a standard econometric technique estimating the willingness to pay for a good for which there is no readily available market data can be more complicated for example what is the willingness to pay for lower waterborne disease exposure due to cleaner surface and groundwater supplies such benefits tend not to be tied to a specific location and are difficult to measure using hedonic regressions when an individual household connects to a centralized sewage system the household s effluent does not enter the groundwater supply lowering exposure to waterborne diseases for all households accessing water from that watershed such consumption externalities can be quantified by conducting a survey of household s willingness to pay for lower incidence of waterborne diseases the standard technique is to conduct a stated preference alternately willingness to pay or contingent valuation survey the literature on such surveys is extensive starting with mishan 1971 whittington 1998 noaa s 2001 guidelines for conducting contingent valuation surveys whittington 2002 and whittington 2010 also chapter 16 of boardman et al s textbook cost benefit analysis provides some discussion of the topic asking businesses their willingness to pay for water can be a good way to measure the induced benefits of alleviating a water scarcity constraint if business owners have full knowledge of the investment opportunities that improved water availability would prevent note however that the businesses willingness to pay is equal to the risk adjusted present value of profits from the new business opportunities the value added of expenditures on labor i e the increase in real incomes resulting from the project for the business employees would not be captured but could be modeled using estimates of firms representative production function from detailed firm surveys the project logic will determine the kind of wtp survey to conduct for example if the primary goal of the project logic is to induce business investment the country team should fund a wtp survey of targeted businesses if the goal is primarily to increase supply of water in a country with relatively little problems with waterborne diseases and time spent collecting water a wtp survey of households may be more appropriate country economists should be aware that a random sample of households will contain business owners so if wtp of both households and businesses is desired a well designed wtp household survey may suffice note that the lack of a market for a good has not stopped mcc from finding revealed preferences approaches in the past if there is no piped water system expenditures on bottled water or estimates of the value of time spent gathering water can be used instead of a contingent valuation survey often the compact development timeline does not allow enough time for a proper cv study to be performed before an investment decision must be made finally even if the willingness to pay approach is used mcc s economic analysis will attempt to understand the nature of the underlying benefit streams to what extent is the willingness to pay a measure of what would be used by firms for productive uses versus expanded use by consumers or for improving health and or the convenience of access these distinctions are important for mcc s beneficiary analysis to forecast the expected beneficiary impact and to ensure that externalities are properly taken into account without double counting benefit stream lower costs of water lower costs of water are included as benefit streams in many mcc wash projects lower costs occur primarily when an existing water transmission and distribution network is rehabilitated to reduce physical losses e g leaks as distinct from non physical losses e g theft in such cases the recommended methodology is to estimate the volume of water that will be saved due to the reduction in physical losses and assign to it the per unit price of water charged to customers if there is a regulatory agency that ensures that any cost savings are passed on to the project s beneficiaries then these cost savings can be captured by consumers in other cases the savings will tend to accrue to the utility and may improve its financial position sustainability and ability to improve service in the future this points to the potential need to address institutional reform in cases where the utility is determined to be unable to sustain service improvements or pass cost savings to customers the country team should recommend which reforms are needed to deliver the project s intended results and whether additional external support is required to achieve the project s objectives using conditionality conditions precedent to establish a regulatory agency for example to ensure cost reflective tariffs sufficient for maintenance overhead and capital expansion is unlikely on its own to successfully address governance failures in the sector if the benefits of the project are primarily increased profits for the utility then the economist should be careful to identify the project beneficiaries as the shareholders of the utility and not the utility s customers the need for accompanying policy and institutional reform is discussed further below in cases where customers are connected for the first time to a water utility the reduction in cost manifests primarily as a reduction in time spent gathering water or expenditures on bottled or delivered water the recommended methodology in this instance is to deduct the estimated cost of utility bills from the time savings or delivered water expenditures for a net reduction in cost for the beneficiary the benefits of improving water quality can include savings on fuel that had been used for boiling water or investments in household treatment systems and consumables these can include purchase of charcoal gas time spent to gather firewood purchase and upkeep of household filters and purchase of chlorination chemicals 4 estimation of mcc wash project costs a crucial assumption on the cost side for mcc cba is expected future maintenance practices with and without the project typically mcc is asked to build wash infrastructure where maintenance in the past was poor and infrastructure was allowed to depreciate prematurely the purpose of maintenance is to sustain an asset s efficiency as illustrated in the following figure energy savings in industrial water pumping systems page 9 typically in the without project baseline we use a realistic business as usual assumption regarding how quickly assets and service levels will deteriorate in the future basing this on past maintenance and partial replacement practices with the associated maintenance costs included being those necessary to sustain the current status quo if there is no reason to expect a change business as usual maintenance and asset management and other aspects of utility performance would also be assumed in the with project scenario the without project scenario should not assume that similar improvements under the proposed project will take place anyhow in a few years under alternative funding this is because it is the project itself not the source of funding which is being analyzed in a cba when wash infrastructure is improved another potential source of higher costs is higher rents charged to tenants in buildings with improved plumbing the associated decrease in affordability can have adverse consequences for the targeted beneficiaries e g the improved infrastructure assets can lead to higher property rents benefitting property owners but forcing renters to move the project design and beneficiary analysis should take note of affordability issues and provide alternatives for addressing them even if there is no efficiency issue 5 detailed estimation of project benefits revealed preferences is a standard methodology described in most cba textbooks and is not reproduced here citations provided above for stated preferences methods may also be useful the revealed preferences method tends to be more consistent with mcc s evidence based approach than the stated preferences methodology in this section when and whether to use cs methodologies is discussed using consumer surplus methods both revealed and stated preferences to estimate benefits of increased consumption of a good in a cost benefit analysis is standard cba practice as mentioned in mcc cba guidelines changes in consumer surplus that represent a simple transfer from producers are not counted as a benefit consistent with standard cba practice regarding transfers from one economic actor to another mcc s cba guidelines specify that the goal of mcc projects is to promote growth in real incomes because growth in income is how we achieve the goals in our authorizing legislation to promote economic growth and reduce extreme poverty when it can mcc economists make a conscious effort to measure changes in real incomes rather than welfare as measured by consumer surplus sometimes cs methods are the best way to approximate real income changes and in some instances cs methods are the only way to estimate benefits at all in wash projects consumer surplus methods can capture cost savings on baseline coping costs other than time spent collecting water and quality of life and aesthetic benefits from the increased quantity of water supplied by a project when such benefits are expected to be significant cs methods may be appropriate however when the main component of quality of life benefits are for leisure purposes like taking showers such benefits might be considered less relevant to mcc s mission of reducing extreme poverty cs methods can also capture the benefits of small scale productive use of water like in subsistence agriculture which may be useful depending on the project indirect benefits through induced investment when increased supply of water can reasonably be expected to induce greater production employment and or investment vis à vis the without project case and data exists to estimate the appropriate values it is acceptable to include these induced benefits assumptions would remain conservative and the degree of induced economic activity would depend upon findings of a constraints analysis as well as the specific context in the country for instance whether other constraints that appear binding are being addressed wash policy and institutional reform pir topics one of mcc s lessons learned from past projects is that most major infrastructure projects require an associated policy institutional reform pir project to ensure that the utility is well managed and asset maintenance improves evaluating the need for improvement in the asset maintenance regime is now standard for due diligence of any proposed infrastructure project see economic analysis of policy and institutional reform programs position paper and recommendations for mcc management internal ea guidance when a pir project has been deemed a necessary component of the project then it is considered a required condition for achieving the long run benefits of the overall project and therefore its costs are included in the overall project costs economists will in cases where it is feasible to do so explicitly separate out the costs and benefits of pir components to calculate a separate err complementarity of benefits being accounted for where relevant in the overall err however regardless of whether this is the case economists will need to assess based on the available evidence and experience the likely trajectory of service and benefits using realistic assumptions regarding both the with and without project scenarios there is some evidence that governance reforms are central to sustaining improved performance in the water and sanitation sector and that in particular private sector participation and independent regulation result in improved sustainability quality of service costs of service and investment levels see andrès et al 2013 serious discussion about this and other evidence the context and the problems faced in the sector should be part of compact development to ensure that mcc investments are cost effective and that impacts are sustained according to mcc s sustainability guidelines the country team should engage in a discussion of assumptions and risks that threaten the sustainability of the project s results the team economist should ensure that the team considers pir issues in this discussion several questions should be considered regarding the potential need for pir investment if the mcc project is building a large infrastructure asset this is an opportunity for mcc to ask questions about how the asset came to be needing building replacement in the first place the three main variables to consider in pir for a wash project is tariff levels physical losses and commercial losses for a water utility charged with maintaining a water network is the tariff set at a level where the utility can recover the costs of repairing existing infrastructure and to cover expected future expansions of the network is the fiscal outlook for the utility sound with a sustainable debt level and capacity to service it are liabilities of the public utility recognized in the government s debt management strategy as quasi fiscal liabilities of the public sector overall does the utility track the location and age of its assets and have a maintenance replacement plan for them what is the rate of physical and commercial losses does the utility track these figures is there an acceptable level of losses written into the tariff setting analysis by the utility s regulator how was that level arrived at are there institutional customers who refuse to pay utility bills because of their political power does the government set aside funds to pay the utility bills of these institutions does the utility have political legal standing to sue the government for non payment who owns the utility is it government owned a ppp privately owned other is the owner of the utility invested in its sustainability would fundamental changes to the owners incentives e g privatization or establishment of a locally elected governing body incentivize the utility s owner to be more invested in its sustainability it should be noted that there is no reason the issue of addressing implicit subsidies must be accompanied by an infrastructure project improving the commercial viability of a water utility can be a standalone project if the proposed changes are politically difficult adding an infrastructural piece to the project may give the compact country additional political leverage to sell the necessary changes some wash projects mcc has worked on involve significant physical losses reducing physical losses has the same effect as reducing costs per unit of water supplied and can be analyzed from a cost reduction perspective however physical losses that reach a certain extreme extent say greater than 50 are an indicator of significant institutional weakness such high levels of losses will almost certainly be accompanied by either explicit or implicit subsidization other wash projects have involved utilities with significant commercial losses a commercial loss is when a utility sends water through its network to someone who consumes the water but does not pay for it while the immediate resulting net welfare is the same as the case without theft the cost of producing the water is the same and the consumer s marginal welfare from consuming the water is the same the transfer of revenue from the utility to the consumer harms the long run financial sustainability of the utility which is often the root cause of the utility s problems ea is currently developing a methodology for measuring the benefit to long run sustainability that results from the reduction of commercial losses in addition to assumptions captured in the project logic teams should spend some time brainstorming additional implicit assumptions and risks pertinent to the sustainability of compact investments including risk mitigation options we do our best to enter into implementation with comprehensive project logics but it is important to validate our design assumptions at the outset and confirm that we have not missed any major opportunities to build greater sustainability into our designs the five pillar model of sustainability can be a good starting place for this task some additional questions to consider are sequencing for projects with activities and sub activities that build on one another what is the potential impact of delays in implementation how will a one month or six month delay affect the overall sequencing of the compact what will the impact be on sustainability behavior change to what degree does post compact maintenance of compact interventions rely on behavior change both in terms of infrastructure investments and non infrastructure investments whose continued action will be necessary to achieve compact results by ced will those individuals have or have acquired the necessary skills resources and incentives to continue taking action after the compact has ended uptake if beneficiaries do not choose to connect to the water network how will this impact compact results if we are assuming uptake will continue to increase after compact end date who will be responsible for continuing to promote uptake among the target of the intervention will that entity have the necessary capacity and resources to do so the question of behavior change and uptake are well understood in mcc now to be critical to achieving project outcomes where key benefit streams depend for example on people financing household connections to the water sewer or electricity grid the affordability of connections for local beneficiaries is paramount in other cases behavior change around using new facilities e g shifting water supply sources civic attitudes to trash disposal or awareness of proper hygiene practices to prevent the spread of water borne disease are critical to achieving project outcomes most projects targeting community level services will require explicit attention to behavior change and uptake uncertainty many of the parameters used to inform wash cba are subject to significant uncertainty mcc s cba guidelines require ea economists to perform monte carlo analysis of errs based on simulations around key parameters that are subject to significant uncertainty as identified by the economist uncertainty can be increased markedly and arbitrarily simply by choosing a large number of variables so the choice of parameters to simulate over is best kept parsimonious and relevant if the distribution is roughly symmetric and unimodal economists should report the most likely err the mode of the distribution in addition to the probability of it falling below the hurdle rate of return if the distribution approximates a bimodal one for example with or without success in achieving pir either an expected value err could be reported or two errs with an if then statement where the scenarios are well specified for wash cba the list of variables subject to uncertainty includes for health benefits wages disease incidence reduction take up of connections to new infrastructure behavior change e g switching from outdoor defecation to latrines or indoor wcs or using toilets as garbage cans other parameters to consider population of the study area if no recent census has been performed case fatality rates and baseline diarrhea incidence for time savings wages time spent collecting water for cost savings technical commercial loss reduction elasticity of demand for water for pir time path and probability of success sustainability of political commitment to program as defined by the world bank a public private partnership ppp is a long term arrangement in which a private party assumes some authority over a government asset or agrees to provide a service for a government entity while bearing a significant share of the risk for the project s outcome a ppp should therefore be viewed as distinct from privatization in which the government relinquishes control or ownership of an asset entirely the wash sector is dominated by goods that are near public goods water and disease resistance are common pool resources and the heavy infrastructure requirements cause the provision of water and sanitation to be provided through natural monopolies these goods can be traded in markets but not efficiently often privatization is not a politically acceptable option an additional complication in the wash sector arises because access to water is often viewed as a human right and the tariff is often set at or near zero productive efficiency of public private partnerships and the manila water concessions under the right circumstances ppps can help with these problems the private sector has inevitable incentives to reduce costs and collect revenue both issues which state owned enterprises struggle to match but these improved incentives must be balanced against the ability of the contracting authority to enforce provisions of the contract which requires contract enforcement and procurement capacity that is often not present in developing countries the case of the manila water concessions illustrates these issues well in the late 1990 s the manila water utility mwss agreed to separate concession arrangements with two consortia operating the eastern manila water and western halves maynilad of its network the two concessionaires each offered tariffs below the initial cost recovery tariff level while agreeing to concession fees large enough to cover the utility s debt service despite identical initial conditions the experiences of the two concessionaires diverged massively manila water was able to keep tariffs low while reducing non revenue water nrw more quickly than contractually required yet continues to operate profitably maynilad was somewhat slower to invest initially after the asian financial crisis maynilad tried to raise tariffs to cover increases in the concession fee resulting in rate shocks which decreased public trust as a result maynilad never invested as heavily in its network as manila water and eventually its network was renationalized following bankruptcy while there may be many causes of maynilad s failure one clear cause was likely the poor risk allocation for these partnerships which in turn is a failure of manila s low procurement capacity manila water s initial investments were already sunk by the time concession fees were raised leaving it with strong incentives to continue network investments appendix mcc

had broken down significantly leading to clean water being provided only a few hours each day households were forced to fill reservoirs with water during the times water was available because

ghana was designed to complement the agriculture project by providing water infrastructure in the mcc project areas and enhance the capacity of local governments to deliver water services mcc funding was used to fund boreholes both mechanized and hand pumped small town pipe systems pipe extensions and community sanitary facilities the main benefits of the project are improved health reduction in the incidence of illness and loss of productivity due to unsafe drinking water and poor consumer sanitation and hygiene and to reduce the time required to procure potable water time savings benefits were valued at half the minimum wage and calculated as the reduction in time spent fetching water per day as derived from local household surveys health savings were calculated as a reduction in

sanitation sub activity the sub activity designed and constructed potable water systems e g wells and pumps in more than 20 communities a large portion of the population in the northern zone of el salvador lacked access to clean piped water the mcc project expanded water access as households had previously used either trucked water wells or river water the installation of piped water access provided benefits through decreased costs reduced time spent gathering water and reduced disease rates cost savings were calculated from a northern zone 2008 household survey on water source and expenditures time savings were taken from the same survey s data on time spent gathering water by source time was valued at half the minimum wage link to el salvador i errs lesotho the lesotho water sector project is aimed at improving water supply for industrial and domestic needs it consists of an urban and a rural sub activity the urban sub activity was designed to extend and rehabilitate the urban and peri urban water network including extending reticulation to the towns of semonkong and augmenting supply to the town of mazenod the rural sub activity was designed to improve water supplies and provide ventilated improved pit latrines to small rural settlements the benefits for the urban sub activity consisted of four main streams i time saved in water collection ii time saved in obtaining medical treatment for water related illnesses iii reduced mortality for children under 5 due to water related illnesses and iv increases in investment due to greater water availability the analysis calculated the value of time saved on the basis of an estimate of the urban population currently affected by underdeveloped or disrupted water service this figure 40 percent corresponds to the portion of the urban population not having piped in house water supplies although one could also expect that a portion of existing in house customers were experiencing deteriorating water service frequency and water quality allowing for urban population growth the analysis estimated an increasing level of time spent collecting water to represent the deterioration in existing infrastructure and anticipated difficulties in providing full service accommodation for an expanding urban population the value of time freed for productive activity through the convenience of improved water supply is qualified by the likelihood of employment for urban men and women it was assumed here that project investments will lead to a halving of the time that would be spent in water collection over time private sector investment to utilize the improved availability and reliability of water in urban areas was also considered relying in part on results produced in the economic growth modeling for lesotho recently undertaken by the world bank estimation of the private sector response is based on an assumed relationship between infrastructure and private investment and the ratio of value added to incremental investment link to lesotho errs tanzania the mcc activities were focused in two regions of tanzania in dar es salaam the lower ruvu plant expansion expanded the capacity of the lower ruvu water treatment plant and the non revenue water activity was intended to significantly reduce physical and commercial water losses in the dar es salaam system in morogoro mcc rehabilitated and upgraded two water treatment plants there and had planned to improve the existing distribution network in tanzania a large portion of the population lacked access to clean piped water furthermore water supply could not fully satisfy business demand for water in those areas with access the mcc wash project sought to expand water access for residential households and increase the water supply and therefore the duration of water access per day to some commercial districts in the residential districts benefits included time and health savings for households since clean piped water takes less time to gather than well or river water and reduces the frequency of waterborne illnesses time savings were valued at half the minimum wage while health savings were valued at the reduction in dalys for commercial districts benefits were measured through a consumer surplus model based on the current price of water and an assumed linear demand curve link to tanzania errs mozambique in mozambique mcc expanded access to water and sanitation facilities in numerous towns and provided boreholes to provide clean water for rural households benefits were time savings valued at the average wage as shown through a consumption survey from 2006 and calculated as the reduction in time spent fetching water per day health savings were calculated as a reduction in morbidity and sick days also valued at the average wage through consumption surveys link to mozambique errs jordan the proposed compact program consists of three tightly integrated infrastructure projects that address critical problems in water distribution wastewater collection and wastewater treatment the projects are focused in zarqa governorate home to the country s second and fourth largest cities zarqa and ruseifa and to the majority of the country s small scale industry the zarqa governorate water network restructuring and rehabilitation project water network project is designed to reduce high water losses by repairing and upgrading transmission and distribution pipes throughout zarqa and ruseifa the project includes direct assistance to poor households to improve plumbing water storage sewage connections and general awareness of best practices for sanitation and water efficiency the wastewater network reinforcement and expansion project wastewater network project is designed to rehabilitate sewer main lines that are nearing capacity and extend service to approximately 18 000 households for a total of 100 000 people that are not currently connected to the sewer network this will improve wastewater services prevent potentially harmful overflows of raw sewage and capture additional quantities of wastewater for eventual reuse in agriculture downstream in the jordan valley the as samra wastewater treatment plant expansion project as samra expansion project is designed to expand the capacity of the existing as samra wastewater treatment plant by an additional 97 800 cubic meters per day an increase of more than one third which is projected to be sufficient to meet the wastewater treatment needs of large populations in amman and zarqa governorates at least through 2025 benefits from the water network project are based on improvements in the efficiency of water supplied to the region s urban population at present most households receive water through the public water network only once or twice per week and many purchase bottled water or tanker truck water to supplement their consumption repairs that make more water available through the public network should allow many consumers to reduce their reliance on these costly sources of additional water thus reducing household expenditures on water or allowing increased water consumption without changes in cost reductions in water losses also mean that the region s limited water supply could serve its growing population over a longer period effectively shifting the water supply curve outward the principal benefits from the wastewater network project and the as samra expansion project accrue from increased efficiency in the use of available surface water particularly in agriculture which consumes a large share of water resources in an effort to prioritize municipal and industrial users the goj has invested heavily in collection treatment and conveyance systems that free up fresh water used in irrigated agriculture and replace it with high quality treated wastewater link to jordan errs cabo verde ii the cabo verde ii wash project has three components 1 national institutional and regulatory reform activity 2 utility reform activity and 3 wash infrastructure financing activity the national level reform is designed to improve planning for maintenance and infrastructure improvements and also to ensure that

infrastructure in another and improve the drainage system in a third region rehabilitating the central water system and extending the water supply infrastructure will reduce the need for women and children to spend time collecting water either because of intermittent water outages or lack of connection to the central water infrastructure increased access to clean water should also reduce the incidence of water borne disease primarily infectious diarrhea improving the central water system will also reduce leaks and institutional reforms particularly installing pre paid meters should reduce the accumulation of arrears and improve the overall collections ratio improved financial performance of the zambia utility should lead to lower water costs for the project s beneficiaries the drainage project will reduce the incidence of disease by reducing pedestrian exposure to contaminated flood waters health impacts are measured in the err by estimating the reduction in dalys lost to disease valued at the average lusaka wage discounted by the overall urban lusaka unemployment rate time savings for women and children carrying water is valued at the average women s wage in urban lusaka discounted by the urban lusaka unemployment rate for women cost reductions in water production are measured by the billable value of the reduction in commercial and non commercial losses the zambia err also estimates the value of reduced property damage and value added for businesses as a result of the drainage project although the value of these benefit streams is very small about 1 of overall benefits the original err for the drainage project estimated significant benefits from reduction of malaria incidence however when more disaggregated data became available for lusaka proper it was discovered that the incidence of malaria there was almost zero about 5 per thousand instead of the originally estimated 120 and accordingly the benefits from reduced exposure to malaria were reduced

the purposes of the err we need the difference in probability of being stunted with and without exposure to diarrhea as an infant i e we need p stunted diarrhea and p stunted no diarrhea in zambia we know the overall prevalence rate of diarrhea 0 483 almost half of all children will have diarrhea during the course of a year we know the overall prevalence rate of stunting in zambia is 0 372 we also know the odds ratio of teshome et al 2 289 we therefore have enough information to calculate the probability of stunting conditional on diarrhea exposure the joint probability of stunting given exposure to diarrhea is 11 1 1 11 joint probability stunted not stunted diarrhea 0 227 0 256 no diarrhea 0 145 0 372 probability of stunting conditional on diarrhea exposure stunted not stunted diarrhea 0 471 0 529 no diarrhea 0 280 0 720 we use this core parameter to estimate the reduction in the number of stunting cases that would result from the anticipated reduction in incidence of infectious diarrhea resulting from the project if the intervention reduces cases of diarrhea by 42 then the number of cases of diarrhea among young children will decline from 483 to 280 per 1000 thus the chance of stunting for 203 out of 1000 children goes down 19 in other words we expect the number of stunting cases to decline by 203 0 19 38 6 per thousand of young beneficiaries aged 0 5 impacted now we must assign a dollar value to each stunting case prevented the definition of stunting is growth that is two standard deviations below the worldwide mean according to who alderman et al 2006 found that a one standard deviation decline in height is associated with entering school half a year later thus delaying entry into the workforce they also found that the average number of grades attained declines by 0 74 consequently a child who is two standard deviations below the mean in terms of height should enter the workforce one year later and attain 1 5 years less schooling with a mincer regression in hand that assigns values to earnings associated with these increments we can estimate the effect on lifetime earnings associated with one incident of stunting equation one below is an example of a mincer equation showing the returns to years of education and experience exp respectively equation one sample mincer equation ln annual salary 1000 if the average worker has 5 years of education and 15 years of experience the salary of the average worker will be 1000 exp 10 000 the annual salary of an otherwise average worker who suffers from stunting will be 1000 exp 7 800 nb each year after the intervention a certain number of stunting cases will be eliminated therefore the benefits of the intervention in a given year is the pdv of the lifetime earnings saved by preventing each case of stunting that year in the above example discounting the average savings of 2 200 over a 45 year working life yields a pdv at 10 discount rate of 21 100 if 1000 of the 10 000 beneficiaries are aged 0 5 then the total benefit from reduced incidence of stunting in a given year will be 38 6 21 100 814 460 acknowledgements
the once fringe fantasy of a return to the gold standard is creeping back into the mainstream it has long been dismissed as a fool s errand on par with abandoning the federal reserve and other trappings of the modern economy mainstream economists deride it almost without exception reintroducing the gold standard would be a disaster for any large advanced economy says the university of chicago s anil kashyap who connects enthusiasm for it with macroeconomic illiteracy his colleague nobel laureate richard thaler struggles with its very underlying principle why tie to gold why not 1982 bordeaux advertisement yet the idea that every us dollar should be backed by a small amount of actual gold is more popular than economists opinions might suggest advocates include members of congress and president donald trump enthusiasm for a return to the gold standard has become more prominent since trump s most recent nominees to fill the vacant federal reserve governorship have endorsed a return the first two herman cain and stephen moore both dropped out of consideration but the third economist judy shelton announced today in a trump tweet may be the most ardent in her support last year shelton called for a new bretton woods conference akin to the 1944 meeting that established the post war economic order perhaps to be held at mar a lago where a return to the gold standard could be considered we make america great again by making america s money great again she wrote in the journal of the cato institute a libertarian think tank since 2011 at least six states have passed laws recognizing gold and silver as currency another three are presently contemplating bills of their own the surprising success of ron paul a texas republican congressman and ardent gold bug in the 2008 and 2012 elections showed the potency of these ideas among the electorate in its 2012 and 2016 campaign platforms the republican party called for a commission to investigate the viability of a return to a gold standard system the republican controlled house of representatives passed a bill including such a commission in both 2015 and 2017 but both times the proposals died in the senate last year alexander mooney a republican representative from west virginia took that a step further when he introduced a bill proposing a full on return to the gold standard the bill has no cosponsors and unsurprisingly has gone nowhere advertisement today with inflation unusually low and stable the gold standard is a tougher sell than it once was but as trust in american institutions wanes there is renewed support for money backed by something tangible not the say so of the government if inflation picks up once again a solid base of gold standard evangelists is ready to take it mainstream that a supporter of the gold standard may yet wind up on the fed s board of governors is yet more evidence that the idea s prospects are shining brighter than they have in many years how the gold standard works money depends on trust the faith that it will hold its value so that when the time comes to spend it it will be accepted without question in exchange for what the holder expects it to be worth inflation eats away at that value in modern times governments are often a culprit behind inflation since they enjoy a monopoly on printing money they can issue new currency at virtually no cost but governments are run by vote seeking politicians who might print more money to juice short term growth needed to win re election inadvertently causing inflation to flare up later this quandary isn t theoretical and has happened with surprising frequency throughout history to cite a recent prominent example us president richard nixon bent to this temptation pdf during his 1972 re election campaign contributing to the breakout of inflation that ravaged the american economy throughout the 1970s and early 1980s there s a seemingly easy fix take the power of money creation out of the hands of politicians according to the monetarist theory popularized by economist milton friedman in the 1970s preventing inflation requires fixing the supply of money the gold standard by limiting the dollars the government can print to the weight of gold it holds in reserves is one way of doing so advertisement the us adopted the gold standard in 1879 when congress finally followed britain germany france and other advanced nations by holding national currencies stable against gold the international embrace of the gold standard encouraged foreign investment and facilitated trade giving rise to the first era of intense globalization here s a very cartoonish version of how it worked the us treasury agreed to redeem a set weight of gold in exchange for a fixed number of dollars and vice versa during the classical gold standard era from 1879 to 1914 in the us one troy ounce of gold fetched 21 the gold standard s discipline came from the fact that the government had to be sure it held the necessary volume of gold in reserve in case anyone wanted to exchange dollars for a set amount of the shiny metal if it printed more money than it held in gold reserves the state risked hyperinflation or causing a financial crisis by shattering faith in the solidity of its currency in theory the gold standard therefore limits government spending to only what it can raise in taxes or borrow against its gold reserve and prevents it from simply printing money to pay its debts it also takes power over the money supply away from central bankers indeed it might render central banks mostly unnecessary bear in mind that for most of the classical gold standard era the us didn t have a central bank which was introduced in 1913 advertisement but why gold had history worked out differently the dollar might have been pegged to cowrie shells peppercorns or giant stone disks all of which like gold have served as money at one time or another but for reasons both aesthetic and practical the glimmering metal became the asset of choice the simple answer to that is that for the last 5 000 years so far as we are aware man has used gold and silver as money and particularly gold says alasdair macleod the head of research at goldmoney a toronto based investment manager for precious metals it s durable people respect that it s got value it s actually as simple as that it is something which markets should be free to choose and they have chosen gold markets should be free to choose and they have chosen gold gold is integral to the story of us growth and prosperity in the 19th century discoveries of subterranean veins in at least 24 states were rungs in a ladder that culminated in america s economic domination of the globe prompting westward migration and economic expansion writes james ledbetter in one nation under gold how one precious metal has dominated the american imagination for four centuries it is a national emblem of wealth and streets paved with gold served as a myth that helped lure many migrants to the us from the very beginnings of our national life it has seemed impossible for americans to look at gold dispassionately ledbetter explains the metal and its seductive hint of boundless wealth tap into a psychological wellspring that reaches beyond any purely physical qualities legislation in the past century which codified and restricted how americans could attain or trade gold seems to have intensified the longing for it in 1933 americans were temporarily barred from buying and selling gold within the country by the 1950s the law was still in place and a black market for gold flourished john f kennedy was anxious that the dollar should be as good as gold operation goldfinger which launched a few years later was a top secret government campaign to dig up gold within us territories as quickly as possible with the hope of propping up a post war economy expanding at a pace that threatened to outstrip the world s supply of the metal advertisement the gold standard is inextricably tied to mining the supply of the metal depends on how much is extracted from the earth after all but since mining only adds a tiny fraction to the overall stock of gold each year prices don t fluctuate as wildly as they used to in the height of mining activity in the mid 1800s big gold discoveries in california and australia spurred a pickup in inflation then as economic growth outpaced the rate of new gold discoveries a 20 year period of deflation set in it ended with new discoveries in south africa and the yukon as well as technological advances in gold processing that s how things are supposed to work when a gold shortage causes purchasing power to rise steadily mining companies are encouraged to find more gold and indeed overall prices and real economic activity during the classical gold standard era was remarkably stable pdf if you look at the us during its classical gold standard period the average rate of inflation is pretty close to zero and likewise in great britain over its experience with the gold standard says lawrence white an economics professor at george mason university and one of the few respected economists who s pro gold standard gold standard adherents often extol the strength of currencies such as the pound and the dollar in the early 20th century modern central banking they say has knocked the stuffing out of these once mighty currencies the fact that average hourly wages have mostly been adjusted to match the rise in inflation doesn t seem to factor into the equation where mainstream economists see constraint goldbugs see discipline a government that cannot spend beyond its means and a hedge against corruption for those who believe in small limited government there is obvious appeal believers credit it with a kind of midas touch the gold standard necessarily begets balanced budgets low taxes small government and a healthy economy to borrow the words of economist barry eichengreen a prominent historian of currencies at the university of california berkeley advertisement it didn t quite deliver the kind of nirvana that people now talk about the thing is economic success during the classical gold standard era depends somewhat on the eye of the beholder david laidler a monetary historian at western university in ontario and friedman s research assistant in the 1960s says the gold standard wasn t as effortlessly successful as the data might suggest i m not going to tell you that the gold standard didn t function in the 19th century it did but it didn t quite deliver the kind of nirvana that people now talk about he says for some americans its effects were downright devastating after the us adopted the gold standard in the 1870s price levels of agricultural commodities fell continuously for nearly 20 years crushing american farmers under the weight of their debts and punishing interest rates the resulting political upheaval culminated in william jennings bryan s famous cross of gold speech his tirade against how deflation caused by the gold standard was ravaging rural america advertisement questions of money are always political and often a zero sum choice between which economic class will prosper and which will suffer inflation erodes the value of financial assets hurting savers but helping borrowers deflation benefits those with wealth and punishes debtors eventually the latter group the masses whose standard of living relies on mortgages and other forms of debt tends to win out why aren t we on the gold standard now the classical gold standard era ended with world war i because to fund wars governments have to print a lot of money in these conditions maintaining gold convertibility goes out the window after the war ended the us and most other advanced economies scrambled to re peg their currencies to gold but for a host of reasons for example the overvaluation of the pound and several other key currencies and the decline of britain as an imperial power the gold standard failed to deliver the stability of the earlier era many economists argue it amplified the shocks of the great depression particularly in the us and france which waited longer than their trading partners to abandon convertibility it was for this reason that john maynard keynes the great british economist called the gold standard a barbarous relic unsurprisingly the post world war ii monetary system of which keynes was a key architect made the us dollar the basis of world reserves the dollar itself was still convertible into gold however other global currencies fixed their exchange rates not to gold but to the dollar when richard nixon took office in the late 1960s the us government was again spending heavily due to the vietnam war and the social welfare programs launched by his predecessor lyndon johnson that effectively pushed down the value of the dollar in 1971 to stave off a run on us gold reserves nixon halted convertibility meaning that other countries could no longer redeem dollars for gold under intensifying pressure in 1973 the president scrapped the gold standard altogether advertisement prices started climbing exacerbated by nixon s strong arming of the fed to keep rates low as the 1970s wore on and inflation surged gold found support among the likes of ronald reagan who talked it up on the campaign trail during the 1980 presidential election by june 1980 prices for consumer goods were rising 14 annually galvanizing public support for sound money after trouncing jimmy carter reagan set up a commission to determine whether to revive the gold standard nixon had promised and perhaps believed that the us would eventually return to the gold standard reagan s victory made that look possible likely even but many of the president s appointees to the commission were longtime opponents of the system among the exceptions was a certain young texas congressman named ron paul then came the volcker shock when fed chairman paul volcker hiked rates to their highest levels in history to curb runaway inflation which thrust the economy into a deep recession crucially though inflation dropped sharply and the commission put the official kibosh pdf on a return to a fixed metallic standard with inflation finally tamed gold s moment was over fiat currency managed by central bankers had officially won out advertisement gone but not forgotten this abandonment represents a betrayal to a few distinct but often overlapping groups people who believe in limited government people who interpret the american constitution literally and people who fear the power of central banks wall street and other financial institutions advocates of the gold standard point to the fact that because there is no way to redeem paper dollars for gold or silver there is no way to finally pay a debt one common fear is that investors will stop buying us treasury bonds ultimately resulting in financial ruin for the country it is impossible to overstate the calamity that will occur when the treasury bond collapses their concerns can run to the hyperbolic it is impossible to overstate the calamity that will occur when the treasury bond collapses stresses the homepage of the arizona based gold standard institute a peripheral non profit dedicated to spreading awareness and knowledge of gold on our current course we will wake up one morning and find that our bank accounts are wiped out it warns even if we have dollar bills in our pockets food will not last in stores for very long because food production and distribution depends on the banking system advertisement some argue returning to the gold standard is a legal imperative there is a basis in the us constitution for this at once specific and quite vague sections 8 and 10 of article i state that congress has the power to coin money regulate the value thereof and of foreign coin while no state shall make any thing but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts it s entirely possible that this was supposed to guarantee convertibility between state currencies rather than asserting anything intrinsic to gold but these two mentions in the country s founding document have served as ammunition for constitutionalists including groups such as the far right john birch society established in 1958 the society whose views align closely with trump s supports the disestablishment of the fed and a return to the gold standard on the grounds that the constitution does not give congress the right to delegate its money related powers elsewhere nor to use any currency that is not gold or silver backed the midas touch but if there are various arguments for a return to the gold standard there are many more reasons to reject it nearly 50 years into using fiat currency at a floating exchange rate a total overhaul of america s entrenched monetary policy framework is much less feasible advertisement for one thing says laidler of western university the rise over the past four decades of politically independent central banks has made it unnecessary that s because as long time fed chair alan greenspan told congress a central bank properly functioning will endeavor to in many cases replicate what a gold standard would itself generate plus constraining a central bank limits how easily it can adjust monetary policy to respond to economic conditions between 1879 and 1914 when the us adhered to the gold standard but had no central bank private clearinghouse associations played the lender of last resort role for member banks says white the george mason economist the world s financial system is now vastly bigger more complex more deeply integrated and more global than it was during the gold standard s heyday it s hard to imagine how anything less than a strong central authority could stave off for example the scale of market collapse that threatened the world in 2008 the us would derive minimal benefit from re adopting the gold standard unless other major economies did too however even then the system of fixed exchange rates created by gold convertibility has some big downsides while encouraging cross border investment and trade it also makes it extremely hard for governments to adjust to localized economic disruptions the struggles of the euro zone currency union offers a present day example of this drawback the gold standard could also push financial contagion to viral levels with the flow of gold and the fixed exchange rate forcing the suffering of one nation on everyone in the system gold makes a comeback despite the myriad reasons that a return to the gold standard seems impossible the dream remains alive in part because of the efforts of ron paul paul was first moved to run for office in 1976 in reaction to nixon scrapping gold standard a few years prior i remember the day very clearly he told texas monthly in 2001 nixon closed the gold window which meant admitting that we could no longer meet our commitments and that there would be no more backing of the dollar after that day all money would be political money rather than money of real value i was astounded advertisement paul s views were shaped in part by economist friedrich hayek s accounts of how the nazis effective abandonment of the gold standard allowed them to beef up fiscal spending in preparation for their war of conquest eichengreen wrote in national interest in 2011 paul subsequently spent most of his career as a vocal but lonely goldbug in congress he retired in 2013 these days mooney the west virginia congressman has taken up the mantle as one of gold s biggest cheerleaders ron paul s son rand a senator from kentucky is also a part of this club for mooney american eagle coins are the key to reviving the gold standard these collectibles are issued by the us mint and sold to numismatists for about 1 600 apiece despite having a face value of just 50 roughly the cost of an ounce of gold in the early 1970s some goldbugs see them as a symbol of what american money should be the disparity between the face value of these coins and the value of the gold used to make them captures how far the dollar has fallen in their minds though they are not us legal tender state law in utah allows them to be used as currency though it s an expensive way to get 50 of gas or groceries other state laws have mostly moved to lift taxes on them broadly recognizing them as money rather than collectibles on the order of baseball cards and beanie babies this taxation of money is a big beef for mooney and his allies advertisement if american eagle coins are a symbol of how degraded us currency has become for gold adherents a return to the gold standard seems like the best way to protect the dollar s value and and ensure it remains a bulwark against inflation it s probably no coincidence that the most recent resurgence of gold interest has come at a time of acute public anxiety about the stability of money the global financial system nearly blew up 10 years ago and was saved by unprecedented monetary activism by the federal reserve nobody knew what to expect from the fed s epic asset purchase program fears of weimar style hyperinflation in some corners proved fertile ground for the pro gold messages of paul and others who see salvation in gold paul s surprisingly successful grassroots presidential campaigns were further evidence that his message was gaining traction hyperinflation never happened but nor did other monetary fears recede notably government over reliance on debt while on occasion president trump has said that deficits don t matter the commander in chief credits the very very solid country of yesteryear with it being based on the gold standard in 2016 before his election trump suggested it might be time to stage a return bringing back the gold standard would be very hard to do but boy would it be wonderful we d have a standard on which to base our money this might be dismissed as a throwaway comment if not for trump s desire to put the likes of cain moore and now shelton on the fed board giving a goldbug a seat at the table to steer the most powerful country s monetary policy

gone too far in pricing in more than expected the european central bank in turn is sitting out for quite some time yet and has pledged to stay low then there s the bank of canada which some economists believe will simply hold its key overnight rate at 1 75 per cent well into the future others expect the bank of canada to cut possibly next year though there is a school of thought that suggests governor stephen poloz senior deputy governor carolyn wilkins and their colleagues will be more aggressive the world is faced with a yearning for stable return or better yet growth but it comes at a

does not go far enough mr brown said we expect the bank to cut interest rates three times starting in october he added we see little prospect of the bank raising interest rates again before 2022 low public debt means that there is ample scope for the federal government to loosen the purse strings if the economy slows as we expect there are obviously implications to all this for central banks and

when central bank independence is increasingly being questioned ms lagarde will probably lean to the dovish side but at a time when the central bank is running low on monetary policy levers to pull

by this past weekend june 29 2019 trump and china president xi met again at the g20 in japan in the midst of a potential further escalating trade war but the outcome looks eerily similar to that of the prior g20 meeting in buenos aires on december 2 2018 when trump and xi also met once more the same post g20 spin is in i e trump declares publicly he has such a great relationship with xi there s a great trade deal soon forthcoming between the two countries us and china trade teams will now begin to thrash out the details on the remaining 10 or so of us china trade differences in the interim once again trump announced he will withhold imposing more tariffs this time on an additional 325 billion of china imports to the us in other words coming out of the latest g20 it s almost an exact déjà vu all over again to the outcome which occurred at last december 2 2018 s g20 meeting between trump and xi in buenos aires will it be different this time will there by an agreement or will trump once again just be buying time i e until just before the 2020 elections until he sees china s economy softening further and he raises us demands further again or maybe trump and his neocon trade advisers lighthizer navarro bolton who are now driving us trade and most of us foreign policy don t want to compromise and will accept nothing less than china s capitulation on the nextgen technology issue that was at the core of the blow up of negotiations in may 2019 it s probably becoming increasingly clear to the chinese that the us did not just launch a tariff war back in march 2018 us policy is driving toward a bonafide economic war between the us and china longer term in the nearer term the current differences may well transform the tariff war into a currency war that will spread contagion and reverberate globally across other economies at a time at which the global capitalist economy is slowing fast and approaching as well a new financial instability all china has to do is allow its currency the yuan renminbi to devalue naturally in response to us policy and the slowing global economy that devaluation would more than offset us tariffs thus far china has intervened in global money exchange markets to prevent this but all it needs to do is allow it to occur according to prevailing economic and market forces and just not intervene in global money markets further to prop up the yuan that will become inevitable as the china us and global economy weaken further in coming months china doesn t have to manipulate its currency it only has to allow global market forces unleased in large part by trump policies to naturally devalue the yuan then there s china s 1 3 trillion of us assets mostly us treasuries it could slow its purchase of new us government debt which it appears it may now be doing should the tariff currency war intensify if necessary it could stop or even sell off its dollar hoard of us treasuries it s been moving toward that since september 2018 as its purchases of us securities first slowed and then declined in march 2019 that reduction of purchases if not offset by other economies buying more would drive up long term interest rates in the us and in turn the value of the us dollar still more all of which further slows global growth rising us rates and the dollar will likely precipitate another us stock and junk bond sell off similar to that which occurred late 2018 and we know trump doesn t like stock market declines there are numerous other actions the chinese could take in response to us neocons intensifying or prolonging the us china tariff trade war further driving the differences into a broader economic war various bureaucratic obstacles to us corporations majority ownership of operations in china buy china not america in china movements restrictions on the sale of what s called rare earths minerals key to technology and military production would likely be imposed even if us neocons don t understand this or don t care widespread business and banking interests do and could intervene more forcefully should trump s drift toward economic war continue economic slowdown recession wild card and there s a wild card in the trade war deck that may check the neocons influence perhaps that s the current softening of the us and china economies that could force both sides to an agreement trump may grab the major concessions on china purchases and us majority ownership rights in china and announce a big victory just before the 2020 us elections china s economy is clearly slowing growing likely no more than 4 5 not the official 6 5 but so too is the us economy as well which will start to become more obvious once the data for the 2nd quarter us gdp start to come in by late july the us 1st quarter gdp numbers were propped up by temporary factors associated with inventory over investment and net exports both of which are fading rapidly this quarter moreover us household consumer spending is barely growing most recently at less than 1 the housing sector has slowed for the past 17 months manufacturing orders and production is now stagnant and business investment has turned negative lagging indicators like jobs are now beginning to turn down as well the us central bank s lowering of interest rates in the second half of 2019 which is helping to drive the massive 1 5 trillion in stock buybacks and dividend payouts scheduled for this year may succeed in putting a temporary floor under stock markets but the real side of the us economy is being driven to slowdown or even worse by year end more bank research departments big finance capitalists and even some economists a notorious conservative and timid forecasting lot have begun to predict recession by year end 2019 a more rapidly slowing us economy now clearly beginning may thus change the trade negotiations dynamic forcing both sides to some kind of a deal and if the us slips into recession by winter 2019 20 which this writer has also been predicting the past year the pressure to cut a deal will grow trump may yet be convinced to take the china concessions already on the table and temporarily suspend the us demand for china s capitulation on the technology issue trump could yet take what s been offered by china i e to buy 1 trillion more us farm goods and allow us corporations majority ownership of operations in china and declare a major victory in the trade negotiations in 2020 just before the elections the nextgen tech military confrontation the real core of the us china dispute could be re raised and revisited thereafter later that s one possible scenario because for trump a deal is never a deal it s never concluded but subject to reopening whenever he so chooses breaking an agreement is standard practice for trump just ask the mexicans where trump recently threatened to levy 25 more tariffs even after us concluding a new nafta 2 0 deal last year or ask the iranians who thought they had an agreement with the us or the europeans who thought they had a climate deal for trump negotiations are a continuing process punctuated by happy talk events stroking foreign leaders followed by more threats of sanctions and personal insults and intimidations to force a reopening of deals once thought concluded by trading partners allied and challengers alike in other words even if a china us trade deal is done perhaps next year the trade war with china will not be over it will have just begun as it evolves toward a broader economic war after the 2020 elections perhaps even before the key to a china trade deal occurring sooner rather than later is whether trump and us big bankers and multinational capitalists can convince the neocons and the military industrial complex to agree to a short term deal with china now that provides only token nextgen technology concessions backed by the trump neocon assurance that the us will reopen and resume the technology offensive after the 2020 elections once again for the us economic and political elites are in basic agreement with the neocons behind the trump daily circus on the nextgen technology issue neither will allow china to challenge us global hegemony next decade by leveraging nextgen technologies that are the key to both economic and military hegemony it s just a question of timing by the us elites trump neocons take two bites of the bargaining apple from the chinese and come back later for the big bite i e the fight over nextgen technology either that or trump and the neocons will continue to insist on three bites all at once this writer s guess and prediction is that the now slowing us and global economy will result in the former and the us will reopen any deal reached and renew its technology demands after the 2020 elections for the current tariff trade war is just the opening salvo in an epic struggle between the us and china the technology war has already begun albeit in early stages the trump trade war today is just the opening move today to a more fundamental technology war tomorrow historical precedents just as european and american imperialists jockeyed and maneuvered in the years leading up to 1914 and the first world war with their focus on disputes over markets and global natural resource control in the 21st century the jockeying and maneuvering has similarly begun albeit this time with a different focus on nextgen technologies over who controls global money flows whose currency will continue to dominant over who calls the shots in global institutions like the imf world bank wto and so on the 2020s decade ahead will prove a highly dangerous period the global capitalist economy is slowing as has always done periodically a new restructuring of global capitalism is on the agenda as it was in the late 1970s in the mid 1940s and during the years immediately leading up to 1914 trump s trade wars and other policies should be understood as part of a broad reordering of us economic and political policies and relations with other nation states allied and adversary alike to ensure the continuation of us global economic and military hegemony for the coming decade nextgen technology development is at the core of that restructuring and restoration of us hegemony trump is just the appearance the historic vehicle behind the deeper global capitalist transformation in progress
contrary to what the parliamentarians are claiming the landlord and tenant bill 2019 as it is in no way protects the small trader or tenant actually it has just made their situation worse by making them more prone and susceptible to the consequences of a weakening shilling and arbitrary rent increments writes judy rugasira kyanda parliament has just passed the landlord and tenant bill 2019 in its original form despite several pleas from landlords tenants and the financial sector so what does this mean moving on before the bill s passing i laboured to explain the dire consequences if no amendments were made for the record and avoidance of doubt i will reiterate some of the points i raised in that article i am a proponent of legislation good legislation that will enable a strong and stable property market by encouraging and attracting local and foreign investment creating employment in this sector and growing our tax revenue and economy ultimately contrary to what the parliamentarians are claiming the bill as it is in no way protects the small trader or tenant actually it has just made their situation worse by making them more prone and susceptible to the consequences of a weakening shilling and arbitrary rent increments on a more macro level the bill has diminished the comparative advantage of uganda over other countries as a real estate investment destination for foreign and local investors who invest in hard currencies like the us dollar for hard currency rental income streams and better yields on investment it would have been more practical to separate the act regulating commercial and residential tenancies instead of having them regulated under the same act for obvious reasons these tenancies are different and cannot be regulated the same way the law regulating an apartment will not be applicable to that regulating a shopping mall for example the capital costs incurred by a residential tenant to fit out their apartment with movable fittings cannot be compared to those incurred by a retailer in a shopping mall some retail anchor tenants incur fit out costs of up to 5m as such the latter will require guaranteed tenure for the lifespan of their tenancy whereas residential tenants require the flexibility of notice periods the bill as passed has protected small traders from the fixed term of a lease but will impact significantly on commercial tenants as they are not in a position to set up business where they cannot guarantee the full tenure the cause of arbitrary rental increments specific to kacita tenants is simply because the relationship between the landlords and tenants is informal the tenants have no tenancy agreements and landlords take advantage of this treating the symptom of increasing rents is pointless if the root cause has not been addressed you cannot enforce the terms of a verbal agreement and this should not be an option if they hope to achieve their desired objective why are these challenges of arbitrary and unfair rental increments not seen in the more prime malls where tenants are paying dollar rents that s because the landlord tenant relationship is formal contractually bound by a lease agreement which is signed by a willing tenant and willing landlord prior to the tenant taking occupation the terms and conditions of the lease are very clear both parties know what to expect and there are no surprises a landlord cannot decide to wake up one morning and shut down an entire mall which has become a habit downtown to settle scores with their business partners leaving tenants totally helpless is this also because of dollar rentals this impunity from landlords is because there is no legal recourse all attention and focus have been given to the issue of currency in which rent will be paid and this seems to be the fulcrum on which the need for a landlord and tenant bill is turning however addressing this issue alone is pointless if other aspects of property management and financing are ignored as i have argued before this issue is bigger than kacita and kacita is not uganda neither do they control the property market of uganda in fact even their contribution to the tax revenue of the country is incomparable to property developers owners of commercial properties in the country at large how then do you ban dollar rentals without giving due consideration to other factors in the property development cycle and value chain it is inconceivable to outlaw dollar rents without bearing in mind the impact of such a regulation on the financial sector and the economy as a whole i am hoping that our honourables are aware that dollar denominated loans are cheaper 8 per cent than shilling loans 20 per cent which is why most commercial properties are financed by dollar loans this being the case were the banks consulted on the feasibility of converting these dollars denominated loans to shilling loans in order for the borrowers to afford their repayments they will have to increase the rent extortionately and the tenant will pay the price however there is also a possibility that the banks will not accept to reschedule these loans have the repercussions of this been thought through or the fact that non performing loans will increase repossessed properties will become the order of the day crashing the property market to smithereens the arguments in parliament were that countries like uk usa europe china insist on local currency rents this is correct but why for example the dollar is found in a pair with all of the other major currencies and often acts as the intermediary in triangular currency transactions this is because the dollar acts as the unofficial global reserve currency held by nearly every central bank and institutional investment entity in the world it is for this reason that uganda fixes her exchange rates to the dollar to stabilize it rather than allowing the free forex markets to fluctuate its relative value why is this the case because of the volatility of the shilling to many external factors pray i ask is the shilling a globally traded currency when our honourables travel to america are they able to take shillings and exchange them for dollars at jfk airport or london heathrow for that matter but you can exchange dollars in london japanese yen in switzerland and the euro in south africa the common thread being that these are strong stable currencies no prudent investor will go to america and get property development financing in pounds sterling or euros simply because it would not make any economic sense it would be more expensive to borrow in any other foreign currency than the local currency the dollar why that is because the dollar is a strong stable currency and there are several federal reserve banks with adequate deposits to lend at affordable rates in uganda it is cheaper to borrow in the dollar because the reverse is true it will also make sense to make loan repayments in the same currency as you have borrowed because 1 it is the terms and conditions of our financing institution and 2 dollar rentals are cheaper than shilling rentals because they are more stable minimal fluctuation to cpi at the end of the day 10 per square metre converts to 37 550 and can fluctuate up or down but mainly upwards by up to 30 per cent in one year rentals will still remain pegged to the dollar but paid in shillings subject to the exchange rate and annual escalations on the shilling of over 20 per cent to keep up with interest rates instead of 3 per cent escalations on the dollar as is the market rate so who will be most affected by the dollar rental ban the bill attempts to limit the extent of the above collateral damage to the tenant by stating that rent increments per annum will be capped at 10 per cent are they also going to cap interest rates i am sure the honourable parliamentarians also appreciate why our finance costs are high put simply our savings as a banked demographic are low therefore banks do not have enough deposits to lend at affordable rates they in turn need to borrow the money they require to lend to borrowers and this comes at a cost both of borrowing and hedge against forex losses shouldn t we be focusing more on how we can increase savings and deposits as a means of lowering interest rates and stabilizing the shilling the need to review this bill is not an option it is a necessity or our property market is going to be destroyed the uganda property market does not operate in a vacuum it is a market which is open to both local and foreign investors not just tenants we must legislate for all with a long term view on things you cannot pass a bill on the whims of one interest group to the economic and social disadvantage of the rest of the country china and america have shown increased interest in investing in uganda s real estate sector i am not certain however that with such legislation which makes the ease of doing business in uganda rankings plummet alongside facing the fear of being imprisoned for annoying a tenant and the inability of a landlord to distress for rent pits uganda as an attractive investment destination for property i am appealing to his excellency the president of uganda not to assent to this bill in its current state property experts and professionals have offered their free services to help draft a better bill which will stand the test of time and encourage a vibrant property market in uganda but to no avail the author is the managing director knight frank uganda

expand ap photo file friedrich hayek was the first president of the mont pelerin society a group of neoliberal intellectuals globalists the end of empire and the birth of neoliberalism quinn slobodian harvard university press state capture how conservative activists big businesses and wealthy donors reshaped the american states and the nation alexander hertel fernandez oxford university press this article appears in the summer 2019 issue of the american prospect magazine subscribe here are democracy and capitalism compatible for much of the postwar era mainstream economists foreign policy decision makers and the political commentariat believed not only in the intrinsic compatibility of a market economy and a liberal democratic polity but in the idea that each strengthened the other but that faith has been shattered in the years since 2008 by the rise of far right political parties in many liberal democracies and the anti democratic abuse of political power by elites in north america and europe rather than capitalism and democracy being soulmates political life seems a three way battle among moneyed interests nationalist populists and pro democracy progressives for many progressives writing in the tradition of karl polanyi or echoing concerns as old as jean jacques rousseau s social contract theory the recent rise of the market to pre eminence in political life has had familiar negative effects on democracy the decline of union membership the shareholder revolution tax cuts for the wealthy and wage stagnation for the working and middle classes are injustices not only because of the dramatic economic inequality they produce but because of the unequal distribution of political power and the loss of democratic legitimacy that results on this telling the assault on unions has hollowed out working class political power while rising wealth inequality and the deregulation of campaign finance beneath the banner of money is speech has created a plutocracy where money and not the people speaks and rules on the right the inverse has long been the worry there the fear is that democracy may grow too strong and intrude on the market this is the story line of theorists such as james buchanan and mancur olson and the rational choice revolution that resulted democracy supposedly is incapable of giving the people what is really in their interest if that was knowable at all and instead ineluctably degenerates into special interest rent seeking in 2009 peter thiel said the quiet part out loud i no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible one of the invaluable services provided by quinn slobodian s globalists the end of empire and the birth of neoliberalism is to trace this anti democratic tendency s theoretical origins and demonstrate how for generations ultra market intellectuals have viewed democracy as a potential threat to the market for some commentators jonathan chait made the case two years ago in new york magazine neoliberalism is an empty epithet just a word angry leftists use to lump the clinton wing of the democratic party in with conservative free marketeers hopefully slobodian has forever put this line of thought to bed beginning in post world war i austria slobodian shows how an internally consistent body of thought reproduced itself through the 20th century eventually providing the intellectual inspiration for institutions like the world trade organization the protagonists of slobodian s story are the austrians friedrich hayek and ludwig von mises and german wilhelm röpke hayek and mises are famous today in the u s as the intellectual forefathers of milton friedman the chicago school of economics and the goldwater presidential campaign but slobodian frames his story around the problem of international organization that austrians faced after the dissolution of the austro hungarian empire beginning with the meetings held in mises s office at the chamber of commerce in vienna these austrians quickly concluded two things first austria isolated from its empire was dependent on international trade for economic growth second stimulating international trade would mean sharply reducing domestic wages a series of strikes and violent worker unrest in austria demonstrated the unpopularity of these measures it also reinforced what would become a central plank of neoliberal thought that unions and the democracy that gave them power could not be trusted and that for the market to function it had to be put beyond the reach of democracy after the rise of nazism in germany slobodian follows his cast of intellectuals to the 1938 walter lippmann colloquium in paris an initial gathering of intellectuals who would go on to become key figures in the mont pelerin society the mont pelerin society named for the swiss mountain resort where they met annually was a collection of intellectuals who self styled themselves as neoliberals or classical liberals and would go on to be enormously influential eight of their members including thinkers of worldwide repute like milton friedman george stigler and james buchanan along with the aforementioned friedrich hayek would win nobel prizes in economics as the international order spiraled into global war and the great depression was fought partly with tariff walls the neoliberals of the mont pelerin society became increasingly skeptical of the ability of economists to ever understand well economics the global flow of economic trade the accumulated variables expressed in each object s discrete price was simply too complex they argued to ever be captured by a macroeconomic model neoliberals believed that the state was likewise incapable of comprehending much less managing the economy all the state could do under neoliberal tutelage was to encase the market ensure that the flows of goods and services are safe from the interference of states political whims and sovereignty the neoliberals imagined an international order that safeguarded the rights of capital to travel across boundaries what slobodian dubs xenos rights namely the rights of foreign capital to supersede state sovereignty protecting those xenos rights became key to the political practice of the inheritors of neoliberalism little known figures who were faithful students and readers of hayek and other first generation neoliberals worked at institutions like the general agreement on tariffs and trade and its successor the world trade organization and the european economic community and its successor the european union there they secured the right of capital to move across state boundaries and sue sovereign states when they engaged in anti trade activity after world war ii the united nations attempted to make human rights universal guaranteed without any reference to a nation state so too now were the rights of capital as with any historical story about the development of a global institution the precise causal role played by neoliberal thought in the development of gatt and the wto is difficult to pin down slobodian s book is at its strongest and most provocative where it demonstrates the clear symmetries between neoliberal thought and the anti democratic pro capital tendencies of international organizations it is at its weakest where it sees the latter as sufficiently caused by the theories of the former neoliberals then value democracy for only instrumental reasons the goal of good governance is to encase the market at times democracy threatens to intrude upon the market for principled reasons and in those cases it must be reined back slobodian s book is at its most engaging when he shows in detail the practically metaphysical dignity the neoliberals bestow upon the market rather than just a way of distributing goods and services the market is a spontaneously self organizing decentralized system of information that always knows more about the world than the humans that inhabit it can hope to read through this lens hayek s road to serfdom or constitution of liberty is less a paean to individual liberty than it is an argument about the limits of economic knowledge and a veneration of the market slobodian s book concludes with a tour de force reading of this hayek for whom the economy is sublime operating beyond the scope of human reason and revealing its dazzling knowledge in elliptical signals humans can respond to but not understand each price is a sum of the value of a good to society attempting to understand how a good came to be priced is always hubristic humans cannot understand the signals they respond to only the basis upon which the signals function that is the free market a democratic government robustly committed to making collective judgments about how the world ought to work is in hayek s view always worse than a market system that can spontaneously allocate resources according to a larger pool of information the market is a gargantuan information processing system explicitly analogized by hayek to the human brain or the process of biological evolution which no human mind can rival to preserve its smooth functioning it must be protected against the meddling of governments slobodian s book focuses on politics at the international level there elite agreement is sufficient to curb national sovereignty moments of intense opposition like the 1999 seattle wto protests or anti eu populisms aside the question that it does not answer is how at the domestic level of a liberal democratic state policies that curb democracy and encase the market can be implemented enter alexander hertel fernandez s new book state capture how conservative activists big businesses and wealthy donors reshaped the american states and the nation in this book hertel fernandez sets out to explain how american states rapidly enacted policies from wisconsin s anti union act 10 of 2011 to stand your ground legislation that have little to no popular support slobodian s protagonists were the intellectuals who theorized the market s right against democracy hertel fernandez s protagonists are the interest groups funded by dark money that enact those rights at the level of state policy in the u s the state policy network spn the american legislative exchange council alec and the koch funded americans for prosperity afp together these three groups form what hertel fernandez calls the conservative troika the spn networks various conservative think tanks across the nation that otherwise would be siloed in their state context alec drafts legislation for its corporate stakeholders that is then copied and proposed in various state legislatures it also holds annual trainingsfor state legislatorsand enlists them as members forwarding copies of corporate sponsored legislation to each afp in concert with the spn and alec provides the foot soldiers and cash afp is a multibillion dollar operation with claimed connections to millions of activists around the country american political scientists have searched for years for hard quantitative proof that big money donors to politics are rational actors getting bang for their buck hertel fernandez provides us with evidence they are just that wherever the troika is more active and better funded states are more likely to pass right to work legislation that cripples unions more likely to spur on pro corporate deregulation and more likely to resist the expansion of medicaid since the passage of the affordable care act hertel fernandez persuasively shows that in all these cases there was practically never a robust majority in favor of the troika s line instead the troika hijacked democracy the 2011 passage of act 10 in wisconsin which effectively gutted public sector collective bargaining rightsand shifted the burden of public pension plans onto workers is one site of this hijacking as hertel fernandez notes governor scott walker himself was a member of alec and several of his early legislative initiatives as governor were alec model bills alec could also claim members among gop leadership in both chambers in the statehouse as walker began pushing act 10 afp bused in hundreds of supporters for the legislation from around the state and bought hundreds of thousands of dollars in tv ads to prop up the anti union legislation a local spn affiliate the maciver institute promoted editorials in state papers arguing in favor of the legislation and after massive resistance from the teachers union including a last ditch effort to recall governor walker act 10 passed and act 10 like much of the legislation pushed by the troika had its intended effect in 2011 about half of wisconsin public sector workers were union that number was below 20 percent in 2017 the value of teachers pensions and health care fell by a fifth during the same period and their pay has stagnated or fallen and crucially the political power of the wisconsin teachers union has fallen precipitously too in 2012 during the walker recall election one out of every 20 dollars spent in the race was union in 2016 less than 1 percent of every dollar spent was union the troika succeeded in crippling the political power of unions a political power that had so profoundly disturbed the early neoliberals in early 20th century austria proving that neoliberalism is suspicious of democracy does not require trips to the dusty archive and the turning up of smoking guns in her controversial democracy in chains nancy maclean believed she had done just that produced archival evidence that james buchanan and charles koch had conspired to uphold segregation and resist the power of democracy her book has been criticized by writers on the right and left and it is unlikely that buchanan personally was a segregationist but it is absolutely the case that buchanan belongs to an intellectual movement suspicious of democracy public choice theory s axiomatic denigration of the possibility of there being anything like a public interest distinct from the aggregation of private interests is evidence of this inheritance and it is overwhelmingly evident that the koch brothers afp wants to reduce worker participation in democracy wherever it can and hijack democracy with dollars the disaggregated conservative interests represented in the troika from the gun lobby to big business to oil interests to evangelical social conservatives are united by one common interest a belief that left alone democracy will decide against them the fight is money against democracy for neoliberals the market knows best even when what the market knows is that workers wages must stagnate or sink for a country that opens itself up to international free trade even when what the market knows is that poisoning a nation s water with cyanide is worth it if that means you can mine gold even when what the market knows is that sweatshops and the disasters they bring with them are a necessary stage in industrial development how can progressives empower democracy against money hertel fernandez s research tells us that better funded state legislatures are better equipped to resist the troika state legislators who are well paid and equipped with aides are much less likely to consort with alec and sign on to conservative bills publicly funding elections and creating public pools of money candidates can draw on as an alternative to afp funding would also probably help and we can also fix the gerrymandered electoral map and pass a new voting rights act to robustly expand the franchise on an international level a pro democracy left needs to rethink the repercussions of free trade agreements not only for the future of the economy but for the future of democracy that canadian companies felt empowered to sue el salvador for the right to mine their mountains for gold risk of poisoning rivers with cyanide be damned is only one of the more visible examples of the rights private companies are afforded in a free trade regime and progressives need to get there before the right steals their clothes already trump s tough on china trade policy suggests a right wing awakening to the possibility of being the party that is pro american worker progressives need to robustly defend the right of sovereign states to regulate their economies emphasize fair trade agreements and when international competition threatens the livelihood of domestic workers develop a robust industrial policy that prioritizes the needs of american people above international capital finally the pro democracy left also has to rise to the intellectual challenge posed to it by neoliberalism thriving debates about the possibility of a jobs guarantee or a universal basic income suggest a reawakening of a democratic imagination that refuses to let the market be the only decider
home world_sp lagarde to succeed draghi as ecb chief as economy weakens christine lagardephotographer jacobia dahm bloomberg july 3rd 2019 13 17 pm 502 views worldbusiness christine lagarde is set to swap the helm of the international monetary fund for that of the european central bank becoming the first woman to run euro area monetary policy just as the bloc s economy looks in need of fresh stimulus lagarde was nominated to succeed mario draghi as president of the ecb when his eight year term ends on oct 31 european leaders turned to the 63 year old onetime lawyer and former french finance minister on tuesday after hours of horse trading in brussels over a package of top eu jobs which included handing the presidency of the european commission to german defense minister ursula von der leyen in a statement lagarde said that she was honored to have been nominated and would temporarily relinquish her responsibilities at the imf while eu lawmakers look to ratify her appointment she was chosen because she took on an indisputable leadership role at the imf and i think whoever can do that can also lead the ecb german chancellor angela merkel said french president emmanuel macron said she has the qualities and competence for the ecb she has credibility with the markets in moving from washington to frankfurt lagarde will be tasked with driving monetary policy in a 19 nation economy which draghi has already signaled will need more help likely in the form of lower interest rates and possibly with the resumption of quantitative easing inflation is running at barely half the ecb s goal of just under 2 despite years of negative rates and 2 6 trillion euros 3 trillion of bond purchases investors will likely bet that as a seasoned crisis fighter lagarde will share draghi s taste for aggressive and innovative monetary policy especially as her appointment means the more hawkish bundesbank president jens weidmann misses out financial markets are already pricing in an ecb rate cut by september in line with predictions by ecb watchers at bloomberg economics and goldman sachs group inc morgan stanley said the choice of lagarde increases their conviction that the ecb will eventually resume buying bonds moliere s trees lagarde last week described the world economy as hitting a rough patch and advised central banks to continue to adjust their policies in response in june 2014 she said she would certainly hope the ecb would conduct qe if inflation stayed sluggish months before it announced it would do so she also praised draghi s 2012 commitment to do whatever it takes to save the euro and recently echoed his call for governments to do more to battle future downturns in march she linked the need to fortify the euro area to the words of playwright moliere the trees that are slow to grow bear the best fruit what bloomberg s economists say the ecb will be a different central bank under lagarde than it has been under draghi but the absence of a ph d may not matter draghi s skills lay as much in navigating european politics as in formulating policy if the new central bank president has just one skill it s the former jamie murray see his ecb insight just last september lagarde dismissed speculation she could take over the ecb telling the financial times she was a bit annoyed and fed up with the suggestion only one economist surveyed last month predicted she would get the job with weidmann seen as the most likely winner in a race dominated by men france has now twice secured the presidency of the two decade old ecb draghi an italian was preceded by frenchman jean claude trichet who replaced dutchman wim duisenberg in common with trichet whose appointment was held up by a trial involving the bailout of credit lyonnais lagarde brings a history of legal wrangles they culminated in a conviction of negligence in 2016 over her handling of a multi million euro dispute linked to the same bank lagarde s appointment also means the ecb and the u s federal reserve will be headed by former lawyers a shift from the era when central banks were run by academic economists such as ben bernanke all of the first three ecb presidents had qualifications in economics and ran their national central banks first that opens lagarde up to criticism that she lacks the knowledge to set monetary policy and could boost the influence of philip lane the ecb s new chief economist it is a little puzzling because she s not known as one of the leading economic minds out there said alicia levine chief strategist at bny mellon investment she does though boast political nous which will be needed to unite fellow ecb officials when setting policy especially if they run low on monetary ammunition and need to nudge governments to step up support of the economy she has the political skills needed to build consensus on the governing council is a good communicator and has the standing and backbone to defend the ecb s decisions on the larger european stage said krishna guha head of central bank strategy at evercore isi she would be forceful in calling on member states to make use of the fiscal space eu council president donald tusk dismissed concerns about lagarde s lack of formal economic training she will make a perfect ecb president he said in brussels alongside sabine lautenschlaeger lagarde will be one of two women on the six member executive board they are likely to be the only two female participants in the 25 member governing council which includes the governors of euro region national central banks and has long been dominated by men broader view lagarde was also the first woman to serve as managing director of the imf being first appointed in 2011 and then handed another five year term in 2016 her exit will likely spark a fight between capitals over whether a european should always run the lender or if it s time for an emerging market candidate to do so at the imf lagarde helped negotiate the fund s biggest ever bailout when it handed more aid last year to argentina she also sought to give emerging economies such as china more of a voice in its management while putting greater emphasis on issues including climate change and income and gender inequality that helped broaden the fund s image beyond its reputation as an advocate of budget cuts she sometimes clashed with countries whose monetary policy she will now help set as the leader of one of greece s major creditors she found herself both pressuring the country to accept austerity to keep it in the euro zone while at the same time persuading its european partners to allow debt relief in 2018 she and weidmann disagreed publicly after she called upon germany s government to spend more and close its current account surplus lagarde was educated in france and the u s working as an intern in the u s congress for a time on graduating from the university of paris nanterre she joined the paris office of chicago based law firm baker mckenzie llp she focused on employment law and mergers and acquisitions rising through its ranks to become a partner in 1987 and then its chairman in 1999 then french president jacques chirac launched her political career in 2005 by appointing her minister for trade she went on to serve as minister for agriculture before becoming the first woman to become finance minister in a group of seven economy in june 2007 she held that role as the collapse of lehman brothers holdings inc set off a global recession and paved the way for the euro area debt crisis during the all night talks of policy makers that followed she often sought to boost morale by passing m m s chocolates around fellow finance chiefs if it had been lehman sisters rather than lehman brothers the world might well look a lot different today she once said a past member of france s synchronized swimming team lagarde said her experience in the pool had taught her how to grit your teeth and smile source courtesy of bloomberg

christine lagarde s nomination as the next president of the european central bank was not widely expected if confirmed as mario draghi s replacement the head of the international monetary fund would be the first ecb president without any direct experience of setting central bank policy although a lawyer by professional background lagarde could be helped by the political experience she has gained through stints at the imf and as france s finance minister presiding over the ecb whose responsibilities include setting the eurozone interest rate and ensuring the stability of the banking system is viewed as a tough task given the requirement to oversee 19 eurozone economies lagarde arrives with several challenges facing the ecb here are the key issues she must address reboot growth in the eurozone financial markets across europe have rallied on the news of her nomination with investors viewing her as a continuity candidate who is not likely to ditch draghi s policies supporting economic growth eurozone growth was a healthy 0 4 in the first quarter of the the year but the us china trade war has dragged down international trade volumes which has had a knock on affect in export intensive industries of europe such as the german carmakers while lagarde has no central bank experience for investors to pore over for clues on her monetary policy stance her speeches at the imf have typically favoured dovish policies meaning an inclination to keep interest rates low hawks in contrast favour higher borrowing costs to combat inflationary pressures lagarde will have little firepower at her disposal to reboot the eurozone economy interest rates are already at record lows of zero and 0 4 for bank deposits however she could take the main interest rate into negative territory or deploy more unconventional policies such as expanding quantitative easing the buying of government bonds from banks keep the eurozone together the eurozone remains an unfinished monetary and political union suffering from deep divisions between member states over the appropriate level of centralisation her political connections could help prod eu governments towards using more tax and spending measures to stimulate the eurozone economy which the central bank has been arguing for without much success lagarde will need to keep an eye on italy where economic growth is weak and government debt high rome has had repeated rows with brussels over its budget the prospect of eurosceptic movements pushing to leave the single currency could send markets into a tailspin requiring swift reaction from the central bank she has comprehensive experience of the eurozone debt crisis from her time at the imf overseeing the bailouts of greece and other nations struggling at the time she also backed draghi after he pledged to do whatever it takes to keep the euro from breaking apart in 2012 display independence the ecb s political independence is enshrined in an eu treaty however lagarde s previous role in french politics brings this sharply into question and also comes as the principle of central bank independence is challenged elsewhere around the world with spain s former finance minister luis de guindos as vice president of the ecb two former politicians will hold the top jobs an institution more traditionally dominated by technocrats financial markets could be rattled if investors believe nation states could apply pressure over monetary policy decisions similar to the concerns over donald trump applying pressure at the us federal reserve jerome powell who leads the american central bank has had to reassure markets of his independence that lagarde is not a trained economist means she may need to rely more on ecb staff and technical members of its governing council the appointment of philip lane the former irish central bank governor as chief economist will help her in this regard
it is wednesday and so a less intensive blog post note how i no longer claim it will be shorter the less intensive claim refers to how much research i have to put in to write the post apart from some beautiful music the topic for today is yesterday s rba decision to cut interest rates to record low levels the decision won t save the economy from recession and highlights the sort of desperation that central bankers now face as governments shunt the responsibility of counterstabilisation onto them while claiming that achieving fiscal surpluses is the brief of the treasuries this self defeating strategy failing to use the most effective policy tool in favour of an ineffective tool is the neoliberal way it is the recipe that new keynesian macroeconomics offers it is mindless ideological nonsense and the problem is that it is not the top end of town that suffers from the negative outcomes that follow quite the opposite in fact reliance on monetary policy is doomed yesterday july 2 2019 the central bank in australia the rba reduced interest rates to 1 per cent down from 1 25 per cent this is the lowest they have been in history the following graph shows the period since 1975 the blue line is the official cash rate set by the rba which is available in time series for since august 1990 the red line is the closely allied interbank overnight cash rate which is the rate the banks loas excess reserves to each other to address payments requirements the last two rba board meetings have brought interest rate cuts totalling 0 5 percentage points in the press release statement by philip lowe governor monetary policy decision the rba said 1 this easing of monetary policy will support employment growth and provide greater confidence that inflation will be consistent with the medium term target 2 the uncertainty generated by the trade and technology disputes is affecting investment and means that the risks to the global economy are tilted to the downside 3 long term government bond yields have declined further and are at record lows in a number of countries including australia 4 over the year to the march quarter the australian economy grew at a below trend 1 8 per cent consumption growth has been subdued weighed down by a protracted period of low income growth and declining housing prices they should have also mentioned the record levels of household debt that is putting a brake on spending now as people are trying to reduce the risk associated with their precarious balance sheet positions in the face of a major slowdown in the economy 5 there has however been little inroad into the spare capacity in the labour market recently with the unemployment rate having risen slightly to 5 2 per cent 6 overall wages growth remains low 7 conditions in most housing markets remain soft which is a euphemism for significant falls in housing prices so essentially they have been forced into this cut by the following 1 they actually believe that aggregate activity is sensitive to interest rate movements and seem to think any response that is present is linear that is it doesn t matter whether interest rates are at 5 per cent or 1 per cent the spending responses to a change in the level are similar 2 the overarching policy framework is neoliberal where the government is pursuing a fiscal surplus draining demand and forcing all the counterstabilisation onto the central bank so failing to use the effective policy tool in favour of an ineffective tool the neoliberal way 3 the economy is tanking and heading for recession and the rba know it while the government seems to be in denial about it three of the four big four commercial banks once again demonstrated why they should be nationalised they declined to pass on the full interest rate cut to their customers greed has no bounds for that lot i urge people to abandon any dealings with these banks and move your banking to an institution that does pass on the rate cuts in full and has low management and service charges the community banks and building societies fit into that category my overall assessment is as follows 1 the claim by mainstream economists that the lower interest rates will boost spending is flawed 2 the problem is that peoples and firms borrowing behaviour is not driven solely by the cost of funds the mainstream macroeconomic models all believe so called substitution or relative price effects are large so they predict that when interest rates fall total spending will rise because the cost of funds is lower but reality intervenes always reality is driven by more than relative prices psychology is important at a time when the outlook is decidedly uncertain real wages growth is barely positive if at all households are carrying massive debt levels and desperately trying to save unemployment and underemployment is rising it is highly unlikely that there will be an outpouring of spending households are likely to use the small gains from lower mortgage payments remembering the banks haven t played ball with the rba to reduce debt exposure or boost saving ahead of going on a spending spree 3 the mainstream economists have also argued that the lower interest rates will drive the australian dollar down because the lower rates reduce the relative attractive of financial investments in australian currency denominated assets which will benefit the export sector and reduce spending on imports a win win for gdp growth but once again reality intervenes have a look at the following graph which shows the aud usd parity since the beginning of last year don t be fooled by the vertical scale the series has been very flat especially over the last 12 months on august 15 2018 the parity was 72 13 yesterday july 2 2019 the parity was 69 79 in the intervening period rates have been cut from 1 5 per cent to 1 per cent not much movement is evident on the exchange rate front of course the export sector has already been relatively strong as a result of strong terms of trade iron ore prices and mining profits are high the problem is that these profits are not translating into wages growth or investment the strong income growth for miners many of who repatriate the gains to overseas owners is also fuelling strong tax revenue growth for the federal government but they are not spending as they should because they are trying to claim virtue as a result of a surplus they might temporarily achieve which reminds me of a great jim morrison quote during a concert in la he said i don t know what s gonna happen but i wanna have my kicks before the whole shithouse goes up in flames that is sort of what the federal government is doing at present any surplus they may achieve will soon be gone if recession hits and then it will run up what i call a bad deficit one associated with falling employment rising unemployment and underemployment and general malaise it is not the way to run an economy 4 a sole reliance on monetary policy to boost aggregate spending at a time the non government sector is resolutely trying not to spend bar exports growth is the hallmark of the stupidity of neoliberalism this was brought out again last week when the general manager of the bank of international settlements gave a speech time to ignite all engines at the annual meeting of the bis in basel on june 30 2019 he said all the usual things about headwinds china us trade subdued inflation slowing growth etc he noted that importantly after the prolonged period of easy financial conditions many vulnerabilities have built up and could throw the global economy off course one such vulnerability is high household debt in many advanced economies especially those not directly affected by the great financial crisis these historically high debt levels limit the scope for households to drive economic activity clearly the era of credit binging by the household sector is over in australia it was always unsustainable and it is the only reason the federal government was able to achieve fiscal surpluses in 10 out of 11 years from 1996 without the record levels of household debt the australian economy would have been in recession by 1997 and the surpluses would have been eliminated by the automatic stabilisers but in considering the question how should monetary policy respond in the event of a sharper than expected weakening of economic activity the bis manager said these considerations highlight the fact that monetary policy cannot be the engine of higher sustainable economic growth more realistically it is better regarded as a backstop a more balanced policy mix is badly needed we need a better balance between monetary policy fiscal policy macroprudential policies and structural reforms that is the point we cannot keep constructing fiscal policy targets in terms of a one way street to surpluses that is not what fiscal policy is meant to achieve it is the most powerful economic policy tool available to a currency issuing government and its purpose is to improve the well being of the population not to achieve any particular number or balance status when we escape that ideological trap the surplus mania better days will be ahead call for financial assistance to make the mmt university project a reality the foundation for monetary studies inc aka the mmt foundation serves as a legal vehicle to raise funds and provide financial resources for educational projects as resources permit and the need arises the foundation is a non profit corporation registered in the state of delaware as a section 501 c 3 company i am the president of the company its legal structure allows people can make donations without their identity being revealed publicly the first project it will support is mmted aka mmt university which will provide formal courses to students in all nations to advance their understanding of modern monetary theory at present this is the priority and we need some solid financial commitments to make this project possible and sustainable some sponsors have already offered their generous assistance we need significantly more funds to get the operations off the ground in order for fms to solicit tax exempt donations while our application to the irs is being processed the modern money network ltd mmn has agreed to serve as a fiscal sponsor and to receive funds on fms s behalf mmn is a non profit corporation registered in the state of delaware and is a federal tax exempt public charity under section 501 c 3 of the internal revenue code donations made to mmn on behalf of fms are not disclosed to the public furthermore all donations made to mmn on behalf of fms will be used exclusively for fms projects please help if you can we cannot make the mmted project viable without funding support clarification i saw a twitter torrent last night and into this morning trying to claim that a diagram in our introductory macroeconomics textbook released in 2016 and which is no longer available for sale was evidence that mmt economists believe in the money multiplier and are inconsistent that textbook has been replaced with the more comprehensive book published by macmillan in march 2019 macroeconomics but let me make it absolutely clear the diagram floating around the twitter space has nothing at all to do with the money multiplier the person prosecuting this lie needs serious help and should be ignored falling leaves music today is from the british singer clare mcguire who has one of the best alto voices you can ever hear although she is not very well known she started out posting her own songs on myspace when she was 17 years old her songs proved popular and the capitalists came running unfortunately the record company she signed with polydor persuaded to abandon her musical roots of folk and blues and become a sort of kylie minogue type artist she should have kept the faith the song falling leaves appeared on her 2016 album stranger things have happened and is 3 minutes and 5 seconds of haunting piano and voice the song was part of the soundtrack for the recent netflix program when they see us which traces the story of the so called central park 5 the five teenage boys aged between 14 16 of african american and latino descent were wrongly convicted of the beating and rape of a girl in central park nyc in april 1989 their questioning by the cops was coercive and they were forced into making false confession tapes there was no hard evidence that connected the boys to the crime they were subsequently imprisoned for periods of between 6 and 14 years and one of them who was 16 at the time went to adult prison and was brutalised beyond belief in 2002 the real offender who was serving life for a series of rapes at the same time found jesus and confessed to the central park crime his dna matched the samples from the rape the five boys were then exonerated and received a total of us41 million the highest in new york history the 4 part series is a shocking indictment of the us criminal justice system and very sad falling leaves falling falling leaves falling falling leaves you left me in the falling leaves orange skies under the blood red moon he left me under falling leaves what has that man gone and done underneath what has that man gone and done underneath he left me in the falling leaves that is enough for today c copyright 2019 william mitchell all rights reserved

then it will run up what i call a bad deficit one associated with falling employment rising unemployment and underemployment and general malaise it is not the way to run an economy 4 a sole reliance on monetary policy to boost aggregate spending at a time the non government sector is resolutely trying not to spend bar exports growth is the hallmark of the stupidity of neoliberalism this was brought out again last week when the general manager of the bank of international settlements gave a speech time to ignite all engines at the annual meeting of the bis in basel on june 30 2019 he said all the usual things about headwinds china us trade subdued inflation slowing growth etc he noted that importantly after the prolonged period of easy financial conditions many vulnerabilities have built up and could throw the global economy off course one such vulnerability is high household debt in many advanced economies especially those not directly affected by the great financial crisis these historically high debt levels limit the scope for households to drive economic activity clearly the era of credit binging by the household sector is over in australia it was always unsustainable and it is the only reason the federal government was able to achieve fiscal surpluses in 10 out of 11 years from 1996 without the record levels of household debt the australian economy would have been in recession by 1997 and the surpluses would have been eliminated by the automatic stabilisers but in considering the question how should monetary policy respond in the event of a sharper than expected weakening of economic activity the bis manager said these considerations highlight the fact that monetary policy cannot be the engine of higher sustainable economic growth more realistically it is better regarded as a backstop a more balanced policy mix is badly needed we need a better balance between monetary policy fiscal policy macroprudential policies and structural reforms that is the point we cannot keep constructing fiscal policy targets in terms of a one way street to surpluses that is not what fiscal policy is meant to achieve it is the most powerful economic policy tool available to a currency issuing government and its purpose is to improve the well being of the population not to achieve any particular number or balance status when we escape that ideological trap the surplus mania better days will be ahead call for financial assistance to make the mmt university project a reality the foundation for monetary studies inc aka the mmt foundation serves as a legal vehicle to raise funds and provide financial resources for educational projects as resources permit and the need arises the foundation is a non profit corporation registered in the state of delaware as a section 501 c 3 company i am the president of the company its legal structure allows people can make donations without their identity being revealed publicly the first project it will support is mmted aka mmt university which will provide formal courses to students in all nations to advance their understanding of modern monetary theory at present this is the priority and we need some solid financial commitments to make this project possible and sustainable some sponsors have already offered their generous assistance we need significantly more funds to get the operations off the ground in order for fms to solicit tax exempt donations while our application to the irs is being processed the modern money network ltd mmn has agreed to serve as a fiscal sponsor and to receive funds on fms s behalf mmn is a non profit corporation registered in the state of delaware and is a federal tax exempt public charity under section 501 c 3 of the internal revenue code donations made to mmn on behalf of fms are not disclosed to the public furthermore all donations made to mmn on behalf of fms will be used exclusively for fms projects please help if you can we cannot make the mmted project viable without funding support clarification i saw a twitter torrent last night and into this morning trying to claim that a diagram in our introductory macroeconomics textbook released in 2016 and which is no longer available for sale was evidence that mmt economists believe in the money multiplier and are inconsistent that textbook has been replaced with the more comprehensive book published by macmillan in march 2019 macroeconomics but let me make it absolutely clear the diagram floating around the twitter space has nothing at all to do with the money multiplier the person prosecuting this lie needs serious help and should be ignored falling leaves music today is from the british singer clare mcguire who has one of the best alto voices you can ever hear although she is not very well known she started out posting her own songs on myspace when she was 17 years old her songs proved popular and the capitalists came running unfortunately the record company she signed with polydor persuaded to abandon her musical roots of folk and blues and become a sort of kylie minogue type artist she should have kept the faith the song falling leaves appeared on her 2016 album stranger things have happened and is 3 minutes and 5 seconds of haunting piano and voice the song was part of the soundtrack for the recent netflix program when they see us which traces the story of the so called central park 5 the five teenage boys aged between 14 16 of african american and latino descent were wrongly convicted of the beating and rape of a girl in central park nyc in april 1989 their questioning by the cops was coercive and they were forced into making false confession tapes there was no hard evidence that connected the boys to the crime they were subsequently imprisoned for periods of between 6 and 14 years and one of them who was 16 at the time went to adult prison and was brutalised beyond belief in 2002 the real offender who was serving life for a series of rapes at the same time found jesus and confessed to the central park crime his dna matched the samples from the rape the five boys were then exonerated and received a total of us41 million the highest in new york history the 4 part series is a shocking indictment of the us criminal justice system and very sad falling leaves falling falling leaves falling falling leaves you left me in the falling leaves

by now everyone has heard of libra the new private digital money system announced last week sponsored by facebook and a consortium of other firms to be rolled out in 2020 the project s official white paper an introduction to libra calls it a new decentralized blockchain a low volatility cryptocurrency and a smart contract platform a second official document on the libra reserve goes into more detail an overview of the system s potential by diego zuluaga is available here a more critical view by stephen williamson here alarmed denunciations of libra for being too corporation y can be found here and here let s put aside the questions of how decentralized libra will really be what kind of blockchain it will employ and its use in smart contracting to focus on the question exactly what kind of money will it be i find that the white papers under specify the core mechanism that is supposed to control the value and quantity of libra my best guess is that libra is meant to be like a mutual funds share redeemable by authorized resellers not by the public directly at the net asset value of a low risk mutual fund diversified across several fiat currencies first a verbal and symbolic aside the libra historically was a medieval monetary unit in latin libra is a singular noun meaning pound or scale plural librae historically this is why the sign of the british pound is â a cursive capital l in the libra white papers libra is variously used as a singular noun a plural noun the word libras is never used and as an adjective herein i adopt as the libra currency sign the zodiac emoji for libra so for 10 libra i write 10 apparently one of the more mundane aspects of creating a new currency is waiting for html to catch up with your preferred symbol the structure of the libra system first the structure of the system the public can buy and sell libra coins in exchange for existing fiat money unlike bitcoins the exchanges at least initially will not be independent of libra and competitive with open entry but will be a set of authorized resellers they sell coins to the public at a price reflecting the wholesale value of the libra plus a bid ask spread and a transaction fee they buy coins back at the wholesale value minus bid ask and transaction charges the resellers manage their inventories by interacting with the libra reserve swapping fiat for libra and vice versa but here s the key unanswered question on what terms do they swap if we take the white papers talk of backing seriously it suggests that the value of libra coins in circulation is matched by the value of assets held in the reserve ready to buy back or redeem the coins the papers say that libra will be backed by a portfolio of denominated â denominated and other fiat denominated securities but is a coin in the hands of a reseller a debt claim or an equity claim on the reserve in particular when a reseller brings 1 to the reserve she might either have an iou entitling her to a specified medium of redemption like a paypal account balance or a hong kong dollar note redeemable in us dollars or she might have a share claim on the libra reserve portfolio like a mutual fund share for the reserve portfolio to provide full backing the share claim will have to be redeemable in a bundle of currencies whose composition mirrors the composition of the portfolio the official papers ambiguously suggest both debt and equity characteristics in places they liken the libra reserve to a currency board an orthodox currency board note issues debt claims local currency notes each redeemable for a fixed amount of the anchor currency hk 7 8 us 1 and holds at least 100 percent reserves in the anchor currency if that is the libra arrangement then there is a fixed exchange rate between libra and a pre specified fiat currency basket the proportions of fiat currencies in the medium of redemption basket would be pre specified to provide full backing the proportions would have to correspond exactly to the proportions of currency denominated assets in the reserve s portfolio otherwise adverse exchange rate movements could reduce the portfolio value below 100 percent of the par value of libra in circulation on the other hand the resellers are not described as redeeming libra at the reserve a different backing arrangement would provide that returning 1 always gives the reseller a fixed proportions fiat currency basket equal in value to 1 n where the portfolio s market value is n the reserve is then a kind of mutual fund and 1 in the hands of a reseller is a mutual fund share a possibility williamson identifies this would be novel arrangement a mutual fund redeemable in a multi fiat medium of redemption with shares used as a medium of exchange the value of the 1 share would not be perfectly steady in terms of the defined currency basket but would be as steady as the nominal net asset value of the portfolio in currency baskets the introduction frames the case for the libra essentially by contrast to bitcoin mass market usage of existing blockchains and cryptocurrencies has been hindered by their volatility and lack of scalability which have so far made them poor stores of value and mediums of exchange i agree although i would have said media of exchange this framing of the case suggests that we are to view libra as a stablecoin that is a cryptocurrency whose value is somehow linked to a bundle of existing government fiat currencies but this does not tell us the backing arrangement because stablecoins have tried various methods for linking to single fiat currencies one simple method is redemption at a fixed rate the most prominent stablecoin today is tether usd which promises on its website that tether is 1 to 1 pegged to the dollar and 100 backed by our reserves though it avoids speaking of redemption a more transparent model is pax usd which promises that the parent company will be issuing and redeeming each token in exchange for 1 00 while backing every token with a us dollar held in segregated accounts at fdic insured u s banks other existing stablecoins do not promise redeemability to ensure that they trade at or close to par but instead promise to correct deviations from par by mechanisms that are supposed to vary the quantity of coins in circulation as appropriate to match demand at the par exchange rate what will libra be stable in terms of the libra reserve paper in some places suggests stability in terms of purchasing power over goods and services like holders of euros who can count on stability in the euro price of coffee it says holders of libra too can be confident the value of their coins today will be relatively stable over time by contrast to bitcoin the paper asserts that this stability will remove the volatility of value that obstructs widespread adoption no mechanism for purchasing power stability is specified however the goal that libra system actually seems to aim for is the stability of libra s value in terms of a basket of existing fiat currencies that lose their purchasing power slowly that is have low and stable inflation rates that goal points to another possible barrier to adoption inertia why would anyone take the trouble to switch to libra if it holds its purchasing power no better than the average of the least bad fiat currencies the positive case for switching must lie in other features of the libra payment system like low transaction fees for intra system transfers but lower than the fees of low cost fiat transfer systems like paypal and venmo fx fees will be a burden until the libra community achieves critical mass the killer use that will make libra gain critical mass remains unclear how will libra achieve stability of value in terms of a basket of fiat currencies the second paper states the reserve is the key mechanism for achieving value preservation by fully backing each coin â users can have confidence that they will be able to sell any libra coin at or close to the value of the reserve at any time this reference to backing by the value of the reserve is what persuades me that the authors have a mutual fund model in mind resellers redeem libra at the reserve portfolio s nav net asset value per libra is the libra reserve really like a currency board in crucial respects libra is very different from a currency board libra does not have a single anchor currency in fact it seems to lack any specific anchor libra coins are never referred to as liabilities we can imagine an anchor currency basket for example such that the fixed par rate is 10 5 â 2 â 1 â 100 chf1 in that case the first white paper would be justified is its claim that the value of libra will be effectively linked to a basket of fiat currencies even if not to any single fiat currency in such a system a reseller who turns in 10 would always be paid 5 â 2 â 1 â 100 chf1 with the same exchange rate in the other direction for a reseller turning in fiat currency baskets or if the greenfield and yeager concept of indirect convertibility could be successfully implemented separating the medium of redemption from the unit of account the reseller turning in 10 would be paid 10 worth of dollars or euros etc at up to the second wholesale foreign exchange mid market rates or asking prices but no specific basket is mentioned in the white papers and there is no talk of a fixed exchange rate the only thing like a basket of fiat currencies is the libra reserve s portfolio which will hold a collection of low volatility assets including bank deposits and government securities in currencies from stable and reputable central banks the reserve portfolio is explicitly to be diversified across multiple governments and currencies saying so does nothing to specify a par redemption rate however is the libra reserve like a mutual fund as the papers describe it the reserve portfolio sounds like a government bond money market mutual fund it is to hold only short term government bonds and cash equivalents the bonds are all to be low in default risk highly liquid and low in duration risk via new issues and buy backs of libra the reserve fund is open ended the liquidity of its assets allows the size of the reserve to be easily adjusted as the number of libra in circulation expands or contracts the choice of the passive voice here be adjusted is odd in that the size of the reserve is not supposed to be deliberately adjusted by anyone but is rather supposed to expand automatically when the public buys libra from resellers and contract automatically when it sells them back also unlike an ordinary mutual fund which allows members of the public to buy shares directly and sell them directly back to the fund at their current net asset value libra only allows resellers to interact directly with the libra reserve to be sure it is nowhere directly stated that libra in the hands of resellers constitutes a claim with a redemption value defined by a share of the portfolio in the manner of mutual fund shares yet some such arrangement would have to exist to make sense of the statement that libra will remain fully backed across time full backing means that the market value of reserves assets equals or exceeds the total value of redeemable claims with claims defined as shares and assets continuously marked to market there is by definition no opportunity for the value of all claims to exceed the value of the portfolio the first white paper elaborates in the next sentence this means that today tomorrow and in the future users have confidence that any libra coin they hold can be sold for fiat currency at a narrow spread above or below the value of the underlying reserve when a competitive market for exchanges is present this would be true if two conditions are satisfied 1 the value of the underlying reserve means the value of 1 as a 1 nth share of the reserve portfolio and 2 the reserve always pays a reseller a proportionate share of the reserve portfolio for each 1 turned in a competitive market for exchanges implies that resellers add only a small competitive bid ask spread to cover their transaction costs and adverse information risk what is missing from the white papers is a clear account of whether these two conditions hold of course they are jointly sufficient conditions not necessary conditions so the authors may have some other mechanism in mind for linking the libra s market price in dollars or euros to the reserve portfolio s value in dollars or euros it would be helpful if the architects of libra would tell us explicitly whether they have in mind such a mutual fund type purchase and redemption arrangement between resellers and the libra reserve otherwise potential users are being asked to rely not on a specified pre commitment but on mere promises a mutual fund structure has advantages and disadvantages advantage a mutual fund is not run prone there is no payoff in running to the head of the line to redeem because you don t get any more than people at the end of the line even if you hear that the libra reserve portfolio has taken a hit say it held japanese bonds and japan s credit rating suddenly plunged there is no point in racing to redeem because the value of your 1 claim has already dropped so that the total of all claims still sums to the value of the portfolio if a libra is at bottom a mutual fund share not a deposit or other kind of debt claim there is no rationale for subjecting the libra system to government deposit guarantee scheme with its taxes premiums and portfolio restrictions it should be noted that the libra association is incorporated in switzerland not in the united states disadvantage the value of a mutual fund share cannot be fixed in nominal terms when the portfolio value can sometimes decline in a world of near zero and sometimes negative interest rates on government bonds a small asset loss can wipe out a day s interest earnings holders of libra will have to live with some degree of nominal volatility even if it is small in terms of the defining currency basket market exchange rate changes among the constituent currencies mean that there will be slightly more volatility in terms of the dollar or any other single currency such a setup would be reminiscent of warren coats proposal for the imf to promote use the sdr basket a bundle of fiat currencies in defined weights as a unit of account and medium of redemption for private bonds and payment media on the microeconomics of bid ask spreads see original post

shortly after the boj followed the ecb in adopting a negative interest rate in 2016 lagarde praised the tool while saying more time is needed to assess its side effects that s an issue on the governing council s agenda now as officials consider whether to cut rates further and keep them below zero for longer while banks complain that negative rates effectively a charge on their overnight reserves hurt profitability the ecb says that s outweighed by the boost to the economy lagarde thought so as well if we had not had those negative rates we would be in a much worse place today with

repeated calls for governments to offer more support with better fiscal policies she has urged nations to strike a better balance between growth debt sustainability and social objectives monetary policy should remain accommodative where inflation is below target and should anchor expectations the reality is that many economies are not resilient enough high public debt and low interest rates

said mmt is no panacea she didn t reject it outright while it is tempting when you look at the sort of mathematical modelling of it and it seems to stand there are big caveats about it such as if the country is in a liquidity trap such as if there is deflation well then in those circumstances it could possibly work for a short period of time probably because interest rates stay low until such time

article article body on tuesday the reserve bank decided to cut the official interest rate for the second time in as many months this time by 25 basis points to 1 the cut brings the official cash rate to a new record low as longstanding pressure on the government to ramp up fiscal stimulus builds meeting in darwin the central bank board led by philip lowe said it hoped the lower rate would help eat up persistent spare capacity in the economy we should be able to achieve a lower rate of unemployment than we currently have and we should also be able to reduce underemployment lowe told a top end community dinner in the hours after the cut a lower official cash rate has at least historically correlated with higher inflation a consequence of a hotter or a faster growing economy it also devalues the aussie dollar which is money back in the pockets of many local businesses with australia being a net exporter others also benefit from more competitive domestic goods as imports become relatively more expensive feeling the software pinch but there are those watching the sliding aussie with a grimace local businesses pay software as a service saas companies for everything from email marketing to database management and the bill is going up prosper taruvinga says he s forking over hundreds of extra dollars for software each quarter as a result of the lower aussie because his providers are american companies billing in usd his business a melbourne based digital marketing agency is unable to trade without software services but has experienced a 5 6 increase in costs in the last year as the aussie has weakened it all adds up he tells smartcompany we ll see what we can cut and trim in january the australian dollar dropped to its lowest level against the american greenback in 10 years dipping below the 70 cent mark while performance has varied since then the aussie closed marginally lower than that at 0 696 cents on monday while not unusual for american companies to bill in their own currency there are also australian saas providers also charging in usd which taruvinga says is strange i d rather pay australian businesses using australian currency taruvinga says its better for the australian economy everyone is pulling their weight to build the country taruvinga isn t alone david pagotto founder of digital marketing agency sixgun has also experienced a hike in his software costs as the currency has weakened it s substantial pagotto tells smartcompany fees bite pagotto says he s been keeping a closer eye on currency fluctuations lately and while he accepts the fall of the aussie is outside his control it is prompting him to consider return on investment if costs are going up we would potentially look at other solutions he says compounding the issue both business owners say they re also copping international transaction fees from their banks sometimes in excess of 50 when transactions are substantial enough it s one of my pet hates pagotto says sometimes they really get you with those fees why do software companies charge in american dollars for both founders the increases will be filed under an increased cost of doing business american software platforms are a mainstay in most companies in their industry these days so they re not the only ones feeling the pinch but australian companies charging in american dollars for their software has left a bad taste in the mouths of more than one local small business owner in recent months as smartcompany reported earlier this year e commerce platform provider neto caused a furore among its own client base when it increased prices earlier this year at the same time switching to billing in american dollars the company cited a trend in the local saas industry as justification for the change arguing billing in usd has become the industry standard notably american listed but australian founded company atlassian has confirmed it bills local clients in american dollars while other software providers smartcompany spoke with also admitted to the practice nobby kleinman owner of wealth management software money rules says software companies who stick with the local currency risk restricting themselves to the australian market currency fluctuations do impact sales he tells smartcompany the international audience is far greater and they are already paying in usd startups feeling the pain too alan jones aussie angel investor and founder of m8 ventures says its very common for software companies around the world to charge in american dollars for most saas startups their biggest market will be in the us and us customers are unfamiliar with being billed in foreign currencies jones tells smartcompany jones says he s witnessed local startups miss out on business because prospective us clients didn t want to pay in aussie dollars but australian startups feel the pain of a weaker dollar as well he says most of them are paying multiple saas subscriptions each month that are billed in usd he explains not everyone is charging in usd though jacqui jones chief executive of cloud software company way we do charges in aussie dollars i personally hated paying extra for software due to the currency exchange jacqui tells smartcompany i wanted our local customers to be confident that their subscriptions were not increasing we wanted to provide consistency jacqui recently benefitted from the decision luring over a client from a us based service can do it just because they can and they see others in the marketplace selling in us dollars jacqui explains until australian businesses say they re not going to do that then australian software companies may not stop now read eleven things startups can do to get their pitch deck on point

seeing recent slowing of employment growth job growth slowed in may and the overall trend in hiring downshifted pointing toward further weakening for growth it has been argued that there are seasonal distortions in the initial estimate of q1 nonfarm payrolls data as each year during the post great recession era one month of q1 nonfarm payrolls typically has had a much larger or smaller change in payrolls than the other two months outside of q1 unusually volatile employment data is uncommon although it is typically attached to weaker gdp growth additionally weaker gdp growth rates are associated with higher recession probabilities which often indicate the need for a more accommodative monetary policy in november 2010 and september 2012 the fed announced second and third rounds of the quantitative easing program as an effort to stimulate the weakening economy in q4 2015 the fed projected three rate hikes in 2016 but ended up hiking only once at year end in light of slower growth overall softer employment data and further weakening in the economy could drive the fed to be more cautious about the outlook for growth causing markets to price in two rate cuts later this

opinion columnist get latest news by email subscribe powered by zimbabwe last week made its interim currency the rtgs dollar the country s sole legal tender drawing the curtains on a decade of united states dollar dominance harare was forced to abandon its own dollar in 2009 and adopt the greenback as its de facto medium of exchange in the face of hyperinflation and economic meltdown against this backdrop what could possibly go wrong it is probably no coincidence that zimbabwean president emmerson mnangagwa reportedly said last week that his government wanted to sell its ivory and rhino horn stockpiles with a price tag of us 600 million as his government brushes aside the us dollar for everyday transactions in favour of a curious currency called the rtgs real gross time settlement dollar it will need as much of the former as it can lay its hands on for the past decade zimbabwe has shared with ecuador and timor leste the dubious distinction of being a country without its own currency one forced to use the us dollar this prevents the central bank from hitting the press button on the printing presses and provides the economy with a currency that people actually have faith in in god we trust is the motto on us dollar notes in a dollarised economy in the dollar we trust could well be the motto zimbabwe was forced to ditch its own dollar in 2009 in favour of the greenback because no one trusted the former zimbabwe 100 trillion notes were printed as hyperinflation ravaged the land decimating savings and salaries as former president robert mugabe s policies reduced a once thriving economy to rubble adopting the us dollar was hardly a panacea and was clearly a sign that things had spun horribly out of control but it prevented a complete meltdown that would probably have emptied the country leaving it with more elephants than people at least there would have been lots of ivory to go around a decade later the government is trying to rollback dollarisation leaving the many zimbabweans of religious faith with only god to trust in they are trying to force people to use a currency that they don t want to use zimbabwean economist tony hawkins told business maverick basically the government is caught between a rock and a hard place the rock on the one side is re dollarisation which they are trying to avoid and the hard place on the other side is hyperinflation and the best way to avoid hyperinflation is with a stable exchange rate and this is a gamble to try and achieve that mnangagwa who came to power in late 2017 during a coup that overthrew mugabe has been known to take gambles and the stakes involved in this roll of the dice are extremely high mnangagwa has said that zimbabwe must bring back its own currency by the end of 2019 the price has already been high the central bank jacked interest rates to 50 from 15 in a bid to shore up the currency meanwhile inflation has raced to a 10 year high of 98 further sapping confidence in the currency as zimbabweans recall the hyperinflation that forced the economy into the greenback s embrace in may zimbabwe agreed to a staff monitored programme with the international monetary fund imf raising hopes that some sanity could be brought to economic policy the imf has said zimbabwe should allow a free float for the rtgs dollar in which most zimbabweans are paid but economists and investors have expressed surprise at the speed with which zimbabwe has rushed to make the currency the new reality not least because many goods and services remain priced in greenbacks it was always expected that they would go back to their own currency but this is sooner than what people expected hopefully the lessons learnt from the past are still fresh in their memory said a senior executive at a south african company that operates in zimbabwe the reasons for the haste to de dollarise are unclear perhaps it is the ruling zanu pf s own version of economic shock treatment to force the populace to accept it but weaning an economy off the dollar is an arduous process and the omens are not good in 2015 the imf published a paper titled dollarisation in sub saharan africa experience and lessons its definition of dollarisation was broad going beyond an economy such as zimbabwe s that had effectively killed its own currency to replace it with the dollar it considered an economy to be dollarised by use of a measure known as the dollarisation ratio the ratio of foreign currency deposits to total deposits if that exceeded 30 an economy was considered to be dollarised even from that base very few african economies that have been regarded as dollarised have successfully de dollarised angola and são tomé and príncipe are standouts in this regard countries that eventually managed to reduce significantly the use of foreign currencies were successful in implementing a sustained process of disinflation and stabilisation which in the end increases the attractiveness of using local currency the imf paper noted experience also shows that dollarisation is often difficult to reverse while the use of a foreign currency as a store of value or for domestic transactions has increased sharply in several countries over time there are fewer cases in which this trend has significantly been reversed memories of macroeconomic instability and hyperinflation the key factors that encourage dollarisation do not wither away easily encouraging economic agents to maintain foreign currency denominated assets even when macroeconomic conditions have stabilised and policy credibility has been established none of this bodes well for zimbabwe s current attempt to cut its us dollar dependence memories of the hyperinflation have not withered and policy credibility despite the imf agreement remains a long way off still there are some encouraging signs the interim currency has actually strengthened on the street in recent days from as low as 13 to the dollar to as high as seven according to one zimbabwe based journalist but it is early days yet other signs are more worrying the imf paper looking not just at africa but more broadly asked why did some of these candidates de dollarise while others did not inflation appears to have been the key six of the eight candidates that kept average inflation below 9 eventually de dollarised while seven out of the nine that did not failed to de dollarise with inflation almost in the triple digits and the searing memory of zimbabwean 100 trillion notes still fresh in the minds of many zimbabwe does not appear to be a good candidate at the moment
christine lagarde is both an arch globalist and a very trumpian pick to run the european central bank the international monetary fund chief was picked by european leaders to run the frankfurt based central bank taking over the top role from mario draghi like jerome powell whom president donald trump tapped to run the fed lagarde is a lawyer by training rather than an economist or a central banker once she receives final approval and takes office two of the world s most powerful central banks and the two biggest currency zones will be lead by non economists for the first time in modern history although she has been called an arch globalist lagarde is not blind to the costs of global trade on workers in the u s and the rest of the developed world but instead of advocating a trumpian policy of trade deals that create or protect good jobs she s argued for a european style welfare state higher minimum wages and direct financial support to compensate workers displaced by global trade instead of economic nationalism she supports a program she calls new multilateralism tackling inequality requires partnership lagarde said in a speech last year it requires governments the private sector and civil society working together to eradicate discrimination against women design the right labor market reforms and strengthen education training and social protection systems to include people not exclude them and prepare them for the coming technological transformation in other words the solution to problems created by globalism is to give the people more globalism good and hard prior to taking over the washington based imf eight years ago lagarde served as france s finance minister before that she spent her career as an antitrust attorney at the chicago based law firm baker mckenzie european leaders may hope that lagarde will repair the reputation of the ecb which has been accused both of impoverishing german savers with low interest rates and with hurting peripheral european economies with a too tight monetary policy lagarde was deeply involved with securing bailouts for the debts of ailing european economies particularly greece in the aftermath of the financial crisis although she has no monetary policy experience it is widely suspected she will be an interest rate dove and might support further interest cuts to stimulate europe s flagging economies the current ecb chief announced last month that he would begin a stimulus policy in the coming months a policy lagarde is expected to continue and perhaps expand trump has both criticized and praised the ecb move to ease monetary policy he has called it unfair to the u s pointing out that easing the stance of monetary policy in europe is likely to devalue to the euro and give european exports a boost over u s products he has also lamented the reluctance of the u s central bank to ease saying he wished he had a draghi running the fed mario draghi just announced more stimulus could come which immediately dropped the euro against the dollar making it unfairly easier for them to compete against the usa they have been getting away with this for years along with china and others donald j trump realdonaldtrump june 18 2019 it is likely that trump will see lagarde in a similar light if she continues draghi s stimulus plans if she truly ends up as supportive of stimulus as some expect trump might turn critical and accuse her of waging a currency war lagarde has been critical of trump and his trade policies prior to the 2016 election she launched a thinly veiled attack on the anti free trade sentiments expressed by us presidential candidate donald trump in a speech calling for globalisation to be made to work for all the guardian reported criticism of tariffs has become a recurrent theme for her throughout the trump presidency last month she said there is strong evidence that the united states china and the world economy are the losers from the current trade tensions just a few days ago largarde sparked controversy after a video clip released by french authorities showed her apparently reacting with a brief look of contempt or disdain to a comment made by ivanka trump in a conversation backstage at the g 20 meeting in japan lagarde has also lined up as an opponent of the growing populist wave around the globe which could limit her ability to repair the battered reputation of the ecb just prior to the 2016 brexit vote she implied pro brexit voters were narrow minded and called for a united europe under her leadership the imf also called for spain to admit millions of migrants to bail out its pension system critics accuse lagarde of coddling china in april lagarde praised china s efforts to stimulate its economy amid signs of stress from u s imposed tariffs but while she has often praised china s leaders she has also called for greater transparency in its economy and its belt and road lending to developing nations as head of the imf lagarde sought to give emerging economies such as china more say in how the fund operates bloomberg reports in 2016 lagarde appointed tao zhang a deputy governor of the people s bank of china as deputy managing director of the imf ms lagarde has spent much of the past five years working on both reassuring beijing of its importance and securing a greater voice for china within the imf and one that is

by ryan mckaken via mises on monday cnn reported on how in spite of all the talk about job growth in recent years wealth accumulation and incomes have been significantly and negatively impacted for many groups in the united states much of what the article explored has been emphasized ever since the great recession started the impact on younger earners for example has long been noted people entering the labor market during recessions have lower lifetime earnings what was most interesting about the cnn article however was its admission that a persistent low interest rate policy one pursued by the central bank since the 2008 financial crisis brings with it a serious downside in a section titled the mixed blessing of low interest rates author lydia depillis discusses how low interest rates have reduced the standard of living for those on mixed incomes and has destabilized pension funds low rates have also made big firms even bigger at the expense of smaller firms but just like taking painkillers for too long can have side effects the fed s monetary policy remedy gave rise to some unintended consequences for example low bond yields led the big funds that control trillions in investment to put their money into private equity and hedge funds that paid high rates as a result initial public offerings which allow a wider group of people to benefit from the creation of new businesses virtually dried up meanwhile low interest rates have been bad news for pension funds which mostly depend on bond yields in order to remain solvent public pensions assets amounted to just 66 of their liabilities in 2016 down from 86 in 2007 according to the pew charitable trusts for the 100 largest private pensions that ratio was 87 1 in 2018 according to the actuarial firm milliman compared to 105 7 in 2007 for retirees counting on fixed income securities like government bonds low interest rates can also mean a lower standard of living low interest rates while they have a lot of benefits have a lot of costs for society as well said kevin kliesen an economist at the federal reserve bank of st louis and that s just short term rates which the fed controls directly long term interest rates were in decline before the financial crisis and the ensuing recession depressed them even further fed officials are now struggling to nudge inflation up to their 2 target those low interest rates may be sapping the economy of its vitality one study published this year found that they give larger firms a greater incentive to invest than smaller ones that fuels market concentration and reduces business dynamism that is the ability of startups to disrupt incumbents as interest rates go down they disproportionately favor market leaders as opposed to market followers said atif mian a finance professor at princeton university who coauthored the study that effect he found is large enough for low interest rates to not have any expansionary effect on the economy any more there are three big takeaways here and it s surprising cnn has mentioned them low interest rates have produced a quest for yield that favors the wealthy over the middle class low interest rate policy hurts regular people who depend on fixed incomes and low risk sources of interest income low interest rates favor large established firms over startups in other words low interest rates favor the rich over the middle class while widening income gaps this won t be terribly surprising to those who follow the austrian school critique of ultra low interest and easy money policies although critics of markets and so called neoliberalism insist on ignoring the destructive power of central banks the fact remains expansionary monetary policy serves to increase income inequality while favoring the already wealthy in other words central banks are the cause of so much that capitalism is blamed for how central banks destroy wealth central bank policy is problematic in a variety of ways one of them not mentioned by the cnn report is the cantillon effects brought about through the creation of money which is used first by financial institutions closer to the central bank and the easy money spigots a scond problem results when a yield famine results from low interest rate policy but regular people can t afford fancy yield chasing investment products that are available to the wealthy thus ordinary people are left trying to gain interest income from government bonds savings accounts and cds in many cases this strategy may not even allow the investor to keep up with price inflation a third problem stems from issues on the production side of the economy we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us the cnn story notes a recent report suggesting large firms benefit more from low rates than small firms the report titled low interest rates market power and productivity growth by ernest liu atif mian and amir sufi found that the gap between the leader and follower increases as interest rates decline making an industry less competitive and more concentrated in other words low interest rates reduce competition and increase monopoly power of a small number of firms moreover the authors conclude their report introduces the possibility of low interest rates as the common global factor that drives the slowdown in productivity growth the mechanism that the theory postulates delivers a number of important predictions that are supported by empirical evidence a reduction in long term interest rates increases market concentration and market power in the model a fall in the interest rate also makes industry leadership and monopoly power more persistent the rise of low interest rate induced monopoly power then stifles innovation leading to lower productivity and slower global economic growth according to liu et al this is not limited to the united states it can be observed as a result of central bank policy worldwide last year analyst karen petrou described how low rates have favored large as our research shows qe exacerbates inequality because it takes safe assets out of the u s financial market driving investors into equity markets and other financial assets not only to place their funds but also in search of yields higher than those possible with ultra low rates the fed hoped that soaking up 4 5 trillion in safe assets would stoke lending and to a limited degree it did however new credit largely goes to large companies and other borrowers who have used it for purposes such as margin loans and stock buy backs not investment that would support strong employment growth growing household indebtedness in the u s is principally consumption or high price housing driven and thus also a cause not cure of inequality far from propelling middle class consumers to ever higher levels of prosperity low interest rate policy is leading either to stagnation of losses in wealth but these revelations should not be shocking after all edward wolff s 2014 article household wealth trends in the united states 1962 2013 suggests that our low interest rate world has done little to increase economic well being or counteract the effects of recessions from 2007 to 2010 house prices fell by 24 percent in real terms stock prices by 26 percent and median wealth by a staggering 44 percent median income also dropped but by a more modest 6 7 percent and median non home wealth plummeted by 49 percent the share of households with zero or negative net worth rose sharply from 18 6 to 21 8 percent however from 2010 to 2013 asset prices recovered with stock prices up by 39 percent and house prices by 8 percent despite this both median and mean wealth stagnated while median income was down by 1 3 percent but mean income rose by 0 9 percent the percent of households with zero or negative net worth remained unchanged according to wolf in this 2017 follow up as of 2016 median wealth was still down by 34 percent the evidence is mounting against the usual narrative which states that low interest rate policy has been a clear good because it has stimulated demand and consumption on the contrary there is reason to believe low interest rate policy has lowered productivity lessened economic growth and favored large firms at the expense of small firms and innovation median incomes have also suffered but central banks are clearly afraid to do anything but kick the low interest can down the road the fed s multi trillion dollar balance sheet isn t going anywhere and the fed has no appetite for raising rates but when the next recession hits it s likely the fed and the world s central banks will dish up more of the same near zero rates in the name of recovery and wealth creation but this strategy s record of delivering has been questionable at best

by ed stoddard zimbabwe last week made its interim currency the rtgs dollar the country s sole legal tender drawing the curtains on a decade of united states dollar dominance harare was forced to abandon its own dollar in 2009 and adopt the greenback as its de facto medium of exchange in the face of hyperinflation and economic meltdown against this backdrop what could possibly go wrong it is probably no coincidence that zimbabwean president emmerson mnangagwa reportedly said last week that his government wanted to sell its ivory and rhino horn stockpiles with a price tag of us 600 million as his government brushes aside the us dollar for everyday transactions in favour of a curious currency called the rtgs real gross time settlement dollar it will need as much of the former as it can lay its hands on for the past decade zimbabwe has shared with ecuador and timor leste the dubious distinction of being a country without its own currency one forced to use the us dollar this prevents the central bank from hitting the press button on the printing presses and provides the economy with a currency that people actually have faith in in god we trust is the motto on us dollar notes in a dollarised economy in the dollar we trust could well be the motto zimbabwe was forced to ditch its own dollar in 2009 in favour of the greenback because no one trusted the former zimbabwe 100 trillion notes were printed as hyperinflation ravaged the land decimating savings and salaries as former president robert mugabe s policies reduced a once thriving economy to rubble adopting the us dollar was hardly a panacea and was clearly a sign that things had spun horribly out of control but it prevented a complete meltdown that would probably have emptied the country leaving it with more elephants than people at least there would have been lots of ivory to go around a decade later the government is trying to rollback dollarisation leaving the many zimbabweans of religious faith with only god to trust in they are trying to force people to use a currency that they don t want to use zimbabwean economist tony hawkins told business maverick basically the government is caught between a rock and a hard place the rock on the one side is re dollarisation which they are trying to avoid and the hard place on the other side is hyperinflation and the best way to avoid hyperinflation is with a stable exchange rate and this is a gamble to try and achieve that mnangagwa who came to power in late 2017 during a coup that overthrew mugabe has been known to take gambles and the stakes involved in this roll of the dice are extremely high mnangagwa has said that zimbabwe must bring back its own currency by the end of 2019 the price has already been high the central bank jacked interest rates to 50 from 15 in a bid to shore up the currency meanwhile inflation has raced to a 10 year high of 98 further sapping confidence in the currency as zimbabweans recall the hyperinflation that forced the economy into the greenback s embrace in may zimbabwe agreed to a staff monitored programme with the international monetary fund imf raising hopes that some sanity could be brought to economic policy the imf has said zimbabwe should allow a free float for the rtgs dollar in which most zimbabweans are paid but economists and investors have expressed surprise at the speed with which zimbabwe has rushed to make the currency the new reality not least because many goods and services remain priced in greenbacks it was always expected that they would go back to their own currency but this is sooner than what people expected hopefully the lessons learnt from the past are still fresh in their memory said a senior executive at a south african company that operates in zimbabwe the reasons for the haste to de dollarise are unclear perhaps it is the ruling zanu pf s own version of economic shock treatment to force the populace to accept it but weaning an economy off the dollar is an arduous process and the omens are not good in 2015 the imf published a paper titled dollarisation in sub saharan africa experience and lessons its definition of dollarisation was broad going beyond an economy such as zimbabwe s that had effectively killed its own currency to replace it with the dollar it considered an economy to be dollarised by use of a measure known as the dollarisation ratio the ratio of foreign currency deposits to total deposits if that exceeded 30 an economy was considered to be dollarised even from that base very few african economies that have been regarded as dollarised have successfully de dollarised angola and sa o tome and pri ncipe are standouts in this regard countries that eventually managed to reduce significantly the use of foreign currencies were successful in implementing a sustained process of disinflation and stabilisation which in the end increases the attractiveness of using local currency the imf paper noted experience also shows that dollarisation is often difficult to reverse while the use of a foreign currency as a store of value or for domestic transactions has increased sharply in several countries over time there are fewer cases in which this trend has significantly been reversed memories of macroeconomic instability and hyperinflation the key factors that encourage dollarisation do not wither away easily encouraging economic agents to maintain foreign currency denominated assets even when macroeconomic conditions have stabilised and policy credibility has been established none of this bodes well for zimbabwe s current attempt to cut its us dollar dependence memories of the hyperinflation have not withered and policy credibility despite the imf agreement remains a long way off still there are some encouraging signs the interim currency has actually strengthened on the street in recent days from as low as 13 to the dollar to as high as seven according to one zimbabwe based journalist but it is early days yet other signs are more worrying the imf paper looking not just at africa but more broadly asked why did some of these candidates de dollarise while others did not inflation appears to have been the key six of the eight candidates that kept average inflation below 9 eventually de dollarised while seven out of the nine that did not failed to de dollarise with inflation almost in the triple digits and the searing memory of zimbabwean 100 trillion notes still fresh in the minds of many zimbabwe does not appear to be a good candidate at the moment business maverick

zimbabwe last week made its interim currency the rtgs dollar the country s sole legal tender drawing the curtains on a decade of united states dollar dominance harare was forced to abandon its own dollar in 2009 and adopt the greenback as its de facto medium of exchange in the face of hyperinflation and economic meltdown zimbabwe last week made its interim currency the rtgs dollar the country s sole legal tender drawing the curtains on a decade of united states dollar dominance harare was forced to abandon its own dollar in 2009 and adopt the greenback as its de facto medium of exchange in the face of hyperinflation and economic meltdown against this backdrop what could possibly go wrong by ed stoddard it is probably no coincidence that zimbabwean president emmerson mnangagwa reportedly said last week that his government wanted to sell its ivory and rhino horn stockpiles with a price tag of us 600 million as his government brushes aside the us dollar for everyday transactions in favour of a curious currency called the rtgs real gross time settlement dollar it will need as much of the former as it can lay its hands on for the past decade zimbabwe has shared with ecuador and timor leste the dubious distinction of being a country without its own currency one forced to use the us dollar this prevents the central bank from hitting the press button on the printing presses and provides the economy with a currency that people actually have faith in in god we trust is the motto on us dollar notes in a dollarised economy in the dollar we trust could well be the motto zimbabwe was forced to ditch its own dollar in 2009 in favour of the greenback because no one trusted the former zimbabwe 100 trillion notes were printed as hyperinflation ravaged the land decimating savings and salaries as former president robert mugabe s policies reduced a once thriving economy to rubble adopting the us dollar was hardly a panacea and was clearly a sign that things had spun horribly out of control but it prevented a complete meltdown that would probably have emptied the country leaving it with more elephants than people at least there would have been lots of ivory to go around a decade later the government is trying to rollback dollarisation leaving the many zimbabweans of religious faith with only god to trust in they are trying to force people to use a currency that they don t want to use zimbabwean economist tony hawkins told business maverick basically the government is caught between a rock and a hard place the rock on the one side is re dollarisation which they are trying to avoid and the hard place on the other side is hyperinflation and the best way to avoid hyperinflation is with a stable exchange rate and this is a gamble to try and achieve that mnangagwa who came to power in late 2017 during a coup that overthrew mugabe has been known to take gambles and the stakes involved in this roll of the dice are extremely high mnangagwa has said that zimbabwe must bring back its own currency by the end of 2019 the price has already been high the central bank jacked interest rates to 50 from 15 in a bid to shore up the currency meanwhile inflation has raced to a 10 year high of 98 further sapping confidence in the currency as zimbabweans recall the hyperinflation that forced the economy into the greenback s embrace in may zimbabwe agreed to a staff monitored programme with the international monetary fund imf raising hopes that some sanity could be brought to economic policy the imf has said zimbabwe should allow a free float for the rtgs dollar in which most zimbabweans are paid but economists and investors have expressed surprise at the speed with which zimbabwe has rushed to make the currency the new reality not least because many goods and services remain priced in greenbacks it was always expected that they would go back to their own currency but this is sooner than what people expected hopefully the lessons learnt from the past are still fresh in their memory said a senior executive at a south african company that operates in zimbabwe the reasons for the haste to de dollarise are unclear perhaps it is the ruling zanu pf s own version of economic shock treatment to force the populace to accept it but weaning an economy off the dollar is an arduous process and the omens are not good in 2015 the imf published a paper titled dollarisation in sub saharan africa experience and lessons its definition of dollarisation was broad going beyond an economy such as zimbabwe s that had effectively killed its own currency to replace it with the dollar it considered an economy to be dollarised by use of a measure known as the dollarisation ratio the ratio of foreign currency deposits to total deposits if that exceeded 30 an economy was considered to be dollarised even from that base very few african economies that have been regarded as dollarised have successfully de dollarised angola and sa o tome and pri ncipe are standouts in this regard countries that eventually managed to reduce significantly the use of foreign currencies were successful in implementing a sustained process of disinflation and stabilisation which in the end increases the attractiveness of using local currency the imf paper noted experience also shows that dollarisation is often difficult to reverse while the use of a foreign currency as a store of value or for domestic transactions has increased sharply in several countries over time there are fewer cases in which this trend has significantly been reversed memories of macroeconomic instability and hyperinflation the key factors that encourage dollarisation do not wither away easily encouraging economic agents to maintain foreign currency denominated assets even when macroeconomic conditions have stabilised and policy credibility has been established none of this bodes well for zimbabwe s current attempt to cut its us dollar dependence memories of the hyperinflation have not withered and policy credibility despite the imf agreement remains a long way off still there are some encouraging signs the interim currency has actually strengthened on the street in recent days from as low as 13 to the dollar to as high as seven according to one zimbabwe based journalist but it is early days yet other signs are more worrying the imf paper looking not just at africa but more broadly asked why did some of these candidates de dollarise while others did not inflation appears to have been the key six of the eight candidates that kept average inflation below 9 eventually de dollarised while seven out of the nine that did not failed to de dollarise with inflation almost in the triple digits and the searing memory of zimbabwean 100 trillion notes still fresh in the minds of many zimbabwe does not appear to be a good candidate at the moment business maverick

after a yearlong assault on the federal reserve and its chairman president donald trump has tapped two wildly different economists to the central bank s board who seemingly have one important thing in common they re both likely to support the president s call for lower interest rates one christopher waller is the more conventional choice drawn from within the fed s own ranks the other judy shelton has spent decades outside mainstream economics and has already faced criticism for some of her unconventional views on monetary policy waller is director of research for st louis federal reserve bank president james bullard who was the only dissenting vote in favor of a rate cut at the fed s meeting in june shelton who has been an informal adviser to trump has publicly said the central bank should reduce rates it seems like both are going to be in favor of lower rates and sooner rather than later said kathleen bostjancic an economist at oxford economics in new york they are much more dovish and obviously that s what president trump wants trump who announced his picks within minutes of each other on twitter tuesday has recently struggled to find candidates for the fed that are acceptable to senators who must confirm nominees the president previously advanced four people for the two remaining open seats on the board of governors none of them made it raising questions about the white house vetting process for his picks it was a great pleasure to meet with the president this afternoon shelton said in an email on tuesday night this president really gets it his pro growth economic agenda should not be undermined by wrongheaded phillips curve thinking that punishes productive economic growth and subverts continued gains while turning a blind eye to the currency impact of additional stimulus measures by other central banks we have high employment and low inflation so much for the supposed trade off the phillips curve holds that there s an inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation christopher waller david paul morris bloomberg senate confirmation as a high ranking fed staffer waller may have a better chance of passing muster with lawmakers than some of trump s previous contenders as for shelton the senate has already confirmed her in her current role as the u s executive director for the european bank for reconstruction and development her unorthodox views though could attract opposition in an interview with bloomberg in may she said she was highly skeptical that the goals for the fed set by congress the pursuit of maximum employment stable prices and moderate long term interest rates were relevant the white house has conducted the search for fed candidates as trump has repeatedly blasted fed chairman jerome powell over the fed s interest rate increases the president has told confidants that he believes he has the authority to replace powell as fed chairman demoting him to the level of board governor according to people familiar with the matter but trump said he doesn t plan to do it the president chose powell as chair replacing janet yellen last year judy shelton u s executive director for the european bank for reconstruction and development speaks during an interview in washington d c u s on wednesday may 29 2019 bloomberg judy shelton u s executive director for the european bank for reconstruction and development speaks during an interview in washington d c u s on wednesday may 29 2019 shelton a conservative economist whom the trump administration is considering for a vacancy on the federal reserve said the central bank should avoid restraining growth while the u s is engaged in a trade war with china photographer bloomberg bloomberg trump s eagerness to get rid of powell makes both of these nominees potential chairs in waiting a factor that may also affect their confirmation process in the senate powell has said he intends to serve his full four year term and that the law is clear on that issue earlier this year trump advanced two supporters for the fed board stephen moore and herman cain but both withdrew their names after they came under criticism st louis fed waller who declined to comment tuesday on his nomination is a ph d economist who previously served as a professor of economics at the university of notre dame before joining the st louis fed in 2009 his key research focus has been on monetary and macroeconomic theory and the political economy waller was approached by the white house last month about the job and met with trump tuesday said karen branding a spokeswoman for the st louis fed the overture came after the white house talked to his boss bullard about joining the fed board of governors himself but bullard told reporters last month that he s happy in his current position the two men are close and have co authored monetary policy papers waller shares and helped to develop in 2016 bullard s dovish view that policy is in a new regime in a world with low inflation and high savings where higher interest rates are not needed we didn t see any overheating in the economy coming and so the question was why are we raising rates waller recalled in a june interview with bloomberg we didn t see any reason to raise rates just for the sake of raising rates waller also said that he doesn t worry about pushing the unemployment rate too low and sparking higher prices we don t buy into the phillips curve story that low unemployment causes inflation look at japan he said fed policy shelton has a doctorate in business administration from the university of utah with an emphasis on finance and international economics she previously worked for the sound money project which was founded to promote awareness about monetary stability and financial privacy in her interview with bloomberg in may shelton questioned the use of the fed s basic interest rate tool to adjust the price of money and thereby guide an economy toward a sustainable level of growth a fed that is too eager to artificially put in an interest rate that isn t close to what the market would be suggesting is not so good she said at the time i would try to be the voice saying are you sure you know better than the markets shelton has also in the past argued for a return to a gold standard fixing the value of the u s dollar to a weight of gold a system the u s followed to varying degrees until 1976 if appointed to the fed however shelton said she would not call for a return to the gold standard or for a sudden abandonment of other established policies after raising interest rates last year in the face of criticism from trump powell and fellow fed colleagues are widely expected to cut rates at their next meeting at the end of this month with assistance from steve matthews christopher condon craig torres matthew boesler kathleen hays sarah mcgregor and saleha mohsin

after a yearlong assault on the federal reserve and its chairman us president donald trump has tapped two wildly different economists to the central bank s board who seemingly have one important thing in common they re both likely to support the president s call for lower interest rates one christopher waller is the more conventional choice drawn from within the fed s own ranks the other judy shelton has spent decades outside mainstream economics and has already faced criticism for some of her unconventional views on monetary policy waller is director of research for st louis federal reserve bank president james bullard who was the only dissenting vote in favor of a rate cut at the fed s meeting in june shelton who has been an informal adviser to trump has publicly said the central bank should reduce rates it seems like both are going to be in favor of lower rates and sooner rather than later said kathleen bostjancic an economist at oxford economics in new york they are much more dovish and obviously that s what president trump wants trump who announced his picks within minutes of each other on twitter tuesday has recently struggled to find candidates for the fed that are acceptable to senators who must confirm nominees the president previously advanced four people for the two remaining open seats on the board of governors none of them made it raising questions about the white house vetting process for his picks it was a great pleasure to meet with the president this afternoon shelton said in an email on tuesday night this president really gets it his pro growth economic agenda should not be undermined by wrongheaded phillips curve thinking that punishes productive economic growth and subverts continued gains while turning a blind eye to the currency impact of additional stimulus measures by other central banks we have high employment and low inflation so much for the supposed trade off the phillips curve holds that there s an inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation senate confirmation as a high ranking fed staffer waller may have a better chance of passing muster with lawmakers than some of trump s previous contenders as for shelton the senate has already confirmed her in her current role as the u s executive director for the european bank for reconstruction and development her unorthodox views though could attract opposition in an interview with bloomberg in may she said she was highly skeptical that the goals for the fed set by congress the pursuit of maximum employment stable prices and moderate long term interest rates were relevant the white house has conducted the search for fed candidates as trump has repeatedly blasted fed chairman jerome powell over the fed s interest rate increases the president has told confidants that he believes he has the authority to replace powell as fed chairman demoting him to the level of board governor according to people familiar with the matter but trump said he doesn t plan to do it the president chose powell as chair replacing janet yellen last year trump s eagerness to get rid of powell makes both of these nominees potential chairs in waiting a factor that may also affect their confirmation process in the senate powell has said he intends to serve his full four year term and that the law is clear on that issue earlier this year trump advanced two supporters for the fed board stephen moore and herman cain but both withdrew their names after they came under criticism st louis fed waller who declined to comment tuesday on his nomination is a ph d economist who previously served as a professor of economics at the university of notre dame before joining the st louis fed in 2009 his key research focus has been on monetary and macroeconomic theory and the political economy waller was approached by the white house last month about the job and met with trump tuesday said karen branding a spokeswoman for the st louis fed the overture came after the white house talked to his boss bullard about joining the fed board of governors himself but bullard told reporters last month that he s happy in his current position the two men are close and have co authored monetary policy papers waller shares and helped to develop in 2016 bullard s dovish view that policy is in a new regime in a world with low inflation and high savings where higher interest rates are not needed we didn t see any overheating in the economy coming and so the question was why are we raising rates waller recalled in a june interview with bloomberg we didn t see any reason to raise rates just for the sake of raising rates waller also said that he doesn t worry about pushing the unemployment rate too low and sparking higher prices we don t buy into the phillips curve story that low unemployment causes inflation look at japan he said fed policy shelton has a doctorate in business administration from the university of utah with an emphasis on finance and international economics she previously worked for the sound money project which was founded to promote awareness about monetary stability and financial privacy in her interview with bloomberg in may shelton questioned the use of the fed s basic interest rate tool to adjust the price of money and thereby guide an economy toward a sustainable level of growth a fed that is too eager to artificially put in an interest rate that isn t close to what the market would be suggesting is not so good she said at the time i would try to be the voice saying are you sure you know better than the markets shelton has also in the past argued for a return to a gold standard fixing the value of the us dollar to a weight of gold a system the us followed to varying degrees until 1976 if appointed to the fed however shelton said she would not call for a return to the gold standard or for a sudden abandonment of other established policies after raising interest rates last year in the face of criticism from trump powell and fellow fed colleagues are widely expected to cut rates at their next meeting at the end of this month bloomberg

opinion columnist get latest news by email subscribe powered by zimbabwe last week made its interim currency the rtgs dollar the country s sole legal tender drawing the curtains on a decade of united states dollar dominance harare was forced to abandon its own dollar in 2009 and adopt the greenback as its de facto medium of exchange in the face of hyperinflation and economic meltdown against this backdrop what could possibly go wrong it is probably no coincidence that zimbabwean president emmerson mnangagwa reportedly said last week that his government wanted to sell its ivory and rhino horn stockpiles with a price tag of us 600 million as his government brushes aside the us dollar for everyday transactions in favour of a curious currency called the rtgs real gross time settlement dollar it will need as much of the former as it can lay its hands on for the past decade zimbabwe has shared with ecuador and timor leste the dubious distinction of being a country without its own currency one forced to use the us dollar this prevents the central bank from hitting the press button on the printing presses and provides the economy with a currency that people actually have faith in in god we trust is the motto on us dollar notes in a dollarised economy in the dollar we trust could well be the motto zimbabwe was forced to ditch its own dollar in 2009 in favour of the greenback because no one trusted the former zimbabwe 100 trillion notes were printed as hyperinflation ravaged the land decimating savings and salaries as former president robert mugabe s policies reduced a once thriving economy to rubble adopting the us dollar was hardly a panacea and was clearly a sign that things had spun horribly out of control but it prevented a complete meltdown that would probably have emptied the country leaving it with more elephants than people at least there would have been lots of ivory to go around a decade later the government is trying to rollback dollarisation leaving the many zimbabweans of religious faith with only god to trust in they are trying to force people to use a currency that they don t want to use zimbabwean economist tony hawkins told business maverick basically the government is caught between a rock and a hard place the rock on the one side is re dollarisation which they are trying to avoid and the hard place on the other side is hyperinflation and the best way to avoid hyperinflation is with a stable exchange rate and this is a gamble to try and achieve that mnangagwa who came to power in late 2017 during a coup that overthrew mugabe has been known to take gambles and the stakes involved in this roll of the dice are extremely high mnangagwa has said that zimbabwe must bring back its own currency by the end of 2019 the price has already been high the central bank jacked interest rates to 50 from 15 in a bid to shore up the currency meanwhile inflation has raced to a 10 year high of 98 further sapping confidence in the currency as zimbabweans recall the hyperinflation that forced the economy into the greenback s embrace in may zimbabwe agreed to a staff monitored programme with the international monetary fund imf raising hopes that some sanity could be brought to economic policy the imf has said zimbabwe should allow a free float for the rtgs dollar in which most zimbabweans are paid but economists and investors have expressed surprise at the speed with which zimbabwe has rushed to make the currency the new reality not least because many goods and services remain priced in greenbacks it was always expected that they would go back to their own currency but this is sooner than what people expected hopefully the lessons learnt from the past are still fresh in their memory said a senior executive at a south african company that operates in zimbabwe the reasons for the haste to de dollarise are unclear perhaps it is the ruling zanu pf s own version of economic shock treatment to force the populace to accept it but weaning an economy off the dollar is an arduous process and the omens are not good in 2015 the imf published a paper titled dollarisation in sub saharan africa experience and lessons its definition of dollarisation was broad going beyond an economy such as zimbabwe s that had effectively killed its own currency to replace it with the dollar it considered an economy to be dollarised by use of a measure known as the dollarisation ratio the ratio of foreign currency deposits to total deposits if that exceeded 30 an economy was considered to be dollarised even from that base very few african economies that have been regarded as dollarised have successfully de dollarised angola and são tomé and príncipe are standouts in this regard countries that eventually managed to reduce significantly the use of foreign currencies were successful in implementing a sustained process of disinflation and stabilisation which in the end increases the attractiveness of using local currency the imf paper noted experience also shows that dollarisation is often difficult to reverse while the use of a foreign currency as a store of value or for domestic transactions has increased sharply in several countries over time there are fewer cases in which this trend has significantly been reversed memories of macroeconomic instability and hyperinflation the key factors that encourage dollarisation do not wither away easily encouraging economic agents to maintain foreign currency denominated assets even when macroeconomic conditions have stabilised and policy credibility has been established none of this bodes well for zimbabwe s current attempt to cut its us dollar dependence memories of the hyperinflation have not withered and policy credibility despite the imf agreement remains a long way off still there are some encouraging signs the interim currency has actually strengthened on the street in recent days from as low as 13 to the dollar to as high as seven according to one zimbabwe based journalist but it is early days yet other signs are more worrying the imf paper looking not just at africa but more broadly asked why did some of these candidates de dollarise while others did not inflation appears to have been the key six of the eight candidates that kept average inflation below 9 eventually de dollarised while seven out of the nine that did not failed to de dollarise with inflation almost in the triple digits and the searing memory of zimbabwean 100 trillion notes still fresh in the minds of many zimbabwe does not appear to be a good candidate at the moment
president donald trump has long been convinced that the united states is locked in an unfair trading relationship with china the u s has lost 500 billion a year for many years he has said several times in a possible reference to the balance of trade that showed the nation bought 420 billion more goods from china in 2018 than it sold trump has long touted china s huge exports to the u s as a sign that beijing has been taking advantage of american businesses for decades his determination to redress what he sees as an imbalance has resulted in an escalating trade war with stringent tariffs affecting not only the two countries economic outlooks but also the entire global economy and when he sits down with xi jinping on the sidelines of the g 20 summit being held june 28 and 29 in osaka japan all eyes will be on whether they can restart trade talks that collapsed amid a war of words in may while both sides have good economic incentives to return to free trade experts say the two superpowers also have good political reasons to hold firm and back up the tough rhetoric with action on the u s side the mood music was good with treasury secretary steven mnuchin saying wednesday that washington and beijing were almost done with their trade deal whatever happens next the u s china spat threatens to overshadow the meeting of some of the world s leading economies and crucial topics such as climate change and urgent reform of the world trade organization in may trump doubled u s tariffs on 200 billion of chinese goods to 25 percent and said he was prepared to slap the same tariff on the remaining 300 billion if there was no progress in talks the effect of this would be huge goldman sachs has warned it would cause global equity markets to fall by 4 percent the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd predicts that renewed tensions between the two countries could see global gross domestic product gdp drop by as much as 0 6 percent the chief economist of the international monetary fund imf gita gopinath said in a blog post in may that the trade war could significantly dent business and financial market sentiment disrupt global supply chains and jeopardize the projected recovery in global growth in 2019 low income households in the u s would be chief among those to suffer from increased prices if the tariff regime was extended she added that s why the mood music coming out of osaka the first official meeting between the two sides in months matters so much why has the dispute become so intense trump spoke so much about u s china trade on the campaign trail in 2015 that a three minute compilation video of him saying china went viral on social media and has since been viewed more than 15 million times a sign for the g 20 summit at a train station in osaka japan tomohiro ohsumi getty images and as promised he has delivered an anti globalization protectionist america first trade agenda billed as a policy that protects u s workers and businesses from unfair chinese practices not everyone believes trump s bold rhetoric will be met by further action there is a real question over whether the u s administration would really be willing to impose all of those i m dubious because this would involve putting tariffs on almost all of the rest of chinese imports said mike jakeman a senior economist at pwc the accountancy and consultancy company in london that would lead to domestic inflation and suddenly you ve got consumers who are quite angry as to why the cost of buying a new iphone has gone up appreciably he said and in an election year when trump has already talked about the economy extensively in his campaign he probably won t want that risk trump s twitter account hails u s economic success on a daily basis from record jobs numbers to stock market highs and it s this economic good fortune that allows him to treat china in terms of foreign policy not just economics jakeman added it s remarkable that trump has gone almost three quarters of the way through his term without really having a difficult decision to make about the economy he has enjoyed a really solid spell that s allowed him to pursue his foreign policy strategy he said national pride as for china the dispute is also about national pride as well as economic success posturing goes both ways and according to james mcgregor an american author journalist and businessman who has lived in china for more than 25 years and is currently chairman of the consulting firm apco worldwide china may have more time to spare despite its domestic economic slowdown the bremen express cargo ship prepares to dock at florida s portmiami which saw china as its top trading country in 2018 joe raedle getty images file i think we have to remember xi jinping does not have to get re elected in 2020 donald trump does and when there s more tariffs coming and they really hit the u s economy and the stock market takes a dive trump will want the stock market to go back up before his election he said so i do think china can be more patient than the u s on this because it s now wrapped up in chinese nationalism very tightly because of huawei he said referring to the huge chinese communications firm that in may was banned from doing business in the u s on whether china is being unfair to u s companies seeking to do business in the country as trump and others allege the picture is more complex the trump administration has made chinese compliance with ip laws a priority for any agreement on reducing or eliminating tariffs between the two countries and it has become a protectionist issue that underscores national pride for both leaders all the more so after trump banned huawei china s leading communications firm from doing business in the u s vicky pryce a former senior u k government economist and now a board member at the centre for economics and business research a london based consultancy said that while american consumers would ultimately be the ones to pay the price for higher tariffs the u s had been justified in taking china to task on various fronts president donald trump greets china s president xi jinping during a business leaders event at the great hall of the people in beijing on nov 8 2017 nicolas asfouri afp getty images file for one thing the government helps chinese companies in a variety of ways such as widespread hidden subsidies she said china has been opening up and so on but it has used all sorts of tricks that make it hard for anyone to see if they have been dumping goods and so on she said you can t say whether in an economic sense it s been wrong but the question is whether you go about it this way the issue of ip theft has long been a bone of contention for trump and for american businesses one third of whom say chinese firms have stolen from them at some point in the past decade at a cost of between 225 billion and 600 billion annually according to the office of the u s trade representative china needs to step up efforts in reform and opening up and carry out more policies in respecting and treating foreign companies and chinese companies as equal to create a better business environment said wei jianguo a former vice minister of commerce and the vice president of china international economic exchange center a government think tank the escalation of tariffs comes as the global economy faces the possibility of a downturn after picking up in 2016 and 2017 with investment and manufacturing stagnating economists generally define a global recession as when growth falls below 2 percent the imf is forecasting 3 6 percent for 2020 which is out of the danger zone but significantly below the 4 percent seen in 2017 so an economic cease fire between the two sides could be a much needed boost if there is suddenly a resolution of the trade problem then you could see a very substantial improvement pryce said i don t think it s a very happy environment at the moment

the following is a transcript of michael bennet s meeting with the los angeles times editorial board nicholas goldberg editor of the editorial pages why don t you just give us a short overview if you want of five minutes or so michael bennet great or i m happy to just answer your questions goldberg why don t you give us a short overview bennet so what i would say is that i was reading on the way in here some of gavin newsom s stuff during his campaign and was struck by how similar his observations were to what i think the national crisis is that we are facing we ve had 40 years of no economic mobility for the bottom 90 of americans advertisement we re spending a lot of time the last few days talking about busing 50 years ago but we have a system of public education today that is reinforcing the income inequality that we have we lack universal healthcare we re not doing anything about climate and i think that there is a real opportunity to make some fundamental changes to the way our economy works to change the trajectory that we ve had so that when the economy grows everybody benefits from it if i had to sum up my last 10 years of town halls it would be that people in colorado who are working really hard in an economy that s doing really well compared to most other economies around the country and around the world what they re saying to me is they can t afford some combination of housing healthcare higher education and early childhood education and that s because their wages have basically been flat and the cost of those things has gone like this over quite a long period of time and therefore they can t afford a middle class life and they re worried about that and i think that s really creating a lot of stress on the democracy i ll come back to that in a second the people that aren t coming to my town halls who are the parents and kids that i used to work for when i was superintendent at the denver public schools are finding it impossible to escape poverty in america and that s been true for a long time i think that the american people in the last election understood this the democrats were left without much of an economic case donald trump saw that stagnation and ran on it and in part that s why the american people voted for him i think they also voted for him because they believe that washington was working on a whole set of priorities that had nothing to do with them and having been there the last 10 years i would have to concede that fact advertisement i think that we were broken before donald trump got there and he s made matters much worse than they were before he got there but we were paralyzed and we were paralyzed and immobilized by a tyranny that we haven t seen in a long time in america this one brought on by the freedom caucus and by citizens united and the effect of the koch brothers money on our electoral process so i think we have a bunch of things we need to do to reform the way the democracy works before we re going to be able to deliver a meaningful change on healthcare on housing on climate but i think we can do it i m optimistic that we can the time that i ve been there has been enough time to see how to get things done in washington but also to understand why we don t actually address the really big things that we need to do and watching donald trump either distract us for seven months on 6 billion for his wall while the chinese are building 3 500 miles of fiber optic cable connecting africa to latin america to china or watching him stumble around at north korea this weekend gives such a sense of the opportunity cost of having somebody in this job who s not competent to do it at a moment in world history when i think american leadership is needed more than it s ever been before advertisement and the waste of time has been catastrophic from the point of view of the middle class in this country but from the vantage point of the kids that i worked for in denver it s much more than a waste of time it s a question whether they are going to be able to contribute to the democracy and contribute to this economy during their lifetimes so that s why i decided to run norman pearlstine executive editor you didn t think that his presence in the dmz was legendary michael bennet it was a legendarily bad way to negotiate is the way i would put it the guy s already conceding on sanctions this morning in the newspaper it s stunning it s staggering mariel garza editorial writer how would you handle it how would you handle north korea and iran bennet well on north korea i wouldn t meet with kim jong un until there was a predicate to have a real discussion and that would require much lower level discussions over a much longer period of time i wouldn t go there and put my arm around him and say we were in love i wouldn t write letters this is a fairly low standard but this is what we ve been reduced to i think that it is a profound threat advertisement what you re seeing in donald trump is a reaction to a conversation he had with barack obama in the oval office as barack obama was kindly turning the keys over to donald trump and saying is the biggest threat that the world faces donald trump was using that as an opportunity to become a showman in his three ring circus and he is compelled to try to fix this because this will show that barack obama was a failure and that s something that he is compelled by when he flew back from that last summit in singapore he tweeted out to america you can sleep tonight there s no need to worry that s what he said and north korea hasn t relented at all on its nuclear program the intelligence is very clear on that i m not saying anything that i know from being on the intelligence committee but the public reporting is very clear on that and him stumbling through the dmz isn t going to help our negotiation so we need to engage china obviously in this discussion and south korea and japan and i think in the end it s going to be very hard to get to actually give up their nuclear weapons but we ve got to make sure that we constrain their development and their ability to locomote them from where they are to here or japan or any other place advertisement as for iran i was up for election in 2016 when we voted for the iran deal and i voted for it after spending six months thinking about it and meeting with people and having discussions there were things that i wished that we d done a better job of negotiating like the term of the deal it also would have been great to been able to do something about iran s ballistic missile program in that negotiation i think the obama administration would say that if we had put that on the table the iranians would ve wanted other stuff on the table which makes sense to me i wasn t at the negotiating table but those are some things that i would have liked to have seen changed when i voted for it and then ran for reelection in a swing state it was by the way the one thing that i couldn t recover from i write about this in my book the polling showed that if i voted for the iran deal and they were able to attack me on that score i couldn t come back from that as it turned out iran complied with the deal that s what the intelligence agencies all said that s what the israelis said that s what our agency said the chinese and the russians said the same thing and a bunch of stuff that was unknowable when i voted for it was now knowable by the time donald trump blew the deal up and what it all adds up to is instead of being two to three months away from breaking out to a nuclear weapon iran was then a year away from breaking out to a nuclear weapon which matters a lot because that gives an american president the time if they decide they are going to break out to try to coalesce our allies in a response and we no longer have that time because of what donald trump has done and getting out of the iran deal because you didn t like it is a little bit like getting out of a lifeboat when there s no other lifeboat in sight now he s flailing around advertisement goldberg so he s flailing around on the foreign policy stage and he is alienating a lot of allies in the process what would you do as president to begin to restore the united states stature gravitas and the relationships that have been damaged bennet well first of all this deal is key to that maybe there s an opportunity to craft a deal with iran that s better for the u s and that might turn out to be a deal that s better for iran too and the allies are a key to that because of the way that the obama administration mobilized the europeans and even china and russia and india in the context of that deal that would be a very fertile place for us to start or restart with our allies second i d say that everybody in the world takes seriously what russia is trying to do to western democracies including the united states and europe except for donald trump as far as i can tell and the republican party which has now become trump s party also is now in this mindset that somehow the russians are better allies to us than democrats somehow we have to overcome that that s a fox news problem too but the fragility of western democracy and the intensity with which the russians are trying to attack us presents us an opportunity to once again lead this western alliance this transatlantic alliance when we were asked the other night at the debates what we thought our biggest national security threat was i said russia and i believe that because our democracies are becoming less stable than they were and are trying to take advantage of it advertisement i have a document that i ve collected of the russian propaganda that for a year was suffused inside of our own political vocabulary and we couldn t distinguish between that propaganda as russian propaganda and our own political discourse that raises a whole question about our political discourse in my mind but it also raised a question about our vulnerabilities to russia so i think that s another place where the europeans are looking for us to lead and we can lead and it will be welcome to have a president who s not badgering europe all the time as if nato doesn t provide us national security that we don t benefit from it which is what trump is basically arguing and third i think another opportunity is with china because that s one where i think trump was right to call the question because china had so abused the world s trading environment ever since they ve gotten into the world trade organization and we really hadn t pushed back on that in terms of intellectual property theft and state sponsored industries and sectors and ownership requirements those kinds of things all of which are a real problem and i think that presents america with an amazing opportunity to lead not just with the usual allies but other people as well because there s virtually no country in the world that has an interest in china being able to perpetuate and perpetrate the trading practices that they re engaged in really the only ones i can come up with are north korea and russia europe has exactly the same equities we have the african and latin american countries i think have equities in this deal as well and the asian countries have no interest living in a unipolar world that s dominated by china they don t want to live in a unipolar world that s dominated by us but they know that s not what the world s going to be the question is will there be a multi polar world or a bipolar world where they benefit from that so i think there s a lot of interest among asian countries to engage in a coalition here that pushes back advertisement jon healey deputy editorial page editor if i can jump on another point did you support the trans pacific partnership bennet i didn t support tpp it was at the end of the 2016 election and i was carrying the iran deal around with me just be honest about it and i think that we have to resuscitate the negotiations around tpp and the american people we need the american people to know that the countries that were part of that agreement went ahead without us and i think as i was just saying i think we ve got obviously really serious geopolitical interest in that part of the world that we need to make sure we protect healey president xi has held himself out as the defender of globalism and multilateralism bennet yep healey president trump is not a believer in multilateral trade agreements nevertheless there is a lot of support for china s notion of globalism if not for the idea of having to compete with china s subsidized state owned industries so how do you reinsert the united states in the global trade conversation when we have been saying for the past three and a half years that we don t believe in these deals advertisement bennet right i think we need a president who believes in that i believe in that and i think that humanity has a big stake in this it s not just us it s humanity these guys are running a surveillance state in china and they re looking to perfect it and export it by expanding that surveillance state which is what this huawei stuff is all about you go to africa and china s everywhere you get elected to office in africa and by the time you get back from your election celebration party there is a plane ticket sitting on your desk waiting for you to go to beijing and nowhere we re literally nowhere and i think it s not acceptable pearlstine did you ever find anyone who actually understood tpp in your state bennet no actually that s not true the farmers and ranchers in my state understood it pearlstine did they know that china s not a part of it i was on the floor in philadelphia and i went around to everybody i saw with the sign that said no tpp and i asked what s tpp and i never did get an answer from anyone carrying the sign there bennet i did vote for tpa by the way but not tpp goldberg clearly there s something of a war on for the soul of the democratic party you have for lack of a better word moderate candidates and you have progressive candidates you have people talking about incremental change and you have people talking about radical transformative change where do you put yourself on that spectrum why is that an important battle to be had and where do you come down advertisement bennet i think the democratic party needs to stand for opportunity i believe this country needs transformational change i think we need universal healthcare in this country i think we need an education system that actually gives kids hope that they re going to be able to participate in this country s democracy and in our economy it doesn t today i think we have to be aggressive on climate but i believe that we need to do this by creating a politics that unifies the country that can overcome the division that trump represents and overcome the division that the tea party and the freedom caucus represent just to take one example we have a climate denier in the white house being a climate denier should be disqualifying to be president politically the majority of people believe climate change is real the majority of the people believe it s an urgent problem that has to be fixed the majority of people believe that humans are contributing to it but we have a climate denier in the white house because democrats lost the economic opportunity to donald trump that should never have happened and i don t want it to happen again we should be able to win that argument and it s so blatantly absurd considering what s happening in california or in colorado or florida advertisement the consequences of not dealing with climate change are so devastating to our economy that this ought to be a relatively easy case for us to make i believe that democrats need to be much more strategic than we ve been when it comes to climate when it comes to judges when it comes to our economic proposals and i think that if you can figure out who s moderate and who s progressive in this field i think that would be an interesting service because i m hearing people who are proposing regressive strategies like loan forgiveness for everybody in america instead of anything to do with kids that are marooned in the los angeles unified school district or the denver public schools or for the 70 of kids that graduate from high school and don t go to college but can t earn anything more than minimum wage because we have no system in america to give people skills and knowledge that they need that would be transformational in our economy in the way that in world war ii or right before world war ii we started making people go to high school we passed the gi bill and women and people of color began to access higher education in a way that they had never done before we could transform our economy again it transformed our economy then so i don t know where i consider myself on that spectrum i read a newspaper headline that described me as a pragmatic idealist and i said i ll take that and i think if you re going to be call yourself a progressive you d better be able to make some progress advertisement goldberg so you re saying that the difference between the democratic candidates is primarily strategic what s the nature of your strategy that s different from that of bernie sanders bennet so let me give you an example bernie sanders believes that the answer to getting to universal healthcare is medicare for all and i assume the seven other six other candidates in this race that have endorsed that legislation have read it the legislation takes insurance away from 180 million people in america who get it from their employer many of whom like their insurance the legislation takes away medicare advantage from 20 million americans that have it and that love it the legislation takes insurance away from every single labor union in america that s negotiated healthcare benefits the legislation ignores the fact that 65 of people on medicare actually buy private insurance as part of it in fairness to bernie the reason that he s done that is that bernie is saying my insurance is better than all the other insurance and that s why i m making illegal and he s right it is that s a correct statement it is a cadillac of health insurance advertisement but you can t win a senate race in colorado running on that platform you can t run a senate race in arizona running on that platform you can t run a senate race in north carolina running on on that platform the afl cio won t support that platform so you don t even have democrats unified much less the rest of the country unified whereas i think that if you went out and said here s a public option that actually creates the opportunity for every family in america who wants to buy a public option instead of their private insurance the opportunity to do that that s something that would be supported broadly i believe and is supported broadly in the polling as opposed to medicare for all my version of that is called medicare for x and it starts in rural counties where there s one or fewer insurers and then works its way out to everybody over the course of three years those rural places are places where 10 years ago they would ve said we don t want your bolshevik plan as part of the affordable care act today they re saying to me thank you for thinking of us we really appreciate the fact that you thought of us and the problems that we re confronting goldberg at the end of three years it rolls out to everybody as an option bennet as an option for everybody yeah by the way it actually nets out well for the treasury according to the congressional budget office when it scored the original public option during the affordable care act discussions it nets out well because there would be fewer people getting subsidies for expensive private insurance on the exchange and because people pay in premiums to pay for medicare as opposed to medicare for all which costs 33 trillion over a 10 year period advertisement jon healey that s predicated on the assumption that employers don t drop their insurance coverage bennet who s this healey the cbo it costs you money if more people come into the program from employer plans bennet that s possible i d have to go back and look at that that s possible i don t think it would be a bad thing for america though the bigger pool the bigger the public pool the better for a lot of reasons but you raise a very important point about healthcare which has not been raised much in this debate which is that getting hold of the cost is still as significant as it was when we passed the affordable care act both for families and for our nation who are spending twice as much as any other industrialized country in the world i ll give you another example i ve got a bill called the american family act that would dramatically increase the child tax credit and would pay it out on a monthly basis so families would get 300 250 a kid it s fully refundable so all the millions of people that don t benefit from it today would have the benefit of it professors who looked at it from columbia said that bill alone would reduce childhood poverty in america by 40 it would end 2 a day childhood poverty in america it would cost 3 of the 33 trillion that medicare for all costs and you wouldn t have to add a single bureaucrat to the federal government to administer it advertisement now i don t know whether that s moderate or not but i think that s the most significant anti poverty program that anybody has offered in this country since medicaid was passed that s how i feel about it i think we re going to have a good competition of ideas in this primary i do think that because of the changing media landscape the collapse of a lot of printed journalism in this country and the influence of cable tv and social media there has been the creation of a twitter base of the party that is very distinct in my mind from the voter base of the democratic party extremely distinct from the people that i meet in iowa new hampshire south carolina and colorado robert greene editorial writer how important is it the twitter base as a political force michael bennet i think it s something to be contended with but i think we need a nominee who s going to be able to resist it the thing about it is that every single day the subject is something new it s here today and gone tomorrow we need to be thinking about where we want to be because the number one thing the democrats want to do and the number one thing i want to do is beat donald trump that is the number one thing that we need to do there s a lot of other stuff i want to do like put the country in the position to govern itself again which we haven t been able to do for the last 10 years advertisement mariel garza on the question of electability do you think you re more electable than all the other candidates who are running bennet i do garza and why bennet well because i m the only one that s won two tough national races in a swing state in the middle of the country the first race that i ran there was more outside money spent in my race than on any other race in the country it was 2010 the rise of the tea party was happening it was a horrible year for democrats we barely held on because i won and harry reid won and patty murray won and chris coons was running against someone who had to say she wasn t a witch we held on to the democratic majority and by the way that was after i voted for the affordable care act and i was running on a platform of making sure that we protected women s reproductive choice in this country it wasn t an issue i was hiding from and then again in 2016 having voted for the iran deal and some other things i was able to stand and win it s never pretty it s always tough but no one else in this race can say that i think my work in the private sector and my work in being superintendent of denver public schools gives me a different perspective on what the country is facing the challenges that we re facing than other candidates in the field have and i ve got a record too in the senate of bipartisan accomplishments that i think will wear well in the course of the campaign advertisement hall are you saying that you think you can get republicans moderate republicans to vote for you as well as democrats bennet i m saying first of all that i actually think i m where the base of the democratic party is i m not where the twitter base of the democratic party is i confess that i do think i have the opportunity to peel off independents and then republicans to beat trump which is what we have to do i mean his base is going to be completely galvanized goldberg can you talk a little bit about this paralysis in washington that s been so devastating nothing s gotten done except for obamacare and the tax cuts in eight or 12 years how would you be different how would you get things moving again how would you make the kind of meaningful and transformative change you re talking about advertisement bennet first of all everything you said is literally right i would add i guess one addendum which is that we passed dodd frank which wasn t nothing and president obama saved the economy with some of the things he did with no help at all from the freedom caucus who were calling him a bolshevik and a socialist and all the rest it turns out they re the bolsheviks and the socialists but i ll come to that in a minute look first of all we have to recognize that we have this challenge to begin with the idea that the vice president says if we just get rid of trump then it will all go back to normal or the way it was that doesn t even reflect the history of the obama administration the last six years of that administration we were paralyzed we were immobilized and who was paralyzing and immobilizing us it was mitch mcconnell and the freedom caucus those guys appeared as the tea party in 2010 a reactionary force against the election of barack obama i think most americans didn t see that coming i did not see it coming i did not see the election of donald trump coming either we thought we were immune i don t think anybody was having any explicit conversations but i think implicitly we thought we were immune from those sorts of forces of reaction which are something you ve seen in latin america or you ve seen in europe but we really haven t seen here in recent eras advertisement their platform had many different components not paying taxes was one the affordable care act was another budget deficits allegedly were a concern that they had but really what it was about in my mind was destroying the federal government immobilizing the federal government and they had adopted they had essentially adopted lock stock and barrel sarah palin s cartoon version of what the founding fathers were engaged in in their mind they were engaged in dismantling a country not building a country or creating a country their ideological commitments which were far outside the mainstream of conventional american political thought including conventional republican thought led them to pursue a legislative tyranny that made it impossible for the obama administration to get done what it needed to get done but even worse than that they drove the american people s confidence down and down and down in our exercise in self government we re now at a 9 approval rating i have spent in the 10 years that i ve been in the senate 40 of the time we ve been in a continuing resolution we haven t even had a real budget or appropriations process and when i walk through the denver international airport which i used to do wanting to put a paper bag over my head because i was so embarrassed about the hijinks that were going on back there and my association with it i wondered why would anybody want to work in a place that has a 9 approval rating advertisement it turns out there s an answer to that which is if you think you ve been sent there to destroy it having a 9 approval rating suits you perfectly every time we have a government shutdown every time the fiscal cliff is going to be gone over every time you can create mayhem you do then mitch mcconnell who doesn t really care about any of that stuff particularly but he doesn t care that it s happening either looks for the opportunity to find a world where we are putting more right wing judges on the courts and he s cutting taxes are borrowing 5 trillion from the chinese and sticking our kids with the bill for the privilege of giving 5 trillion of tax cuts almost all of which have gone to the wealthiest people in america and exacerbated the income inequality we have advertisement we spend 5 6 trillion in the middle east trump says it s 7 trillion borrowed it all sticking them with the debt we ve spent 12 or 13 trillion while we ve been on autopilot or completely immobilized from the vantage point of the kids in my old school district or anybody in america looking for opportunity or the desire to have an economy that when it actually grew again all of america could participate in it we might as well have lit that money on fire so when joe biden and i get into an argument the other night about the fiscal cliff this is what that s all about that was a deal that was a terrible deal for the country it was a terrible deal for democrats it was cut at two in the morning it was voted on nobody had read it i was one of three democrats who voted against it one of eight senators who voted against it this book which i wrote is called the land of flickering lights the title is drawn from that night the title is drawn from that deal if you want to read about it it s in there they come in they surf in with this reactionary reality they surf in with the immobility they surf in with the structural impediments that are built into our system to give a minority a minority if they choose to use the veto the hastert rule being the best example that prevented the comprehensive immigration bill advertisement i was part of the gang of eight that wrote that bill in 2013 that made it impossible for us to pass comprehensive immigration reform in this country not because the country didn t want it not because the country didn t need it not because the country didn t support it but because a minority of a minority in the house were operating under a rule named for a guy who s in jail for whatever denny hastert is in jail for and they were basically able to bring down boehner and they were able to make paul ryan s life an abject misery while this is all happening we have these profound structural challenges to our democracy the supreme court is deciding citizens united in 2010 the same year that the tea party is rising that gives the fossil fuel industry particularly the koch brothers an advantage that nobody in modern american history has enjoyed to distort our politics and to create what i describe as a corruption of inaction in washington advertisement the supreme court was completely obsessed by this idea that what we re supposed to defend against in our campaign finance system is a world of quid pro quo corruption where you give me 5 000 and i go write a bill that benefits you and they said well that s a problem we re going to have to allow congress to govern that and they said you know what even the appearance is a problem you give me five grand and i go write a bill that s good for you even if it s quid pro quo but it s the appearance we should regulate that but if it s an independent expenditure by billionaires into a committee that s run by the staff of a senator who s running for president that s okay with us that happened simultaneously with the rise of the tea party i think they simultaneously occurred and that s what has created so much when i say corruption of inaction the best example of that is how do you get a republican party to go from richard nixon with the epa richard nixon signing the clean air act and the clean water act ronald reagan closing the hole in the ozone layer both bushes supporting the idea that we had to do something about climate change and actually providing leadership at the white house john mccain running his president campaign on climate change to a world where everybody in washington who s elected republican has signed a pledge that says climate change isn t real and we can t do anything about it advertisement on top of that you got the attack on voting rights best represented by shelby vs holder and now the courts saying we can t do anything about political gerrymandering in the wake of all that or at the same time this was all happening we had that incredible gerrymandering in 2010 a long way of saying that s what we re contending with and to me the only way you re going to overcome it is by building a broad coalition of americans that are unified against a broken washington and insist that this exercise in self government belongs to us it doesn t belong to msnbc and fox doesn t belong to twitter it doesn t belong to the special interests or to the koch brothers it belongs to us and we have a fundamental responsibility as citizens to rise to this challenge to save our democracy the way other generations of americans have risen in their own time the case i argue in the book is that when you think about what the founders accomplished they did two really incredible things they liberated us through an armed insurrection against a colonial power they drafted a constitution which enshrined a set of eternal rights and mechanisms for us to resolve our disputes and that s pretty amazing they also perpetuated human slavery which was devastating but other americans over time fulfilled their responsibility advertisement and i think somebody like frederick douglass who was born a slave and helped transform the abolitionist movement by arguing that the constitution was actually an anti slavery document not a pro slavery document was able to grab the power of those ideas for his movement in my mind he s a founder as well and that has led me to conclude that that s what s required of us that being a citizen in this democratic republic one needs to think of oneself as a founder you guys know that better than anybody else i mean the significance of the role you play in this moment in american history and what it should be forcing everybody who s in the news media to ask themselves about whether they re doing everything they can do just like everybody who s in my job should be asking are we doing everything we can do to save american democracy this is a massive test that we re facing healey so do you think the fix is legislative constitutional bennet i think the fix is a little bit of everything it is a democratic party that stands for unifying the country that stands for creating opportunity and it is not making policy proposals that can t even unify democrats much less the rest of the country we should be able to do that because the guy in the white house has pursued a policy agenda that is the dream of the freedom caucus this isn t even ronald reagan s republican party anymore this is trump s party and on all these dimensions he s so far outside the mainstream that you d think we could actually overcome his ideas with our ideas advertisement don t know whether we will but we might it s constitutional let s overturn citizens united that would be a worthy political exercise to organize the american people and the states to do it it would take a long time to do it goldberg to pass a constitutional amendment bennet yeah it would take a long time to do it well i roll my eyes on ending the electoral college but not on citizens united i think the opportunity there is for people to see that they re more important than money in politics and they can have a role to play here as i say it s going to take a long time it s statutory ending political gerrymandering i ve had that bill in the senate for years it s a version of the bill that nancy pelosi passed as part of her package we could pass a statute tomorrow and end political gerrymandering in america advertisement carla hall editorial writer do you think the electoral college is ok bennet no i would prefer not to have it there but i ve got other priorities like ending political gerrymandering goldberg didn t barack obama do his best to create a central coalition to work across the aisle to talk to his adversaries and find himself totally stymied bennet yeah i want to be very clear about this you can t negotiate with mitch mcconnell and you can t negotiate with the freedom caucus unless you re negotiating with mitch mcconnell from a position of strength i saw mcconnell when i was putting out the book and i said to him and i don t have much of a relationship with him i said it s pretty tough on you and he said oh that s ok you re running for president and i m sure that s why you did it and i said come to think of it you re probably the only guy in the senate who will like the book because i say things like mitch mcconnell is impervious to give and take unless he s taking everything which is almost always the case advertisement and so let s take the fiscal cliff deal that was a deal where we decided to extend almost all the bush tax cuts we put in place the sequester that s what that deal accomplished that deal stripped from the democrats an economic argument that said we have a different approach to this than george bush did and we ran against this barack obama ran against this twice and we were left going to 2016 with no argument in this case we have arguments we ve got the arguments that i m making on the child tax credit you got the arguments that sherrod brown and i are making on the earned income tax credit you got arguments for paid family leave you ve got arguments for raising the minimum wage we ve got coherent arguments that i think are frankly to the left of where president obama was in terms of his arguments when he was running and i think that s right and that s where we should be and we should have a coherent set of arguments that hillary clinton did not advance during her campaign i think barack obama believed that when he was reelected president the fever would break that s what he said and that s what he said before the election that s what we said after the election we now know that s not the case the fever didn t break my hope is the best way of doing this would be to dislodge mitch mcconnell by creating a democratic majority in the senate advertisement if we re going to do that we re going to need to attend to that in this race in other words we re going to need somebody at the top of the ticket that can talk to the states that give us that majority and we re going to need candidates in those states running on a democratic agenda where we can be convincing in those states that s the most important thing we could do to overcome the logjam that we have if we fail to do that and mitch mcconnell is still in the majority when we re doing stuff like repealing the trump tax bill i think a president needs to be out in america when he s doing that showing the american people in rural parts of the state what the math looks like because the math of trump s bill is so atrocious that the math of a replacement bill is clearly better for other people you re never going to get fox news to report that but you are going to be able to go do it yourself with the bully pulpit i don t think the obama administration did much of that i by the way have a very very high personal regard for barack obama until it was too late i think none of us had an appreciation for how willing these people were going to be to dismantle our exercise in self government now we know now we ve got some history and we re going to have to construct a politics that overcomes it advertisement and the american people are going to have to understand what the cost is to our children and to our role in the world and to our democracy if we don t do it and i don t think that s well understood today by the american people i hope that s something that we ll be able to talk about during this presidential election greene what do you do about all those democrats i don t think they re all in the twitter base but maybe who say well so if you win and you get both houses then don t reach across the aisles scorched earth absolutely what the republicans have done to us i think you re articulating a different approach but you ve got so many democrats who say no no no bennet i don t think you can sustain this if what we think we can do is just replace their version of one party rule with a preferred version of one party rule i think that that s the beginning of the end of our democracy advertisement scott martelle editorial writer well it s already over isn t it bennet what martelle it s already over isn t it you mentioned this bennet i refuse to accept martelle you mention that the tea party surfed in they got elected and got reelected and got reelected in an electorate where even in the most competitive presidential races north of 40 of the voting eligible people don t even come out bennet you might be right that it s over i don t accept that it s over but think about what helped them get elected and reelected and reelected gerrymandering that should never have been the law of our land but is the law of our land the ability of the koch brothers to threaten just by rattling the coins in their pocket it s no more than that and when you look at what happened mike lee beating bob bennett in utah on a saturday morning at a barely attended convention and rand paul beating whoever it was he beat in kentucky and you go down the list of people under these circumstances i guess what i would say is i expect more of ourselves than that i expect us to be able to beat that not democrats i mean america to overcome it advertisement and in my state which is 1 3 democratic 1 3 republican and 1 3 independent i don t think people are accepting that the right answer here is a one way ratchet into blowing it all up into smithereens which is how the roman republic ended it s how the roman empire ended this is not unknown in american history but i think that if you care about climate change then you can t accept what you just said because if you care about climate change it s not just a matter of urgently addressing it s a matter of creating an enduring policy solution and political solution in a democracy to contend with climate change you can t solve it two years at a time you can t put in your stuff for two years then let the next guys come in and rip it out for two years and then do that again i grant you or i accept that that is where our politics is today i accept it and i think that is an unacceptable state of our political system we cannot accept that state of our political system because we will fail we will fail on climate we will fail for every single kid in the lausd who s going to a terrible school we ll fail for every family in america who feels like they can t get ahead no matter how hard they re working that is a guaranteed failure for us and you re also right that there are people in the party and there are people running for president who believe that s the right approach i totally disagree i do not believe that makes me a moderate the worst thing it makes me is an idealist which is what i said earlier in answer to your question and i believe in this exercise in self government i think that people in america have faced far worse challenges than we re facing today we re not sitting at our radios today listening to roosevelt tell us that we have to fight yet another world war someplace else that s just one example and we re giving up because we re living in the land of cable television hosts and social media and politicians who can t weather a tweet storm i think we have to do better than that to me that is an outrage that we would accept it i m not saying you accept it i don t accept it advertisement pearlstine if you made voting mandatory would you have a more moderate electorate role i m just thinking in terms of the ways in which the extremes seem to get so much attention are the ones who actually show up we had a school bond issue a couple of weeks ago where was it 10 of the electorate voted bennet yeah these school board elections i think i read once have 3 of the people vote yeah i don t think america is prepared for mandatory voting but i think we would it would be a much more representative view i do think automatic registration of people when they turn 18 and same day voter registration by the way those are all things we could pass in congress if we wanted to pass those things in congress bennet i do think this gets to the heart of why my political theory is different from a lot of people that are in this race i may be naive i think people could criticize me for being naive i suppose i think what s really naive is accepting the current state of affairs as something that s inevitable and that somehow while we re doing that we can also solve the problems that we face i think that is horrendously naive advertisement greene now the question is can you win with this approach bennet i don t know we ll see i think there s a market for it healey you mentioned early on that you started to say something along the lines of you think that we can close the inequality problem and then you said going forward we can make sure that the profits are distributed more equitably can you talk a little bit more about that because it almost sounded like you were saying you re not a fan of wealth taxes but you do see a way to address income bennet well i think in general more focus on taxing capital and less focus on taxing work would be a good thing the fact that gm even though they ve got many fewer employees today than they once had they still have a ton of employees and they re paying a ton at payroll tax amazon doesn t have a ton of employees they never will and they re not paying any tax that seems upside down i think on the economy there re not obviously any silver bullets but if you were imagining trying to at least look like you were trying as opposed to what we have been doing you would massively invest in infrastructure you d massively invest in r d you d massively in an education system that you were transforming for the 21st century as you were doing it and in early childhood education your priority would look more like that than it would look like bernie s priorities there advertisement i think if you reverse the trump tax cuts and do a version of my bill that i mentioned earlier on the child tax credit the eitc paid family leave and raising the minimum wage for 15 in places where that could be afforded and probably less than that in rural places where it couldn t that would be a lot better than what we have today as a country and provide us some hope that we can at least when the economy grows everybody benefits from it i think on the other take in the capital gains tax up to where ordinary income is taxing intergenerational wealth we re now at a point where we re not taxing peoples estates going up to a zillion dollars and you ve got the whole problem of stepped up bases there that you can solve it s not there s nothing we can do we could spend the next 12 or 13 trillion a lot differently than we ve spent the last 12 or 13 trillion and i think that would help america kerry cavanaugh editorial writer given the inequality that exists and the voting population that is vastly in the lower tiers not the 1 why don t those ideas of changing the taxation system have much resonance in d c how can that change advertisement bennet i think part of it is that people are so skeptical of the federal government look ronald reagan sort of started all of this the optimist in me says maybe we re at the end of the reagan era i say in southern california and that this kind of completely bastardized version of reagan in donald trump who shares none of reagan s virtues may be that s the point where we say hold on this is not really this is self defeating as a country but up to this point they have done an incredibly good job of causing the american people to lose faith in the federal government they ve done an incredible job of separating the federal government from the american people i have huge problems with the federal government i was a school superintendent i know the problems that it created there i was in business i know problems were created there and i know how corrupt it is which is very most of the legislative branch and how ossified it is and how belonging to the last century it is but that doesn t mean we can give up on it any less than we can give up on the politics over here we have to fix it because it is our mechanism for deciding things as a nation and i think we need a president who can help us build confidence in that again and can show us the mistakes that we ve made over the last 20 years and give us hope that there s another path and i think there is another path and that s where i think you ll begin to try to create some confidence that we can take on things like income inequality but if what we re going to do is accept mitch mcconnell s terms of the debate and accept that the bush tax cuts are going to become permanent you re not going to send much of a signal to the american people that there s something different you can do if you re running on the child tax credit for everybody in america who has a kid and an increase in the income maybe you will catch people s attention i don t know advertisement goldberg we re running out of time bennet sorry i apologize goldberg i wanted to ask mike who s on the phone if he has any questions mike mcgough senior editorial writer on telephone yeah it s sort of a hobbyhorse question but you were talking about judges if you re president do you see you have a role in doing anything about the politicization of not so much of the court themselves but the confirmation process would you try to choose judges differently do you think partisanship is a problem bennet i have my head in my hands which you can t see because i think politicization is a huge problem when i was in law school if you were qualified and you were nominated to go on a circuit court to say nothing of the district court but a circuit court or the supreme court you got 90 or 96 votes in the senate and every time that happened we reestablished the importance of having an independent judiciary that was insulated from the hopefully temporary partisan insanity of the legislative branch or what has become that that is what our approach was and there s a chapter in the book about this about the judges this generation of american politicians has destroyed that we have turned the senate s advise and consent responsibility which is a constitutional responsibility into just one more extension of our partisan warfare i have apologized on the senate floor for having voted to change the rules when i did vote to change the rules in 2014 i think that was a terrible substantive mistake and it was a horrible strategic mistake advertisement mcconnell has been completely strategic the whole way along the democrats i think we ve been feckless let me use a different word let me use a different word i think we ve been less strategic than mcconnell has been and he won and what he did on merrick garland is the most reprehensible act that any person who s ever been leader since people were filibustering civil rights but at least they had the dignity to use the processes that were involved mcconnell just broke our government and so my view is we should never be as malevolent or as cynical as he is but i do think it s far past time for us to be as strategic as he is on judges on climate on the economy all this stuff understanding that the bias in the public is that government is all screwed up which it is which is why we sent a reality tv star there there s no way if we didn t have that degraded a sense of our political institutions that we would have sent such a person to washington and i think the judges are the best example of why believing that a one way ratchet of destroying our political institutions is a self defeating exercise in destroying this exercise in self government rather than something that should be cherished by partisan politicians or people that want to raise money as partisan politicians which is what it s been advertisement and what i would do as president is nominate people that i thought were qualified nominated people that i thought would uphold roe vs wade nominate people that were the best lawyers in the country to be the best judges in the country the pressure is going to be on whoever s the next nominee to nominate the most partisan people they can find just as it is on trump what he s putting on it s a joke if it weren t so serious the quality these are judges that are i ve got lists of them in the book but these are judges that would never have survived a vet when we had a 60 vote threshold and now they re at 51 now what some democrats are saying is let s pack the court there s not a single person in america that s had that idea and so do we really want to give mcconnell and trump the gift of saying they re the ones protecting the institutions from the democrats who want to pack the court really are we really going to be for the filibuster or getting rid of the filibuster when mcconnell is the majority leader he s the majority leader and by the way we have the likelihood of our winning the majority is not that high it is doable we have to do it we ve got to do everything we can to do it advertisement let me take back not that high we have to do everything we can to do it but it s not assured that we re going to win the majority so do we really want to set the predicate for him pulling the pin here just like we did when we changed the rules for administrative appointments and for lower court judges when he was able to get away with blowing up the nuclear option on kavanaugh when literally no one in america was looking i was the only democrat who argued we shouldn t filibuster kavanaugh we should save it for the next one because the next one was going to be 5 4 on roe vs wade and maybe we could mobilize america under the circumstances we filibustered he pulled the pin it was over and by the time kavanaugh showed up all we were doing was pretending it didn t have to be that way it did not have to be that way so i deeply regret that it s become this partisan exercise i don t think it was required i think it was a failure of leadership and a failure of elected leaders in washington including myself as i said i ve apologized for this and i hope over time caroline s generation can figure out how to dig us out from this morass of turning what was until now through 230 years of history a pretty honorable process that now has become just more of the same it s going to be hard to fix that

between the united states and china helped drive activity in the services sector to a two year low in june further signs that economic growth slowed sharply in the second quarter the economy s dimming outlook was also underscored by other data on wednesday showing private employers adding far fewer than expected jobs to their payrolls last month new orders for manufactured goods dropped in may for a second straight month the reports followed recent weak housing and business investment data as well as moderate consumer spending business and consumer confidence have dipped the slowdown in activity as last year s massive stimulus from tax cuts and more government spending fades could prompt the federal reserve to cut interest rates this month the u s central bank last month signaled it could ease monetary policy as early as its july 30 31 meeting citing rising risks to the economy from the trade war between washington and beijing and low inflation the international monetary fund has lowered global growth estimates because of reduced trade flows as a result of the trade fights one wonders how long washington will continue to claim they are helping the u s economy said chris rupkey chief economist at mufg in new york one of the factors behind the economy s fall in the great depression was protectionism and trade wars and it will be a miracle if the world economy can avoid another downturn this time the trade deficit rose 8 4 to 55 5 billion as a surge in imports overshadowed a broad increase in exports the commerce department said economists polled by reuters had forecast the trade gap widening to 54 0 billion in may the goods trade deficit with china a focus of president donald trump s america first agenda increased 12 2 to 30 2 billion trump imposed additional import tariffs on chinese goods after a breakdown in negotiations prompting beijing to retaliate economists say the expectation of additional duties likely boosted imports from china which jumped 12 8 in may story continues trump and chinese president xi jinping last week agreed to a trade truce and a return to talks white house trade adviser peter navarro said on tuesday talks were heading in the right direction but it would take time to get the right deal made the u s china trade tensions have caused wild swings in the trade deficit with exporters and importers trying to stay ahead of the tariff fight between the two economic giants trump on wednesday accused china and europe of playing big currency manipulation game and pumping money into their system in order to compete with usa we still think it is slightly more likely than not that the trade dispute with china will ultimately escalate further said andrew hunter a senior u s economist at capital economics in london

wednesday the institute for supply management said its non manufacturing activity index fell to 55 1 in june the lowest reading since july 2017 from 56 9 in may a reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector which accounts for more than two thirds of u s economic activity the ism said a degree of uncertainty exists due to trade and tariffs the decrease in services industry activity reflected a decline in the new orders measure which dropped to the lowest level since december 2017 a gauge of services employment also fell the slowing trend evident across categories raises concern that a slowing trend most evident in manufacturing is also becoming more apparent in the broader economy said andrew hollenhorst an economist at citigroup in new york this should leave the fed right on the precipice of providing some insurance by cutting rates at the july meeting the slowdown in employment was mirrored by the adp national employment report showing private payrolls increased by 102 000 jobs in june from 41 000 in may but below market expectations for a gain of 140 000 that suggests a moderate rebound in the private payrolls component of the government s closely followed employment

should have draghi as chief instead of powell after a yearlong assault on the federal reserve and its chairman president donald trump has tapped two wildly different economists to the central bank s board who seemingly have one important thing in common they re both likely to support the president s call for lower interest rates one christopher waller is the more conventional choice drawn from within the fed s own ranks the other judy shelton has spent decades outside mainstream economics and has already faced criticism for some of her unconventional views on monetary policy waller is director of research for st louis federal reserve bank president james bullard who was the only dissenting vote in favor of a rate cut at the fed s meeting in june shelton who has been an informal adviser to trump has publicly said the central bank should reduce rates it seems like both are going to be in favor of lower rates and sooner rather than later said kathleen bostjancic an economist at oxford economics in new york they are much more dovish and obviously that s what president trump wants trump who announced his picks within minutes of each other on twitter tuesday has recently struggled to find candidates for the fed that are acceptable to senators who must confirm nominees the president previously advanced four people for the two remaining open seats on the board of governors none of them made it raising questions about the white house vetting process for his picks it was a great pleasure to meet with the president this afternoon shelton said in an email on tuesday night this president really gets it his pro growth economic agenda should not be undermined by wrongheaded phillips curve thinking that punishes productive economic growth and subverts continued gains while turning a blind eye to the currency impact of additional stimulus measures by other central banks we have high employment and low inflation so much for the supposed trade off the phillips curve holds that there s an inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation as a high ranking fed staffer waller may have a better chance of passing muster with lawmakers than some of trump s previous contenders as for shelton the senate has already confirmed her in her current role as the u s executive director for the european bank for reconstruction and development her unorthodox views though could attract opposition in an interview with bloomberg in may she said she was highly skeptical that the goals for the fed set by congress the pursuit of maximum employment stable prices and moderate long term interest rates were relevant the white house has conducted the search for fed candidates as trump has repeatedly blasted fed chairman jerome powell over the fed s interest rate increases the president has told confidants that he believes he has the authority to replace powell as fed chairman demoting him to the level of board governor according to people familiar with the matter but trump said he doesn t plan to do it the president chose powell as chair replacing janet yellen last year trump s eagerness to get rid of powell makes both of these nominees potential chairs in waiting a factor that may also affect their confirmation process in the senate powell has said he intends to serve his full four year term and that the law is clear on that issue earlier this year trump advanced two supporters for the fed board stephen moore and herman cain but both withdrew their names after they came under criticism waller who declined to comment tuesday on his nomination is a ph d economist who previously served as a professor of economics at the university of notre dame before joining the st louis fed in 2009 his key research focus has been on monetary and macroeconomic theory and the political economy waller was approached by the white house last month about the job and met with trump tuesday said karen branding a spokeswoman for the st louis fed the overture came after the white house talked to his boss bullard about joining the fed board of governors himself but bullard told reporters last month that he s happy in his current position the two men are close and have co authored monetary policy papers waller shares and helped to develop in 2016 bullard s dovish view that policy is in a new regime in a world with low inflation and high savings where higher interest rates are not needed we didn t see any overheating in the economy coming and so the question was why are we raising rates waller recalled in a june interview with bloomberg we didn t see any reason to raise rates just for the sake of raising rates waller also said that he doesn t worry about pushing the unemployment rate too low and sparking higher prices we don t buy into the phillips curve story that low unemployment causes inflation look at japan he said shelton has a doctorate in business administration from the university of utah with an emphasis on finance and international economics she previously worked for the sound money project which was founded to promote awareness about monetary stability and financial privacy in her interview with bloomberg in may shelton questioned the use of the fed s basic interest rate tool to adjust the price of money and thereby guide an economy toward a sustainable level of growth a fed that is too eager to artificially put in an interest rate that isn t close to what the market would be suggesting is not so good she said at the time i would try to be the voice saying are you sure you know better than the markets shelton has also in the past argued for a return to a gold standard fixing the value of the u s dollar to a weight of gold a system the u s followed to varying degrees until 1976 if appointed to the fed however shelton said she would not call for a return to the gold standard or for a sudden abandonment of other established policies after raising interest rates last year in the face of criticism from trump powell and fellow fed colleagues are widely expected to cut rates at their next meeting at the end of this month
toronto north american stock markets closed higher wednesday with the three main u s markets all hitting record highs on further anticipation of u s interest rate cuts later this month the main theme in the market today is really one of the anticipation of easier monetary policy from major central banks and an underlying dovish bias from central banks says candice bangsund portfolio manager for fiera capital that view followed the planned nomination by u s president donald trump of two economists for federal reserve governors who have in the past called for interest rate cuts the selection of christine lagarde to head the european central bank who favours cuts to support economic growth and weaker economic data private u s payrolls disappointed as the 102 000 increase in june was below expectations so all of this taken together has boosted the case for more stimulus which of course is welcomed by equity markets so it s a bit of a case on the economic front anyways of bad news in the economy being good news for the markets because it means that central bank policy will remain accommodative the s p tsx composite index rose 104 91 points to 16 576 20 that s less than 100 points below april s record intraday high in new york the dow jones industrial average was up 179 32 points at 26 966 00 an all time high after closing early ahead of the july 4 holiday the s p 500 index was up 22 81 points at 2 995 82 just a fraction below the intraday record while the nasdaq composite was up 61 14 points at 8 170 23 a record closing the canadian dollar traded for 76 49 cents us compared with an average of 76 25 cents us on tuesday due to a weaker u s dollar higher oil prices and strong trade data with the balance swinging back into surplus territory for the first time in 10 months bangsund said the recovery in canadian exports should give the bank of canada more flexibility to not follow other central banks in cutting rates nine of the 11 major sectors on the tsx closed higher led by interest sensitive and defensive sectors like consumer staples real estate and utilities that points to some skepticism behind the market rally she said there s still some nerves in the market there s still a lot of uncertainties out there bangsund added noting the results of the g20 meeting between the presidents of china and the u s obviously the trade truce over the weekend was good news but it was by no means an all encompassing deal that means that global trade tensions go away health care was up as canopy growth corp shares rose 1 7 per cent after the ousting of its co ceo bruce linton the heavyweight financial sector gained 0 6 per cent with u s 10 year treasuries sinking below two per cent to their lowest level since november 2016 energy increased with tc energy corp gaining 2 4 per cent after signing a deal to sell its u s midstream assets in appalachian basin for 1 7 billion the august crude contract recovered from tuesday s steep drop to climb us 1 09 at us 57 34 per barrel and the august natural gas contract was up five cents at us 2 29 per mmbtu the materials sector fell 0 32 per cent with teck resources ltd and goldcorp inc falling two and 1 6 per cent respectively the decreases came despite a rise in metals prices including gold reaching its highest level since may 2013 the august gold contract was up us 12 90 at us 1 420 90 an ounce and the september copper contract was up 1 9 cents at us 2 68 a pound thursday trading in toronto is expected to be light but friday could prove to be an important session with the final u s non farm payroll numbers being released before the federal reserve makes its interest rate decision good payroll numbers could prompt the fed to keep rates steady while really weak results could put the fed in motion on cuts said bangsund this could be a big market mover depending on what the result is

steel from vietnam south korea and taiwan might have diverted steel to vietnam and exported from there to circumvent us steel tariffs recall that us imports from vietnam have soared as production moves out of china and with its weak currency many us trade hawks have increased their scrutiny the dollar had gapped higher against the yen on monday filled the gap yesterday and kept falling today geopolitical tensions are running high between the gulf the russian nuclear submarine accident and us vice president pence interrupted schedule to abruptly return to washington the dollar held above

roman prussian as draghi was called in some german press and junker surprised last time lagarde and von der leyen were unexpected the main takeaway for many participants is that lagarde s appointment is very much in line with policy continuity the french were able to once again secure the ecb presidency it is the second french national of the four ecb presidents merkel as we have long argued recognized german interest could be best defended from the ec presidency rather than the ecb von der leyen had previously been seen as one of the possible successors to merkel as chancellor the eurozone flash services and composite pmi were a little better than the flash readings suggested the region s service pmi rose to 53 6 from 53 4 flash and 52 9 in may this is the highest since last

composite fell below 50 for the first time in three years today s report lends credence to ideas that the ecb meeting later this month may be too soon for the ecb to move but a move before draghi s term expires at the end of october is still seen as likely with the september meeting seen as most likely in contrast sweden s riksbank maintained that it is still poised to hike rates before the end of the year meanwhile boe s carney struck a dovish note yesterday which weighed on sterling carney emphasized the uncertainty surrounding brexit and rising protectionism as threats playing into brexit uncertainty both tory candidates have promised to jettison the backstop this and strategies based on renegotiating the withdrawal agreement are raising the risk of a no deal exit which weighs on

same light as st louis fed president bullard the sole dissent in favor of an immediate cut at last month s fomc meeting shelton is seen to be a bit out of the mainstream but also a dove she has already been confirmed by the senate for her current role so the confirmation hearings while could be colorful are not seen to be an insurmountable hurdle waller should easily be confirmed cleveland fed s mester aligned herself with the other wing at the fed she was skeptical of the immediate need to cut rates mester expects growth to slow but still be a solid 2 while recognizing downside risks

why most voters accept inflation from 2007 there are a few economists very few and a small percentage of voters very small worldwide who are convinced that central banks inflate their domestic currencies as a deliberate policy we skeptics monitor the various money supply statistics and find that there is rarely a period longer than a few months in which any nation s money supply is either stable or falling we also monitor various price index statistics and find the same thing with the exception of japan japan did have a few years 1995 and 2001 3 in which its official price level fell for over a year by about one or two percent on japan see the chart on inflation in testifying before the congress every chairman of the federal reserve system invariably warns against inflation meaning price inflation he tells congress that inflation has not been fully overcome that it lurks in the background and that recent successes in the war on inflation price increases of less than 3 must regarded only as good progress not a victory this song and dance has been going on ever since the end of the korean war if you go to the inflation calculator of the bureau of labor statistics and search for what you would pay in dollars today compared with 1 000 spent in any previous year you will find that inflation has been with us year by year with the exception of 1955 for over six decades a 1 000 purchase in 1914 the first full year of operations by the federal reserve system would cost you more than 20 000 today that is a depreciation of over 95 this performance should be evaluated in terms of the officially stated purpose of the fed a good example of this official policy appears on the website of the federal reserve bank of richmond the fed s task is to supply enough reserves to support an adequate amount of money and credit avoiding the excesses that result in inflation and the shortages that stifle economic growth the depreciation of the dollar by 95 is not an indication of success regarding the first criterion the great depression 1929 40 is not an indication of success regarding the second neither are the recurring years of recession ever since 1949 how is it that a government appointed organization whose criterion of success is stable prices has failed except for 1930 40 in its anti inflation goal and was successful only during the worst depression in american history in other words how is it that success somehow eludes this organization more important how is it that it never comes under attack in congress for its nine consecutive decades of failure i suggest two answers 1 the federal reserve is the source of price inflation not its dedicated opponent 2 the voting public prefers price inflation to the alternatives stable prices or falling prices in short the federal reserve has faithfully delivered what the voters have wanted buckets of money imagine an auction you have arrived early you have looked over the inventory of the items to be auctioned off you have spotted some items that interest you you have made a few notes you have jotted down limits on what you are willing to pay for each item so that you will not be caught up in the heat of the bidding competition in other words you have treated the auction as a business a few minutes before the auction begins you look around the hall the other bidders have assembled it is a large crowd this will tend to drive prices higher you then notice something odd there are several men in three piece dark blue suits who have entered the hall each of them is carrying a bucket each of them approaches a member of the audience each of them engages in whispered conversation the person in the suit hands the other person a document and a pen who signs the document and hands it back and the pen the person in the suit hands a bucket to the person the person then takes his seat with a bucket in front of him the auction begins before everyone is approached by someone carrying a bucket you notice that the bidding is lively prices are higher than usual you also notice that the people sitting next to a bucket are among the most aggressive bidders they seem to be about to outbid the people without the buckets after each item is sold anyone with a bucket walks forward sets the bucket down reaches into it grabs a handful of what appears to be currency counts out pieces of paper hands the wad to the auctioneer picks up the item he has just purchased picks up his bucket with his other hand and walks back to his seat in the hall this goes on all day long the people with the buckets are buying up most of the prime items the law of the auction remains intact high bid wins you attend three more auctions in the next three weeks you see the same scenario replayed then in auction number five someone with a bucket and a pen approaches you he whispers his offer you can borrow cash to participate in the auction you see what this involves an increase in debt you hesitate he says have you noticed that prices have begun to rise at the auctions you have attended you admit that you have he continues if you don t add to your holdings of cash do you think you will be able to buy any of the items you want you admit that you have been forced to drop out of the bidding in the last two auctions he comments with prices rising as they have what do you think the items you won t buy today will be worth in a year a lot more you estimate what about five years from now it will be even worse why not borrow the money on a five year contract you can get a good rate but you decide not to do it you were warned by your grandparents about consumer debt you lose every bid that day you then miss every bid for the next month you are becoming frantic at the next auction another man with a bucket approaches you he presents the same arguments then he adds this you may have noticed that interest rates on longer term loans have been rising you can lock in today s rate for as many years as you want but if you don t act now you may be forced to pay more next time you sign today you bid successfully on several of the items you want prices do continue to rise interest rates also continue to rise at the next auctions you start signing more contracts you start buying items you would not have been interested in two months ago in the heat of the bidding you find that you don t abide by your pre auction limits on the prices you are willing to pay you are accumulating a portfolio of items whose prices keep rising then one evening you are watching the evening news there is a photo of a man wearing a three piece suit that looks like the suits worn by the men with the buckets the anchorman reports that the chairman of the federal reserve system testified before congress that day that the recent rise of prices at the nation s auctions reveals that the specter of inflation has arisen again congressmen questioned him on rising long term interest rates this is hurting the middle class several congressmen complained to the chairman the chairman replied that the problem is irrational exuberance buyers are being caught up in the emotion of the auctions it is time for people to understand that no tree grows to the sky forever that people should save for a rainy day and that a penny saved is a penny earned then the news switches to the latest antics of a 23 year old blonde celebrity who has been arrested again later that night you watch c span which you began doing when you quit using lunesta you see the entire 90 minute hearing you also see something that was not mentioned by the newscaster a congressman from texas asked the man in the suit to explain any connection between rising prices at auctions and reports that men with buckets full of currency have been attending auctions the man in the suit replied that there was no connection whatsoever the men with buckets attend auctions only to maintain price stability while seeing to it that the auctions do not suffer a meltdown due to unpredictable tight monetary conditions you drift off to sleep you wake up at 3 a m to find that c span is covering hearings on native american owned casinos you turn off the set and go to bed you dream about sioux warriors on horseback attacking men in three piece dark blue suits you find yourself cheering for the indians better 4 inflation than buy now pay later there are few slogans that better summarize the dominant philosophy of the modern consumer driven economy the popularity of this appeal is inherent in man he discounts the future he values whatever he owns now more than the same item owned in the future but postponed for now what he wants is a way to buy now and pay later or not pay at all the wicked borroweth and payeth not again but the righteous sheweth mercy and giveth psalm 37 21 the more present oriented he is the more ready he is to buy now and pay later he starts looking for a way to buy now without having to forfeit ownership of something worth as much or more as the item offered for sale before the money economy a man might take possession of a sheep today in exchange for his promise of delivering a sheep to the lender next year and a second sheep the year after what he hopes for is the birth of two black sheep which don t have a good resale market because of what later became known as the henry ford promise you can get it in any color you want so long as it s black white wool can be dyed a different color black wool can t its market is smaller fewer people bid for black sheep he will repay his debt with black sheep smart lenders of course wrote into their contracts that the sheep to be delivered had to be the same type as the sheep originally loaned this made it tough on borrowers the modern fractional reserve banking system lets borrowers get back into the black sheep scam anyway they think they can they think they can get something for nothing so they take loans at 5 per annum so they can buy whatever they want at today s low prices they are not concerned about a 4 depreciation of the dollar over the following year they can use depreciated dollars to pay off lenders so when the men with the buckets come around they find takers people sign the contracts why would anyone lend money at 5 when the money returned will be worth 4 less answer because they have a government license to print the money they loan paper and ink are cheap better a 5 return with 4 inflation than having your license revoked digits are cheaper than paper and ink economists are mostly keynesians monetarists or supply siders all three positions assert that a nation needs a central bank to increase the money supply all three deny that a gold coin standard without fractional reserve banking is a legitimate ideal they assure us that the economy needs fiat money to sustain economic growth of course it does not need too much money too much money is bad for the economy it needs a just right quantity of fiat money these people are promoters of gray sheep economics borrowers get to dream of paying off loans with depreciating money lenders bankers get to lend more money than they otherwise would have more fiat money to lend private creditors get to believe that the central bank will get inflation under control economists get jobs promoting the system who are the big winners auctioneers sotheby s began in 1804 christie s was founded in 1744 there is one other big winner in the united states crane company privately held it reports to no one outside its offices it alone provides the paper for the u s currency it has ever since 1879 arizona s congressman jim kolbe has introduced legislation every year for a decade to open up this market to competing bids so far no law the treasury has refused to tell congress if any other companies have been allowed to bid after all what does congress think it is the voice of the people well then who do the people think they are what motivates the fed the fellows with the buckets full of money have a sweet deal but there is a risk they may not get repaid in an economic downturn also there is the problem of competition new counterfeiters so bankers need just enough money to hand out but no more but some bankers cheat they print too much money this can lead to too much inflation congress might get involved that would be very bad congress might revoke some banks license to print money this is terrifying to bankers bankers therefore need a cartel to keep the members in line this is the primary function of every central bank the cartelization of fractional reserve banking everything else is subordinate there is a continuing complaint among the fed s critics that the fed gets rich by creating the money it lends to the government it then gets paid interest by the government this is true it does get paid what the critics apparently do not know is that the fed returns two thirds of this money to the treasury every year in 2005 it took in a little over 30 billion and returned 21 5 billion the fed is the lender of first choice for the government the fed alone returns two thirds of the interest paid basically the fed pays congress 20 billion a year to sit there and be quiet rather like schoolchildren in a tax funded school when a congressman cross examines a fed chairman he does so with the same authority that a fourth grader raises his hand and asks miss snook a question about long division and with about the same knowledge of the subject the only time a fed chairman gets asked serious questions is during a recession and the questions are some variation of the schoolchild s can i go to the bathroom the fed chairman answers yes you may go to the bathroom the congressman looks relieved there is a lot of fuss about who owns the fed this implies that the key to understanding the fed is to follow the money it does indeed but the critics do not understand that the flow of funds begins with the fed it does not end with the fed member banks own the fed s shares yes congress should be told which banks own the shares of the fed and in what percentage but that would not prove anything except this the owners are private banks the key to understanding the fed is understanding that its goal is not merely to expand the money supply it is to control the rate of expansion by controlling the banking system as a whole not too fast not too slow but just right the fed is owned by private banks to provide a service to the owners of private banks cartelization this keeps bankers from cheating other bankers by producing too much money thereby endangering the entire fractional reserve banking system by exposing it to bankrupting bank runs by depositors think of the fed as opec opec wants people to buy and use oil the fed wants people to borrow and spend money opec wants to control the rate of production of oil by legally independent producers the fed wants to control the rate of production of fiat money by legally independent producers opec protects the market for its product from secret discounts by its members so does the fed conclusion price inflation persists because 1 the fed creates money to buy assets spending it into circulation 2 the public wants a little inflation there is no politically organized constituency for stable money the public gets what it wants depreciating money for repaying debts the bankers get what they want constant income from ever expanding debt the congress gets what it wants placated voters the fed gets what it wants a cartel there is a price for all this the absence of 100 market created market allocated money instead the world gets a money system based on the decisions of competing bureaucrats who do not own the money their central banks create power without ownership authority without full responsibility here is a formula for disaster ______________________ published on june 20 2007 the original is here the inflation calculator now reports 25 609 20 for

the ecb is paving the way for more easing as it appoints the imf s lagarde as draghi s replacement president trump nominates two more candidates to the fed s board of governors both are pro easing and could sway the fed into more than merely cutting rates with another round of qe markets so far are fairly flat on this news heading into the july 4th break in the us however gold is flying higher on the anticipation of more easing and monetary inflation tuesday s market moves didn t quite reflect some of the major news stories stocks were moderately bullish and held onto the majority of the gains following the g20 meeting us yields did little oil was lower dollar pairs mostly flat and the euro quiet however the one conspicuous market was gold which flew higher from a weekly low of 1380 to quickly re test the 1440 high this move was mostly driven by the news that the imf s lagarde will replace mario draghi as president of the ecb the appointment may not seem like a major deal but given the ecb s current position and need to provide stimulus lagarde s dovish stance gives the market a pretty clear signal that easing is on its way in moving from washington to frankfurt lagarde will be tasked with driving monetary policy in a 19 nation economy which draghi has already signaled will need more help likely in the form of lower interest rates and possibly with the resumption of quantitative easing inflation is running at barely half the ecb s goal of just under 2 despite years of negative rates and 2 6 trillion euros 3 trillion of bond purchases investors will likely bet that as a seasoned crisis fighter lagarde will share draghi s taste for aggressive and innovative monetary policy especially as her appointment means the more hawkish bundesbank president jens weidmann misses out reported bloomberg lagarde is not an economist and has no central bank experience and will presumably support a dovish policy so far the euro has not responded much to the news and eurusd is only just under 1 13 but gold seems to like the news more dovish nominations lagarde was not the only new dove to be introduced to the markets on tuesday president trump said that he is planning to nominate two candidates christopher waller and judy shelton who are both considered doves and open to easing us monetary policy the president continues to criticize the current fed and especially its chair jerome powell as he is not cutting rates or providing stimulus like the president wishes this desire for more stimulus is at odds with his claims that the economy is the best ever but he clearly wants stock markets higher and this is an easy if risky way to do it advertisement president trump plans to nominate christopher waller and judy shelton to fill the two remaining seats on the federal reserve board of governors the latest push in trump s effort to get the central bank to lower interest rates ahead of the 2020 election shelton is a conservative scholar and former adviser to the trump campaign who told the washington post last month that she thinks interest rates should be cut as expeditiously as possible waller is an economist who currently serves as research director at the federal reserve bank of st louis he rarely speaks publicly but his boss st louis fed president james bullard was the only member of the fed s policy setting committee to vote for an interest rate cut in june executive bios christoper wallerchristopher waller is an executive vice president and the director of research at the federal reserve bank of st the washington post this dovish news could keep the dollar in check going forward and has helped balance out the lagarde news for eurusd but this is another reason why gold is back at 1440 as an easing bias and monetary inflation help lift the yellow metal

the canadian dollar rose 0 1 percent against the us dollar on tuesday the canada day holiday had put the loonie in a vulnerable spot as the g20 wrapped up with presidents trump and xi agreeing to restart negotiations on trade the outcome was not the best case scenario for the market as there were no details revealed on when the new rounds will take place or how far apart both parties are canadian manufacturing is not expanding with the common thread of contraction that the economies of china and europe have reported this week trade headwinds are to blame for the lack of traction and the prolonged dispute between the us and china has put downward pressure on global growth up ahead for the canadian currency is the release of the trade balance on wednesday and employment and pmi

catalyst needed for energy prices to really take off the meeting between saudi arabia and russia was the most productive sideline event as the opec extension was announced back then but without a real breakthrough on the tariff war between the us and china it was not enough the prolonged trade war is now on ice after both sides agreed to a truce but the market has seen this before and based on the aggressive demands from the us it could unravel once again supply data on wednesday as the eia published the weekly us crude inventories could show a smaller contraction after two consecutive

threatened new tariffs on eu exports was a positive for gold central banks will not be an obstacle for the yellow metal the reserve bank of australia rba cut rates on tuesday to 1 percent and the fed

bloomberg after a yearlong assault on the federal reserve and its chairman president trump has tapped two wildly different economists to the central bank s board who seemingly have one important thing in common they re both likely to support the president s call for lower interest rates one christopher waller is largely a conventional choice drawn from within the fed s own ranks he s been consistent in his calls for a more dovish approach over the years the other judy shelton has spent decades outside mainstream economics and recently appears to have completed a metamorphosis from proponent of returning to the gold standard a concept broadly espoused by those who feel monetary policy is too lax to an advocate of the need for more stimulus it seems like both are going to be in favor of lower rates and sooner rather than later said kathleen bostjancic an economist at oxford economics in new york they are much more dovish and obviously that s what president trump wants advertisement waller is director of research for st louis federal reserve bank president james bullard who was the only vote in favor of a rate cut at the fed s meeting in june shelton who has been an informal advisor to trump has publicly said the central bank should reduce rates trump who announced his picks within minutes of each other on twitter on tuesday has recently struggled to find candidates for the fed that are acceptable to senators who must confirm nominees the president previously advanced four people for the two remaining open seats on the board of governors none of them made it raising questions about the white house vetting process for his picks it was a great pleasure to meet with the president this afternoon shelton said in an email on tuesday night this president really gets it his pro growth economic agenda should not be undermined by wrongheaded phillips curve thinking that punishes productive economic growth and subverts continued gains while turning a blind eye to the currency impact of additional stimulus measures by other central banks we have high employment and low inflation so much for the supposed trade off the phillips curve holds that there s an inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation the lengthy senate confirmation process means neither candidate is likely to join the board for months perhaps not even until next year current vice chairman richard clarida s nomination was announced april 18 2018 and he wasn t sworn in until sept 17 governor michelle bowman nominated the same day as clarida didn t take office until nov 26 as a high ranking fed staffer waller may have a better chance of passing muster with lawmakers than some of trump s previous contenders as for shelton the senate has already confirmed her in her current role as the u s executive director for the european bank for reconstruction and development her unorthodox views though could attract opposition advertisement in an interview with bloomberg in may she said she was highly skeptical that the goals for the fed set by congress the pursuit of maximum employment stable prices and moderate long term interest rates were relevant the white house has conducted the search for fed candidates as trump has repeatedly blasted fed chairman jerome h powell over the fed s interest rate increases the president has told confidants that he believes he has the authority to replace powell as fed chairman demoting him to the level of board governor according to people familiar with the matter but trump said he doesn t plan to do it the president chose powell as chairman replacing janet yellen last year trump s eagerness to get rid of powell makes both of these nominees potential chairs in waiting a factor that may also affect their confirmation process in the senate powell has said he intends to serve his full four year term and that the law is clear on that issue earlier this year trump advanced two supporters for the fed board stephen moore and herman cain but both withdrew their names after they came under criticism waller who declined to comment tuesday on his nomination has a doctorate in economics and previously served as a professor of economics at the university of notre dame before joining the st louis fed in 2009 his key research focus has been on monetary and macroeconomic theory and the political economy advertisement waller was approached by the white house last month about the job and met with trump on tuesday said karen branding a spokeswoman for the st louis fed the overture came after the white house talked to his boss bullard about joining the fed board of governors himself but bullard told reporters last month that he s happy in his current position the two men are close and have coauthored monetary policy papers waller shares and helped to develop in 2016 bullard s dovish view that policy is in a new regime in a world with low inflation and high savings where higher interest rates are not needed we didn t see any overheating in the economy coming and so the question was why are we raising rates waller recalled in a june interview with bloomberg we didn t see any reason to raise rates just for the sake of raising rates waller also said that he doesn t worry about pushing the unemployment rate too low and sparking higher prices we don t buy into the phillips curve story that low unemployment causes inflation look at japan he said shelton has a doctorate in business administration from the university of utah with an emphasis on finance and international economics she previously worked for the sound money project which was founded to promote awareness about monetary stability and financial privacy advertisement in her interview with bloomberg in may shelton questioned the use of the fed s basic interest rate tool to adjust the price of money and thereby guide an economy toward a sustainable level of growth a fed that is too eager to artificially put in an interest rate that isn t close to what the market would be suggesting is not so good she said at the time i would try to be the voice saying are you sure you know better than the markets shelton has also in the past argued for a return to a gold standard fixing the value of the dollar to a weight of gold a system the u s followed to varying degrees until 1976 if appointed to the fed however shelton said she would not call for a return to the gold standard or for a sudden abandonment of other established policies after raising interest rates last year in the face of criticism from trump powell and fellow fed colleagues are widely expected to cut rates at their next meeting at the end of this month

it is official president donald trump is flying two doves over the federal reserve the president announced on twitter that he is nominating christopher waller an executive vice president at the federal reserve bank of st louis and judy shelton the u s director of the european bank for reconstruction and development to the fed board of governors i am pleased to announce that it is my intention to nominate judy shelton ph d u s executive dir european bank of reconstruction development to be on the board of the federal reserve donald j trump realdonaldtrump july 2 2019 president trump has said on multiple occasions that he wants lower interest rates and he is going to get them no matter what waller helped his boss st louis fed bank president james bullard commit to lowering interest rates asserting that monetary policy is in a new regime higher interest rates are unnecessary in an interview waller said we didn t see any overheating in the economy coming so the question was why are we raising rates we didn t see any reason to raise rates just for the sake of raising rates judy shelton liberty nation has the story shelton presently acts as the u s executive director for the european bank for reconstruction and development previously she was an adviser to the trump campaign and worked at the sound money project a group founded in 2009 to perform research and promote awareness regarding monetary stability and financial privacy shelton also penned two books including the coming soviet crash which examined the russian economy and its collapse in april shelton wrote an op ed in the wall street journal titled the case for monetary regime change her supposition was that it is entirely prudent to question the infallibility of the federal reserve in calibrating the money supply to the needs of the economy why she accurately blamed the fed s influence over the creation of money and credit for the 2008 financial crisis last year she wrote in a cato institute paper we make america great again by making america s money great again one way to achieve this she suggested is to link the u s dollar to gold or another commodity rather than blanket trust in the federal government speaking in an interview with fortune during the 2016 election campaign shelton was blunt in calling for a fundamental reassessment of the global monetary order she outlined her concerns over central banks around the world acquiring corporate assets and the federal reserve prolonging the normalization of interest rates the economist ultimately believes that the central bank is the biggest risk to the economy i think it s perfectly legitimate to question whether the current monetary system we have is working and whether we ve solved the imbalances that led to the last crisis she said that is some serious libertarian anti globalist speak that the fed needs right now of course there is always a but a true inflationary unfortunately shelton now holds positions that contradict past statements and mirror the central planning measures of the keynesians this has been a common trait with past fed picks including marvin goodfriend and nellie liang at least she is not proposing to eliminate cash recently in a separate interview shelton endorsed near zero interest rates which would certainly please president trump who has demanded the central bank cut rates moreover she does not like the policy of paying interest on excess money that financial institutions hold at the fed to set rates because it enables these banks to hold funds rather than lend to potential borrowers instead shelton would institute rock bottom rates again and sell off the fed s holdings of treasury securities and government bonds to prevent skyrocketing price inflation however these policies would have the reverse effect unleashing a tidal wave of inflation the expansion of the money supply first cutting rates would produce more dollars and create price inflation second there is approximately 1 2 trillion in excess reserves so if that money seeps into the system then the money supply would spike by 1 2 trillion where the heck is candidate trump when you need him like this article get ecn delivered to your inbox daily subscribe here

judy shelton update below by robert wenzel this is big trouble president trump plans to nominate christopher waller and judy shelton to fill the two remaining seats on the federal reserve board of governors he announced in a series of tweets i am pleased to announce that it is my intention to nominate christopher waller ph d executive vp and director of research federal reserve bank of st louis missouri to be on the board of the federal reserve donald j trump realdonaldtrump july 2 2019 prior to his current position christopher served as a professor and chair of economics at notre dame donald j trump realdonaldtrump july 2 2019 i am pleased to announce that it is my intention to nominate judy shelton ph d u s executive dir european bank of reconstruction development to be on the board of the federal reserve donald j trump realdonaldtrump july 2 2019 judy is a founding member of the board of directors of empower america and has served on the board of directors of hilton hotels donald j trump realdonaldtrump july 2 2019 there is a strong indication that both of these likely nominees are just what trump wants mad money printers who will want to keep interest rates below free market levels and in the process flood the economy with money he is packing the fed with crazed money printers there is no question that waller loves the smell of green ink in a 2015 paper mr waller found that injecting more money into the economy can help revive an economy when central banks have already brought rates down to zero in 2009 mr waller wrote that central banks could let inflation run higher for a while to make up for periods of weaker inflation and help the economy recover from downturns as far as shelton as i have pointed out before it is really difficult to understand what she really thinks since her specialty seems to be incomplete and contradictory thoughts see the wacky monetary policy thinking of judy shelton joseph salerno warns that she is an oddball supply sider when it comes to monetary policy the bad news is that she leans heavily toward supply side economics which is deeply flawed on monetary policy like most supply siders the position she advocates may be summed up in the motto i favor sound money and plenty of it shelton attributes blame for the devastating 2008 global meltdown to the fed s influence over the creation of money and credit she then goes on to criticize the fed s policy of paying interest on excess reserves for slowing down the economic recovery from the post crisis depression her argument is that paying interest on excess reserves discouraged the banking system from fully lending out the enormous amount of reserves that gushed forth into the system through the fed s qe programs while this is true the fed s policy was still very expansionary rom mid 2011 to 2017 the year over year yoy growth rates of the money supply as measured by the fed aggregates of m2 and mzm varied between 5 and 10 these slightly exceeded the monetary growth rates recorded during the run up of the housing bubble from the beginning of 2002 through 2005 which culminated in the devastating global meltdown that shelton bemoaned a few sentences earlier thus shelton considers the same rates of monetary growth inflationary in the earlier period but contractionary in the later period shelton also reveals the flaws in her supply side position when she argues that a gold standard and a bretton woods like regime by linking the supply of money and credit to gold would both be effective in redress inflationary pressures shelton s position here shows a lack of theoretical and historical awareness of the vast differences between the classical gold standard and the bretton woods system in their nature and operation the former was a genuine gold standard in which gold coins were in circulation and all bank notes and deposits were instantaneously redeemable in gold the bretton woods system on the other hand was a form of price rule monetarism in which the fed followed a rule to target a legally mandated price of gold by buying and selling gold foreign currencies or domestic securities there was no gold in circulation as a medium of exchange and the convertibility of dollars into gold was restricted to foreign governments and other official institutions the historical bretton woods system had inherent flaws that led to its slow motion inflationary collapse in the late 1960s and its disappearance in 1971 this did not stop supply siders including shelton in her 1994 book money meltdown from penning proposals for an updated version of bretton woods under the gold standard the dollar and the pound sterling were merely names for a definite weight of gold within very narrow margins precisely determined by the laws shelton s prescription for monetary policy has changed so dramatically and her rationale for it makes so little sense as to make her appointment to the fed a gamble does she believe what she is now saying or is she just saying what trump wants to hear journal interviewer began his write up by saying these are dizzy days for monetary economists for people keeping track of shelton s pronouncements they re even dizzier and it turns out her solution for the 2008 financial crisis was even more money printing than actually occurred after the crisis and she has a wacky contradictory position about it salerno again in other words she correctly blames the financial crisis on fed money printing but then calls for more money printing as the solution salerno calls her positions bad news relative to what sound money advocates would support and clearly evident contradictory positions and don t get sucked in by her statement that she is for a gold standard she is just as confused here salerno writes as ludwig von mises wrote that is paper money could be redeemed for a specific weight of gold and gold coins could also circulate this is not what shelton is advocating when she calls for a gold standard by calling for a bretton woods type standard she is calling for a manipulated fake gold standard that eventually results in the link between gold and currency cut indeed in 1971 president richard nixon cut the bretton woods gold standard relation between the us dollar and gold if these two trump nominations are confirmed by the senate the fed will have on its board two more mad money printers this will result in great volatility in the economy and more difficulty in making sound investment decisions you will be better off putting your money at golden nugget atlantic city formerly known as trump

published wednesday 3 july 2019 print disqus gary christenson city one debtapolis in this fictional world a financial genius and his offspring executed a brilliant plan over several centuries the government authorized his bank to create and print paper money backed by gold or silver the bank accepted gold silver and other valuables as deposits into its vaults and loaned paper money to governments businesses politicians and individuals debtors repaid loans in gold bullion bank owners accumulated huge personal wealth became trusted confidants to government leaders and pillars of the society the bank owners encouraged politicians to start wars and borrow from the bank to pay for excessive spending debts increased politicians bought votes and the bank became important in global affairs the bank stored sovereign gold for safe keeping the gold was never audited politicians created more promises wars welfare programs and debts prices rose rapidly they reissued currency units as paper certificates with no intrinsic value backed only by faith and credit prices for food and energy rose to 10 times often 100 times higher than a few decades before the bank collected interest on outstanding debts bank owners declared large bonuses for themselves and bought gold because they knew the true value of the paper units they distributed to the populace a few people noticed that the massive creation of currency units caused the price of gold to move higher which worried the bank it sold gold from its vaults but called the sales swaps or leases sales slowed gold s price rise currencies were digitalized easier to create control and manipulate derivatives added leverage to control prices and increase wealth for the banker class however the risk of another market melt down of paper assets expanded important people issued denials and reassurances total currencies and debt became so bloated that the bubble exceeded charles ponzi s wildest delusions they needed a reset and a diversion politicians studied diversions an epidemic a nuclear attack another ground war a cyber attack that crashed financial systems an emp a scandal implicating national politicians a massive power failure a 1 000 year drought food riots and earthquakes the reset crash armageddon the apocalypse or paying the piper caused the middle and poorer classes to lose their savings through inflation their standard of living declined and they rioted most wealthy insiders owned gold before the reset and survived the temporary chaos government increased controls over transportation food energy employment currency transfers and medical care to manage the populace most people lived unhappily ever after because they had not protected their assets and savings this story is fiction city two inflationapolis people elected the politicians but they served the needs of the political and financial elite who wanted wealth and power the people wanted free benefits politicians bought votes increased benefits and printed paper currency units to pay for their promises prices rose the poor and middle classes suffered from consumer price inflation while the wealthy protected their wealth via gold land real estate and hard assets stored abroad the people had little power to change a flawed system more paper currency units were printed and prices rose 1 000 times higher than previously the central bank issued new currency units called new pesos and recalled old pesos the new pesos were worth 1 000 old pesos inflation remained tame for a year or two political leadership changed but policies did not twenty years later the central bank issued new currency units called forever pesos and replaced new pesos at 1 000 for each forever peso political leadership changed but the central bank elite individuals and printing policies persisted the forever peso was replaced in 15 years and the inflation cycle continued the rich got richer the poor got poorer and middle class assets were strip mined and transferred to the political and financial elite the elite owned gold real estate and hard assets while the poor and middle classes owned devaluing paper certificates city three city of wisdom in a gold backed world gold and silver coins and bullion are money gold backs the currency units anyone can exchange digital or paper currency units for physical gold people trust the currency units and seldom exchange them for gold gold bullion that backs currencies is stored in vaults bars are audited every year governments avoid debt except in emergencies they report honest financial information to the public if government officials overspend annual revenues politicians lose retirement benefits without the economic resistance from high taxes inflation and a huge government the economy and residents prosper when politicians want war they explain how they will pay for the war and they specify benefits from winning the war the legislature votes on tax increases and the declaration of war victory and defeat are measurable and defined if they lose the war the politicians who instigated the war are publicly executed by a firing squad while remaining politicians who voted for the war are cast out of office without pensions most politicians and citizens understand the system is flawed but history has shown other choices are worse people lived happily ever after while using honest money under rational government summary the fictional city of debtapolis resembles countries in the western hemisphere regular people politicians and central bankers inhabit the city digital currency units buy less every year and are created in large quantities the political and financial elite control the government and economy to expand their wealth economic statistics sincere politicians and the media assure the people that it s all good most residents of debtapolis do not own gold to protect their savings and retirement the elite own gold and hard assets the city of inflationapolis has been the model for many countries most residents of inflationapolis do not own gold to protect their savings and retirements the consequences are ugly and depressing city of

listen to this article listen to this article after a yearlong assault on the federal reserve and its chairman president donald trump has tapped two wildly different economists to the central bank s board who seemingly have one important thing in common they re both likely to support the president s call for lower interest rates one christopher waller is largely a conventional choice drawn from within the fed s own ranks he s been consistent in his calls for a more dovish approach over the years the other judy shelton has spent decades outside mainstream economics and recently appears to have completed a metamorphosis from proponent of returning to the gold standard a concept broadly espoused by those who feel monetary policy is too lax to an advocate of the need for more stimulus it seems like both are going to be in favor of lower rates and sooner rather than later said kathleen bostjancic an economist at oxford economics in new york they are much more dovish and obviously that s what president trump wants waller is director of research for st louis federal reserve bank president james bullard who was the only dissenting vote in favor of a rate cut at the fed s meeting in june shelton who has been an informal adviser to trump has publicly said the central bank should reduce rates trump who announced his picks within minutes of each other on twitter on tuesday has recently struggled to find candidates for the fed that are acceptable to senators who must confirm nominees the president previously advanced four people for the two remaining open seats on the board of governors none of them made it raising questions about the white house vetting process for his picks it was a great pleasure to meet with the president this afternoon shelton said in an email on tuesday night this president really gets it his pro growth economic agenda should not be undermined by wrongheaded phillips curve thinking that punishes productive economic growth and subverts continued gains while turning a blind eye to the currency impact of additional stimulus measures by other central banks we have high employment and low inflation so much for the supposed trade off the phillips curve holds that there s an inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation senate confirmation the lengthy senate confirmation process means neither candidate is likely to join the board for months perhaps not even until next year current vice chairman richard clarida s nomination was announced april 18 2018 and he wasn t sworn in until sept 17 governor michelle bowman nominated the same day as clarida didn t take office until nov 26 as a high ranking fed staffer waller may have a better chance of passing muster with lawmakers than some of trump s previous contenders as for shelton the senate has already confirmed her in her current role as the u s executive director for the european bank for reconstruction and development her unorthodox views though could attract opposition in an interview with bloomberg in may she said she was highly skeptical that the goals for the fed set by congress the pursuit of maximum employment stable prices and moderate long term interest rates were relevant the white house has conducted the search for fed candidates as trump has repeatedly blasted fed chairman jerome powell over the fed s interest rate increases the president has told confidants that he believes he has the authority to replace powell as fed chairman demoting him to the level of board governor according to people familiar with the matter but trump said he doesn t plan to do it the president chose powell as chair replacing janet yellen last year trump s eagerness to get rid of powell makes both of these nominees potential chairs in waiting a factor that may also affect their confirmation process in the senate powell has said he intends to serve his full four year term and that the law is clear on that issue earlier this year trump advanced two supporters for the fed board stephen moore and herman cain but both withdrew their names after they came under criticism st louis fed waller who declined to comment tuesday on his nomination is a ph d economist who previously served as a professor of economics at the university of notre dame before joining the st louis fed in 2009 his key research focus has been on monetary and macroeconomic theory and the political economy waller was approached by the white house last month about the job and met with trump on tuesday said karen branding a spokeswoman for the st louis fed the overture came after the white house talked to his boss bullard about joining the fed board of governors himself but bullard told reporters last month that he s happy in his current position the two men are close and have co authored monetary policy papers waller shares and helped to develop in 2016 bullard s dovish view that policy is in a new regime in a world with low inflation and high savings where higher interest rates are not needed we didn t see any overheating in the economy coming and so the question was why are we raising rates waller recalled in a june interview with bloomberg we didn t see any reason to raise rates just for the sake of raising rates waller also said that he doesn t worry about pushing the unemployment rate too low and sparking higher prices we don t buy into the phillips curve story that low unemployment causes inflation look at japan he said shelton has a doctorate in business administration from the university of utah with an emphasis on finance and international economics she previously worked for the sound money project which was founded to promote awareness about monetary stability and financial privacy fed policy in her interview with bloomberg in may shelton questioned the use of the fed s basic interest rate tool to adjust the price of money and thereby guide an economy toward a sustainable level of growth a fed that is too eager to artificially put in an interest rate that isn t close to what the market would be suggesting is not so good she said at the time i would try to be the voice saying are you sure you know better than the markets shelton has also in the past argued for a return to a gold standard fixing the value of the u s dollar to a weight of gold a system the u s followed to varying degrees until 1976 if appointed to the fed however shelton said she would not call for a return to the gold standard or for a sudden abandonment of other established policies after raising interest rates last year in the face of criticism from trump powell and fellow fed colleagues are widely expected to cut rates at their next meeting at the end of this month like this article gain access to all of our great content with a month to month subscription
