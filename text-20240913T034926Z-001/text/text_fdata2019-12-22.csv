article content central bank of argentina current rate floor 58 forecast for end of 2020 n a argentina s recently appointed central bank chief miguel pesce is facing a daunting task with an economy in crisis and an inflation rate of more than 50 he aims to slash price growth to single digit rates by the end of 2021 and says both monetary policy and a social accord proposed by president alberto fernandez s administration will be part of this fernandez only took office this month and during the campaign trail advisers said the central bank would seek to keep the argentine peso at relatively weak levels in a bid to boost exports and turn the economy around the strategy would require interventions in the foreign exchange market to control inflation the bank might seek to rein in monetary aggregates while the government tries to strike deals with the productive sector to keep prices stable what bloomberg s economists say the new government has a clear focus on growth and poverty relief and is very likely to use credit as a lever on that front in the meantime economy minister martin guzman has already hinted that capital controls will not be lifted at this time and that interest rates are not the only tool to fight inflation keeping the risk of price freeze in the air the bottom line seems to be that interest rates are about to fall both in nominal and even more so in real

riksbank current repo rate 0 forecast for end of 2020 0 sweden s central bank ended nearly half a decade of negative interest rates this month by raising its benchmark rate to zero but it will probably stay put throughout 2020 and possibly until 2022 according to its latest rate path the final months of 2019 have seen a determination from governor stefan ingves and his colleagues to put the ultra loose monetary policy experiment behind them that s despite the economy heading towards a slowdown and inflation stuck below the 2 target having earned the sadomonetarist epithet from nobel laureate paul krugman in 2014 for keeping rates too high the board is now risking similar controversy with its latest move what bloomberg s economists say after raising rates to zero the riksbank will be slow to make another move a fragile global outlook will dampen demand in export oriented sweden at the same time the domestic critique against negative rates has been fierce and that makes new cuts highly unlikely even if the economy worsens we expect the riksbank to stay on hold during the remainder of 2020 johanna jeansson norges bank current deposit rate 1 5 forecast for end of 2020 1 5 after four rate hikes since september 2018 norway s monetary policy is on hold for the foreseeable future yet norges bank surprised the market on dec 19 when it kept the door open for another raise next year governor oystein olsen rejects any notion that he s hawkish with a message that he expects a stable benchmark rate possibly for years but some economists had expected him to lower the probability of a hike in 2020 due to weaker than forecast prospects for the norwegian economy instead the bank kept that chance at 40 amid a weak krone and higher oil prices reserve bank of new zealand current cash rate 1 forecast for end of 2020 0 75 signs the new zealand economy may be turning a corner have prompted most economists to scale back expectations for further rbnz easing in 2020 to just one more cut that was reinforced when governor adrian orr announced new capital rules for banks that were less onerous than expected easing fears they could drive up borrowing costs and require an offset from monetary policy the government has also announced a fiscal spending package that may relieve pressure on the rbnz to do more to stimulate growth that said downside risks remain and with room for further rate cuts limited the central bank has said it will outline its unconventional policy options early next year just in case they re needed what bloomberg s economists say the new zealand dollar has appreciated since the november monetary policy statement and with robust commodity prices is likely to remain above the expectations the rbnz s factored into their outlook a further 25bp cut is likely in 2020 but from there rates are likely to be on hold for a considerable period james mcintyre national bank of poland current cash rate 1 5 forecast for end of 2020 1 5 with benchmark interest rates unchanged at a record low 1 5 since march 2015 poland is in the midst of its longest ever period of stable borrowing costs based on the central bank s comments the pause will extend for the foreseeable future despite hitting a six year high this year inflation remains within the central bank s tolerance range while growth of the european union s largest eastern economy is the slowest in three years thate conflicting forces reduce the chance for any shift in rates strengthening governor adam glapinski s long held position that staying put ensures balanced and persistent economic expansion early in december he noted that inflation will only slightly overshoot next year adding so i can only repeat that a change in rates either way isn t necessary czech national bank current cash rate 2 forecast for end of 2020 2 the czech central bank is among the few in europe still discussing whether to raise interest rates but it may end up keeping them where they are for another year after lifting the benchmark to a 10 year high in may the eighth increase since summer 2017 policy makers have stayed put some have called for tighter policy to curb above target inflation driven by the eu s lowest unemployment rate and the bank s own forecast implies two hikes by the end of march but the majority on the monetary panel has voted down several motions to raise rates saying the

taiwan capitalism in the context of sino us imperialist conflict document endorsed by the 4th congress of the cwi section in china hong kong taiwan note the political parties which advocate taiwan s independence of which the ruling dpp is the dominant one bloc together as the pan greens while the kuomintang and its allies who favour closer china ties oppose independence are the pan blues taiwan within the context of the sino us imperialist conflict finds itself on the front line of the new cold war between the superpowers this marks the end of a period of relatively stable cross strait relations since at least the start of the century and the beginning of a new more turbulent period in which taiwan its people economy and politics are hostages of the two imperialist giants taiwan is affected in multiple ways by this conflict of course economically but even more as a crucial geopolitical chess piece in the respective strategies of us and chinese imperialism the us has shifted decisively to a containment policy to thwart the rise of china the chinese ruling class requires control of taiwan not only because of its powerful symbolism for the project of building a great chinese nation but to fundamentally tilt the military balance against the us in the south china sea and western pacific the us military is still more powerful but the gap is narrowing in china s backyard these new geopolitical realities cast a dark shadow over all other processes in taiwanese politics military emergencies incidents and even proxy wars are possible within the region in the next period if the us china conflict intensifies these processes posing great dangers for all the people of the region can spill over into taiwanese politics drawing the various political parties and capitalist factions into the conflict on different sides no wing of the capitalists in taiwan are capable of holding an independent position rather they will seek to become vassals for one of the superpowers only the working class based on strong organisation and independent politics can offer a way out of this nightmarish future the taiwanese economy highly dependent on china and the united states has already been severely impacted taiwanese capitalism which relies heavily on exports has been partially transformed from a model of taking orders in taiwan manufacturing in china and exporting to the united states to taiwan companies providing independent production chains separately for china and the united states how far this process goes depends on how far the sino us conflict and the de globalisation of the world economy go politically the taiwan bourgeoisie is no longer able to maintain its previous bilateral balance position this bilateral balance was based on the past co operation between china and the united states which has now been superseded by the sino us conflict in accordance with its economic interests the capitalist class in taiwan will be torn in three directions pro us pro china and trying to balance between the two this means that the confrontations and splits within the ruling class will intensify in the coming period and become one of the main trends of political development of the taiwan capitalist class if tsai ing wen is re elected the military threat on both sides of the taiwan strait will heat up for xi jinping this will be the latest in a series of serious economic and political setbacks increasing the pressure upon him to deliver a strong response the ccp will inevitably strengthen its propaganda of anti taiwan independence and attempt to block the united struggle of the working class on both sides of the strait the future of taiwan is an intensifying arms race and more threats of war proof of which is the tsai ing wen government s vigorous promotion of self reliance in national defence in reality far from an independent position this pushes the dpp further into the china containment strategy of the us the situation between the three sides us china and taiwan will grow even more tense the political and military threats of the ccp towards taiwan and the lack of international working class unity has created domestic support for militarization and nationalism in taiwan and has increased the peoples illusions in us imperialism bourgeois taiwanese nationalists tend to be the most reactionary on this issue and may push the anti ccp movement to the right such as supporting nationalism and military cooperation with the united states and japan if nationalist sentiment heightens it can cause tremendous pressure on international socialists marxists call for the chinese and taiwanese masses to unite together against military threats and the militarisation of both us and china and stand for the united struggle to defeat the ccp s dictatorship and the capitalist system national oppression like class oppression is endemic under capitalism marxists explain that only the working class based on the programme of international socialism can resolve the national question in taiwan in the world today we see many examples from catalonia to scotland of bourgeois nationalist parties that are incapable of conducting real struggle even to achieve their own nationally limited agenda invariably these capitalist parties and politicians have ties to or illusions in foreign imperialism only the working class which has no country as karl marx said can provide the leadership of the struggle for national and democratic rights as part of the struggle against capitalism and imperialism we stand for an independent socialist taiwan as part of a struggle against capitalism throughout our region this problem cannot be solved within the borders of taiwan alone or within the framework of crisis ridden capitalism as long as chinese and us imperialism dominate asia any move towards taiwanese independence will be blocked with capitalism defeated and workers democratic governments linking together in solidarity and voluntary cooperation across our region the right of self determination including the right to independence can be realised for all national groups marxists must understand that the mass hatred against the ccp s dictatorship and reunification is mainly based on the desire to defend existing democratic rights and autonomy and rejection of a return to one party dictatorship thus most people regard taiwan independence as a way out currently racism and chauvinism are not dominant in the mass consciousness however in the future without a strong left wing workers party to intervene and propose a platform for uniting the working class on both sides of the taiwan strait and an independent socialist taiwan the taiwan independence movement will continue to be used by the dpp and its right wing flank and become a pawn in the us imperialist strategy in view of the above when the ccp intensifies its attacks on taiwan it might push the anti ccp pro independence sentiment towards right wing chauvinism and racism economically the bourgeoisie has become more inclined to nationalist economic policies hoping to stimulate domestic investment and consumption the dpp government has also used such trend to promote nationalist economic policies to create a wave of repatriation of taiwanese capital in order to maintain its profits and market competitiveness the regime will further attack and deregulate labour rights land taxation and financial controls and plunder the environment taiwanese capital played a vital role in the historic rise of chinese capitalism today of china s top 20 companies exporting to the united states 15 of them have a taiwan background according to the average of the previous years 40 of taiwan s exports and 60 of foreign investment are in the chinese market the sino us conflict has resulted in a drop in taiwan s foreign trade with china but an increase with the us taiwan s investment in china has also declined by 56 9 the first three quarters of this year compared with the same period last year the amount of new investment in china as a proportion of total foreign investment has dropped from 83 8 in 2010 to only 34 1 this year in the long run this can weaken the ccp s economic influence on the taiwan capitalist class although us imperialism enjoys dominance in the global production chain and most taiwanese capitalists in terms of technology capital and markets are dependent on the us how the prolonged struggle of chinese and us capitalism unfolds is not possible to predict accurately this struggle will involve periods of ebb and flow temporary agreements and new eruptions of conflict in which both economies can be weakened with a negative impact on the rest of the global economy with the rise of chinese capitalism a faction of the taiwanese capitalists that is highly dependent on china has been formed based on the economic benefits brought about by the expansion of the chinese market and power they have become the ccp agents in taiwan as such the taiwan bourgeoisie and its political parties will further divide and polarize based on the future of the sino us conflict according to the above trend next year s general election is one of the battlefields between china and the us given the unappealing prospect of the ccp s one country two systems taiwan plan theory as well as the democratic struggle in hong kong the general mass consciousness is to resist the ccp and kuomintang pro china forces and to restore and defend existing democratic rights therefore the dpp and the us have gained a competitive advantage in the electoral battlefield especially in the short term with the absence of a strong left wing alternative the hope of oppose authoritarianism and protect democracy is wrongly attributed to the dpp and us imperialism the re election of the dpp will greatly undermine the authority of the ccp and exacerbate differences within the ccp over policy toward taiwan on the other hand the re election of the dpp will not bring about a more distinct and progressive taiwan independence policy it is subject to the pressure of pro china taiwanese capitalists and also depends on us strategy towards china even the pan greens bourgeois democratic demands for independence state building and changing the constitution are no longer part of the dpp s blueprint for governance taiwan s capitalist economy and the impending recession the prospects for the global economy look increasingly grim with a synchronized slowdown in nearly 90 percent of countries according to the imf a new world recession even if the timing is not clear is unlikely to resemble the last recession of 2007 9 which was the most devastating in 70 years the ability of central banks and governments to cushion the crisis with stimulus policies and massive monetary easing is considerably less than ten years ago and china with its debt mountain is unlikely to again step forwards as the saviour of global capitalism inter imperialist tensions the paralysis of global capitalist institutions like the wto and the worldwide trend towards nationalist economic policies make it much more difficult for the capitalists to coordinate solutions to a new global crisis this raises the possibility of a more serious or more prolonged downturn even than in 2007 09 for taiwan with its high level of dependence on the global market the next recession can bring unprecedented pressures and a massive intensification of the class struggle although taiwan has been described by a united nations report as the biggest winner in the sino us trade war this is not the case the taiwanese capitalists are deeply concerned the industry council pointed out in a 2019 white paper with the escalation of us china trade conflicts taiwan s export oriented economy will suffer from tit for tat retaliations this is no exaggeration the ministry of finance reported that taiwan s overall exports have shown a decline although exports to the us in the first nine months of this year increased by 17 7 over the same period exports to china fell by 7 1 overall from september last year to september this year exports fell by an average of 1 7 given the likelihood that the sino us conflict intensifies the impact will be even more dramatic the export price index hit its biggest decline in a decade the conflict between china and the united states has caused a decline in global market demand on one hand demand from chinese has declined and on the other hand taiwanese exports face more competition from chinese exports such as in the steel industry in this context the dpp government is hailing as its economic achievement that taiwanese repatriated investment has already reached nt 627 billion as of november 8th 152 firms and is expected to reach 700bn or even 800bn this year but at the same time the number of workers on unpaid leave has risen sharply this shows that in the imperialist conflict the working class is the first to suffer something that will have serious implications for the class struggle in 2018 taiwan listed companies had an average net profit of nt 2 19 trillion a fall of 1 3 for the year by the fourth quarter of the year profits had been severely reduced by 36 3 by year and 38 3 by quarter by the first half of 2019 profits were still down by 21 31 this reflects the impact of the sino us trade war on the profitability of taiwanese capital this profit decline is likely to be translated into more pro business laws in the future this is the case for listed companies and unavoidable for smes workers employed by smes accounting for 80 of taiwan s total workforce will definitely suffer therefore even though trillions of dollars in investments may have been repatriated to taiwan to invest in industrial production it will mostly be in capital intensive high end sectors thus is only able to provide a limited amount of jobs according to optimistic government estimates one trillion taiwan dollars of investment can create 100 000 jobs however there is a shortage of profitable industrial production in the world market and a large amount of excess capital is more willing to flow into real estate and financial speculation to profit from arbitrage and create economic bubbles the prolonged rising cost of living especially house prices has reduced the disposable income of grassroots people thus it is not possible to substantially stimulate consumption power to increase domestic demand the repatriation of taiwanese capital will not recreate the period of the so called economic miracle especially in the context of the world economic recession and decline of taiwan s exports on the contrary it may exacerbate domestic capital concentration and monopoly which especially because of the sino us conflict will destroy numerous small and medium sized enterprises according to a statistical survey by the academia sinica and the national university of political science up to 24 of wealth in taiwan is in the hands of 150 000 people 1 of the propertied population 64 of the wealth is in the hands of approximately 1 5 million people 10 their average wealth is nt 41 8 million according to ubs the assets of taiwan s rich overseas are as high as us 500 billion behind only to china at us 1 4 trillion and the us at us 700 billion as the old saying goes don t suffer from scarcity but suffer from inequality this fact and development of inequality between the rich and the poor will become a hotbed for polarization and social conflict since the dpp government came to power it has been trying to stimulate the stock market and corporate profits using state capitalist measures at the same time to boost domestic demand and promote industrial modernisation it follows typical neo liberal policies to attract domestic and foreign investment and reduce various operating costs as the capitalist crisis deepens the taiwan bourgeoisie needs to step up exploitation and oppression to maintain profits however if the dpp is re elected it may delay in the initial period the implementation of policies that directly attack workers so as not to trigger mass protests and to maintain public opinion support at the same time the government has turned to saving the economy as a pretext to promote pro business policies these policies indirectly harm the interests of workers in order to defend profits but are presented in such a way to make workers think they are not affected this is the case with the factory law the mining law and the overseas fund repatriation program law the dpp government also keeps up regular releases of small improvements to shore up its popularity and political legitimacy this is a new trend of the global bourgeoisie after nearly a decade of austerity policies the consumption levels of the working class have fallen due to the increased cost of living and falling wages and economic growth has stalled further and has fallen into a vicious circle more and more countries are moving towards adopting more state capitalist and nationalist economic policies in an attempt to stimulate growth however although these stimulus plans will include some public infrastructure or services these measures will not reverse the above trend instead capital tends to flow to speculative sectors therefore creating more economic bubbles and wastage which will only delay and intensify the economic recession taking a recent example the dpp government has made concessions under the pressure of public opinion concerning the rights of gig economy workers rules on advance notice of strikes and fire fighters rights however with the factory law and the mining law which have largely escaped public attention the government stands firmly on the same side as the big corporations as the sino us conflict worsens the outlook for the world economy the taiwanese capitalists will be even more intolerant of calls for various reform policies for more than three years various pro capitalist policies have shown that even in the face of resistance from the working class the capitalists and dpp government are becoming more hardline and have made no significant concessions in general it is increasingly difficult for bourgeois governments to balance the interests of the ruling classes of all factions no matter what policy the government implements it will not only lead to a backlash from the working class but it will also be more difficult to meet the demands of rival factions of the capitalists the expected bankruptcy of the public pension system by 2026 has become a hidden bomb of class confrontation in taiwan and will likely detonate larger social conflicts in the future whether it is to de regulate reform or wait for the problems to erupt this will also become a hot potato that the ruling party cannot avoid after 2020 avoiding the issue and trying to postpone the inevitable bankruptcy will only make future labour resistance more intense blue green and white parties and third forces it is nineteen years since the political scene came to be dominated by pan blue and pan green parties since this time the pan blues and greens have generally played the role of conservatives and liberals respectively as neither party represents the interests of the working class and the mass disappointment and disillusionment with pan blue and pan green parties increases the political vacuum has grown in this situation the taiwan people s party emerged as a form of pro capitalist populism the tpp was formed by former second and third level politicians of the pan blue and pan green parties objectively on the one hand it reflects that capitalism needs a new face to maintain control over political power while different factions of the bourgeoisie engage in an intensified power struggle to try to advance their interests in a crisis it can be expected that tri polar politics will become the norm of the political landscape in the coming period this will not resemble the clear division of the two party system in past years but it will be a period of instability and turbulence as political parties will see more splits new alliances and new formations third forces refer to the minor pan green parties that have emerged after the 2014 sunflower movement their common characteristics are electoralism opportunism and zigzagging positions although there is a huge political vacuum these petty bourgeois parties are unable to provide a real alternative so most of them can only depend on the dpp to varying degrees and it would be difficult for them to unite together to fill this void for example the dpp will further co opt social movements and third forces in the legislative elections and in the next term to strengthen its progressive image while most third force parties such as the social democrats and the green party and pan green social movement organisations are vigorously supporting tsai ing wen as such we can expect that these third forces will experience more challenges and volatility in the future the new power party are trying to use progressive policies and moderate reformism to promote a social movement friendly and progressive image to attract those who are disillusioned by the blue green and white parties in order to consolidate their own support base recently they have purged the pro dpp elements within their party they are now posing as a liberal party independent of the dpp in order to attract the social support lost by the dpp it cannot be ruled out that in the future mass resistance and new formations will adopt more leftist positions for electoral purposes but because they lack a solid and active mass base and embrace a pro capitalist program it will still be difficult for these formations to become a leading force in mass struggles after five years of transformation and development the social democratic party and the much downsized green party have transformed from social movement ngo election machines into parties of professional politicians the taiwan statebuilding party zigzags between liberalism and far right pro independence populism to capture support from pan green voters and its influence among the third forces is second only to that of the new power party as taiwan nationalism increases it cannot be ruled out that far right forces advocating more open racism and xenophobia can grow in the future the political situation will become more fragmented the positions and relations of different parties will become more complex and volatile the above situation will become the new normal in taiwan politics we must stand against the ccp dictatorship kuomintang kmt and the taiwan people s party and at the same time expose the pro capitalist and conservative nature of dpp from this we will establish a revolutionary vision for a workers mass party and the perspective of socialist workers democracy upon which we will build a solid revolutionary backbone with flexible methods this is the best way to fight against the dpp the illusions in the third forces and prepare for the subsequent disillusionment so that we are in a better position to consolidate and expand our party s influence amongst the most advanced workers and young people consciousness of the advanced youth and working class the 2018 election given the lack of a left wing alternative was dominated by a mood to punish the dpp but this also increased the fears among the advanced youth and workers about the prospects of the kmt s return to power and ccp infiltration the promotion of the one country two systems taiwan plan by xi jinping and hong kong s mass anti authoritarian struggle have greatly stimulated the political consciousness for defending democratic rights and taiwan s autonomy it cannot be ruled out that in the future a democratic movement against the ccp and its military threats comparable to the two million people holding hands to protect taiwan movement in 2004 may again break out if the dpp wins the upcoming presidential election as expected the masses would lose some of their sense of crisis and political fervour following the election when faced with pressures from taiwan s bourgeoisie the dpp would not be able to resist and can only bow down to them of course this does not mean that the dpp will not want to protect the reputation of the ruling party by making slight concessions this will also push the advanced youth and workers into seeking new political solutions however in the unlikely event that han kuo yu is elected it will make the situation more complicated far right forces can have more space to grow because the dpp will be able to hide behind the veil of opposition whenever attacks on workers are being done they will be exposed more slowly before the masses than if they are the ruling party as a result the dpp as a pro capitalist opposition may still be able to directly or indirectly lead the movement against ccp and kmt which will considerably limit and weaken the scope and the program of such struggle but even in the event of tsai ing wen s victory the situation can still be complicated and so the dpp will also face a governance crisis encouraged by the success of china airlines strike in 2016 labour rights awareness has grown significantly since then especially among the younger generation and has led to the founding of many new unions trade unions in the transportation industry have played a considerable role for example in helping and encouraging the china airlines and eva air cabin crew strikes the taiwan railway union struggle and the china airlines pilot strike the capitalists are vigorously pushing for the revision of the labour standards act and anti union laws which is a significant proof of the growth of the labour movement since the large scale westward movement towards china of taiwanese capital which has led to de industrialisation and the widespread implementation of neoliberal policies in taiwan the long term growth of wages has stagnated and purchasing power has fallen both the pan blues and pan greens are unable to fundamentally solve the problem of falling living standards the onshoring of taiwanese capital will not reverse this at the same time the gap between rich and poor continues to widen and there are more and more attacks from big business today s average monthly take home pay is only nt 40 773 which is less than nt 40 890 of 16 years ago at the same time the salary of young employees has grown by only 15 on average over the past 20 years yet the national housing price to income ratio has increased by 178 in the same period the gap between the bottom 5 of households compared to the richest 5 has increased from 55 times to 113 times indeed the real situation must be even more serious grassroots young people s illusions about class mobility are weaker than those of middle aged and elderly people in the struggle against the reform of the labour standards act in 2017 and the two largest strikes of recent years eva air china airlines most of the protestors and activists who showed solidarity were working class youth the above objective facts are a solid foundation for the growth of labour consciousness and anti capitalist sentiment this trend will give the left and the labour movement important development opportunities in future social crises however due to the lack of mass left wing workers political parties and the lack of organisation of the working class the taiwanese labour movement is still weak with a few exceptions the main union leaders are out of touch with the mass struggle bureaucratized and extremely conservative failing to attract many young workers who are new to the struggle the different unions have not yet been able to coordinate and unite with each other so we urgently need to propose a fighting national trade union federation marxists must be involved in the labour movement and fight to radicalize it international socialist forward was fully involved in the eva air flight attendants strike we gave support to the striking workers and independently proposed winning strategies and plans during the strike we gave suggestions to the trade unions to step up their propaganda in order to win a wider layer of mass support as well as concrete proposals we also pushed the eva air strike to link up with different union organisations to hold rallies in support of the strike taiwan s social movement is still stuck in the ngo style small circle leadership model that lacks organisation and clear leadership it does not base itself on organised and fighting mass struggle nor does it consciously seek to raise the political awareness of the mass movement thus acting as a bureaucratic obstacle factors such as the ccp s crackdown capitalist exploitation homophobic threats the party state legacy and environmental damage will all provoke struggles from the advanced groups in society however this is bound to challenge the existing ngo based social movement model and corresponding organisations as was shown by the defeat of the struggle against labour law revision in 2017 and the defeat of the marriage equality referendum in 2018 lessons will be drawn and the ngo model of leadership will increasingly be challenged in future in this context marxists call for a fighting left wing workers party that is democratically accountable after more than a decade of saying goodbye to the era of economic prosperity the social mobility of the working class in taiwan has been greatly reduced and class consciousness is growing the living standards of the petty bourgeoisie are also being proletarianized so they are also agitating causing political changes and instability there will be more and more social movements with significant participation also from the middle class and youth such as campaigns on environmental issues and gender equality issues our organisation s involvement in the lgbt rights movement in these two years is a good example our involvement in the gay equality movement with an anti capitalist program and a class struggle line attracted a new group of young people from working class and middle class backgrounds the global climate movement that has emerged this year has also attracted millions of people in many european countries the us and australia with youth as the largest group marxists must fight for the attention of most progressive and radical elements and provide a working class struggle strategy for the movement the struggle for democracy and socialism the struggle to defend and deepen democratic rights will play a pivotal role in the future in the face of mass resistance to the ccp s bullying and fear of the kmt s return coupled with the historic anti authoritarian movement in hong kong since june 2019 the dpp is regarded as the force to defend taiwan against china thus tsai is expected to win a landslide presidential victory and she hopes to return to the peak of popularity as the sino us conflict escalates the dpp is becoming more dependent on us imperialism we do not rule out that tsai ing wen given us support would be more confident to adopt more anti china rhetoric and use democracy to win support but the real purpose is to increase the geopolitical and economic interests of taiwan s capitalism and the political prestige of the dpp within the sino us conflict however we know that as political representative of taiwan s bourgeoisie the dpp is in fact weak in its stand against the ccp dictatorial regime playing the role of a brake on mass struggle if the pro democracy masses in taiwan are further radicalized the role of the dpp would be exposed for example on the issue of transitional justice addressing the legacies of the kmt dictatorship this could widen and even be translated into practical actions and demands that go far beyond the dpp s compromise and reconciliation position in this situation marxists must be the democratic vanguards of the workers independent of the blue green and white factions of the capitalist class and both chinese and american imperialism we not only defend existing democratic rights but also point out that the unity of the working class across the taiwan straits is the only thing that can truly resist the ccp dictatorship it is necessary to fight for workers democratic rights and an independent socialist taiwan and to oppose the dictatorship of the capitalists only in this way can our party be rooted in revolutionary youth and workers taiwanese capitalists who desire and depend on profits from the chinese market are the main ccp representatives in taiwan therefore in order to win the struggle against these ccp proxies must be an anti capitalist struggle led by the working class combining democratic demands including the demand for national independence with the programme of socialist revolution the ccp s policy of extending its influence over taiwan s economy is currently being resisted by the dpp government and this may increase in the next period with the escalation of the sino us conflict a weakened control over taiwan will undermine xi jinping s authority and intensify the ccp s internal power struggle and could under certain conditions strengthen the confidence of the chinese masses to engage in struggle at the same time this process is contradictory the political positions of the pan greens of narrow bourgeois nationalism and collaboration with the anti china strategy of us imperialism cannot attract the mainland masses and in many cases will repel them the ccp will of course exploit such propaganda gifts to mould domestic opinion in favour of more severe political and military intimidation to show strength only by mass struggle to defend and extend democracy and ending the dictatorship of the capitalists can the people of taiwan effectively resist the ccp s policy of bribes and intimidation only by nationalising the banks and big companies and placing them under the democratic control and management of the working class and the public can foreign capitalist manipulation a central strategy of the ccp be broken failing this then of course the ccp s enticement policy would enable it to have a deeper and more rooted influence on taiwan s political situation the rapid rise of the right wing anti lgbt movement is based on its tightly centralized church based organisation solid beliefs and massive financial strength after the 2018 referendum victory their confidence has grown now they are eyeing the parliamentary elections although the chances of winning a seat are small this is intended to create an organisational basis for a political party of the religious anti lgbt movement their political rise shows that the conservative right wing religious forces are filling the political vacuum created by the disillusionment in both pan blues and pan greens some of which is turning into the political power base of the conservative right wing sect the bureaucrats of the official lgbt movement have yet to draw the correct lessons from the last defeat and therefore the far right offensive will continue with the campaign for the abortion referendum and other reactionary positions threatening another blow to the movement for democratic and equal rights as with the situation globally with the lack of a left wing socialist alternative we see the rise of right wing forces that seek to divide the working class and the oppressed with their growing attacks on women lgbt and immigrants which the far right parties in europe and trump in the united states have used as scapegoats for the capitalist crisis but as our international shows only a combative mass movement can effectively resist and fightback in ireland we have won the right to abortion in the united states we are fighting against trump s gender discrimination policy and in south africa we are active against xenophobia capitalism and imperialism on a world scale and in taiwan is entering into a period of unprecedented crisis and turmoil which in turn means the mood of the masses will be more radical and the scale of the mass struggle is likely to expand this places heavy demands on a marxist organisation to build our forces and win support for socialist ideas and methods at the same time the mass movement will become more complicated as a result of the deepening social and political crisis and the fact that mass consciousness is lagging behind the objective situation given that we are still a small organisation and the left is currently just a small voice within the whole movement it requires even more effort for us to get our voice heard so as to attract the best workers and youth into our ranks we must follow events closely be always prepared to intervene in the ever changing situation and train a bigger and stronger marxist cadre
that nigeria s debt is humongous and the economy has a revenue challenge are no longer in contest how the country will exit the quagmire is now the concern kunle aderinokun wonders if the appointment of the new chairman of the federal inland revenue service mr muhammad nami will make any difference nigeria is at a crossroads the debt stock is burgeoning with service payment to revenue ratio trending northward and increasingly becoming more unsustainable hence something drastic must be done to turn the tide according to the debt management office the country s total debt portfolio hit n25 701 trillion 83 882 billion this year s june out of which the states and the federal capital territory accounted for n5 276 trillion 17 220 billion and the remaining portion accumulated by the federal government the external debt portion of the total debt stood at 27 163 billion in the review period but by the time the recently approved 30 billion foreign loans are fully contracted nigeria will be burdened with 57 163 billion debt it expected that with the additional foreign loan the federal government will be servicing the humongous debt with about 80 per cent of revenue this is a significant increase from the current 58 per cent debt service as it stands the debt service position has crowded the capital budget leaving a very low revenue for critical infrastructure development thereby stunting economic growth however the federal government through the dmo has said most of its new loans were taken from china and the world bank and were contracted at discretionary interest rates with long years of moratorium besides the debt office said at the current level the country s debt stock is sustainable caution but the international monetary fund has cautioned nigeria alongside other african countries against rising level of indebtedness to china saying the non paris club creditors create some instability or some vulnerabilities the financial counsellor and director monetary and capital market department imf tobias adrian said this during a media briefing on the global financial stability report gfsr at this year s imf world bank annual meetings in washington dc adrian who responded to a question on the elevated external debt levels in nigeria and whether the federal government should shift to more of domestic borrowing adrian said both domestic and external debt markets are important for economic growth and development and both markets should be well developed but of course any borrowing has to be managed in a responsible manner there are both costs and benefits so borrowing can be helpful for economic growth and investment but it can also be dangerous when negative shocks arise so we have done a lot of work in the imf on debt sustainability and debt management and we have a host of recommendations of how to manage debt in a responsible manner weak economy there is no gainsaying the fact the nation s debt situation has left the economy in a precarious situation especially with low revenue making the recovery pace of the economy which recently exited recession slow the imf in a report after the conclusion of its staff s visit to nigeria early october alluded to this according to the bretton woods institution the pace of economic recovery remains slow as depressed private consumption and investors wait and see attitude kept growth in the first half of the year at 2 percent a rate significantly below population growth headline inflation has fallen reaching its lowest level since january 2016 helped by lower food price inflation spurred by one off increases in imports the current account turned into a deficit in the first half of 2019 after three years of surpluses gross international reserves have fallen to below 42 billion at end august 2019 mainly reflecting a decline in foreign holdings of short term securities and equity the exchange rate in various windows remained stable helped by steady sales of foreign exchange by the central bank of nigeria cbn carryover from 2018 to 2019 helped increase public investment spending in the first half of 2019 but revenue underperformed significantly relative to the budget target in the first half of 2019 over optimistic revenue projections have led to higher financing needs than initially envisaged resulting in overreliance on expensive borrowing from the cbn to finance the fiscal deficit federal government interest payments continue to absorb more than half of revenues in 2019 imf stated to further appreciate nigeria s current economic situation few days ago moody s investors service one of the global credit rating agencies in its report changed its outlook on country s ratings to negative from stable it explained already weak government finances will likely weaken further given an extremely narrow revenue base and persistently sluggish growth that hinders fiscal consolidation as pressures mount there is a risk that the government resorts to increasingly opaque and costly options to finance a moderate but rising debt burden moreover vulnerability to an adverse change in capital flows is building in light of nigeria s increasing reliance on foreign investors to fund the country s foreign exchange reserves the finance minister budget and national planning mrs zainab ahmed just like her predecessor mrs kemi adeosun insists nigeria does not have a debt problem but a revenue challenge we have heard repeatedly that nigeria is inching towards a debt crisis and we have consistently said that nigeria does not have a debt crisis our total borrowing rate is just under 50 per cent of our gdp while the multilateral institutions project for a country to borrow from 50 to 55 per cent of the gross domestic product gdp what we have is a revenue problem our revenue performance by half year is 58 per cent so we have designed this strategic revenue growth initiative early this year which has three thematic areas noted ahmed recently according to government nigeria s tax to gdp ratio is 6 per cent which is the lowest in the world oil revenue which accounts for a major lifeline for the economy is not reliable and can no longer sustain the economy hence the need to expand tax revenue reforms realising the ensuing economic challenges and the dire need for adequate revenue to buoy the economy the federal government proposed a finance bill and in october submitted same to the national assembly which graciously passed it but the bill currently awaits president muhammadu buhari s assent the finance bill seeks to establish practical measures to generate additional revenues for the government to partly finance the deficit in the 2020 budget to achieve these the bill sought to amend various tax laws in the country the bill proposes fiscal measures in support of the 2020 budget of the federal government with extensive tax implications for the country with a total proposed expenditure of n10 33 trillion against total expected revenue of n8 15 trillion resulting in a deficit of n2 18 trillion the 2020 budget is projected to be financed partly by tax revenues expected to be generated through the key fiscal changes introduced by the bill the bill contains notable changes to the companies income tax act value added tax vat act petroleum profits tax act ppta personal income tax act capital gains tax act cgta customs and excise tariff etc consolidation act and stamp duties act for 2019 budget the federal government appropriated n8 92 trillion out of which n6 319 trillion was allocated to recurrent expenditure with the remaining n2 094 trillion for capital expenditure of the n6 319 trillion recurrent expenditure debt service gulped n2 254 trillion as at june 30 2019 a total n3 39 trillion had been spent according to ahmed minister of finance budget and national planning as at half year the federal government s actual aggregate revenue was n2 04 trillion which is 58 percent of the pro rata target this includes oil revenue of n900 billion 49per cent performance company income tax cit of n349 11 billion 86per cent performance value added tax vat of n81 36 billion 71per cent performance and customs collections of n184 10 billion 100 47per cent performance she explained that the overall revenue performance is only 58 percent of the target in the 2019 budget largely because some one off items such as the n710 billion from oil joint venture asset restructuring and n320 billion from revision of the oil production sharing contract legislation terms are yet to be actualized fiscal deductions by nnpc for federally funded projects also exceeded target as at the end of 2018 firs made a collection of n5 3 trillion out of which ahmed said the federal government gave n1 9 trillion budget support to states expectations that is why all eyes are on the new chairman of the federal inland revenue service mr muhammad nami to fulfill the objectives of the finance bill although relatively unknown nami who replaced mr babatunde fowler is expected to implement the far reaching measures outlined in the finance bill with a view to generating adequate revenue and up the ante this will be necessary to assuage the prevailing unfortunate economic situation where a large portion of recurrent expenditure are dedicated to debt servicing given the huge task before them nami and his team must not be told to hit the ground running there is not time to wait a tax expert and head of tax and corporate advisory services at pwc nigeria mr taiwo oyedele said the new firs leadership needs to build on the gains that have been made so far especially in the area of tax awareness better coordination with sub national levels through the joint tax board and the various initiatives to digitalise tax compliance according to him the immediate priority for the new firs chairman and board should be how to build capacity to implement the nigeria tax and fiscal law amendment bill otherwise known as the finance bill which seeks to amend seven different tax laws and expected to take effect from january 2020 other key areas of focus should include effective and efficient tax administration beyond mere tax collection this should be measured by concrete improvements in the ease of paying taxes index ensuring robust and transparent reporting of tax revenue generation and expansion of the tax net he added in his own view an economist and ceo global analytics derivatives mr tope fasua said going by his past visibility or lack of one it is easy to despair that he may get overwhelmed by the enormity of the task and therefore not set large targets for his team but many times we have seen people come in from the cold and work wonders fasua believed the finance bill gives mr nami a template to work with saying the idea of a finance bill should be made a permanent feature of our budgets going forward specifically the chief executive noted mr nami on his own part at firs should ensure he broadens the tax net to include many nigerians who are otherwise disillusioned he should also set ambitious target beyond the n8 5trillion that his predecessor set for 2020 firs should be targeting n15trillion by 2021 it can be done especially if he revisits many of the moribund tax lines that for political reasons have been neglected such as luxury tax carbon tax some aspects of capital gains tax and excise duties on goods such as alcohol and cigarettes which have seen a push back from manufacturers mr nami should be very diplomatic and communicative and be able to paint a vivid picture of what these stakeholders stand to gain to improve their businesses and livelihoods in order to be successful he however added before his appointment nami was a tax consultant he comes with qualifications and professional practice as well as licences from relevant professional bodies according to a statement signed by the senior special assistant media and publicity to the president malam garba shehu the new firs boss is armed with almost three decades of practical work experience in auditing tax management and advisory and management services to clients in the banking manufacturing services and public sectors as well as non profit organisations director union capital market ltd mr egie akpata is of the opinion that the new firs chairman is coming into the role at a very challenging time for federal government finances given the macroeconomic indices it would be difficult for the firs to meet its short term revenue targets it is important to realise that firs does not collect personal income taxes which is left to the states in an economy dominated by the informal sector and smes it is hard to see where the increase in firs revenue is expected to come from tax paying corporates are already overburdened by a 32 per cent marginal tax rate which is very high on a global scale so there is no room to increase the corporate tax rate 2 5 per cent gdp growth is unlikely to produce incremental taxes from the existing tax compliant companies he said akpata believed the firs would need to significantly increase the number of tax paying companies according to him the use of technology and banking information could help bring more companies into the tax net also a much larger workforce would be needed by the firs to properly track down these tax defaulters he noted akpata however suggested that if the firs wants to radically change their income profile something radical needs to be done a lower corporate tax rate should be considered to encourage other non tax payers to become compliant the current 32 per cent rate is high enough to discourage businesses from complying he stated
in currency direction and movement terms the year of 2019 will be remembered as a period when the nz dollar dramatically diverged away from its economic fundamentals export commodity prices in particular the similarities of the 2019 nzd usd rate movements to what occurred the year before in 2018 is also telling in 2018 global risk off investor sentiment largely due to the looming trade wars between china and the us caused the us dollar to strengthen and currency speculators sold currencies like the nz dollar against the usd as it was viewed our economy would suffer more in that deteriorating international trade economic environment the nz dollar depreciated 10 cents against the usd in 2018 from 0 7400 to a low of 0 6400 by october 2018 as it turned out the nz economy proved to be more robust against the expected global headwinds and by the end of 2018 stronger than forecast gdp growth caused the rbnz and others to abandon their negative economic forecasts the kiwi rebounded to 0 6900 in early 2019 as speculative short sold nzd position were unwound according to the iconic 1981 split enz song history never repeats however that is exactly what did not happen to the kiwi dollar in 2019 the movements against the usd erringly mirrored the 2018 pattern and despite agriculture export commodity prices rising through the year rbnz and bank economic forecasters yet again painted a gloomy picture for our economy they confidently cited the auckland property market weakness and global risks such as the trade wars and brexit as causing the economy to stumble and stall towards a much lower growth performance and possibly into recession local business confidence plunged further into the abyss as many business owners and managers obviously believed the forecasts of a much weaker economy the negativity culminated in the rbnz cutting the ocr interest rate in august by 0 50 sending an almost panic signal that the economy was in deep trouble offshore currency speculators backed the weaker nz economy view of the rbnz and the bank economists and sold the kiwi down 7½ cents over the year from 0 6900 to a low 0 6250 in early october a deliberate devaluing of the chinese yuan as a counter measure to us import tariffs for chinese product also played a part this year as the aud and nzd currencies follow the yuan yet again as gdp growth and other economic data have proven the economy did not slow up in 2019 to the extent widely forecast the currency punters have been forced to unwind their short sold nzd positions sending the nzd usd rate up sharply over the last three months to 0 6600 business confidence has improved over the last two months as the rbnz reversed their extreme dovish august view to a much more positive economic outlook in their november monetary policy statement some of the banks have also been forced to abruptly reverse their nzd usd rate forecasts from below 0 6000 to above 0 6500 as an eventful year draws to a close the nz economy is in great shape with still high export commodity prices and a property markets on the rise again after a very modest correction regular readers of this weekly column will recall that we never bought into the stalling nz economy scenario and therefore viewed the kiwi dollar as over sold and undervalued at exchange rates below 0 6500 the currency speculators sold it down well below 0 6500 however yet again they have been burnt by following the gloomy economic forecasts that have been subsequently proven to be inaccurate looking ahead 2020 economic picture refreshingly clearer the first matter to contemplate when projecting likely nzd usd exchange rate movements in 2020 is that the currency speculators will not be selling the nz dollar by blindly following negative rbnz and local bank economic forecasts that have proven to be well wide of the mark in 2019 from the current rate of 0 6600 the downside risks for the kiwi dollar appear limited whereas the upside has potential with a stronger global economy and a return to economic fundamentals as the main driver the brexit and trade war issues have been partially resolved and these risks are thus disappearing global economic growth forecasts will start to be revised upwards instead of downwards the changing international economic landscape is good news for growth commodity currencies nzd and aud and negative for the usd as the safe haven fx trades of the last two years are unwound unfortunately for the australians climatic risks have conspired against them with drought and now horrific bush fires adversely impacting on their otherwise recovering economy the nzd usd exchange rate can be expected to be more heavily influenced by the usd side of the currency pair in 2020 over recent years the americans have operated a loose fiscal policy resulting in the large and growing internal budget deficit and relatively tighter monetary policy compared to europe and the rest of the world the european economic policy settings have been the opposite very loose monetary policy and relatively tight fiscal policy since the federal reserve reversed their previous tightening bias with interest

the u s house and senate managed to wrap up their work for the year without shutting down the government an improvement on the state of affairs when the fully republican controlled congress left for the winter holiday break in 2018 the two huge bills contained about 1 4 trillion in spending which will keep the federal government open through the end of the current fiscal year on september 30 2020 president donald trump signed the legislation what s in the bills the associated press reported on some of the important compromises the legislation delivers trump a victory on his u s mexico border fence and gives democrats long sought domestic spending increases and a repeal of obama era taxes on high cost health insurance plans it blends spending increases for both sides reelection fodder for lawmakers with tax and benefit add ons that will mean a roughly 400 billion boost to the deficit over 10 years the core of the spending bill is formed by the 12 annual agency appropriations bills passed by congress each year it fills in the details of a bipartisan framework from july that delivered about 100 billion in agency spending increases over the coming two years instead of automatic spending cuts the bill exceeds trump s budget requests in virtually every domestic category except for trump s request for 8 billion plus for the u s mexico wall it was cut back to 1 4 billion equal to last year s appropriation the measure preserves trump s ability to use his budget powers to tap other accounts for several times that amount that s a blow for liberal opponents of the wall but an acceptable trade off for democrats who wanted to gain 27 billion in increases for domestic programs other notable provisions 25 million for research on gun violence which hasn t been federally funded for 20 years 425 million for election security but without mandates for paper ballots and post election audits an increase in funding to conduct the 2020 census the minimum age to buy smoking and vaping products will be raised to 21 but anti smoking advocates criticized the provisions as less effective than other regulations the tobacco industry has fought the export import bank will be reauthorized for seven years how the iowans voted the domestic spending package passed by 297 votes to 120 in the house and by 71 votes to 23 in the senate the military and security bills passed by 280 votes to 138 in the house and by 81 votes to 11 in the senate the roll calls show many house democrats supported the domestic spending but opposed the defense package because of the wall funding while many republicans voted the opposite way however no one in iowa s delegation split their votes on the appropriations deal republican senators chuck grassley and joni ernst voted for both bills as did democratic representatives abby finkenauer ia 01 dave loebsack ia 02 and cindy axne ia 03 republican steve king ia 04 opposed both measures side note it s difficult to follow congressional happenings just by looking at the roll call votes in the house and senate because the bill titles often have nothing to do with the content shortly before the final votes h r 1865 was amended to include fiscal year 2020 appropriations from eight other bills covering most domestic spending and h r 1158 was amended to include the contents of four appropriations bills including defense and homeland security funds the congressional research service website explained the context fortunately otherwise you d never guess that the vote on the national law enforcement museum commemorative coin act contained the domestic spending package and the dhs cyber hunt and incident response teams act contained the defense appropriations for the remainder of the 2020 fiscal year among the democratic presidential candidates who serve in the senate michael bennet voted for both bills while cory booker amy klobuchar bernie sanders and elizabeth warren did not vote while campaigning elsewhere what the iowans said about the budget deal as is typical for members of congress the iowans issued statements highlighting provisions they had co sponsored or fought to include in the spending package even king who defended his vote against both appropriations bills released a long list of items he was proud to have supported all of the iowa representatives and senators mentioned the retroactive extension of the biodiesel tax credit and most touted funding to expand broadband access in rural communities i enclose below all of those official comments in full notably ernst released a statement about the defense bill but did not highlight her vote for the domestic spending agreement which many conservative commentators criticized statement from representative abby finkenauer december 17

requiring the dod to report to congress on contracting practices specifically on the sole source spare parts contracts for which the dod is unable to obtain accurate cost data this amendment is a

to secure reasonable prices in contracts grassley also sent a letter to the leadership of the house and senate armed services committees urging them not to adopt a house provision in the fy 2020 ndaa

key point no country can keep growing and paying for its social services without a positive population pyramid population growth driven by immigration has helped power australia to a record breaking 28 straight years of economic expansion yet government warnings of an aging time bomb have sparked alarm that the good times cannot last forever even in the lucky country australian treasurer josh frydenberg raised the alarm in mid november when he suggested the nation s increasing aged population could represent an economic time bomb it is a great development that people are living longer but we must be prepared for the implications if we don t remain fiscally disciplined today the next generation will have to pick up the bill tomorrow he told the committee for economic development of australia in sydney the treasurer warned of a growing fiscal burden on both the revenue and spending side particularly amid stagnating productivity growth among its estimated 25 million population baby boomers those born between 1946 and 1964 now number more than 5 million with their retirements constituting a structural headwind for the economy the baby boomers are forecast to cost the government budget some a 36 billion us 24 billion a year by 2028 more than it spends on the national health insurance scheme medicare at around 15 percent australia s elderly defined as those aged 65 and older as a proportion of the overall population is well below other oecd nations such as japan 25 percent and germany 21 percent according to the oecd s 2014 data yet key demographic indicators such as the dependency ratio are deteriorating from nearly eight working age persons for every australian aged over 65 in the 1970s the proportion has now halved and could drop to as low as two by 2066 depending on immigration levels the proportion of australians aged over 85 could triple in size to reach around 1 5 million over the same period accounting for 4 percent of the total population meanwhile the number of those not paying income tax could reach 22 percent of the population up from 15 percent currently the older the population is the more people are on welfare benefits we need more health care and there s a smaller base to pay the taxes professor ian harper of the melbourne business school told the abc s 7 30 program an older population is also seen lowering consumption and increasing savings contributing to deflationary pressures as seen in advanced aging societies such as japan government debt is also likely to rise due to governments reluctance to cut pensions and raise taxes for political reasons the reserve bank of australia has slashed official interest rates to a record low of 0 75 percent amid low inflation and sluggish economic growth curbing savings income for retirees and forcing many to work longer while the current retirement age is 66 it is scheduled to reach 67 by july 2023 although plans to raise it to 70 were axed in the face of public opposition declining birth rate australia s demographics since the 1970s have been a tale of declining births offset by increased new arrivals since 1976 australia s total fertility rate tfr has been below the estimated replacement level of 2 1 babies per women in 2017 the tfr was 1 74 well down on its postwar levels above 3 percent abs data reveals the prospect for a turnaround appears limited given the downward slide in developed world birth rates and domestic factors young australians are facing a hell of a hill they are coming out of universities with a much larger debt than their parents did and they are going to have to buy in the most expensive housing market in the world all against a backdrop of negative income growth economist gerard minack said it s a trifecta that s pretty tough for them making up the difference has been high levels of immigration according to abs data nearly two thirds of population growth in the year to march 2019 was from net overseas migration particularly in the populous eastern states of new south wales victoria and queensland high immigration levels have become increasingly important to the economy adding an estimated 0 5 and 1 percentage point annually to gdp growth migrants are typically also younger than the resident population with around 84 percent of those arriving in fiscal 2016 less than 40 years old compared to 54 percent of the resident population more than a quarter of the nation s population was born overseas led by former british residents who accounted for 5 percent of the population in 2016 however those born in asia now outnumber those born in europe with people born in china now accounting for 2 5 percent india 2 2 percent and the philippines 1 1 percent the tendency of such new arrivals to settle in the major cities of sydney and melbourne has sparked concerns of increasing pressure on infrastructure and housing costs together with rising pollution and quality of life issues congestion in australia s state capitals is estimated to cost the economy a 25 billion a year in lost productivity with driving still the dominant form of travel yet any move by canberra to turn off the immigration tap could tip the economy into recession population increase is estimated to have contributed around 1 66 percent to annual gdp growth in the decade since the global financial crisis gfc compared to 1 24 percent in the prior period the latest gdp data showed the economy slowing to a 1 4 percent annual expansion its weakest pace since the gfc amid sluggish household spending and weak business investment in a per capita sense the economy went backwards in the last 12 months westpac economist bill evans told abc news reform push could reforms help alleviate australia s demographic pressures accounting group pwc suggests increasing workforce participation rates among younger workers females and elderly could lift potential gdp by as much as 12 percent it argues that australia ranks only 14th of 35 countries in labor market performance below the oecd average realizing the potential economic gains from greater participation will need a mix of policies to overcome discrimination in the workplace boost vocational training including retraining for all age groups and improve childcare and flexible working arrangements said pwc chief economist jeremy thorpe successive australian governments have certainly made progress over the last two decades but our analysis suggests more needs to be done for australia to match international best practice and drive economic growth amid a backlash over any move to raise the pension age the australian government has proposed measures including encouraging migrants to settle in regional areas and developing alternative employment hubs in major cities as well as providing funding to alleviate urban congestion and strengthen infrastructure growth in the working age population is still seen giving australia an advantage through to 2025 along with other immigration friendly countries such as the united states canada and britain according to nikko asset management s chris rands yet as australia s frydenberg admitted productivity is the most important source of income growth over the long run contributing three quarters of real gross national income growth over the past 30 years with politically unpopular reforms consigned to the too hard basket immigration likely will continue propping up economic growth until it too reaches its limits time bomb or otherwise australia s demographic clock is definitely ticking

a sales staff helps a customer at a machine tools section inside a mall in ohio us associated press us economic growth nudged up in the third quarter and the economy appears to have maintained the moderate pace of expansion as the year ended supported by a strong labour market other data on friday showed consumer spending increased solidly in november adding to a string of upbeat data that have helped to quell recession fears which gripped financial markets in the summer the longest expansion in history now in its 11th year remains on track thanks to the federal reserve cutting interest rates three times this year the us central bank last week kept rates steady and signaled borrowing costs could remain unchanged at least through 2020 though growth has been relatively strong economists did not expect the economy to achieve the trump administration s 3 0 target this year still the resilient economy could offer some respite for president donald trump who was impeached on charges of abusing his office on wednesday by the democratic led house of representatives the data will comfort the fed that the economy is in a good place and monetary policy is appropriate said gregory daco chief us economist at oxford economics in new york gross domestic product increased at a 2 1 annualized rate the commerce department said in its third estimate of third quarter gdp that was unrevised from november s estimate the economy grew at a 2 0 pace in the april june period despite the unrevised estimate which was in line with economists expectations consumer spending was stronger than previously reported in the third quarter there were also upgrades to business spending on nonresidential structures such as power infrastructure which limited the drop in overall business investment that offset downward revisions to investment in homebuilding and inventory accumulation imports which are a drag to gdp growth were higher than previously estimated growth estimates for the fourth quarter range from as low as a 1 5 rate to as high as a 2 3 pace growth has slowed from the 3 1 rate notched in the first three months of the year in part because of the 17 month trade war between the united states and china and the fading stimulus from last year s 1 5 trillion tax cut package when measured from the income side the economy grew at a 2 1 rate in the last quarter rather than the 2 4 pace estimated in november gross domestic income gdi increased at a rate of 0 9 in the second quarter the revision to the income side of the growth ledger reflected a downgrade to corporate profits after tax profits without inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustment which corresponds to s p 500 profits were revised down to show them declining 23 1 billion or at a rate of 1 2 profits were previously reported to have decreased 11 3 billion or at a rate of 0 6 in the third quarter they were in part held down by legal settlements with facebook and google profits increased at a 3 3 rate in the second quarter the average of gdp and gdi also referred to as gross domestic output and considered a better measure of economic activity also increased at a 2 1 rate in the july september period the data boosted the dollar against a basket of currencies while us treasury prices fell stocks on wall street were treading higher pushing key indexes to new record highs the economy s moderate growth speed appears to have persisted in the fourth quarter in a second report on friday the commerce department said consumer spending which accounts for more than two thirds of u s economic activity rose 0 4 last month as households stepped up purchases of motor vehicles and spent more on healthcare consumption increased 0 3 in october consumer spending is being supported by the lowest unemployment rate in nearly half a century but inflation stayed tame last month and could remain so for a while the university of michigan s survey of consumers showed households one year inflation expectations fell in december to 2 3 the lowest in three years from 2 5 in november if this month s drop in inflation expectations is sustained or intensifies it would be concerning to the fed which is trying to lift inflation and would suggest easier monetary policy than would prevail otherwise said scott hoyt a senior economist at moody s analytics in west chester pennsylvania despite the economy improving prospects risks remain boeing s decision this week to suspend production of its best selling 737 max jetliner in january after two fatal crashes of the now grounded aircraft means the fallout is likely to drag into 2020 that could pressure the fragile manufacturing sector which was starting to stabilize as the us china trade tensions ebb reuters
the stats it was a particularly busy week on the economic calendar in the week ending 20th december a whopping 94 stats were monitored in a data deluge week before christmas just 54 stats had been monitored in the week prior of the 94 stats 34 came in ahead forecasts with 43 economic indicators coming up short of forecast 17 stats were in line with forecasts looking at the numbers 39 of the stats reflected an upward trend from previous figures of the remaining 55 41 stats reflected a deterioration from previous for the greenback the focus was back on the economic calendar with brexit woes returning both supporting demand for the dollar the dollar did manage to shrug off the democrat s impeachment vote for the week the dollar spot index rose by 0 53 to 97 690 out of the u s it was a busy week for the dollar with the stats skewed to the positive on monday prelim december private sector pmis delivered mixed results while the manufacturing sector activity slowed marginally the all important service sector activity picked up at the end of the year with services accounting for the lion s share of the economy this was a welcome outcome contributing to a marginal increase in the composite pmi figures from new york state also reflected an upward trend with the manufacturing index rising from 2 9 to 3 5 in december on tuesday industrial production figures impressed with production jumping by 1 1 in november month on month jolts job openings were also dollar positive with openings rising from 7 032m to 7 267m in october with no stats on wednesday the focus then shifted to a relatively busy 2nd half of the week the philly fed manufacturing index and weekly jobless claims figures were in focus on thursday both sets of numbers disappointed weighing on the dollar on the day on friday finalized 3rd quarter gdp numbers were in line with previous estimates limiting any dollar reaction the fed s preferred core pce price index figures also failed to pressure the dollar in spite of the annual rate of core inflation easing from 1 7 to 1 6 story continues consumer sentiment figures and personal pending did have an impact however personal spending was on the rise alongside consumer sentiment supporting a positive outlook on consumption with the u s and china reaching an agreement and the stats skewed the positive supporting optimism towards the economy inflation is unlikely to be in the fed s sights for now from the housing sector building permits increased by 1 482m on an annualized basis housing starts were up by 1 345m on an annualized basis with both coming in ahead of october figures and forecasts the figures reflected home builder confidence that sits at its highest level since 1999 while existing home sales did disappoint on thursday inventories rather than a lack of demand were the issue a jump in both housing starts and permits is expected to support purchases in the year ahead for the bulls the good news was the lack of a reaction to trump s impeachment in the equity markets the dow rose by 1 14 while the s p500 and nasdaq up 1 65 and by 2 18 respectively trump will be happy that the u s majors entered the holidays sitting at record highs out of the uk it was also a busy week on the economic calendar private sector pmi figures on monday delivered more bad news with both the manufacturing and the service sectors reporting a faster pace of contraction at the end of the year on tuesday labor market figures were mixed while the unemployment rate held steady at 3 8 supported by a 24k increase in employment in october wage growth disappointed perhaps of greater influence however was another jump in claimant counts in november offsetting any positive numbers from october on wednesday inflation figures were also mixed while the annual rate of inflation held steady at 1 5 in november producer input prices fell by 0 3 which was worse than a forecasted 0 4 rise retail sales figures had added to a laundry list of weak data for the pound ahead of the boe month on month retail sales fell by 0 6 with core retail sales also falling by 0 6 in spite of a string of weak stats the boe held steady and suggested that there would be no move until late into 2020 it wasn t enough to support the pound however which saw deep red on thursday the boe minutes did reveal that monetary policy easing would be delivered should economic conditions fail to improve expectations are for the numbers to begin picking up following johnson s election victory and clarity on brexit on friday finalized 3rd quarter gdp numbers had a muted impact however in spite of finalized numbers coming in ahead of prelims the economy grew by 0 4 quarter on quarter coming in ahead of a forecast and prelim 0 3 uk parliament and brexit over the week while the stats certainly added pressure on the pound it was ultimately geopolitics that reversed the general election fueled friday rally from last week boris johnson announced plans of pushing through changes to the brexit bill that would prevent any extension in negotiations beyond december 2020 with the street view and that of the eu being that it would take more than a year to negotiate a trade agreement this points to an increased probability of hard brexit on friday boris johnson s majority had its first test mps voted in favor of johnson s withdrawal bill by an overwhelming 134 majority the bill ensures that britain leaves the eu by 31st january and also removes the option to extend the transition period mps will have the opportunity to debate the bill further on 7th 8th and 9th january for the week the pound tumbled by 2 49 to end the week at 1 2999 for the ftse100 a slide in the pound and continued support from resource stocks contributed to a 3 11 gain for the week out of the eurozone it was a particularly busy week economic data front prelim december private sector pmis for france germany and the eurozone kicked things off on monday along with 3rd quarter wage growth figures it was another mixed bag service sector activity hit a 4 month high while manufacturing output fell to an 86 month low that left private sector output for the 4th quarter at its slowest pace since 2013 while new orders saw a slight uptick it wasn t enough to suggest better times ahead for the ecb employment growth slowed to a 5 year low with wage growth slowing in the 3rd quarter this is a bad combination when relying on consumer consumption to prop up the economy on tuesday the eurozone s trade data spurred the eur into action with a marked widening in the trade surplus from 18 7bn to 28 0bn mid week economic data included germany s ifo business climate index figures and the eurozone s finalized november inflation figures goods news was a pickup in business confidence supported by improved sentiment towards current conditions and the economic outlook the headline ifo business climate index rose from 95 1 to 96 3 in december interestingly the confidence figures were not reflective of the economic environment in germany with the manufacturing sector continuing to struggle on the inflation front there were no surprises with the stats being in line with expectations it was worth noting however that the annual rate of core inflation continued to fall well short of the ecb s 2 with consumer prices falling by 0 3 month on month downward pressure could build should the disappointing wage growth and employment figures from the pmi survey translate into a pullback in spending on friday german and eurozone consumer confidence figures rounded off a busy week confidence hit reverse at the end of the year the eur and the european equity markets for the week a 0 39 slide on friday left the eur down by 0 38 at 1 1079 for the european major indexes the cac40 led the way rising by 1 73 with the eurostoxx600 up by 1 55 the dax30 gained 0 27 supported by a 0 81 rebound on friday negative sentiment towards brexit had pressured the majors on tuesday and wednesday elsewhere it was a mixed week for the aussie dollar and the kiwi dollar for the week the aussie dollar rose by 0 35 to 0 6900 while the kiwi dollar ended the week flat at 0 6599 as we predicted last week there was some downside with monetary policy divergence going against the aussie and kiwi dollars stats late in the week saved the aussie dollar from losses however for the aussie dollar it was a relatively quiet first half of the week for the aussie dollar but an influential one october home loan figures which came in softer than forecast had a muted impact at the start of the week it was the rba that sent more mixed signals on policy which pressured the aussie dollar on tuesday from the minutes talk of a february assessment of policy armed with their latest forecasts suggested that further easing may be on the horizon recent stats have been far from impressive on thursday employment figures for november delivered a strong boost for the aussie dollar however reversing rba driven losses in the week positive data out of china at the start of the week had provided the aussie dollar with support before hitting reverse on tuesday for the kiwi dollar it was a busy start to the week on the economic colander while there was some good news at the start of the week with business and consumer confidence improving it was not enough to prevent the downside from kicking on 3rd quarter current account figures on tuesday certainly didn t help the cause with the deficits widening in the 3rd quarter all of this came ahead of 3rd quarter gdp numbers and november trade data on thursday the trade deficit narrowed in november with the economy growing at a faster pace in the 3rd quarter in spite of the positive numbers in the week skepticism remains over whether the rbnz can hold off from another rate cut for the loonie it was a relatively busy week for the loonie economic data included october foreign securities purchases on monday and manufacturing sales figures on tuesday in spite of manufacturing sales disappointing the loonie managed to hold onto positive territory by tuesday s close on wednesday inflation figures did weigh however with consumer prices falling by 0 2 in november on thursday wholesale sales figures added further pressure on the loonie ahead of retail sales figures on friday that cut the loonie s gains from the week month on month core retail sales fell by 0 5 in october with retail sales sliding by 1 5 in september both had fallen by 0 1 disappointing inflation numbers and dire retail sales figures could test the boc s resolve support continued to come from progress on the usmca agreement however in the week the agreement sailed through in a bipartisan vote that brought an end to 1 year of cross party wrangling from elsewhere rising crude oil prices and positive economic data from china at the start of the week were also supportive the loonie rose by just 0 04 to c 1 3161 against the greenback a 0 27 slide on friday left the loonie with minor gains for the japanese yen there was plenty for the bank of japan to consider ahead of thursday s monetary policy decision private sector pmi figures delivered mixed results while service sector activity picked up slightly the manufacturing sector contracted at a marginally quickly pace in december things were not much better on the trade front exports fell by a further 7 9 in november year on year following a 9 2 slide in october imports tumbled by 15 7 following a 14 8 slide in october with the trade balance falling from a 15 7bn surplus to an 82 1bn deficit in november the economy is not out of the woods just yet on friday inflation figures also left the yen unmoved leaving it in the red for the week the annual rate of core inflation came in at just 0 5 outside of the numbers brexit woes did provide some support but not enough to reverse losses from the start of the week upbeat sentiment towards the u s china trade agreement offset the negative sentiment towards brexit on the monetary policy front the boj stood pat on monetary policy as expected with the government delivering fiscal policy support the boj will now look to assess the impact on the economy members will also want to see how the u s and china s phase 1 agreement will impact global trade terms the japanese yen fell by 0 05 to 109 44 against the u s dollar out of china the stats were on the positive side with industrial production jumping by 6 2 in november in october production had risen by 4 7 retail sales also impressed with an 8 rise following a 7 2 increase in october it was a positive start to the week with china s numbers impressing despite tariffs et al positive stats and a phase 1 trade agreement with the u s also contributed to the upside for the csi300 in particular which rallied by 1 24 in the week for the yuen it was 4 days in the red out of 5 that left the yuan down by 0 30 to cny7 0065 against the greenback the pboc

conservative decision to keep its key policy rates unchanged a sharp correction of argentina s current account deficit and the re profiling of u s dollar denominated local bills strengthens the external backdrop during the debt restructuring talks the year is ending on a high note with strong inflows to emerging markets em dedicated funds and more optimism about the growth outlook which includes an upward revision of china s consensus gross domestic product gdp forecast for 2020 the latter gives chinese authorities more time to evaluate the impact of past policy initiatives and this

accommodative but the reasons behind high funding costs for private companies are largely structural a succession of rate cuts might ease the situation at the margin but a meaningful improvement

by william l anderson via mises a decade ago democrat politicians and their cultural and academic allies were singing the praises of hugo chávez and his economic miracle in venezuela from bernie sanders to salon to joseph stiglitz and sean penn chávez s version of socialism had transformed venezuela lifted up the poor and set an example for the united states and latin america today venezuela takes its rightful place with the left in the orwellian memory hole sanders no longer brings it up on the campaign trail stiglitz has not made a public comment on the venezuelan economy or chávez s successor nicolás maduro the left either claims that venezuela never really tried real socialism yahoo finance or simply pretends that the country and its brutal kleptocracy are nonexistent or at best irrelevant to the latest collectivist policies being thrown out by democrat politicians yet neither venezuela nor its policies are irrelevant in us politics on the contrary they are the staple of some candidates running for the presidential nomination of the democratic party their proposals are much closer to the chávez maduro variety of socialism than any of them or their media allies are willing to admit while they insist that they want to create a new denmark what they are fashioning is a domestic version of the latest latin american tragedy to understand why this is so we first need a refresher course on what has happened in venezuela first chávez directed almost all his political rhetoric toward poor people in the country and against those who were wealthy now it is important to remember that latin america has had much greater contrasts between wealth and poverty than what we generally see in the united states and europe the classical liberalism that encouraged free trade and produced the open economy in the usa did not take root south of the border the economies in latin america historically have been much more highly regulated and more protectionist than what has been the case in this country and that means fewer economic opportunities for the masses this fact has not kept socialists from claiming that latin american countries practice untrammeled free enterprise and so politicians there with encouragement from the american left have maintained that authoritarian socialism is necessary to narrow the standard of living gap between rich and poor in those nations in the case of venezuela the chávez government nationalized the oil industry not an insignificant thing given that venezuela sits upon the world s largest reserves of crude oil venezuela hardly is the only country with a government owned oil sector the oil producing facilities of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec nations all are state owned as is norway s petroleum producing sector whatever the inefficiencies of socialism in the energy sectors however the people running the nationalized oil industries at least have had the foresight to maintain a workable capital stock drilling and transportation of crude oil is highly capital intensive which means that a sizable portion of oil revenues must be plowed back into working capital in order to keep the oil fields productive chávez had different and more delusional ideas about how to run venezuela s newly nationalized oil industry first like the cartoon version of the latin american dictator he replaced much of the private workforce with political cronies which guaranteed that the industry would be poorly managed second he spent oil revenues for political purposes ostensibly to build schools and hospitals as the narrative goes and his spending spree somehow drastically reduced the nation s rate of poverty there is some truth to the idea that at the beginning vast wealth transfers will make the recipients better off but this always is temporary because the productive individuals and industrial sectors having their assets confiscated will not go on producing at the same high level in the case of the venezuelan oil boom chávez s scheme had its inevitable meeting with reality at first the vast wealth transfers did make some people better off in part because the nation had enormous oil revenues and oil prices were at historically high levels around the world however even then the oil money was not enough to cover the chávez spending spree and his government resorted to what latin american dictators from central casting always do print money and lots of it the high oil prices did not last and venezuela saw a combination of falling prices and falling production as capital equipment in the neglected oil fields wore out and oil revenues dropped precipitously that meant even more money printing and burgeoning hyperinflation to go with it as one would expect from the cartoonish chávez who mercifully would die of cancer and leave his government in the hands of the even more thuggish maduro but what does that have to do with the platforms of bernie sanders elizabeth warren and other democrats after all while they talk of democratic socialism none are calling for anything that seems to be as radical as anything done in venezuela but guess again their platforms are closer to those of chávez and maduro than they will admit the venezuelan authorities seized the assets of oil companies and other firms and then spent their revenues on things not related to the businesses his supporters say that chávez s government built hospitals and schools providing services for poor people that in return provided chávez his votes as pointed out before whatever chávez and maduro did with the oil revenues was not sustainable because the government failed to maintain the capital and oil prices fell drastically leaving the government to print money the rest is very sad history other than sanders no candidate has called for directly nationalizing the oil and gas industries although warren and sanders have called for shutting down at least some fuel production and it is clear that they would like the industry to disappear altogether with windmills and solar energy providing the bulk of us energy thus whatever income equality schemes they have planned using oil revenues is not one of them sanders has promised to provide five years of pay and benefits for energy workers that lose their jobs under his energy or lack of energy plan instead of milking the oil industry for political cash sanders and warren have found what they believe to be an eternal source of revenue the wealth of american billionaires through proposed wealth taxes and other acts of property confiscation warren and sanders seem to believe that they can fund trillions of dollars in new programs seizing the assets of people like bill gates and jeff bezos and turning them into new revenue that would work economic miracles elsewhere declared sanders we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us say bill gates was actually taxed 100 billion we could end homelessness and provide safe drinking water to everyone in this country bill would still be a multibillionaire while warren hasn t made the claim that confiscating most of gates s wealth would end homelessness and provide clean water for the nation she has made a big deal of the fact that the proposed tax would only be two cents on the dollar but also would accomplish all sorts of wonderful things i will deal with sanders s claims later if the facebook posts by my progressive friends are accurate a small number of billionaires controls most of the wealth in the world and this tiny cadre of people is hoarding all the money and leaving everyone else in the world out in the cold while this might seem like a cause for action there is much that the progressives warren sanders and their economist allies are not saying and what is left out is the most important thing contrary to what one reads in the new york times or the nation people like jeff bezos are not hoarding anything and they certainly are not creating poverty according to economists thomas piketty and gabriel zucman among others capital owners receive increasing returns on their investment and so as their businesses grow they gain an increasing share of the proceeds leaving workers and everyone else out in the cold getting beyond all the numbers that these economists are presenting there is a logical construct that must be satisfied for their claims to be true if they are correct then over the past two decades which have seen exponential growth in web based enterprises and the rise of billionaire fortunes we would expect to see a corresponding number of people around the world slide off into poverty after all if bill gates and jeff bezos are gobbling up all the wealth and income then there would be a constantly decreasing amount for everyone else which only can mean that the rest of the world is getting poorer there is no other possible outcome yet that is not what we have seen over the past two decades poverty rates worldwide have fallen not risen the numbers are irrefutable and more important if they are true then warren and sanders along with their supporting economists are wrong even warren and sanders however recognize that most billionaires are not receiving these huge sums of money as cash income the way the rest of us receive paychecks instead they seem to understand that the vast holdings of billionaires are in non cash assets such as stocks or property furthermore getting an accurate and timely assessment of those assets would be difficult to put it mildly zucman and others have said that governments simply can seize the assets like stock holdings and sell them on open markets and in their view make the markets more efficient which would is a heroic assumption getting beyond the practicality of such taxation there is the problem of the assumption behind it governments would gain new tax revenues but the economic behavior of the people being taxed would not change one has to understand how someone like bezos gained his wealth in the first place before he founded amazon in 1994 using 300 000 he received from his parents he had other tech jobs but hardly commanded anything close to his current wealth amazon he told other investors was a huge risk and he warned them that it had maybe a 30 percent chance of success like so many other internet startups from that era it took a long time for amazon to turn a profit but when many of the dot com companies imploded at the turn of this century amazon managed to survive not that long ago the wealth that amazon currently represents did not exist we are speaking of a firm that is only twenty five years old google is younger than that and in its early days was up for sale for less than a million dollars these companies and many like them grew and thrived because they provided something of value for their customers and clients this last point is important because to listen to the political rhetoric coming from sanders and warren one would think that people like bezos and gates raided everyone else s bank accounts and unexplainably managed to hoard the money for themselves neither of these candidates seem to have a clue that the asset values of these billionaire portfolios have come from entrepreneurial activity in which these people risked their own personal wealth to build companies that had no guarantee of success what these political candidates and their economist supporters seem to believe however is that if they seize huge assets from these people 1 they easily can convert them into cash without destroying their value and 2 their actions will not have any negative effect on the creation of wealth so that every year these billionaires and their companies will continue to fill the government coffers full of cash paying for every political promise one can imagine earlier in this article i pointed out sanders s assertion that if he could confiscate more than 90 percent of bill gates s assets the result would be no more homeless people living on the streets and clean water for all americans the causality chain is murky to say the least and sanders does not explain how his plan would work or how it would get people off the streets and clean up the nation s drinking supply apparently he assumes that such things are self evident but the government has been throwing billions and billions of dollars at these issues for years and homeless people seem to be increasing especially in the places that progressives govern besides performing all sorts of government financed wonders warren and sanders seem to believe that those being taxed would not change their behaviors and that confiscating large amounts of assets from growing firms would have zero effect on business growth the closest analogy i can find is from the cult film animal house in which the band marches into the wall i am sure that sanders and warren would respond that they would issue threats against the firms and anyone trying to change their wealth status as though one can build wealth through threats of government punishment like chávez and maduro who believed that the oil revenues would last forever warren and sanders believe that they have found their fountain of funding the confiscation of billionaires assets and like chávez and maduro they seem to believe that american businesses would continue to grow that entrepreneurs would pretend that the government didn t regard them as public enemy number one and that their taxation schemes would provide lots of funding for free healthcare education and much more the oil revenue stream in fact did run dry or nearly so but the flood of new programs and benefits was still there including the new hospitals and the like as we know the chávez maduro regime simply printed money and lots of it but paper money was not a replacement for real assets and we know the rest of the story the vaunted new hospital construction became the hospitals with no medicine consumer goods disappeared from the shelves as did basic food items all that was left was the inflation and the memories of a better time likewise whatever new flood of programs sanders and warren would fund through mass confiscation of private assets would not last very long before the funding dried up of course one can imagine that they would take the maduro option blame capitalism and print money such points are obvious and should be obvious to anyone capable of logical thinking that so many voters pundits academics and media figures are taken in by the warren sanders schemes does not bode well for our economic and political future destroying wealth makes us poorer not wealthier and if american voters are not able to understand that simple point they will find out the hard way but they will find out whether or not they understand why the calamity has hit them is another issue altogether as american voters seem increasingly determined to vote for politicians who can create the biggest fantasies
paul volcker s recent death marks the passing of an era one of bipartisan sanity and reasoned restraint in the making of public policy it also was the passing of a great american one of those very few people in public life whose integrity and character are etched in history as deeply as the details of the policies they succeeded in getting implemented and it is the passing of one of the two great leaders of the federal reserve who shaped the institution and defined its autonomous role within government this prepared it to weather the challenges of a future in which sanity and reasoned restraint in public policy and discourse now seem to have been thrown to the winds there are few if any in our national public life today of volcker s wisdom and moral stature and we suffer from that start with his role as chair of the board of governors of the federal reserve system volcker was appointed by jimmy carter in august 1979 at the height of national frustration with stagflation the concurrence of both slow economic growth and high inflation this is four decades ago so older baby boomers now have personal memories of that period and its events even if many people today do not discontent in the 1970s was particularly acute because the 1950s and 1960s had been decades of stable prices strong growth in the economy and the number of jobs growth in inflation adjusted disposable income was better then than at any time since our nation dominated the world the u s dollar was the standard for all international transactions with its value tied to gold we were the dominant economic political and military power with the largest and most advanced manufacturing sector we usually ran positive balances of trade and overall payments the bloom had begun to come off the rose however in the late 1960s reactions to racial discrimination and against the war in vietnam led to rioting in major cities demonstrations and conflict between then younger boomers and their parents most of whom had known the depression and fought world war ii cpi inflation had been 2 1 in the 1950s and 2 7 in the 1960s it was 7 8 in the 1970s unemployment averaged 4 1 and 4 8 respectively in the first two decades but rose to 6 2 in the 1970s moreover the average for the 1960s understates cause for disillusionment the 1965 1969 rates had been among the lowest ones in peacetime since measuring unemployment began in 1913 when things turned sour in the 1970s people tended to focus on these boom years as the 1970s opened we had national humiliations we were defeated in vietnam the watergate affair divided the nation our trade surpluses disappeared and we ended the bretton woods system tying other currencies to ours this entailed a humiliating devaluation of the dollar this helped agriculture and manufacturing but had the very visible effect of pushing consumer prices higher in the wake of the 1973 arab israeli war an oil embargo forced gas prices sharply upward and caused lines at gas stations waiting for inadequate supplies strikes were common and there were episodic shortages of sundry items one summer a shortage of canning lids struck fear into the hearts of farmwives across the nation unanticipated inflation is particularly hard on those who have fixed incomes such as retirees social security beneficiaries complained those holding u s treasury bonds also were devastated but unlike social security recipients got no help the fact that higher inflation was accompanied by rising unemployment infuriated citizens and left many economists intellectually adrift the theories of british economist john maynard keynes had dominated these specified how government might adjust monetary policy the money supply and interest rates together with fiscal policy taxes and government spending to counter inflation or unemployment however it assumed these problems were polar opposites in unsustainable booms one would have inflation but low unemployment in busts unemployment would be high but price rises would disappear in the 1970s the nation faced both economists and government leaders had no answers president gerald ford promoted win buttons exhorting people to whip inflation now however not all economists were clueless a minority led by university of chicago professor milton friedman an early libertarian had always opposed keynesian arguments and they emphasized the importance of the money supply inflation was always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon if you wanted to whip inflation throw away silly buttons and reduce the money supply that was up to the fed the chair of the fed s board of governors at the time was arthur burns an expert in monetary issues and the most distinguished economist to ever hold that post he turned out as one of the worst chairs however episodically letting money grow to help republicans win elections and refusing to recognize that policy under his leadership was fatally wrong more than anyone else burns was responsible for the inflation that tripled prices between 1967 and 1981 burns term ended a year after jimmy carter was inaugurated as his replacement carter named g william miller a lawyer who had headed textron a large conglomerate for decades even worse than burns miller let inflation hit unprecedented highs the most inept chair in fed history he was kicked upstairs to be treasury secretary after 17 months an old adage says cometh the hour cometh the man here paul volcker enters u s history volcker came from middle class new jersey origins and had studied economics at princeton harvard and the london school of economics but he did not have a ph d and was not an academic his career had started at the new york federal reserve in 1952 and that was his home base until carter called him to washington he did work nine years at chase manhattan bank and he served in the u s treasury for three kennedy johnson years in the nixon administration volcker returned to the treasury at a high level for another five responsible for international affairs he was the key treasury representative in the nixon administration s august 1971 ending of the bretton woods system unilaterally and without consultation with allies in this he interacted with burns then fed chair with treasury secretary john connally a consummate politician if there ever was one and with nixon s political advisers he returned to the new york fed becoming president in 1975 from there in the desperation of august 1979 carter summoned volcker to lead the fed in contrast to alan greenspan his successor volcker was not an ideologue nor was he ambition driven campaigning for the position the way greenspan would most importantly he ignored any political considerations like the ones that led burn to historical ignominy in terms of monetary issues volcker was a moderate and pragmatic monetarist like milton friedman he understood that to wring inflation out of the u s economy growth of the money supply had to be limited this would raise interest rates and throw the economy into a recession probably a harsh one it was a dirty job but someone had to do it and volcker had the mettle carter was warned that appointing volcker would cost him the 1980 election and it did the recession was brutal for months interest rates went to double digits output shrank many people lost jobs ronald reagan the new president talked a good line on inflation and never criticized volcker publicly but its priorities were cutting taxes and increasing military spending democrats did not want domestic spending cuts the result was the borrow and spend approach to federal finances that has now dominated u s government for 40 years such fiscal laxness in the face of monetary tightening was idiotic and complicated things enormously government borrowing at a time of limited money growth kept interest rates high attracting money from the rest of the world and driving up the value of the dollar the strong dollar tipped u s agriculture into the harshest crisis since 1933 steel and autos each lost 300 000 jobs imported cars were cheap along with anything else manufactured abroad but inflation faded away and interest rates eventually fell the recession hurt the gop in the 1982 elections and reagan s advisers feared even worse damage in 1984 so they put tremendous pressure on volcker and engineered an internal revolt against him with new board appointees openly queried about their willingness to defy the chair volcker faced this down but after being told that he did not have reagan s confidence stepped down at the end of his second four year term as chair much more could be said about his public service after leaving the fed yet his key contribution to our nation was having the knowledge temperament and leadership to get us out of an economic morass

the stats it was a particularly busy week on the economic calendar in the week ending 20th december a whopping 94 stats were monitored in a data deluge week before christmas just 54 stats had been monitored in the week prior of the 94 stats 34 came in ahead forecasts with 43 economic indicators coming up short of forecast 17 stats were in line with forecasts looking at the numbers 39 of the stats reflected an upward trend from previous figures of the remaining 55 41 stats reflected a deterioration from previous for the greenback the focus was back on the economic calendar with brexit woes returning both supporting demand for the dollar the dollar did manage to shrug off the democrat s impeachment vote advertisement for the week the dollar spot index rose by 0 53 to 97 690 out of the u s it was a busy week for the dollar with the stats skewed to the positive on monday prelim december private sector pmis delivered mixed results while the manufacturing sector activity slowed marginally the all important service sector activity picked up at the end of the year with services accounting for the lion s share of the economy this was a welcome outcome contributing to a marginal increase in the composite pmi figures from new york state also reflected an upward trend with the manufacturing index rising from 2 9 to 3 5 in december on tuesday industrial production figures impressed with production jumping by 1 1 in november month on month jolts job openings were also dollar positive with openings rising from 7 032m to 7 267m in october with no stats on wednesday the focus then shifted to a relatively busy 2nd half of the week the philly fed manufacturing index and weekly jobless claims figures were in focus on thursday both sets of numbers disappointed weighing on the dollar on the day on friday finalized 3rd quarter gdp numbers were in line with previous estimates limiting any dollar reaction the fed s preferred core pce price index figures also failed to pressure the dollar in spite of the annual rate of core inflation easing from 1 7 to 1 6 story continues consumer sentiment figures and personal pending did have an impact however personal spending was on the rise alongside consumer sentiment supporting a positive outlook on consumption with the u s and china reaching an agreement and the stats skewed the positive supporting optimism towards the economy inflation is unlikely to be in the fed s sights for now from the housing sector building permits increased by 1 482m on an annualized basis housing starts were up by 1 345m on an annualized basis with both coming in ahead of october figures and forecasts the figures reflected home builder confidence that sits at its highest level since 1999 while existing home sales did disappoint on thursday inventories rather than a lack of demand were the issue a jump in both housing starts and permits is expected to support purchases in the year ahead for the bulls the good news was the lack of a reaction to trump s impeachment in the equity markets the dow rose by 1 14 while the s p500 and nasdaq up 1 65 and by 2 18 respectively trump will be happy that the u s majors entered the holidays sitting at record highs out of the uk it was also a busy week on the economic calendar private sector pmi figures on monday delivered more bad news with both the manufacturing and the service sectors reporting a faster pace of contraction at the end of the year on tuesday labor market figures were mixed while the unemployment rate held steady at 3 8 supported by a 24k increase in employment in october wage growth disappointed perhaps of greater influence however was another jump in claimant counts in november offsetting any positive numbers from october on wednesday inflation figures were also mixed while the annual rate of inflation held steady at 1 5 in november producer input prices fell by 0 3 which was worse than a forecasted 0 4 rise retail sales figures had added to a laundry list of weak data for the pound ahead of the boe month on month retail sales fell by 0 6 with core retail sales also falling by 0 6 in spite of a string of weak stats the boe held steady and suggested that there would be no move until late into 2020 it wasn t enough to support the pound however which saw deep red on thursday the boe minutes did reveal that monetary policy easing would be delivered should economic conditions fail to improve expectations are for the numbers to begin picking up following johnson s election victory and clarity on brexit on friday finalized 3rd quarter gdp numbers had a muted impact however in spite of finalized numbers coming in ahead of prelims the economy grew by 0 4 quarter on quarter coming in ahead of a forecast and prelim 0 3 uk parliament and brexit over the week while the stats certainly added pressure on the pound it was ultimately geopolitics that reversed the general election fueled friday rally from last week boris johnson announced plans of pushing through changes to the brexit bill that would prevent any extension in negotiations beyond december 2020 with the street view and that of the eu being that it would take more than a year to negotiate a trade agreement this points to an increased probability of hard brexit on friday boris johnson s majority had its first test mps voted in favor of johnson s withdrawal bill by an overwhelming 134 majority the bill ensures that britain leaves the eu by 31st january and also removes the option to extend the transition period mps will have the opportunity to debate the bill further on 7th 8th and 9th january for the week the pound tumbled by 2 49 to end the week at 1 2999 for the ftse100 a slide in the pound and continued support from resource stocks contributed to a 3 11 gain for the week out of the eurozone it was a particularly busy week economic data front prelim december private sector pmis for france germany and the eurozone kicked things off on monday along with 3rd quarter wage growth figures it was another mixed bag service sector activity hit a 4 month high while manufacturing output fell to an 86 month low that left private sector output for the 4th quarter at its slowest pace since 2013 while new orders saw a slight uptick it wasn t enough to suggest better times ahead for the ecb employment growth slowed to a 5 year low with wage growth slowing in the 3rd quarter this is a bad combination when relying on consumer consumption to prop up the economy on tuesday the eurozone s trade data spurred the eur into action with a marked widening in the trade surplus from 18 7bn to 28 0bn mid week economic data included germany s ifo business climate index figures and the eurozone s finalized november inflation figures goods news was a pickup in business confidence supported by improved sentiment towards current conditions and the economic outlook the headline ifo business climate index rose from 95 1 to 96 3 in december interestingly the confidence figures were not reflective of the economic environment in germany with the manufacturing sector continuing to struggle on the inflation front there were no surprises with the stats being in line with expectations it was worth noting however that the annual rate of core inflation continued to fall well short of the ecb s 2 with consumer prices falling by 0 3 month on month downward pressure could build should the disappointing wage growth and employment figures from the pmi survey translate into a pullback in spending on friday german and eurozone consumer confidence figures rounded off a busy week confidence hit reverse at the end of the year the eur and the european equity markets for the week a 0 39 slide on friday left the eur down by 0 38 at 1 1079 for the european major indexes the cac40 led the way rising by 1 73 with the eurostoxx600 up by 1 55 the dax30 gained 0 27 supported by a 0 81 rebound on friday negative sentiment towards brexit had pressured the majors on tuesday and wednesday elsewhere it was a mixed week for the aussie dollar and the kiwi dollar for the week the aussie dollar rose by 0 35 to 0 6900 while the kiwi dollar ended the week flat at 0 6599 as we predicted last week there was some downside with monetary policy divergence going against the aussie and kiwi dollars stats late in the week saved the aussie dollar from losses however for the aussie dollar it was a relatively quiet first half of the week for the aussie dollar but an influential one october home loan figures which came in softer than forecast had a muted impact at the start of the week it was the rba that sent more mixed signals on policy which pressured the aussie dollar on tuesday from the minutes talk of a february assessment of policy armed with their latest forecasts suggested that further easing may be on the horizon recent stats have been far from impressive on thursday employment figures for november delivered a strong boost for the aussie dollar however reversing rba driven losses in the week positive data out of china at the start of the week had provided the aussie dollar with support before hitting reverse on tuesday for the kiwi dollar it was a busy start to the week on the economic colander while there was some good news at the start of the week with business and consumer confidence improving it was not enough to prevent the downside from kicking on 3rd quarter current account figures on tuesday certainly didn t help the cause with the deficits widening in the 3rd quarter all of this came ahead of 3rd quarter gdp numbers and november trade data on thursday the trade deficit narrowed in november with the economy growing at a faster pace in the 3rd quarter in spite of the positive numbers in the week skepticism remains over whether the rbnz can hold off from another rate cut for the loonie it was a relatively busy week for the loonie economic data included october foreign securities purchases on monday and manufacturing sales figures on tuesday in spite of manufacturing sales disappointing the loonie managed to hold onto positive territory by tuesday s close on wednesday inflation figures did weigh however with consumer prices falling by 0 2 in november on thursday wholesale sales figures added further pressure on the loonie ahead of retail sales figures on friday that cut the loonie s gains from the week month on month core retail sales fell by 0 5 in october with retail sales sliding by 1 5 in september both had fallen by 0 1 disappointing inflation numbers and dire retail sales figures could test the boc s resolve support continued to come from progress on the usmca agreement however in the week the agreement sailed through in a bipartisan vote that brought an end to 1 year of cross party wrangling from elsewhere rising crude oil prices and positive economic data from china at the start of the week were also supportive the loonie rose by just 0 04 to c 1 3161 against the greenback a 0 27 slide on friday left the loonie with minor gains for the japanese yen there was plenty for the bank of japan to consider ahead of thursday s monetary policy decision private sector pmi figures delivered mixed results while service sector activity picked up slightly the manufacturing sector contracted at a marginally quickly pace in december things were not much better on the trade front exports fell by a further 7 9 in november year on year following a 9 2 slide in october imports tumbled by 15 7 following a 14 8 slide in october with the trade balance falling from a 15 7bn surplus to an 82 1bn deficit in november the economy is not out of the woods just yet on friday inflation figures also left the yen unmoved leaving it in the red for the week the annual rate of core inflation came in at just 0 5 outside of the numbers brexit woes did provide some support but not enough to reverse losses from the start of the week upbeat sentiment towards the u s china trade agreement offset the negative sentiment towards brexit on the monetary policy front the boj stood pat on monetary policy as expected with the government delivering fiscal policy support the boj will now look to assess the impact on the economy members will also want to see how the u s and china s phase 1 agreement will impact global trade terms the japanese yen fell by 0 05 to 109 44 against the u s dollar out of china the stats were on the positive side with industrial production jumping by 6 2 in november in october production had risen by 4 7 retail sales also impressed with an 8 rise following a 7 2 increase in october it was a positive start to the week with china s numbers impressing despite tariffs et al positive stats and a phase 1 trade agreement with the u s also contributed

people visit a currency exhibition at the riksbank headquarters in stockholm sweden file agence france presse sweden s central bank cb ended five years of negative interest rates when it raised benchmark borrowing costs by a quarter point to zero defying an economic slowdown and global uncertainty the increase from 0 25 makes the riksbank the first of the central banks that pushed rates below zero to inch its way back to what was long considered the floor for interest rates rates are still negative in the eurozone japan denmark switzerland and hungary and with the exception of hungary are expected to remain so for some time to come riksbank governor stefan ingves said negative rates had worked well boosting inflation and the economy but it is a completely different question what would happen in an economy if you had negative rates for a very long period he told reporters negative rates have boosted real estate prices households and corporations have taken on more and more debt threatening a financial meltdown if there is an unexpected shock pension funds and insurers have to take greater risks to meet their liabilities cheap loans have also kept alive zombie firms which otherwise would have gone to the wall reducing overall productivity in the economy some critics doubt negative rates should be used at all arguing they have failed to push up inflation in the eurozone or japan sustainably and that they create more problems than they solve others like switzerland s central bank say that they are an essential policy tool the swedish crown gained against the euro after the riksbank s decision but fell back to unchanged all but one analyst in a reuters poll had forecast a rate increase deputy governors per jansson and anna breman the latter in her first rate setting meeting entered reservations against the decision both wanted the central bank to wait before raising the central bank repeated that it expected the repo rate would remain unchanged through 2021 the world s oldest central bank cut rates to 0 10 in 2015 worried that the euro zone crisis would hit already weak prices and lead to a japanese style deflationary spiral it was forced to go further with rates dipping as low as 0 50 in 2016 before ultra loose policy began to bite the economy has grown strongly and inflation has bounced back few would argue that raising rates now makes policy too tight i m not too concerned today because rates are still so low that a small increase isn t worrying said justus jondal a 50 year old recruitment consultant and homeowner when i was growing up interest rates were much higher but many question the timing of the increase only the second since mid 2011 as the economy is slowing inflation is below target and not expected to be stable around 2 for years industrial activity is at its lowest since 2012 and business confidence is falling the move also puts the riksbank at odds with other major central banks norway s central bank left its benchmark rate unchanged at 1 50 on thursday the bank of england s rate remained 0 75 while the riksbank has been keen to exit negative policy it could still be forced into a u turn if brexit or the ongoing trade conflict between the united states and china turns nasty and inflation dives again zero isn t a floor for interest rates it is the rate that is the most appropriate at the moment ingves told reporters if we need to we can have periods with negative rates but that s a hypothetical question and not anything we see ahead of us given our view of the development of the economy as central bank for the world s least cash dependent economy sweden s riksbank risks becoming a bystander its banknotes face extinction while commercial banks control the country s electronic payment infrastructure diluting the riksbank s influence over its own financial system central bankers in stockholm worry they are losing control over moving people s money while a few banks have gained pricing power over sweden s financial plumbing in a bid to regain the upper hand the riksbank is planning a not for profit system for the instant settlement of payments in a litmus test for other central banks the head of the bank of international settlements bis said this month that central banks had to remain the foundation of payments systems to ensure a level playing field particularly as big technology firms enter finance reuters

trump is remaking the republican party into what for a century the gop has been bankrolled by big business and wall street trump wants to keep the money rolling in his signature tax cut two years old last sunday has helped us corporations score record profits and the stock market reach all time highs to spur even more corporate generosity for the 2020 election trump is suggesting more giveaways acting chief of staff mick mulvaney recently told an assemblage of ceos that trump wants to go beyond his 2017 tax cut trump also wants to expand his working class base in rallies and countless tweets he claims to be restoring the american working class by holding back immigration and trade most incumbent republicans and gop candidates are mimicking trump s economic nationalism as trump consigliere stephen bannon boasted recently we ve turned the republican party into a working class party keeping the gop the party of big money while making it over into the party of the working class is a tricky maneuver especially at a time when capital and labor are engaged in the most intense economic contest in more than a century because so much wealth and power are going to the top armed with deductions and loopholes america s largest companies paid an average federal tax rate of only 11 3 on their profits last year roughly half the official rate under the new tax law the lowest effective corporate tax rate in more than eighty years yet almost nothing has trickled down to ordinary workers corporations have used most of their tax savings to buy back their shares giving the stock market a sugar high the typical american household remains poorer today than it was before the financial crisis began in 2007 trump s tax cut has also caused the federal budget deficit to balloon even as pre tax corporate profits have reached record highs corporate tax revenues have dropped about a third under projected levels this requires more federal dollars for interest on the debt leaving fewer dollars for public services workers need the trump administration has already announced a 45bn cut in food stamp benefits that would affect an estimated 10 000 families many at the lower end of the working class the administration is also proposing to reduce social security disability benefits a potential blow to hundreds of thousands of workers the tax cut has also shifted more of the total tax burden to workers payroll taxes made up 7 8 of national income last year while corporate taxes made up just 0 9 the biggest gap in nearly two decades all told taxes on workers were 35 of federal tax revenue in 2018 taxes on corporations only 9 trump probably figures he can cover up this massive redistribution from the working class to the corporate elite by pushing the same economic nationalism tinged with xenophobia and racism he used in 2016 as steve bannon has noted the formula seems to have worked for britain s conservative party but it will be difficult this time around because trump s economic nationalism has hurt american workers particularly in states that were critical to trump s 2016 win manufacturing has suffered as tariffs raised prices for imported parts and materials hiring has slowed sharply in pennsylvania michigan and other states trump won and in states like minnesota that he narrowly lost the trade wars have also harmed rural america which also went for trump by reducing demand for american farm produce last year china bought around 8 6bn of farm goods down from 20bn in 2016 a new tentative trade deal calls for substantially more chinese purchases meanwhile healthcare costs continue to soar college is even less affordable and average life expectancy is dropping due to a rise in deaths from suicide and opioid drugs like fentanyl polls show most americans remain dissatisfied with the country s direction the consequences of trump s and the republicans excessive corporate giveaways and their failure to improve the lives of ordinary working americans are becoming clearer by the day the only tricks left to them are stoking social and racial resentments and claiming to be foes of the establishment but bigotry alone won t win elections and the detritus of the tax cut makes it difficult for trump and the gop to portray themselves as anti establishment this has created a giant political void and an opportunity democrats have an historic chance to do what they should have done years ago create a multi racial coalition of the working class middle class and poor dedicated to reclaiming the economy for the vast majority and making democracy work for all

for all the angst about trade wars geopolitics and a sputtering and overly indebted global economy 2019 might just be the best year investors have ever had the numbers are staggering global stocks have piled on more than 10 trillion bonds have been on fire oil has surged almost 25 former crisis spots greece and ukraine have top performed and even gold has sparkled wall street and msci s near 50 country world index have both stormed to record highs after 30 and 24 leaps europe japan china and brazil are all up at least 20 in dollar terms too not exactly shoddy a mirror image of 2018 when almost everything fell perhaps but there have been a couple of important drivers one was china showing it was serious about stimulus for its 14 trillion economy the other was the screeching change of direction by the world s top central banks led by the federal reserve which cut u s interest rates for the first time since the financial crisis more than a decade earlier whereas a year ago the fed was raising rates and earnings were rolling over this year you have felt the fed has been on your side said james clunie who manages asset firm jupiter s absolute return fund they are willing to do qe4 at a stock market record high which is extraordinary he added referring to fed efforts to bring down a spike in money market rates that some suggest could presage a fourth round of quantitative easing asset purchases that fed shift and the worldwide blizzard of rate cuts that have come since have fired bond markets up like a rocket u s treasuries the world s benchmark government iou have made a whopping 9 4 after yields plunged as much as 120 basis points that followed a near 40 basis point fall the last quarter of 2018 after five quarters in which they had consistently risen german bunds europe s safest asset had their best year in five years making roughly 5 5 in euro terms as the european central bank has reversed course too the yield on 10 year debt dropped below zero percent for the first time since 2016 in march and dived as deep as 0 74 in september in commodities oil has raced up almost 25 following its best first quarter since 2009 that plus key dividend rule changes has made russia s stock market the best in the world with a 40 rise and also made the rouble a top three currency metals have had a more mixed time copper is only 4 higher after buckling badly when trade tensions flared in the middle of the year and aluminum is down 2 but palladium used in car and truck catalytic converters has boomed 55 while gold has had its best year since 2010 with a 15 jump a statistic likely to make most jaws drop is that greek banks remember all that euro debt crisis and capital controls stuff a few years back have been some of the world s best performing stocks this year the country s biggest lender piraeus bank is up 250 as is smaller attica bank helping make athens europe s strongest bourse this year but even those gains look skimpy in comparison to californian video streaming darling roko whose shares have risen 440 this year fangtastic tech has remained top more broadly apple may just have lost its crown as the world s most valuable firm to saudi aramco but it can console itself with its 77 leap this year facebook has surged 57 microsoft 53 google 30 netflix 24 and amazon 19 china s tech sector is right in mix too with a 64 rally and online behemoth alibaba up 53 cryptoassets have been typically wild bitcoin was up over up 260 in june but it has been hauled back to around 85 riskier high yield debt corporate bonds and local currency emerging market bonds and have all brought in between 11 14 while ukraine s dollar bonds and greece s euro bonds have piled on over 30 it is just a great year for the asset class said pictet emerging market debt portfolio manager guido chamorro it has been a relentless rally across the board over the last couple of months and it is possible that it continues into next year despite almost daily brexit chaos the loss of another prime minister and a snap election uk gilts have returned 4 5 and a near 6 rise could land sterling its best quarter since 2009 in contrast the fed s pirouette and easing of trade tensions mean the dollar index is about to experience its worst quarter in 1 1 2 years it is still clinging to a 1 5 gain for the year though meaning it will be the euro s fifth red year in six
today we shall look back at nine predictions for 2019 and we will have an outlook for 2020 next week 1 the united states was expected to suspend the trade war at the beginning of the year believing that it would have to re establish trade relations with china and other countries in the face of pressure from companies and slowing economic growth as a result the trade war seems to be ending not as expected in the first half of the year but in the fourth quarter but is the trade war over not yet it seems 2 at the beginning of the year a shares and hong kong stocks were expected to see a rise in the first half of the year the result could only last until may when the trade war between china and the us failed to stop 3 the uk s decoupling problem was magnified so the pound rose significantly in december when the conservatives won the general election but decoupling is still a side issue and the pound should level off in 2020 4 there is still no economic and currency crisis in emerging markets including asia but the performance of regional stock markets is far lower than that of major markets in europe and the us therefore there is a possibility of catch up in 2020 but the potential crisis is still there 5 the fed did hold off on raising interest rates but the dollar index fell as low as 94 635 not reaching the expected level of 92 at the beginning of the year instead it peaked at 99 3 in september just short of the expected high but the reason why the dollar did not fall is not because the dollar fundamentals were ideal but just because its opponents are too weak 6 the hong kong dollar interest rate remains stable although hibor has increased it seems to be the end of the ultra low interest rate environment of course there will be outflows but not on a large scale and a real crisis may not come until 2021 7 not only did hong kong s property prices show steady growth in the first half of the year but the volatility for the whole year was also moderate will there not be a major correction in the housing market in the near future the fourth quarter of 2020 is likely to witness a correction and the adjustment period may not end until 2022 to 2023 rather than 2021 which had been expected at the start of the year 8 it is true that hong kong has not lost its status as an independent customs territory but the us has passed the hong kong democracy and human rights act will it lose its status as an independent customs territory next year next year is still not yet and it will be up to mr trump to win a second term to see if it will keep or lose its status 9 this prediction should have been most accurate at the beginning of the year despite the inverted yield curve in the bond market in 2018 us stocks have not yet entered a full blown bear market meanwhile expectations at the start of the year that us stocks might not officially enter a bear market until next year or 2021 remain unchanged i shall explain the reasons next week
by jeff miller theeconomic calendaris very light and interrupted by the mid week holiday we can always see volatility when volume is low but many market participants will be on an extended holiday this includes much of the a team punditry but someone will be left to fill the airtime some will continue the outlook theme i covered last week but i expect many to be asking are investors too complacent it is an interesting question especially considering recent events that suggest danger to many observers as usual i ll include a range of ideas and offer some comments on each last week recap in my last installment of wtwa i took note of the bigeconomic calendarbut predicted that most would prefer to discuss 2020 market forecasts that was an accurate guess the week was filled with such reports the chart below shows one that i find particularly interesting it does not represent the forecast of a single person as john butters factset explains he looks at the median target price estimates from analysts covering the stocks the same people generating earnings estimates the prices are then aggregated to generate a forecast for the entire s p 500 index this contrasts with the top down analysts who work from expectations for the economy interest rates and the most likely p e multiple the story in one chart i always start my personal review of the week by looking at a great chart this week i am featuring the version from jill mislinski who combines a lot of important data into a single readable chart the market gained 1 6 for the week the trading range was only 1 3 this can happen because i measure the weekly change based upon the prior week s close the trading range reflects prices during the actual trading hours reflecting gains from last friday even on the low points for the week you can monitor volatility implied volatility and historical comparisons in my weekly indicator snapshot in the quant corner below noteworthy which countries lead the world in scientific publications statista reports the numbers are you surprised by anything the news each week i break down events into good and bad for our purposes good has two components the news must be market friendly and better than expectations i avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news and you should too new deal democrat s high frequency indicators are an important part of our regular research the results remain positive in both the long and concurrent time frames but the short term forecast has turned negative ndd continues to highlight the metrics to watch if concerned about manufacturing weakness spreading to the consumer a government shutdown was averted and the usmca trade bill was passed the necessity of action generated some compromise even amid the impeachment rancor the hill homebuilder confidence hit the highest level in 20 years diana olick cnbc the good and fannie mae is forecasting a big increase in single family starts diana olick cnbc after increasing just over 1 annually this year growth in single family housing starts will accelerate to 10 during 2020 and top 1 million new homes in 2021 the group predicts that would mark a post recession high but is still far below the annual peak of about 1 7 million single family starts in 2005 and the 1 2 million annual pace experienced in the late 90s single family housing starts have been improving steadily since may and building permits an indicator of future construction are also trending higher it will likely take several years even at a more robust pace for new construction to address the existing pent up demand for additional housing as suggested by a still increasing share of 25 to 34 year olds living at home with their parents according to the report housing starts nov increased to a saar of 1365k surpassing expectations of 1340k and october s upwardly revised 1323k despite the slow start to 2019 calculated risk observes that the strong finish means that starts will be higher in 2019 than in 2018 building permits for november reached 1482k saar beating expectations of 1400k and october s 1461k industrial production reversed october s downwardly revised decline of 0 9 with a gain of 1 1 this was better than the expected 0 8 part of the fluctuation was the gm strike it is more than a one or two month effect as bob dieli explains the rebound in vehicle output associated with the resumption of normal operations at will be a plus going forward but we still think that it will be second and third order effects of the trade war that will have the greatest bearing on how this sector performs going forward what are the second and third order effects stopping the importation of chinese steel through a tariff is the first round effect of the trade war the diminished use of trucks to haul the steel is the second order effect the diminished demand for fuel and truck parts are part of the third order effects ending the trade war will diminish the problems that starting the trade war created but the adjustments to the supply chain will take some time jolts again hit a sweet spot labor markets remain strong but not too tight job openings registered 7 267 million for october up from september s 7 032 million but that is only one element to consider the coverage of this report is so poor that i am devoting some extra space this week below are charts from the bls site illustrating the most important elements of labor market structure core pce prices showed a gain of 0 1 in november the same rate as october and lower than expectations of 0 2 this is good because the fed will not feel any pressure for a rate hike mortgage purchases remain strong the pace continues as the best in a decade michigan sentiment for december registered 99 3 in the final reading slightly beating the prior 99 2 and expectations of 99 1 jill mislinski publishes my favorite chart of this series including gdp and recession data with the meaningful history personal

continuing improvement on a year over year basis the bad the ugly new climate records this decade check out the six animated time series the week ahead we would all like to know the direction of the market in advance good luck with that second best is planning what to look for and how to react the calendar theeconomic calendarhas few reports it is a holiday shortened week split in the middle congress has gone into recess many would expect a time of low volatility but we sometimes see big moves on small volume and we cannot ignore the tweet factor briefing com has a good u s economic calendarfor the week here are the main u s releases next week s theme it is a quiet time which will naturally lead the flight b pundits taking over for the week to ask have investors become too complacent background eddy elfenbein has his usual level headed perspective on complacency here are two of his many good points i don t know how many people would have predicted that the stock market would have a low volatility and multiple new highs during an impeachment but that s exactly what s happened the mood has shifted and investors seem much more confident than they did over the summer remember in august when the two year treasury yield jumped above the 10 year yield for about half an hour the inversion scare was good for about a week as market commentators talked about being very concerned and one of the big mistakes investors make is confusing financial markets with voting booths markets have rallied under both parties and markets have dropped under both parties sometimes stocks just have a mind of their own in the long run it s all about earnings and valuation complacency is viewed by some as important because events could send surprised investors heading for the exits i ll try to evaluate that idea with several different approaches the dimensions of complacency a quiet market this is a common definition of investor complacency especially when stocks are rising cnn business leads their complacency story with these observations there is an eerie sense of calm on wall street heading to the end of the year it s the inverse of last year s december market panic stocks are at all time highs the cnn business fear greed index is hovering above 90 firmly in extreme greed territory for the first time since 2017 the index which tracks the vix volatility gauge and six other measures of investor sentiment can t go higher than 100 but are there risks investors are ignoring the trade war isn t necessarily over earnings estimates and valuations may be too high and oil prices have crept up lately while the dollar has softened raising the potential specter of commodity inflation could the federal reserve have to gulp raise rates in 2020 after all market action is the aggregate of millions of individual actions describing markets as having goals targets and emotions is popular but of little analytical value a quiet market could be achieved with different factions intensely pursuing opposite goals and it has little to offer about the potential for frightened investors surveys of investor sentiment here is the popular survey of the american association of individual investors you can see the bullish reading of 44 10 does it seem extremely high the daily short displays the same data as a spread between bulls and bears now the current level seems much more extreme is this the right approach to take david templeton horan adds an eight period moving average to the bespoke approach does the ma seem to lead the market i am a big fan of surveys when properly conducted and used for the right purpose this one which i occasionally cite has several problems it asks about attitude or intentions rather than describing behavior results are less accurate in those cases the universe includes self described investors who are part of an organization it omits many of the people of greatest interest the sidelined investors the indicator can be measured in several different ways none of which has a clear predictive relationship to market results headline risk news certainly moves markets and the trade war has been one of the most closely watched stories the data show moves of less than nine percent over two days in the case of the most dramatic stories please note that the universe is a basket of stocks determined after the fact to be sensitive to trade and weighted by that sensitivity both the stories and the basket are selected for dramatic effect once again we learn little about how investors might react to this since the trade story typically generates a trading reaction dumb money is complacent there are many definitions of dumb money but it is usually ascribed to individual investors and of course these investors display fear and greed at the wrong times i strongly dislike approaches where the message is carried in the title terminology and the exact methods are obscure just as important is the lack of evidence that these are leading indicators finally how does it capture the emotions of our sidelined investors trader attitudes jesse felder s approach concludes that sentiment has only been this bullish on two prior occasions he uses the rydex ratio or the measure of rydex traders assets in bear funds and money market funds relative to their assets in bull funds and sector funds he likes the measure because it is based on real money not opinion i also like data based upon action in preference to a survey once again the problem here i that we are looking at traders not individual investors the sidelined folks we are concerned about have never heard of a rydex fund we cannot impute trader behavior to these investors but does the method provide a good predictor of the market the second chart looks like a fuzzy coincident indicator but you really need to do a lags and leads test on the underlying data meanwhile another group of traders those who use s p options are skewed very bearish in their positions this is still not an indicator for individual investors of course it is more a response to the felder approach different markets and trader groups provide different results better fact based measures the best sentiment measures are published in my quant corner every week compare the vix called the market s fear gauge to the actual volatility when it is much higher there is plenty of fear reflected in the market the equity risk premium compares the expected return from stocks and bonds since the bond return is known a wide spread implies little confidence in expected earnings these indicators do not cover the sidelined investors but do we think they are less fearful than those who are in the market i view the fear indicated as an underbid i ll have some additional observations in today s final thought quant corner and risk analysis i have a rule for my investment clients think first about your risk only then should you consider possible rewards i monitor many quantitative reports and highlight the best methods in this weekly update featuring the indicator snapshot both long term and short term technical indicators remain neutral and are finally showing improvement recession risk remains in the watchful area there is little confirmation for the risk signals which we have been monitoring since may many observers who reacted to the yield curve inversion have become less worried let s check in with business cycle expert dr robert dieli here is just one page from his excellent monthly business cycle update he also has a monthly analysis of the employment report and special reports as needed this is a great explanation of why we remain watchful on the recession front most newbies in this field reacted too much to the inversion and now to the steepening the desire to sound smart on tv leads many non experts to oversimplify complex subjects some readers have asked how my conclusion can be bullish when technical indicators are weak the outlook is intended for investors for them the technical indicators are mostly useful to guide specific entry and exit points an attractive equity risk premium and modest recession odds are the keys for investors the featured sources bob dieli business cycle analysis via the c score brian gilmartin all things earnings for the overall market as well as many individual companies georg vrba business

pick calculated risk insight for traders our weekly stock exchange series is written for traders i try to separate this from the regular investor advice in wtwa there is often something interesting for investors but keep in mind that the trades described are certainly not suitable for everyone we welcome my colleague todd hurlbut chief investment officer at incline investment advisors llc he chose this week s topic intuition or intu wishing the trading models are back on the job with comments about current trades some of them this week even looked attractive for long term investors insight for investors investors should understand and embrace volatility they should join my delight in a well documented list of worries as the worries are addressed or even resolved the investor who looks beyond the obvious can collect handsomely best of the week if i had to recommend a single must read article for this week it would be the introspective and insightful piece by the heisenberg where he sets out to dispel some popular heisenberg misconceptions there are several features that investment readers will find useful although it is certainly a change of pace from my typical best of the week even mild neutral analysis inspires many readers to an aggressive reaction his examples are very interesting how he tried the bearish side when i first started writing for public consumption i tried presenting the bear case in forceful sometimes bombastic terms but that got old pretty quickly for me even if not for some readers there s always a bear case and somebody as adept as i am with the digital pen can always make it convincingly especially given my access to copious amounts of data and information how the excessive market worries of late 2018 changed his writing it s no longer clear to me whether market participants are pricing in concerns or pricing in an increasingly dire narrative and then using the resultant selloff to justify that same narrative in a self feeding insanity loop it s interesting how insanity becomes contagious the underlying force that binds everything together this process is that fear has become the new cognitive principle and fear is self reinforcing if you spread fear it looks like you have a deep knowledge of things if you are calm it is like being ignorant and the dramatic difference between 2018 q4 performance and corporate earnings booked and expected he writes at least two analysts have discussed what happened in late 2018 in the context of fear kolanovic for example tackled it head on a year ago last week he famously lamented how misinformation is disseminated to market participants citing the mass production of content that mixes real and fake news with somewhat credible but distorted coverage of sell side financial research he wasn t talking about me i can promise you that he then warned that if we add to this an increased number of algorithms that trade based on posts and headlines the impact on price action and investor psychology can be significant in recent months i have occasionally quoted the heisenberg the work had become more relevant and useful now i know why stock ideas chuck carnevale continues his series on the principles of valuation this time discussing a common problem avoiding obvious mistakes barron s liked fedex fdx before the decline now fedex stock got crushed after

existent to 0 85bill mo looking for a straggler barron s opines that becton dickinson bdx is ready to surpass its peers the great rotation one objective for those of us investing in the great rotation is more exposure to emerging markets picking individual stocks in many of these countries can be a challenge this is an occasion when an etf might be a better choice seeking alpha etf expert jonathan liss interviews perth tolle whose interesting background helped her create the freedom 100 emerging markets etf frdm a key objective for this approach is avoiding the direct china exposure of 30 35 in cap weighted indexes there is inevitable indirect exposure because of china s trade role with emerging markets the result is an approach that includes an objectively derived freedom ranking so far the thesis that freedom helps economic success is proving out here is a key answer pt so we re actually we re not just excluding countries we re actually also rewarding countries for being more free so we re promoting you know freedom in these countries and investing more in those cases so countries like taiwan south korea chile and poland are getting a higher weight in the index because of their freedom levels so the higher the freedom level the higher the weight and then the lower you know the kind of lower freedom countries are getting but they re not completely like abysmal so they re not excluded they re still included they get a lower weight as a result of their lower freedom scores so it s all based on their freedom score so the freedom score is the only factor we use on country allocations dividend sensei discusses the elements of good news from recent weeks all familiar to wtwa readers unlike others he then applies the new information writing the best dividend stocks smart investors can buy now that we have a trade deal i like his conclusions but also the process it is a long article providing a lot of detail for me the key is using recent information in stock selection

moths to a flame when they see the big 12 3 dividend yield tesla tsla kirk spano advises those who joined him in buying below 200 that it is time to start trimming tesla boeing ba where stone fox capital concludes big cash burn big avoid final thought when i speak with investors there is always a lot of nervousness mostly it is just a sense that a market at new highs must be dangerous sometimes there is concern about the length of the bull market i would hardly call them complacent there are a lot of cautious bulls but few ready to run for the hills because of the next headline and these are people in the market the equity outflows and bond inflows have shown the dominant trend all year it does not signify a dangerous level of complacency personal note i hope readers appreciated the implications of the heisenberg link above i once mused to mrs oldprof that if i approached investment blogging with a strict profit motive i knew how to get page views ads and notoriety i elaborated on the techniques citing the success of some of the leading sources there is much less interest in investment education and a willingness to see all sides but then she said you would not be yourself and you certainly wouldn t be happy great rotation hint of the week the past week provided a contrary test end of year trading seems to be at variance from the recent trend as i have noted this process will take a long time review what bob dieli above said about third order effects the market was slow to grasp the trade war negatives and few are even thinking about the actual positives most are focused on the politics i am about 50 invested in my themes of value small and mid cap non us markets and trade deal beneficiaries astute investors should take a close look at the differences between now and a year ago edward jones has a nice summary different times call for a different portfolio take what the market is giving you some other items on my radar i am trying to put the worries

dubai they come from the countryside from the villages from the capital city or from neighbouring countries energetic ambitious full of hope that they will find jobs and a community and better lives few find what they come for yet they keep coming not to london or new york but to lagos the nigerian urban sprawl that s an unrivalled magnet for people in africa or anywhere a city of less than 1 5 million in 1970 lagos is growing so fast that population estimates vary by more than 10 million the lagos bureau of statistics says it s 26 million now the federal government says it s 21 million and international institutions put it at around 15 to 16 million by the end of the century lagos will grow to 88 million making it the world s largest city according to the university of toronto s global cities institute nigeria could be the third largest country by then with a housing deficit of 2 5 million units more than two thirds of lagos s residents live in slums that are among the least hospitable on earth according to leilani farha the united nations special rapporteur on housing people are living in some of the worst if not the worst conditions i have seen in the world and i have been to all the big slums in india kenya south africa ms farha said during a visit to the country in september while most government officials agree the affordable housing shortage is a crisis they have little idea of how to respond key services needed the aim of making housing readily available accessible and affordable for the low and middle income earners who form the bulk of our citizenry had always been challenged by the ever growing population of the state moruf akinderu fatai the lagos state commissioner for housing said in a dec 8 speech we see many people trooping into lagos in search of economic opportunities on a daily basis with no intention of going back new apartment towers are rising in lagos but they are intended for foreign oil workers and the small group of nigerians who can obtain mortgages or afford to pay cash not the families crowded into crumbling units with seven to a room and limited access to clean water and sanitation developers focus on high end units amid a shortage of affordable housing mirrors that of builders in cities around the world from berlin to london to new york and hong kong the most ambitious project is eko atlantic a city within a city that s being built on a lower manhattan sized stretch of land reclaimed from the atlantic ocean its builders plan a boulevard modelled on paris s champs ã lysã es and it will house around 250 000 people in luxury apartments while the us will move its lagos consulate there with vast oil and mineral wealth nigeria has the 29th largest economy in the world just behind norway s while africa s richest man aliko dangote mainly lives in lagos nigeria also has the highest number of people classified as extremely poor defined as living on us 1 90 or less per day at about 87 million of the country s 200 million residents according to the brookings institution lagos is one of the fastest growing cities in sub saharan africa and so far the only one of more than 10 million the threshold for a megacity though several others including kinshasa in dr congo luanda in angola and johannesburg in south africa aren t far behind for proponents of faster economic development this should be a sign that africa is finally getting its chance to catch up with the developed world but even as urbanisation accelerates and third world megacities proliferate it s no longer a direct route to greater prosperity and the rise of a middle class that it was when industrial revolutions swept europe and north america in the 19th century or transformed the economies of countries such as south korea and china in the 20th to serve as engines of greater productivity and development cities need affordable housing reliable public transportation public health services education and other basic amenities without those megacities impede economic growth rather than promote it poor infrastructure all of these together help make cities more productive engines of economic growth said shlomo angel a professor of city planning at new york university one of the setbacks in lagos is that the economy is fragmented it s not integrated people live in small communities so without decent transportation or housing the number of jobs you can reach is based on how far they can walk continued failure to provide adequate housing sanitation and transportation robs nigeria of its greatest resource its human capital nigeria has such a vibrant culture said meredith mcghie secretary general of the global centre for pluralism they are artists musicians and entrepreneurs and they are full of energy under the right conditions they are a formidable workforce for foreign investors particularly those wanting to sell consumer goods nigeria s young rapidly growing population of 200 million should be a major attraction but many are put off by the poor infrastructure including the scarcity of housing investors won t come if housing isn t available for their workers they ll just bypass nigeria said marja hoek smit the founder of the international housing finance programme at the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania and who has worked extensively in africa economic growth is very affected by this lack of affordable housing it means cities are a mess inefficient and costly to live in that ultimately means industrialists have to pay more for labour most government efforts so far have been designed to help people buy homes with government mortgages few could qualify because a 30 per cent downpayment was required for the 10 year loan according to mr akinderu fatai in a speech this month so the government introduced a rent to own programme the prospective homeowners make only a 5 per cent downpayment take possession and pay up the remaining balance with as little interest as possible as rent towards the ownership of the property over a period of 10 years he said very few nigerians have access to home loans from banks there are only around 50 000 home mortgages in the entire country and with nigerian inflation in double digits most lenders that do provide home loans charge at least 20 per cent according to a nigerian central bank survey if you don t have normal access to finance you won t get mass development of housing said wharton s ms hoek smit developers are not going to build if they can t sell upon finishing building the world bank estimates nigeria has a deficit of 17 million housing units one of the largest globally it would cost around us 363 billion to build that many homes according to the centre for affordable housing finance in africa a johannesburg based think tank the government should begin with the basics said the un s ms farha it should prioritise improving informal settlements by giving people the right to live there and upgrading infrastructure she said that way they would lose their fear of being evicted by police who regularly raze slums and invest in their communities they would be quite happy to band together and put up a roof and a wall and build a drain she explained bloomberg

can happen because i measure the weekly change based upon the prior week s close the trading range reflects prices during the actual trading hours reflecting gains from last friday even on the low points for the week you can monitor volatility implied volatility and historical comparisons in my weekly indicator snapshot in the quant corner below noteworthy which countries lead the world in scientific publications statista reports the numbers are you surprised by anything the news each week i break down events into good and bad for our purposes good has two components the news must be market friendly and better than expectations i avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news and you should too new deal democrat s high frequency indicators are an important part of our regular research the results remain positive in both the long and concurrent time frames but the short term forecast has turned negative ndd continues to highlight the metrics to watch if concerned about manufacturing weakness spreading to the consumer a government shutdown was averted and the usmca trade bill was passed the necessity of action generated some compromise even amid the impeachment

increasing just over 1 annually this year growth in single family housing starts will accelerate to 10 during 2020 and top 1 million new homes in 2021 the group predicts that would mark a post recession high but is still far below the annual peak of about 1 7 million single family starts in 2005 and the 1 2 million annual pace experienced in the late 90s single family housing starts have been improving steadily since may and building permits an indicator of future construction are also trending higher it will likely take several years even at a more robust pace for new construction to address the existing pent up demand for additional housing as suggested by a still increasing share of 25 to 34 year olds living at home with their parents according to the report housing starts nov increased to a saar of 1365k surpassing expectations of 1340k and october s upwardly revised 1323k despite the slow start to 2019 calculated risk observes that the strong finish means that starts will be higher in 2019 than in 2018 building permits for november reached 1482k saar beating expectations of 1400k and october s 1461k industrial production reversed october s downwardly revised decline of 0 9 with a gain of 1 1 this was better than the expected 0 8 part of the fluctuation was the gm strike it is more than a one or two month effect as bob dieli explains the rebound in vehicle output associated with the resumption of normal operations at will be a plus going forward but we still think that it will be second and third order effects of the trade war that will have the greatest bearing on how this sector performs going forward what are the second and third order effects stopping the importation of chinese steel through a tariff is the first round effect of the trade war the diminished use of trucks to haul the steel is the second order effect the diminished demand for fuel and truck parts are part of the third order effects ending the trade war will diminish the problems that starting the trade war created but the adjustments to the supply chain will take some time jolts again hit a sweet spot labor markets remain strong but not too tight job openings registered 7 267 million for october up from september s 7 032 million but that is only one element to consider the coverage of this report is so poor that i am devoting some extra space this week below are charts from the bls site illustrating the most important elements of labor market structure core pce prices showed a gain of 0 1 in november the same rate as october and lower than expectations of 0 2 this is good because the fed will not feel any pressure for a rate hike mortgage purchases remain strong the pace continues as the best in a decade michigan sentiment for december registered 99 3 in the final reading slightly beating the prior 99 2 and expectations of 99 1 jill mislinski publishes my favorite chart of this series including gdp and recession data with the meaningful history personal

continuing improvement on a year over year basis the bad the ugly new climate records this decade check out the six animated time series the week ahead we would all like to know the direction of the market in advance good luck with that second best is planning what to look for and how to react the calendar theeconomic calendarhas few reports it is a holiday shortened week split in the middle congress has gone into recess many would expect a time of low volatility but we sometimes see big moves on small volume and we cannot ignore the tweet factor briefing com has a good u s economic calendarfor the week here are the main u s releases next week s theme it is a quiet time which will naturally lead the flight b pundits taking over for the week to ask have investors become too complacent background eddy elfenbein has his usual level headed perspective on complacency here are two of his many good points i don t know how many people would have predicted that the stock market would have a low volatility and multiple new highs during an impeachment but that s exactly what s happened the mood has shifted and investors seem much more confident than they did over the summer remember in august when the two year treasury yield jumped above the 10 year yield for about half an hour the inversion scare was good for about a week as market commentators talked about being very concerned and one of the big mistakes investors make is confusing financial markets with voting booths markets have rallied under both parties and markets have dropped under both parties sometimes stocks just have a mind of their own in the long run it s all about earnings and valuation complacency is viewed by some as important because events could send surprised investors heading for the exits i ll try to evaluate that idea with several different approaches the dimensions of complacency a quiet market this is a common definition of investor complacency especially when stocks are rising cnn business leads their complacency story with these observations there is an eerie sense of calm on wall street heading to the end of the year it s the inverse of last year s december market panic stocks are at all time highs the cnn business fear greed index is hovering above 90 firmly in extreme greed territory for the first time since 2017 the index which tracks the vix volatility gauge and six other measures of investor sentiment can t go higher than 100 but are there risks investors are ignoring the trade war isn t necessarily over earnings estimates and valuations may be too high and oil prices have crept up lately while the dollar has softened raising the potential specter of commodity inflation could the federal reserve have to gulp raise rates in 2020 after all market action is the aggregate of millions of individual actions describing markets as having goals targets and emotions is popular but of little analytical value a quiet market could be achieved with different factions intensely pursuing opposite goals and it has little to offer about the potential for frightened investors surveys of investor sentiment here is the popular survey of the american association of individual investors you can see the bullish reading of 44 10 does it seem extremely high the daily short displays the same data as a spread between bulls and bears now the current level seems much more extreme is this the right approach to take david templeton horan adds an eight period moving average to the bespoke approach does the ma seem to lead the market i am a big fan of surveys when properly conducted and used for the right purpose this one which i occasionally cite has several problems it asks about attitude or intentions rather than describing behavior results are less accurate in those cases the universe includes self described investors who are part of an organization it omits many of the people of greatest interest the sidelined investors the indicator can be measured in several different ways none of which has a clear predictive relationship to market results headline risk news certainly moves markets and the trade war has been one of the most closely watched stories the data show moves of less than nine percent over two days in the case of the most dramatic stories please note that the universe is a basket of stocks determined after the fact to be sensitive to trade and weighted by that sensitivity both the stories and the basket are selected for dramatic effect once again we learn little about how investors might react to this since the trade story typically generates a trading reaction dumb money is complacent there are many definitions of dumb money but it is usually ascribed to individual investors and of course these investors display fear and greed at the wrong times i strongly dislike approaches where the message is carried in the title terminology and the exact methods are obscure just as important is the lack of evidence that these are leading indicators finally how does it capture the emotions of our sidelined investors trader attitudes jesse felder s approach concludes that sentiment has only been this bullish on two prior occasions he uses the rydex ratio or the measure of rydex traders assets in bear funds and money market funds relative to their assets in bull funds and sector funds he likes the measure because it is based on real money not opinion i also like data based upon action in preference to a survey once again the problem here i that we are looking at traders not individual investors the sidelined folks we are concerned about have never heard of a rydex fund we cannot impute trader behavior to these investors but does the method provide a good predictor of the market the second chart looks like a fuzzy coincident indicator but you really need to do a lags and leads test on the underlying data meanwhile another group of traders those who use s p options are skewed very bearish in their positions this is still not an indicator for individual investors of course it is more a response to the felder approach different markets and trader groups provide different results better fact based measures the best sentiment measures are published in my quant corner every week compare the vix called the market s fear gauge to the actual volatility when it is much higher there is plenty of fear reflected in the market the equity risk premium compares the expected return from stocks and bonds since the bond return is known a wide spread implies little confidence in expected earnings these indicators do not cover the sidelined investors but do we think they are less fearful than those who are in the market i view the fear indicated as an underbid i ll have some additional observations in today s final thought quant corner and risk analysis i have a rule for my investment clients think first about your risk only then should you consider possible rewards i monitor many quantitative reports and highlight the best methods in this weekly update featuring the indicator snapshot both long term and short term technical indicators remain neutral and are finally showing improvement recession risk remains in the watchful area there is little confirmation for the risk signals which we have been monitoring since may many observers who reacted to the yield curve inversion have become less worried let s check in with business cycle expert dr robert dieli here is just one page from his excellent monthly business cycle update he also has a monthly analysis of the employment report and special reports as needed this is a great explanation of why we remain watchful on the recession front most newbies in this field reacted too much to the inversion and now to the steepening the desire to sound smart on tv leads many non experts to oversimplify complex subjects some readers have asked how my conclusion can be bullish when technical indicators are weak the outlook is intended for investors for them the technical indicators are mostly useful to guide specific entry and exit points an attractive equity risk premium and modest recession odds are the keys for investors the featured sources bob dieli business cycle analysis via the c score brian gilmartin all things earnings for the overall market as well as many individual companies georg vrba business

for investors but keep in mind that the trades described are certainly not suitable for everyone we welcome my colleague todd hurlbut chief investment officer at incline investment advisors llc he chose this week s topic intuition or intu wishing the trading models are back on the job with comments about current trades some of them this week even looked attractive for long term investors insight for investors investors should understand and embrace volatility they should join my delight in a well documented list of worries as the worries are addressed or even resolved the investor who looks beyond the obvious can collect handsomely best of the week if i had to recommend a single must read article for this week it would be the introspective and insightful piece by the heisenberg where he sets out to dispel some popular heisenberg misconceptions there are several features that investment readers will find useful although it is certainly a change of pace from my typical best of the week even mild neutral analysis inspires many readers to an aggressive reaction his examples are very interesting how he tried the bearish side when i first started writing for public consumption i tried presenting the bear case in forceful sometimes bombastic terms but that got old pretty quickly for me even if not for some readers there s always a bear case and somebody as adept as i am with the digital pen can always make it convincingly especially given my access to copious amounts of data and information how the excessive market worries of late 2018 changed his writing it s no longer clear to me whether market participants are pricing in concerns or pricing in an increasingly dire narrative and then using the resultant selloff to justify that same narrative in a self feeding insanity loop it s interesting how insanity becomes contagious the underlying force that binds everything together this process is that fear has become the new cognitive principle and fear is self reinforcing if you spread fear it looks like you have a deep knowledge of things if you are calm it is like being ignorant and the dramatic difference between 2018 q4 performance and corporate earnings booked and expected he writes at least two analysts have discussed what happened in late 2018 in the context of fear kolanovic for example tackled it head on a year ago last week he famously lamented how misinformation is disseminated to market participants citing the mass production of content that mixes real and fake news with somewhat credible but distorted coverage of sell side financial research he wasn t talking about me i can promise you that he then warned that if we add to this an increased number of algorithms that trade based on posts and headlines the impact on price action and investor psychology can be significant in recent months i have occasionally quoted the heisenberg the work had become more relevant and useful now i know why stock ideas chuck carnevale

is more exposure to emerging markets picking individual stocks in many of these countries can be a challenge this is an occasion when an etf might be a better choice seeking alpha etf expert jonathan liss interviews perth tolle whose interesting background helped her create the freedom 100 emerging markets etf frdm a key objective for this approach is avoiding the direct china exposure of 30 35 in cap weighted indexes there is inevitable indirect exposure because of china s trade role with emerging markets the result is an approach that includes an objectively derived freedom ranking so far the thesis that freedom helps economic success is proving out here is a key answer pt so we re actually we re not just excluding countries we re actually also rewarding countries for being more free so we re promoting you know freedom in these countries and investing more in those cases so countries like taiwan south korea chile and poland are getting a higher weight in the index because of their freedom levels so the higher the freedom level the higher the weight and then the lower you know the kind of lower freedom countries are getting but they re not completely like abysmal so they re not excluded they re still included they get a lower weight as a result of their lower freedom scores so it s all based on their freedom score so the freedom score is the only factor we use on country

capital concludes big cash burn big avoid final thought when i speak with investors there is always a lot of nervousness mostly it is just a sense that a market at new highs must be dangerous sometimes there is concern about the length of the bull market i would hardly call them complacent there are a lot of cautious bulls but few ready to run for the hills because of the next headline and these are people in the market the equity outflows and bond inflows have shown the dominant trend all year it does not signify a dangerous level of complacency personal note i hope readers appreciated the implications of the heisenberg link above i once mused to mrs oldprof that if i approached investment blogging with a strict profit motive i knew how to get page views ads and notoriety i elaborated on the techniques citing the success of some of the leading sources there is much less interest in investment education and a willingness to see all sides but then she said you would not be yourself and you certainly wouldn t be happy great rotation hint of the week the past week provided a contrary test end of year trading seems to be at variance from the recent trend as i have noted this process will take a long time review what bob dieli above said about third order effects the market was slow to grasp the trade war negatives and few are even thinking about the actual positives most are focused on the politics i am about 50 invested in my themes of value small and mid cap non us markets and trade deal beneficiaries astute investors should take a close look at the differences between now and a year ago edward jones has a nice summary different times call for a different portfolio take what the market is giving you some other items on my radar i am trying to put the worries

via marketwatch rarely has failure been celebrated so much but it is of little wonder after all as all asset classes rose in 2019 despite slowing economic growth and flat to declining earnings in religious debates this question is often asked why is there something instead of nothing in financial markets the corollary may be easier to answer why are markets higher on nothing the answer of course being primarily central bank liquidity we ve discussed the unholy alliance and central bankers being trapped but there is a more sinister truth lurking beneath one of system failure suggesting things are not anywhere near as rosy as they may appear the evidence increasingly suggests that the federal reserve desperate to fix a leak in the hull is lighting the whole ship on fire in the process by blowing a historic asset bubble setting up markets to fail and on course for a massive reversion why system failure because 2019 has revealed a fundamental truth central banks can t extract themselves from the monstrosity they have created and made markets dependent upon turns out 2018 was the only year since the financial crisis that central banks reduced liquidity on a net basis and it blew up in everybody s face all previous moves to neutral resulted in more intervention with the most aggressive move occurring on the heels of the 2015 2016 earnings recession in 2018 the fed moved to finally reduce the size of its balance sheet it failed miserably in fact the sequence of communications and actions by the fed in the past year reveals another fundamental truth nothing the fed says can be trusted none of their communications have any predictive meaning i ll give you a basic timeline july 11 2018 the st louis fed gives everyone a primer on fed balance sheet reduction it says the fed has always viewed the remaining increase as temporary with an eye toward shrinking or unwinding the balance sheet once economic recovery was complete the fed s long term plan was to gradually end both policies aka normalizing monetary policy oh yeah normalization unwinding fighting words but that s what they promised all along the fighting words lasted until mid december 2018 dec 19 2018 from cnbc the fed currently is allowing 50 billion a month to run off the balance sheet which is largely a portfolio of bonds the central bank purchased to stimulate the economy during and after the financial crisis fed chairman jerome powell said the process is going well i think that the runoff of the balance sheet has been smooth and has served its purpose he said during a news conference i don t see us changing that ha ha markets were collapsing and only a few days later powell switched course jan 4 2019 from cnbc we don t believe that our issuance is an important part of the story of the market turbulence that began in the fourth quarter of last year but i ll say again if we reached a different conclusion we wouldn t hesitate to make a change he said if we came to the view that the balance sheet normalization plan or any other aspect of normalization was part of the problem we wouldn t hesitate to make a change suddenly he s flexible this is what markets wanted to hear an acknowledgment that the fed s normalization was causing market turbulence stocks soared over 3 5 in just one day on that statement and it marked the beginning of powell being the market bottom trigger throughout 2019 in march another rally was prompted when the fed announced it would end the balance sheet run off march 8 2019 from the fed the committee is now well along in our discussions of a plan to conclude balance sheet runoff later this year once balance sheet runoff ends we may if appropriate hold the size of the balance sheet constant for a time to allow reserves to very gradually decline to the desired level as other liabilities such as currency increase we ll end quantitative tightening qt and then keep the balance sheet constant for a time sure but that s what markets wanted to hear and this is what markets got then it was the rate cut carrots that kept markets propelling higher and this carrot was unveiled every single time markets got in trouble in may and in august but then something odd happened the actual rate cut announcements didn t work anymore both the july and september rate cuts prompted selling by investors creating the need for ever more aggressive actions and successively more so the trigger the sept 16 overnight funding crisis which prompted overnight rates to spike dramatically forcing the fed to intervene it was the leak in the hull and now watch the communications and actions it was temporary then it morphed into an aggressive course of actions sept 20 2019 from the associated press the federal reserve will keep pumping cash into a vital but obscure corner of u s financial markets in coming weeks the new york federal reserve bank which handles the central bank s interactions with financial markets said friday that it will offer daily repurchase or repo operations of at least 75 billion through oct 10 the aim is to maintain the fed s key policy rate within its target range officials say this week s spike in rates is not a precursor of the type of underlying troubles that preceded the 2008 market meltdown the fed began conducting these operations to calm money markets rates on short term repo agreements had briefly spiked to nearly 10 earlier this week as financial firms scrambled to find short term funding to calm markets it said it didn t last long more action was required and in october the fed went wild oct 8 2019 from cnbc powell says the fed will start expanding its balance sheet soon in response to funding issues powell said this is not qe in no sense is this qe we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us sure oct 11 2019 from the financial times the federal reserve is poised to begin at least a six month operation to buy about 60 billion of treasury bills per month as the u s central bank seeks to ease cash shortages that caused a recent spike in the overnight cost of borrowing the announcement on friday sent three month bill yields sharply lower dropping from a high of 1 7 to a low of 1 62 the size of the operation shocked wall street analysts who had expected the central bank to be more conservative oct 23 2019 from cnbc the fed is sharply increasing the amount of help it is providing to the financial system the new york fed announced it is increasing its temporary overnight repo operations to 120 billion a day from the current 75 billion temporary right it s so temporary we ll increase repos by 60 but why stop there even this is not enough apparently the unholy alliance strikes again the same week the trump administration announces a phase one trade deal the fed announces even more liquidity to come dec 13 2019 from markets insider fed boosts plan to inject billions into the u s economy the central bank lifted its limit for operations scheduled between december 31 and january 2 to 150 billion from 120 billion according to a release let s be crystal clear these actions announced in october changed the market dynamics volatility was crushed and markets went on a one way street to new highs the banking sector having failed to break out of its trading range all year suddenly managed to explode to the upside this rally in 2019 and in the fourth quarter in particular is entirely the product of liquidity injections in the form of rate cuts and balance sheet expansions it s not the economy stupid it s the balance sheets stupid t co vsq757xjag sven henrich northmantrader december 14 2019 it s not based on economic reality it s not based on earnings growth it s not even based on a trade deal that is opaque and lacking details and because of it markets keep disconnecting ever further from an economic basis in fact on an economic basis markets have reached record levels not seen since the year 2000 party like it s 1999 the aggregate us market closed at 32 trillion market cap for the first time ever or approximately 149 market cap gdp most notable this valuation milestone was reached amid flat to declining earnings growth and slowing economic growth pic twitter com peb4by0plp sven henrich northmantrader december 14 2019 market cap to gdp is now overtly flirting with the 150 level last seen in 1999 some will say that s fine because there are now more international sales reflected in s p 500 spx 0 49 companies fine if you want to make that argument but you have to account for several factors one is that international growth is as flat as a pancake the bundesbank recently reduced german gdp growth outlook to 0 6 for 2020 and 1 6 for 2021 the oecd has japan s gdp growth outlook pegged at 0 6 for 2020 and 0 7 for 2020 and the ecb has europe on a forever 1 x for years to come lagarde introduces the gdp and inflation outlook for the euro area pic twitter com 69tzrfj4iz european central bank ecb december 12 2019 so if you want to justify markets trading at a 150 market cap to gdp based on international sales go right ahead but don t justify it based on solid growth it s not there and hence that justification would be a fantasy in keeping with the year 2000 theme note we are seeing some of the same internal distortions as those of the dot com bubble as five tech components now represent 16 5 of the s p 500 relative to the rest of the market the same as in 1999 we re ending 2019 with key components such as microsoft msft 1 09 and apple aapl 0 21 being massively overbought technically disconnected extended and over owned these types of extremes have led to pain and reconnects take apple as an example it s repeating a previous pattern extending far above its quarterly bollinger band far above its quarterly 15 moving average to the extent these moves are driven by global liquidity the fed may well then have set up the entire market for a massive failure in the fourth quarter the fed has been forced to set on a path of ever increasing liquidity injections with its balance sheet now destined to reach record highs as early as perhaps the first quarter of 2020 it has been a giant system failure central banks can t reduce liquidity otherwise markets fall apart the process of never letting markets correct themselves is producing valuations across the economic spectrum that are worse than in 2000 as household wealth concentrated among the top 10 relative to gdp has reached unprecedented levels and yet new market highs are following a familiar historic script all new highs are coming on negative divergences the s p 500 has reached its trend line apex the yield curve went from inversion to steepening a process that has preceded recessions every time in the past 50 years and when these conditions take place we can see that the geometric value line index xvg shows significantly lower readings compared with previous highs these conditions suggest markets remain at a sizable reversion risk at the end of december 2018 i talked about bullish technical reconnects to take place in 2019 as a result of deeply oversold conditions now a year later we re seeing some of the same conditions but to the upside suggesting that we will witness corrective reconnect activity into 2020 be clear the liquidity avalanche will continue into year end and until something breaks the upside train can continue despite overbought conditions what s it mean for investors i suppose if long stays long until wrong from our perch it s sell the rips and buy the dips until the dynamic changes that s as the sell case has not been disproven as price has not breached the sell zone indicated the fed has now indicated it will not cut rates further in 2020 based on its track record in the past year such a proclamation has no meaning both the fed s powell and new european central bank president christine lagarde cemented the system failure of 2019 this month powell indicated no rate hikes ever unless inflation exceeds either the fed s inflation target which they ve failed to reach in 10 plus years according to how both the fed and the ecb measure inflation this seems to imply no rate hikes ever as lagarde indicated no end of qe until just before the ecb will raise rates so qe forever for now investors can party like it s 1999 but have a plan for when the music stops as history suggests it can stop suddenly in 2000 it stopped in the month of march sven henrich is founder and the lead market strategist of northmantrader com follow him on twitter at northmantrader
if the us is any guide the uk s fiscal position is set to deteriorate markedly while the bond market quietly snoozes in the corner photograph istock back in the dark days of the financial crisis irish taxpayers learned to their cost that policymakers are terrified of bond markets bonds do affect pretty much everything bond yields are the most important variable in finance is a mantra often expressed by business school professors even longer ago than the crisis james carvell an adviser to then president bill clinton famously mused that in the event of reincarnation he would like to come back as the bond market that way you can intimidate everybody he wouldn t say that today bond markets are about as intimidating as a mince pie the reasons for this are poorly understood and to the extent we have any ideas at all they are bitterly fought over traders on the floor of the new york stock exchange nyse photograph spencer platt getty images bonds do impact on all of us but in ways that are mostly invisible our mortgage repayments and overdrafts are largely determined by bonds a large chunk of our taxes go towards interest payments on the national debt read more our own version of the financial crisis was made much worse by the decision to repay senior bondholders the money they were owed by insolvent banks there are still lots of battles fought over that one doubts about the solvency of many governments including ireland effectively meant that investors stopped buying bonds issued by countries like greece bond vigilantes as they are sometimes called are thought to impose discipline on spendthrift politicians if you can t borrow the money the only thing left for a finance minister to do is to print it that s been tried on occasion often but not always with disastrous consequences printing money just generates inflation the late great douglas adams once gave a brilliant exposition of the quantity theory of money when two of his protagonists in the hitchhiker s guide to the galaxy travel back to prehistoric times needing money they decide the currency of the day is to be the humble leaf in the blink of an eye the price of a cup of tea rises to two deciduous forests in slightly more formal terms economists are raised to believe that if you print too much money inflation will be the destructive result in the economists version of fighting the last war a lot of the debate about the relationship between government borrowing money and inflation is being rehashed particularly in the us academics prominent american politicians like alexandria ocasio cortez have latched on to the writings of a bunch of academics labelled modern monetary theorists mmt the idea is that governments who can print their own money can never go bust the main consequence of this not terribly original insight is the suggestion that government borrowing can and should be a lot higher mainstream economists have mostly rubbished all this as old wine in new bottles the curious thing about this debate is that its protagonists don t seem to have noticed that donald trump has embraced mmt with open arms mmt theories have been used by democratic politicians to espouse more government involvement in the economy via greatly expanded borrowing liberal in the american sense politicians want to spend more while trump has cut taxes on companies and rich people the fiscal consequences are the same massively increased borrowing and contrary to all those dark textbook warnings about inflation price rises are noticeable only by their absence the other dog failing to bark is the bond market those vigilantes look to have taken an extended vacation in fact markets are falling over themselves to lend to governments and corporations just about everywhere recently those markets have actually been prepared to pay the irish government for the privilege of lending to the state weird bond markets have turned political orthodoxy on its head in the us the republican party is normally the one to moan about fiscal responsibility as trump runs unprecedented deficits for a peacetime economy at full employment so the fiscal scolds of the ruling party pretend not to notice the conservative party in the uk usually mimics its republican cousins and historically at least lays claim to the virtues of small government and balanced budgets on both sides of the atlantic this orthodoxy has been turned on its head trump playbook it seems clear to me at least that johnson is following the trump playbook almost word for word the unannounced ditching of fiscal conservatism will be the next shoe to drop albeit with an emphasis on blowing the budget on spending rises rather than tax cuts if the us is any guide the uk s fiscal position is set to

if the us is any guide the uk s fiscal position is set to deteriorate markedly while the bond market quietly snoozes in the corner photograph istock back in the dark days of the financial crisis irish taxpayers learned to their cost that policymakers are terrified of bond markets bonds do affect pretty much everything bond yields are the most important variable in finance is a mantra often expressed by business school professors even longer ago than the crisis james carvell an adviser to then president bill clinton famously mused that in the event of reincarnation he would like to come back as the bond market that way you can intimidate everybody he wouldn t say that today bond markets are about as intimidating as a mince pie the reasons for this are poorly understood and to the extent we have any ideas at all they are bitterly fought over traders on the floor of the new york stock exchange nyse photograph spencer platt getty images bonds do impact on all of us but in ways that are mostly invisible our mortgage repayments and overdrafts are largely determined by bonds a large chunk of our taxes go towards interest payments on the national debt read more our own version of the financial crisis was made much worse by the decision to repay senior bondholders the money they were owed by insolvent banks there are still lots of battles fought over that one doubts about the solvency of many governments including ireland effectively meant that investors stopped buying bonds issued by countries like greece bond vigilantes as they are sometimes called are thought to impose discipline on spendthrift politicians if you can t borrow the money the only thing left for a finance minister to do is to print it that s been tried on occasion often but not always with disastrous consequences printing money just generates inflation the late great douglas adams once gave a brilliant exposition of the quantity theory of money when two of his protagonists in the hitchhiker s guide to the galaxy travel back to prehistoric times needing money they decide the currency of the day is to be the humble leaf in the blink of an eye the price of a cup of tea rises to two deciduous forests in slightly more formal terms economists are raised to believe that if you print too much money inflation will be the destructive result in the economists version of fighting the last war a lot of the debate about the relationship between government borrowing money and inflation is being rehashed particularly in the us academics prominent american politicians like alexandria ocasio cortez have latched on to the writings of a bunch of academics labelled modern monetary theorists mmt the idea is that governments who can print their own money can never go bust the main consequence of this not terribly original insight is the suggestion that government borrowing can and should be a lot higher mainstream economists have mostly rubbished all this as old wine in new bottles the curious thing about this debate is that its protagonists don t seem to have noticed that donald trump has embraced mmt with open arms mmt theories have been used by democratic politicians to espouse more government involvement in the economy via greatly expanded borrowing liberal in the american sense politicians want to spend more while trump has cut taxes on companies and rich people the fiscal consequences are the same massively increased borrowing and contrary to all those dark textbook warnings about inflation price rises are noticeable only by their absence the other dog failing to bark is the bond market those vigilantes look to have taken an extended vacation in fact markets are falling over themselves to lend to governments and corporations just about everywhere recently those markets have actually been prepared to pay the irish government for the privilege of lending to the state weird bond markets have turned political orthodoxy on its head in the us the republican party is normally the one to moan about fiscal responsibility as trump runs unprecedented deficits for a peacetime economy at full employment so the fiscal scolds of the ruling party pretend not to notice the conservative party in the uk usually mimics its republican cousins and historically at least lays claim to the virtues of small government and balanced budgets on both sides of the atlantic this orthodoxy has been turned on its head trump playbook it seems clear to me at least that johnson is following the trump playbook almost word for word the unannounced ditching of fiscal conservatism will be the next shoe to drop albeit with an emphasis on blowing the budget on spending rises rather than tax cuts if the us is any guide the uk s fiscal position is set to deteriorate markedly while the bond market quietly snoozes in the corner indeed this process has already started this could work johnson was lucky with his political opponents and is fortunate now to be faced with a quiescent bond market things could change but for now he will be able to spend with relative impunity this of course will be maddening for his enemies he has found the right policy for

in an unsurprising move the bank of england decided to keep its cash rates steady leaving it at 0 75 percent during the central bank s last meeting of 2019 despite being unsurprising this move was quite remarkable especially given the current state of the british economy during its announcement the bank made a cautious statement regarding the future of the economy which has been suffering from weakness this year in the first quarter the british gdp went up by 0 5 percent followed by a 0 2 percent contraction in the second and a soft recovery in the third gaining 0 3 percent the bank expects the british economy to grow marginally in q4 as exports and investment have remained weak despite the surge in household consumption an improving global situation aided by a reduction in uncertainty levels and modest recovery makes bank members believe that the british economic growth is going to pick up next year it also highlighted that the pound sterling and british stocks have appreciated in a significant way against their counterparts before and after the elections and that unemployment rates remain stable as well as having an employment rate that s around its record high regarding the global economic situation the bank highlighted the advances in the talks between the united states and china but remained cautious given the new wave of tariffs against countries like brazil argentina and france which added to the uncertainty in the international markets inflation on the other hand remains way below the bank s target which is currently set at 2 percent britain s consumer price inflation remained unchanged in november at 1 5 percent hitting its lowest level since november 2016 the monetary policy committee expects the inflation rate to follow this trend in 2020 and made clear that monetary policy could still respond in such a way that it would help to bring back inflation to the target monetary policy could respond in either direction to changes in the economic outlook in order to ensure a sustainable return of inflation to the 2 target said the boe s statement in reality despite making sure that the inflation levels remain close to the bank s target the central bank needs to adjust its monetary policy stance in such a way that it aids the british economic growth and employment levels simply put when making its decision the bank needs to take into account the possible effects of leaving the european union as well as the timeline and whether it will withdraw from the union with or without a deal despite the recent overwhelming victory that gave the tories an ample majority in the british parliament there is still the underlying uncertainty associated with the second phase of the talks that the uk representatives are holding with brussels the fact that the british pm boris johnson is attempting to make illegal to ask for an extension for the a50 notice beyond 2020 only contributes to the unease this together with the mixed economic picture enables us to understan the bank s decision to express its cautiousness and its willingness to leave the door open for future changes in the monetary policy and it seems that the market actors are not indifferent to this fact either the gbp usd has been closing on the negative territory during the last couple of days as well as experiencing a lot of volatility recently it rebounded during the european session on thursday mostly aided by a bullish us dollar but came back to the negative territory right after the bank s announcement showing how uncertainty still weighs on the market

but the terms of the new relationship with the eu is fraught with risks prime minister johnson is maneuvering to avoid a repeat of the brexit delays which means that if an agreement is not struck by the end of next year and such negotiations usually take years to complete the uk will leave with only the wto standards governing this significant relationship this is understood to be potentially significantly disruptive the uk joins japan and canada among the g7 to provide fiscal stimulus in 2020 the economic calendar is light next week and in any event ought not to challenge the holiday mood the u s reports the chicago fed s it has been in negative territory in all but two of the first ten months of the year in 2018 it fell in just three months this year s average reading is 0 29 while in the january october period in 2018 it averaged 0 19 this is not a widely followed report but like the which has not risen in since july offers some worrying signs about the strength of the u s economy while the headline for november ought to have improved from the 0 5 reading in october the details may be poorer most of the orders appear to be coming from the auto sector and when transportation is eliminated a small gain is likely shipments are expected to have fallen by after the 0 8 gain in october than snapped a three month decline set the cyclical high in september and slipped by 0 7 in october and may have slipped a touch again in november according to the bloomberg survey rounding out this coming week s u s data includes the richmond fed s and the three other fed surveys for december have been reported the and kansas fed survey were sequentially weaker and poorer than expected the ticked up 3 5 from 2 9 but missed the median forecast bloomberg survey of 4 0 weekly jobless claims spiked to year s high 252k in the week ending december 6 and pulled back 234k in the week ending december 13 the four week moving average before the jump was a little below 220k the divergence between the atlanta and new york fed s trackers narrowed a bit last week as the former edged up to 2 1 from 2 0 while the latter nearly doubled to 1 3 the implied yield of the december 2020 fed funds futures contract rose to 1 395 last week from 1 32 the previous week it is the highest since august 1 the current effective average is 1 55 this means that about a 60 chance of a cut next year has been discounted japan s sales tax increase brought forward economic activity and especially consumption this was evident in the depressing october reports however in the holiday shortened week ahead tokyo will likely report a bounce back in in november after a 14 2 drop in october retail sales the median forecast in the bloomberg survey calls for a 5 rise however which slumped 4 5 in october probably continued to contract in november the median forecast looks for a 1 1 decline it would be the third contraction in four months canada and sweden have parallel stories inflation is firm in both countries and this appears to be the driver of monetary policy considerations while the real economies disappoint sweden s riksbank became the first central bank to have introduced negative rates to bring them back zero sort of the refi rate is at zero but the repo rate and deposit rate remain in negative territory 25 bp and 35 bp respectively the economy has disappointed the composite pmi has not been above the 50 boom bust level since august the three month average of house prices in november was at its lowest level of the year industrial orders fell for the fifth consecutive month in october is volatile in sweden but this year s average through november is about 6 8 nearly 0 5 above the year ago period many observers see the as indicative of some general official recognition that negative interest rates are not working however this seems to be an exaggeration at her first press conference as ecb president lagarde pushed back against such accusations and defended negative rates the swiss national bank also shows no signs that it has become convinced that negative rates are counter productive nor does the boj seem ready to throw in the towel on negative interest rates canada reported the highest median 2 4 in a decade last week and that helped lift the to nine month highs 1 75 and seemed to reinforce the bank of canada s decidedly neutral policy yet real sector data disappointed the 38 4k in november was the largest decline of the year the median forecast in the bloomberg survey called for a 10k increase it was the first back to back loss of full time jobs since march april 2017 the latest disappointment was last week s report that showed collapsed 1 2 in october the largest decline since november 2017 excluding autos canadian retail sales fell by 0 5 the third consecutive monthly decline it has not risen since june canada will report october s monthly on december 23 the economy expanded at a monthly average of 0 1 and a 1 3 annualized pace in q3 that compares with a monthly average of 0 3 in q2 and an annualized pace of 3 5 the median forecast expects that the economy stagnated in october the risk appears to be on the downside
transportation climate initiative proponents don t want to call their proposal a tax hike but critics point out it would have the same result as a gas or carbon tax hike eric allie boston mass this past week details were released about the transportation climate initiative tci the proposal to increase the price of gas across nearly a dozen northeastern and mid atlantic states with a new regulatory scheme that will now be debated in statehouses across tci member states over the coming weeks and months tci supporters didn t have long to celebrate as the ink was barely dry on the january 17 press release and memorandum of understanding announcing the tci details new hampshire governor chris sununu r announced that his state will not be participating in the fuel cost increasing regulatory scheme that is tci i will not force granite staters to pay more for their gas just to subsidize other states crumbling infrastructure governor sununu told the boston herald new hampshire is already taking substantial steps to curb our carbon emissions and this initiative if enacted would institute a new gas tax by up to 17 cents per gallon while only achieving minimal results this program is a financial boondoggle and the people of new hampshire will never support it governor sununu s office also pointed out how tci would inflict financial strain on some constituents more than others explaining that rural communities would be left at a severe disadvantage if new hampshire participated in the tci as drivers will bear the brunt of the artificially higher gas prices according to sununu spokesman jared chicoine the transportation climate initiative is a huge hit to the wallets of rural drivers the data makes it clear that even without the tci proposal the market is already projected to reach many of the same environmental benchmarks massachusetts governor charlie baker r says he can impose tci in his state unilaterally without the consent of commonwealth representatives and senators in most other tci states however legislative sign off will be necessary for ratification an important question to be answered is whether other state leaders will follow governor sununu s lead and announce that they will protect their constituents from an effective gas tax hike by not subjecting their state to tci in vermont governor phil scott r deserves a great deal of credit for being the only thing standing between his constituents and a regressive carbon tax hike many are now wondering what scott will do on tci a proposal which like a carbon tax would drive up the cost of fuel governor scott s spokeswoman recently said their administration is reviewing and analyzing the draft memorandum of understanding in full so it s too early to weigh in at this point tci would have the exact same effect on vermonters as a gas or carbon tax hike tci supporters themselves admit that the plan will inflate the cost of gas by as much as 17 cents per gallon by this logic many are hoping that governor scott will ultimately protect his constituents from energy cost inflating tci as he has done with carbon tax proposals for so many years tci is a carbon tax governor scott has been vociferously opposed to any carbon tax statewide or regional since his initial campaign for governor in 2016 said rob roper president of the ethan allen institute a vermont based think tank in fact in that campaign when his opponent described her support for a regional cap and trade program designed to expand the regional greenhouse gas initiative to the transportation sector which is what tci is scott said sounds like she supports a carbon tax so if scott is consistent with his campaign promises and his recent policy statements he should not be long in following new hampshire out of this bad bargain if vermont were to go along with tci while new hampshire doesn t it would put vermont businesses near the border at a disadvantage relative to their new hampshire based competitors massachusetts businesses near the border are already preparing to face this disadvantage that their governor has created for them with much higher fuel costs massachusetts small businesses on the new hampshire border now risk losing customers to a lower cost state as well as the sale of soda cigarettes and snacks christopher carlozzi massachusetts director of the national federation of independent business told the boston herald consumers will already travel over the border to save a few cents a gallon but if it s 17 cents they certainly will drive to new hampshire for cheaper gas which hurts massachusetts state revenues massachusetts gov charlie baker speaks to the media after a private meeting to discuss issues of regional importance with rhode island gov gina raimondo and connecticut gov ned lamont thursday oct 24 2019 on the campus of rhode island college in providence r i ap photo steven senne associated press on tuesday december 17 the day tci was rolled out a coalition of non profit organizations from across 13 northeast and mid atlantic states plus the district of columbia sent an joint open letter to public officials urging opposition to tci gas taxes are regressive in nature the tci will hurt lower income and rural residents much more significantly than their higher income urban peers the open letter explained since motor fuels are economically inelastic the higher costs imposed by the tci s fuel tax will have to come out of other areas of household budgets people already struggling to make ends meet will be forced by their own governments to make painfully difficult choices economically speaking this is bad policy morally speaking it s just cruel that coalition letter also noted that tci would raise fuel costs for motorists and direct that additional revenue away from roads the letter notes that unlike motor fuel taxes levied to pay for roads bridges and transportation infrastructure a reasonable fee for use the tci would be the equivalent of a sin tax a penalty for engaging in bad behavior organized labor is already expressing concern about the transportation climate initiative which provides another example of the frequent conflict between the policy goals of green advocacy groups and the livelihoods of union workers who are employed in the fossil fuel industry in response to the transportation climate initiative rollout vermont afl cio issued a statement on december 29 proclaiming that the union supports a true union based green new deal for vermont and beyond but central to our vision for a socially just renewable energy future built maintained with union labor is that such a bold social project needs to be funded through progressive taxation and other creative means which do not regressively put more burdens on low income working class people in addition to the adverse economic consequences associated with the effective tax hike imposed by tci critics of the proposal contend that the project will have a negligible impact on emissions tci supporters themselves admit that transportation derived carbon emissions are projected to drop by 19 in the decade from 2022 2032 even if tci is not implemented if tci is implemented supporters project that reduction in emissions would increase from 19 to at least 20 and possibly as much as 25 put another way tci supporters project that enactment of the cap and trade like regulatory scheme will speed up the already projected emissions reduction over the next decade by one to five percentage points to produce a mere 1 point reduction in emissions over 10 years they would impose a 14 billion tax on the region s economy paul gangi with the massachusetts fiscal alliance writes about tci to produce the high end estimate of an additional 6 point reduction in emissions 25 overall they would impose a 56 billion tax on the region s economy will the democratic takeover in richmond mean that virginia signs on to tci will pennsylvania governor tom wolf d seek to impose tci unilaterally or will he allow elected officials in the keystone state house and senate to have a say will governor phil scott protect his constituents from this latest proposal to impose a regressive tax hike just as he has done with past efforts to enact a carbon tax in vermont the answers to these important questions all of which will become evident in early 2020 will determine the fate of tci and whether motorists across nearly a dozen states will pay higher gas prices that are artificially inflated in a new more opaque manner

melt up to melt down notice several commentators have started talking up the melt up and with the traditional santa claus rally coming on in full force i expect that the momentum will continue at this accelerated level into january i have been talking about the melt up for weeks now and if it is a true melt up there is inevitably a meltdown traders please use the cash management method i have talked about innumerable times at this point with 0 commission for trades it makes even more sense now to sell a share or two of each â oldâ position in your trading portfolio also charge yourself a â commissionâ for each trade letâ s say a few hundred and if youâ re an active trader that will add up most discount brokers come with a checking account sweep the cash in there so you arenâ t tempted to put it into your next trade when the melt down happens you can go shopping the s p 500 is already above 3200 most analysts have the s p not much higher for 2020 i expect that we will surpass even the higher estimates but right now i have 3400 as the top and that is based on 180 earnings for 2020 at a 19 times pe at this point we canâ t rely on expanded valuations we need earnings growth to step in so i am going to say here and now that we will probably have a 10 â meltdownâ at some time late january through february it really depends on the earnings season starting after january 15 if we see any kind of accelerated earnings then we can hope for better earnings in 2020 even so the market will find some kind of reason to correct if we continue to have the hyperbolic rise that i am modeling i am not a bear but i believe in volatility here is what i propose watch the vix if we break 11 and then we will definitely be at peak complacency at that point we will be nearing the peak of the melt up the hedgies will be shorting the vix and probably the leveraged etfs on top of that i am basically describing what happened in the transition from december 2017 then on january 22 the retreat started itâ s never perfectly the same but this rally is already overbought and is going to get even more so where can the s p 500 go if the current trajectory continues if you take now until the end of january you have about 40 days letâ s extend the upslope source tradingview the first diagonal is a well established upslope nearly from the beginning of the year now we have from the beginning of october which i believe that most market participants would agree is now at a new accelerated phase again i called it a melt up call it what you want but optimism is about to reach euphoric levels that gets us about 200 points taking us to 3400 that seems shocking and not feasible the downside if my 10 prediction comes to pass that will take us right back to 3100 however the support on the chart is about 3000 this is a 12 sell off so letâ s widen the range from 10 to 12 i canâ t imagine that this melt up extends to that oversold level but momentum is building here are some hard numbers to contemplate etf movement back into equities the spy and the qqq leading in etf inflows both traders and allocators money managers at 10 billion each equities vs fixed income throughout much of the year fixed income received the lion s share of investment dollars and starting in august when we had a 45 billion gap that started to change while equities lagged it started to lag less and by october it started to catch up in earnest of course this matches up with our chart and the hyperbolic phase in the s p now inflows are dead even and i would not be surprised if at the very end of this year we could see equities beating fixed income by 10 billion to 20 billion we have to admit to ourselves that investors are taking more risk this is for good reason a lot of things are coming together i am using etf fund flows to indicate trading and investing in individual stocks hedge funds and individuals are experiencing fomo the movement to equities is very logical a lot of positive things are coming together starting with the likelihood that trump will be reelected the polls are moving toward trump i am not being political the market wants visibility trump is the devil it knows and the market is reacting to this we also have hope for a recovery in earnings we have the rest of the world bottoming and reporting better economic numbers or at least not getting worse we have the trade war in china moving to the background and we have the usmca the new nafta being agreed to you will hear about a free trade deal with the uk after brexit hopefully it wonâ t have the unfortunate name usuk free trade deal if it modeled after the usmca moniker you have news that dram and nand has bottomed and memory is a foundational cyclical it goes into everything these days we have news that for the first time in months we have double digit growth in drilling rigs in the permian accelerated growth or potential for growth is accelerating overbought conditions start with a logical underpinning so do many bubbles the dot com bubble turned out to be true the internet did change everything it just took 10 15 years to get there now that we have this melt up the momentum becomes procyclical and it takes on a life of its own the plan is simple wait for the vix to signal hedging activity i hate being a scold but i want you to preserve the gains that you worked so hard for in 2019 once we break under 11 on the vix we will start talking about hedging until then start building your cash as i described earlier cash is the cheapest hedge my call for selling positions and generating cash is for traders only donâ t touch your long term investments and never sell your long term investments everyone should have cash that you can survive on for six to 12 months that is not what i am talking about cash management in a trading account is for trading discipline not financial emergencies ok letâ s talk stocks i want to address 5g a topic i have avoided what made me focus on 5g i am not going to say that i am was a 5g skeptic i just felt that its time really hasnâ t come yet i believe the true economic leverage of 5g hasnâ t yet arrived we still havenâ t built out the network so that 5g is ubiquitous then weâ ll see the true benefit of 5g until that point 5g will have islands of operability so for now you will have the ability to watch videos everywhere and probably never have dropped calls or bad reception again the 5g killer app hasnâ t been invented yet though futurists are claiming that true robotic driving will be possible then so what got me started piper jaffray ups price target and earnings estimation on apple thanks to 5g iphone with the visibility of the iphone 5g phone for 2020 i realized that the 5g build out is starting to happen in earnest i assume you know the â go toâ first tier names like american tower amt and crown castle cci skyworks swks qorvo qrvo qualcomm ericcson eric nokia nok then the secondary chips xilinx xlnx analog devices adi marvell technology group mrvl even taiwan semi tsm if you invest in tech you probably have a lot of the above names already amt and cci are the towers that receive the cell signals and house the equipment from eric and nok the chips from qcom swks and qrvo process and create the signals in your phone the chips in xlnx adi mrvl and manufactured by tsm are in various parts of the equipment and phones out of the box and maybe in your portfolio so what are the out of the box names i want to share letâ s start with valmont vmi which is a metal bending manufacturer that actually makes the towers with 5g because of the spectrum the 5g waves are short waves they need more power to get wide reception and the demand for more towers will be stronger also there will be a need for more equipment to process edge computing which means more enclosures and specialized structures vmi gives a 1 dividend and it has other products so it could be a long term investment infinera infn provides high speed equipment on the fiber optic network once the signal goes to the tower and has the initial processing the data has to go somewhere this is called the backhaul it is underfollowed and unappreciated speaking of unappreciated i give you centurylink ctl another name that i believe will benefit from backhaul traffic earlier this year we saw a bit of insider buying it has been weak of late but 5g is going to be a huge expansion of data even though the verizons vz of this world are building out their networks there will be plenty of demand for ctl as well in the meantime you get a 9 dividend the next two are in electronic testing national instrument nati and keysight keys nati is the microsoft msft of the testing world they provide testing software for pre silicon chip development and every other type of electronic equipment keys is more closely associated with 5g electronics testing you are going to need special testing for this leading edge type equipment stuff is still being designed as we speak i did say that we are still in the development stage they are gonna need this akoustis akts is a filter manufacturer when you have what will likely be an order of magnitude more transmitting devices and this short frequency you are going to need filters to boost the signal to noise ratio we have the final piece of the 5g chips economy is adesto technologies corporation iots which makes special chips for edge computinn the â internet of thingsâ explosion that is supposed to happen with 5g they even have iots as their symbol the last name i want to mention is arista networks anet anet is a name i have been touting for a number of years they are the leader in â software based networksâ using white boxes and loading them with their software to manage networks sk telecom chose anet for their networking backbone for its 5g sk is south korea telecom south korea has the fastest most advanced internet on the planet last i checked perhaps they are no 2 now but the fact that they chose anet over cisco csco or juniper jnpr says it all as far as i am concerned my take i am not saying that you should go out and invest in all these names nor am i saying are they a trade i just think that it s time to get familiar with these names and it is very likely there will be some more immediate reason for demand before 5g really heats up study up be prepared as investments amt cci and vmi all give decent dividends so if you were looking for an investment angle and if 1 69 3 43 and 1 dividends along with already strong appreciation sounds interesting then perhaps 5g strengthens your investment thesis i already like tsm qrvo swks and all the other chip names in the first tier i just think that these other less followed names could offer interesting alpha at some point analyst corner jpmorgan chase co baxter international bax becton dickinson and bdx boston scientific bsx dexcom dxcm boosting price targets up 14 10 5 21 2 and 19 6 upside respectively all with overweight ratings my take obviously i like the dxcm call the bsx pt raise is interesting i need to look into that one micron technology mu was upgraded by analysts at susquehanna bancshares inc from a neutral rating to a positive rating on monday they now have a 85 00 price target on the stock up previously from 45 00 54 4 upside from the current price of 55 06 my take i like mu as well as amd and i expect them to continue to rise this pt is very strong clearly

the most interesting event in the sixth democratic primary debate on thursday was a tiff between elizabeth warren and pete buttigieg over fundraisers for high dollar donors for those who aren t already aware of the controversy here s a bit of background courtesy of ella nilsen at vox the biggest on stage fight of thursday s democratic debate between sen elizabeth warren and south bend indiana mayor pete buttigieg indeed one of the biggest fights we ve seen come out of any of the debates was about wine caves or rather it was a fight about high dollar fundraisers political access and who gets to have it a disagreement that has been simmering for weeks between the progressive massachusetts senator and the more moderate mayor erupted during the pbs newshour politico debate when warren brought up buttigieg s recent high dollar fundraiser at the hall rutherford wine caves in napa valley the vineyard s billionaire owners craig and kathryn hall recently hosted the pooled press fundraiser for buttigieg per a report from the associated press s brian slodysko said wine caves recently went viral when recode reporter teddy schleifer tweeted out photos of the buttigieg event showcasing the glittering chandelier made out of 1 500 swarovski crystals and as slodysko recently reported hall rutherford s wine caves produce bottles of cabernet sauvignon that go for as much as 900 both the warren and sanders campaigns have been making an example of the wine cave fundraiser as part of a broader argument about the corruption of big dollar fundraisers progressives argue that these sorts of events are inherently corrupting donors who attend them often expect special favors and the public perceives democracy to be corrupted as a result on the other side of the coin both joe biden and pete buttigieg have high dollar bundlers and hold expensive top dollar fundraisers defenders of this practice argue as obama adviser david axelrod did in post debate interviews that these are harmless activities and that politicians can hold these sorts of fundraisers without being corrupted by them the problem is that evidence shows this is not the case corporate executives and lobbyists can bundle maximum contributions of 2 800 to candidates that don t disavow their help quickly raising at least tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars during a primary often from colleagues whose industries spend millions of dollars on lobbying the office the candidate is seeking for candidates that receive a lot of wealthy donor support a backer might respond do high dollar bundlers really get improper influence over legislation and public policy from these early contributions the answer is clearly yes according to experts in the money in politics field dozens of academic studies published over the past ten years establish the correlation of politicians fundraising abilities and special interest influence over policy additionally the firsthand testimony of former or current elected officials lobbyists watchdogs and consultants attests to the causation of legalized bribery earlier this year leah stokes an assistant professor of political science at the university of california santa barbara found that 45 of senior congressional staff admit to changing their mind about a policy after meeting with a contributor stokes also drew attention from her research in climate policymaking to the findings of a 2015 study that senior policy makers were three to four times more likely to meet with a campaign contributor but let s say for the sake of silly argument that pete buttigieg and joe biden somehow aren t improperly influenced by big dollar dinners that they aren t afraid to take stronger policy positions don t deliver ambassadorships to attendees and don t grant more meetings to lobbyists connected to contributors a healthcare company executive named bill wehrle attended the infamous buttigieg wine cave fundraiser in napa valley for max donors and claims there was nothing wrong with it at all just regular non millionaires asking normal questions the problem is that as chris hayes documents extensively in his book twilight of the elites even when there is no overt quid pro quo corruption the social hobnobbing of wealthy individuals with mostly wealthy legislators blinds policymakers to the realities faced by normal people in the economy and harmfully skews their concerns toward those of the ultra privileged for instance the top 1 are far more concerned about deficits than normal people are despite the overwhelming evidence showing that deficits are not remotely as problematic as even most center left politicians seem to believe until very recently even major democratic politicians and fictional democratic presidents on tv seemed to believe that entitlement reform i e slashing social security and medicare was an important part of a healthy economic policy prescription and sought to achieve it via so called grand bargains with republicans this was not dictated by actual evidence and definitely not by the actual policy preferences of normal people but rather by the obsessions of wealthy donors wrongly concerned about correlations between deficits interest rates and inflation and their potential impacts on bloated stock portfolios the reality is that 2800 donors like mr wehrle should not in fact have any more opportunity to have personal conversations and ask burning policy questions of presidential candidates than anyone else giving 2800 to a presidential candidate should not guarantee you access to a powerful legislator under any circumstances much less under the swanky lights of a 1 500 swarovski crystal chandelier when 10 donors get a quick handshake from behind a rally barricade but 2 800 donors get to communicate their pressing concerns the result is that the candidate s worldview is strongly colored by the latter and not the former it s just human nature and that s before those donors start coming back round to ask for personal and policy favors later and the candidate has to decide just how much to grant them to keep them happy and so what you might ask so what if some well heeled socialite gets a caribbean ambassadorship or some special interest gets a small tax carveout so what if that s what it takes to defeat trump there are two answers to that first as much as trump s primary appeal to his base voters was racism sexism and intentional cruelty it is undeniable that the past 30 years of policy being tilted ever further to corporations and the wealthy provided an avenue for a rich grifter who claimed to be uncorruptible how laughable the reality may be to run against the supposed swamp of washington dc the perception of corruption alone works to the benefit of conservative populists second it s not at all clear that presidential candidates actually need to take this sort of money or at least not with these sorts of preconditions american presidential campaigns are the most visible and highest funded in the entire world and there is increasing evidence that the marginal utility of campaign spending decreases after certain amounts have already been spent in other words once you ve spent 700 million on a presidential election it s not at all clear that getting another 200 million actually does that much to win votes so if there are potential donors out there who will give 2800 if they can get invited to an intimate gathering but would otherwise refuse it s best to simply refuse them it is inherently corrupting for people with 2800 to drop on a presidential campaign to get any closer access to a candidate than anyone else our democracy suffers as result and giving them that access doesn t help dislodge trump it does the opposite
amid the drama surrounding impeachment both parties came together on one area of shared support spending enormous amounts of taxpayer dollars and adding to the 23 1 trillion national debt congress had little time to properly review fiscal 2020 spending bills which weighed in at more than 2 000 pages of clunky text the legislation contained a multitude of flaws including lobbyist driven handouts and a private pension bailout that could open the door for even larger bailouts down the line this is a business as usual conclusion to an irresponsible decade the degree to which washington has been reckless with the nation s finances is hard to comprehend since 2010 the federal government has spent 293 750 per household federal spending started the decade at an artificially high level due to the 2009 economic stimulus package there was a slight dip after the stimulus ended and the tea party wave ushered in a brief period of restraint in congress sadly this flicker of responsibility was short lived according to the office of management and budget and the congressional budget office federal spending totaled 37 6 trillion from 2010 through 2019 spread across 128 million households per the census bureau that yields 293 750 in spending for every household federal spending in 2019 was equivalent to the combined economies of 16 states in fiscal 2019 which ended sept 30 the federal government doled out 4 4 trillion the full scope of that much money is virtually impossible for the human mind to grasp one way to understand the sheer enormity is by comparing it to the size of state economies to match the amount that the federal government spent in fiscal 2019 one would need to add the total economic output of alabama arizona connecticut indiana iowa kentucky louisiana minnesota missouri nevada oklahoma oregon south carolina tennessee utah and wisconsin we should treat the notion that this level of federal activity is too small with deep skepticism spending per household is up 47 since 2000 the federal government spent 34 700 per household in 2019 which is serious money no matter what part of the country you live in is nearly 35 000 per household too much spending to put it in context we can go back to the last time the economy had a surging stock market and unemployment under 4 the year 2000 back then federal spending was about 2 49 trillion after adjusting for inflation divided by the number of households in 2000 the government spent just 23 600 per household in today s dollars that means that the spending increase from 2000 to now is a staggering 47 per household even after controlling for inflation in real terms the federal government is nearly half again larger than it was less than two decades ago the budget would balance today if spending had grown more modestly with the federal government growing so quickly it should come as no surprise that this year s deficit likely will exceed 1 trillion even if the economy remains strong some on the left counter that the high deficits are primarily the fault of the tax cuts and jobs act signed into law just before christmas 2017 and that the solution is funneling more taxpayer dollars to washington that assertion is incorrect once again a comparison to 2000 is instructive revenue per household adjusted for inflation was 26 750 in 2000 today it s roughly 27 000 even after the 2017 tax cut if federal spending had grown based only on population and inflation starting in 2000 today s trillion dollar deficit would turn into a surplus policymakers should recognize that the federal government has grown far too quickly since there is no way to undo the past they should take some prudent steps to return the country to sound financial footing first congress should trim excessive spending that has accumulated over the years the heritage foundation s blueprint for balance offers hundreds of policy ideas to save money by eliminating waste making social security and medicare sustainable and slashing perks for politically connected industries second congress should enact meaningful guardrails that rein in future spending growth one model for reform comes from switzerland where the budget balances over the course of a business cycle closer to home the taxpayer bill of rights approved by colorado voters in 1992 limits spending based on a combination of revenue inflation and population growth such rules would create headaches for washington by forcing big spending members of congress to make tough decisions rather than all of them getting what they want by abusing the national credit card yet this would merely force legislators to behave the way most families do every day namely pay for necessities first and only add extras if there s cash to spare congress is ending the decade on a note of fiscal irresponsibility but next year lawmakers have a fresh chance to do right by america
our representative in congress is supposed to listen to the working people of long island and put our interests first last week rep lee zeldin once again failed to live up to this duty as i travel throughout our district and talk to residents i hear again and again that the cost of living on long island is too high almost prohibitive we all know the stories of bright young people moving elsewhere after college or military service because they can t afford to come back home or because they can t afford to stay here and i have heard disheartening stories from retired people who raised their families on long island and cannot afford to remain in their homes because it s too expensive to live here the struggles of long islanders the many stories are why lee zeldin s complicity this week in refusing to join a bipartisan push to unwind a major tax increase on long island homeowners is so troubling until 2017 state and local taxes were fully deductible against federal income tax the salt deduction a relief from the burden of double taxation is especially important in middle class in areas with high property taxes was of significant help in making long island a more affordable place to live and raise a family in 2017 a republican congress imposed a limit on the salt deduction as part of a plan to reduce taxes on the most wealthy americans zeldin initially voted with his party to greenlight the plan and ultimately did little to fight it in ny 1 the average salt deduction before the 2017 law was 18 000 under the new law the salt deduction is capped at 10 000 year which means the average person in ny 1 is now required to pay federal taxes on 8 000 more of their income for most of those affected the itemized deduction including salt charitable expenses and mortgage interest is higher than the new standard deduction the gop tax bill effectively doubled the burden of state and local taxes in effect millionaires in states with low salt are being subsidized by middle income taxpayers in high salt states such as new york new jersey maryland and california the states most affected by the salt cap already pay more dollars to the federal government than we receive back low salt states typically receive more from the federal government than they pay new york is a donor state to the federal government the salt cap is basically a regional redistribution of wealth last week rep tom suozzi joined by 52 co sponsors including rep peter king and several other new york representatives including republicans introduced a bipartisan bill to help long islanders pay less in taxes by removing the salt cap to be paid for by restoring the tax rate to pre 2017 tax levels for people in the highest bracket the suozzi bill would reduce overall taxes for most middle class long island residents so the benefit would be substantial and those with lower salt obligations who benefited from the new tax law would not be adversely affected where was lee zeldin he refused to co sponsor the bill citing a need to protect the tax rate for people in the high bracket lee zeldin is more interested in protecting millionaires than ny 1 s middle class significantly the salt cap impacts more than just the taxes we pay by effectively raising our property taxes the salt cap lowers the value of local homes and depresses our economy because people have less to spend zeldin s refusal to participate in the suozzi bill works directly against the interests of those who live here in the 2018 midterm elections the two new york republicans who joined zeldin in the initial vote for the salt changes john faso and dan donovan were not reelected one can conclude that voters took notice and demanded their representatives work to unwind the salt cap and it makes zeldin s failure to co sponsor the suozzi bill that much more puzzling however if you look at zeldin s other recent votes we should not be surprised by his failure to stand up for his constituents a few weeks ago zeldin voted against blocking russia from readmission to the g 7 a vote where he was in the minority of his own party he also last week voted against a house bill to reduce prescription drug costs whose interest is zeldin serving certainly not the middle class residents of long island we need bipartisan leadership in congress rep lee zeldin is not providing it he is failing us perry gershon is a democratic party candidate for the 1st congressional district
but it was the third challenge that was perhaps the most difficult and the most insidious his government s ability to exercise self restraint on issues that could threaten its two core goals a rapidly growing india that could make a legitimate claim on the world stage as former us president abraham lincoln had put it nearly all men can stand adversity but if you want to test a man s character give him power but at the same time his new government was confronting three major challenges the first was a tepid economy whose weaknesses were threatening all other goals the second was a more uncertain international environment stemming from an unpredictable and polarised united states and a resurgent china when prime minster narendra modi came back to power he had many things going for him a renewed mandate an absolute majority in parliament a prostrate opposition and a level of personal popularity with the electorate that dwarfed any other leader to understand the nature of power go back to 1972 indira gandhi was at the peak of her power after the bangladesh war barely two years later despite the pokhran nuclear test she was facing an unprecedented challenge to her rule in the form of student protests and diminishing legitimacy what happened in such a short period of time first in the aftermath of the first oil shock in 1973 the economy went into a tailspin second when that happened she overestimated her own abilities and underestimated everyone else s exemplifying the ease with which one can slide across the fragile line separating confidence from certitude when lubricated by successive victories but perhaps most importantly she lost sight of addressing her main challenge the economy because the pursuit of other agendas clouded her focus there is a story in the mahabharata when dronacharya who was tasked with training the kaurav and pandav princes in the art of warfare holds an archery competition dronacharya placed a wooden bird on a branch and in a test of their archery skills asked his students to strike the eye of the wooden bird but before each student shot his arrow he asked each one of them what they saw all but one mentioned sundry other objects besides the wooden bird the tree its branches the sky other birds only arjun said i can only see the eye of the bird he won the competition because while everyone else s gaze wandered over multiple objects only arjun focused solely on the only goal that mattered the eye of the bird the weakness of the indian economy has been clear for a while all other goals of this or any government should have been set aside until its health was restored unless the economy can grow more rapidly india s aspirations will simply be delusions there are many reasons for the current slowdown including the toxic lending legacy inherited from the united progressive alliance government but that was known by 2014 since then the government indeed did take some decisions from demonetisation to goods and services tax from recapitalising banks to the insolvency and bankruptcy code and ujjwal discom assurance yojana uday on the power sector in all cases however the outcome has been sub par the result of ignoring the lesson dronacharya wanted the princes to learn unless you have an unwavering focus on the core task at hand through sustained high level political attention and bureaucratic engagement you will not achieve your goal whatever the merits or demerits of demonetisation per se it imposed significant cognitive costs on the leadership who spent substantial time and attention in its planning and implementation even as the gst was in the works the cognitive effects of multitasking can be severe also read cutting income tax is not the fix indian economy needs it s slashing gst rates it leads to tunneling a narrowing of attention and cognitive bandwidth and the resulting temporal scarcity leads leaders into a constant firefighting mode pushing them to focus largely on the most immediate but often low value tasks rather than those more meaningful tasks that require longer horizon strategic thinking with higher payoffs in this case firefighting the aftermath of demonetisation resulted in limited attention to the gst warnings to avoid a complex gst were given short shrift and undermined one of the government s signature achievements another example is the power sector the travails of india s power sector have continued for decades and various attempts beginning with the electricity act 2003 have had limited success the states have packed their regulatory commissions and undermined their autonomy while continuing to own and micromanage their distribution companies discoms in 2015 the central government unveiled a bail out package uday under which the state governments took over 75 of the debt of the distribution companies or discoms and serviced the remainder with lower interest bonds four years later power producers total outstanding dues owed by distribution companies has again ballooned to 81 010 crore in october 2019 the surprise was that the central government could not even get bharatiya janata party bjp ruled states to copy and implement a rare success in electricity sector reforms namely gujarat when pm modi was chief minister that model separated feeders which took electricity for irrigation from those that went to village settlements subsidising the former while villagers got unsubsidised but uninterrupted electricity supply in their homes the costs of subverting power reforms have been much more than financial they have blocked reforms in agriculture undermined the financial viability of generating companies added to the financial stresses of the banks that have extended credit to them and undermined the government s laudable goals on renewable energy energy security and its flagship make in india campaign financially stressed discoms have repeatedly blocked the open access promised to consumers and generators limiting supply by cheaper renewable energy sources and undermining the sector s growth moreover if investors had seen a strong predictable growth path in renewable energy without being subject to the vicissitudes of actions by discoms that could have led to more upstream investments in renewable energy manufacturing boosting the government s make in india campaign after his re election pm modi as reported by the hindustan times expressed his unhappiness about the civil service and its role in the implementation failures he is correct in his assessment that there is much that is wrong with the civil service but at the same time if loyalty trumps expertise in senior level appointments this should not be surprising there is a big gulf between a cowed bureaucracy and a competent bureaucracy and the former does not lead to the latter instead of an arjuna like focus on the critical task at hand the economy the government first tried to undermine the reputation of those who were asking hard questions then came up with dubious numbers and only when the reality is palpably manifest has it woken up from the media to courts from business to civil society criticism has been countered not by evidence and corrective actions but intimidation and fear when might is right learning will be wrong infallibility can be ascribed to the gods but not to man admitting mistakes and moving on would have made recovery faster also read gita gopinath asks india to stick to fiscal consolidation as q3 q4 recovery could be lower the government might feel that the external criticism of events in kashmir and the combination of the citizenship amendment act caa and national register of citizens nrc is par for the course whatever one s views on the revocation of article 370 the subsequent treatment of the population there is hardly a matter of pride to paraphrase an american gangster you can get far with a gun but much farther with a kind word and a gun but if that can be dismissed because it s a foreign saying why not listen to tulsidas for whom compassion was the root of religion and pride the root of sin if kashmiris are indian even if they are not seen to be deserving of tuslidas s compassion they are surely entitled to all the privileges of civil liberties that every indian is guaranteed under the constitution unless of course one believes that indians themselves are not for the government to ignore global unease about its actions would be to wilfully blind itself to its implications the caa and nrc have undermined the goodwill it so arduously built up with afghanistan and bangladesh and further west in the gulf yes china may be treating its uighur muslims worse but india hardly has comparable economic and political heft to silence its critics but even more the government is severely underestimating the implications of its actions on the one constituency it has been so assiduously trying to build relations with the indian diaspora no foreign leader has courted his country s diaspora as much as pm modi from australia to canada from the united kingdom to the us from dubai to israel but underneath the surface bonhomie there are deeper undercurrents that are flashing warning signs first the second generation in crucial countries like the us will have an increasingly dominant share among the voting population of the diaspora this group is much less engaged with india and more liberal than their parents the fact that only one of four members of the so called samosa caucus of indian americans in the us congress showed up for the howdy modi rally in houston and some have even been involved in calling for hearings on kashmir is a sign of times to come second the government s actions are dividing the diaspora across generational and denominational lines and instead of being a force multiplier for the country its divisiveness will be a handicap and third these actions provide needless grist to the mill to hardliners calling for a proposed referendum on khalistan that india s global image has suffered is without doubt one could argue that its implications are modest soft power s power is possibly much exaggerated that might be valid if instead india was growing its hard power but with defence spending as a share of gdp at a historic low and the amount spent on salaries and pensions at a record high india s hard power is falling further behind its global aspirations some of the resource limitations could have been redressed through meaningful defence reforms but there has been little of that as well a different approach would be to build serious domestic technological capabilities like israel or china the latter is today poised to be a leader in technologies that will fundamentally shape the future be it quantum computing or nanotechnology artificial intelligence or neurosciences the result of systematic resolve and core belief in the importance of science and technology not just for its economy but in its relentless drive to make itself a global power also read modi govt s adamant stand on citizenship will push india s neighbours into china s arms meanwhile in india the government wants to drive into the future by looking only in the rearview mirror giant statues and temples changes in citizenship laws or the nrc might be good politics but they will do little to deter a massive cyber attack or revive the stalled engine of economic growth indeed the cancellation of the summit with the japanese prime minister shinzo abe in guwahati is emblematic of the low priority to forward looking goals such as building the economy strengthening ties with key partners or giving priority to building the country s human capital with global interest rates at historic lows and poised to remain so for the foreseeable future india s huge market and burgeoning labor force should have made it the top destination for manufacturing investment but that is not occurring for a variety of reasons many foreign companies are shifting investments out of china and seeking alternative destinations india should have been the natural alternative but it cannot even compete with vietnam understanding why this is the case should have been an obsession if this moment was to be seized but closing one s mind to criticisms is not the ideal pathway to understanding india is at a crossroads it is severely underestimating its longer term challenges from the relentless pressures from climate change to burgeoning unemployment due to rapid technological change from an international environment that is becoming less hospitable to a giant neighbor that is racing ahead but the hardest challenge the government faces is itself can it exercise self restraint in the exercise of power or will its obsessions over its social agenda undermine the more pressing challenges and in failing to address it undermine the country itself it is time for the government to have arjun s focus and

inside camden s aquarium in september 2015 a packed crowd gathered for the unveiling of a new development plan renderings of office buildings shops and apartments that would rise up along the city s sparse delaware river shoreline on hand were democratic power broker george e norcross iii his political ally gov chris christie and his friend and onetime business partner william hankowsky ceo of liberty property trust the publicly traded firm that would oversee the project the vision would take off thanks to a 2013 tax break law cosponsored and championed by members of the norcross family and signed by christie there s momentum in the city hankowsky noted as he described the 700 million project on stage norcross who formerly co owned the inquirer with hankowsky and others had personally pitched liberty on the camden investment idea yet for a developer that added comcast s two towers to the philadelphia skyline across the river things in camden did not go as planned advertisement just a year later in 2016 the relationship between norcross and liberty soured to the point that norcross and his partners ultimately went with another builder for their 18 story office tower then in 2018 liberty announced it was taking a 26 million hit on the value of its camden venture yet if liberty s camden investment didn t pay off as expected it did help others cement control of valuable waterfront land chief among them was norcross according to an inquirer review of hundreds of pages of property records and previously undisclosed government documents norcross and his fellow investors holdings on the waterfront access to rental income from tax credit recipients and ability to tap into additional lending on those properties go beyond what has been previously reported norcross and his business partners now own three properties inside liberty s original development as well as two others nearby totaling about 10 acres the portfolio came together between 2016 and 2018 in all projects norcross has invested in along the waterfront have benefited from nearly 290 million in tax credits and other incentives from the state multiple public agencies were involved in the transactions consider the three acre parking lot across the street from the victor pub both the delaware river port authority and camden redevelopment agency held interests in the land which was appraised at 2 3 million in 2015 public officials agreed to sell it to liberty for 800 000 after the sale liberty gave norcross and his business partners an option to buy the property which they eventually did for 350 000 or 15 cents on the dollar of the appraised value when it was held by public agencies and while norcross and his partners aren t allowed to build on the parking lot for five years they could develop it by 2023 if they choose the series of transactions also underscores the influence and reach of the mount laurel based law firm parker mccay led by george norcross brother philip the firm which helped write the tax credit law also represented liberty as it sought government approvals for its project and represented george norcross investor group in its dealings with liberty norcross has long pitched himself as the biggest cheerleader for camden the city where he was born and set up his first business out of a basement office he made his name in business as a successful insurance executive and built a powerful political machine in south jersey as chairman of cooper health system he turned a struggling hospital network into an economic engine for the region over the last year however the tax credit program and projects tied to george norcross have come under scrutiny from a state task force federal prosecutors in philadelphia are also conducting a criminal investigation in connection with the incentive program the inquirer has reported one area of interest is a real estate transaction involving the sale of camden s l3 office complex in which cooper health owns a stake the state owned parcel was sold to private developers for 20 million under its appraised value the inquirer found acres of investment norcross is suing new jersey gov phil murphy over the task force inquiry calling it a political hit job some of norcross allies see him as an indispensable asset who helped overhaul the city s police department improve schools and attract unprecedented private investment to encourage investment in camden norcoss has said he needed to lead by example and he has the three acre parking lot sits next to the 18 story tower known as triad1828 centre built for norcross insurance brokerage conner strong buckelew and two other companies with the award of 245 million in state tax credits adjacent to the building there s a one acre parking lot which the partners bought for 1 from liberty just steps from the tower norcross lives in the 156 unit apartment complex he and his partners built 11 cooper in part with 18 million in state grants walk a couple of blocks south along the waterfront toward the adventure aquarium and there s the ferry terminal building an office building norcross and fellow investors bought in 2016 for 16 5 million half of the building s square footage is now leased by tenants that won tax breaks to cover their rent with new leases in place the investors were able to take out a 7 6 million second mortgage on the property the three acre parking lot was also listed as collateral on the loan each of the buildings has a local property tax abatement on the valuable waterfront land not everything the investors tried worked out their control over another parking lot led to pushback from a state agency the state s economic development authority spent 555 000 to build a parking lot next to the ferry terminal building and the eda leased the lot to the camden parking authority for public access to the waterfront and events at the nearby bb t pavilion but the parking authority ended up leasing it to the norcross group starting in june 2018 records show that arrangement continued into this year when an eda audit found the lot wasn t being used for waterfront events as its agreement with the camden parking authority required at eda s direction the parking authority eventually terminated the lease with the norcross group but those investors had more success working with liberty when the group bought the ferry terminal building the investors inherited a long term parking lease on land that liberty would soon acquire for the project those new owners of the ferry terminal building agreed to give up the lease set to expire in 2021 and in return they got ownership of a multimillion dollar piece of property known as parking lot nine records show william sasso an attorney for the investors said they accepted parking on a lot that was farther away from the ferry terminal building the investors also spent 450 000 on repaving and environmental issues he said some of the parking spaces are reserved for victor pub patrons the investor group had a parking lot that was necessary to liberty s development and they did a swap for lot nine said sasso chairman of the philadelphia law firm stradley ronon he added the use of the lot that they were giving up was just much more beneficial to the operation of the building than the one that they got liberty said the transactions it participated in were vital to the waterfront development project while assembling the land and doing due diligence we learned of numerous potential obstacles the resolution of which was necessary for the project to proceed spokesperson jeanne leonard said in a statement the company did not agree to an interview for this story making parking available for the norcross investor group was complex and heavily negotiated leonard said it was not just a simple land sale for 350 000 the drpa said it received adequate compensation for its share of the property the cra said that its own interest in the parking lot did not have monetary value and that it simply shifted its rights from the parking lot to the larger liberty development in the waterfront investments norcross has partnered with executives from the logistics firm nfi including the family of ceo sidney brown and the michaels organization a developer the partners have personally invested more than 300 million in the development boom but for now they are underwater on those investments norcross told the state senate in november nothing would have occurred in the city without the tax incentives norcross testified since the law was passed new jersey has approved about 1 6 billion in tax credits for companies to move to camden one of the state s poorest cities the question i ask whenever i get people yelling at me in different places i say ok fine you don t like what george norcross is doing what s your plan said attorney william tambussi who represents norcross company what s plan b an ill fated tram from camden to philly years before the three acre parking lot ended up with norcross it was linked to another development project ill fated plans for a tram connecting camden to philadelphia while the delaware river port authority sank 16 million into the concept it would never be built earning criticism as a government boondoggle by 2016 the drpa had already abandoned the tram project but it still loomed over liberty s plans an aerial easement for the tram crossed a swath of the new development site the company also says it needed the parking lot known as parking lot nine to provide the critical substitute parking for the ferry terminal building in march 2016 drpa records show the agency s board approved the start of negotiations to sell liberty the parking lot and the air rights what happened next shows how a development project heralded as a catalyst for change in camden also helped the de facto political boss of south jersey get a bargain deal on land down the line appraisals commissioned by the port authority in 2015 reflected the fact that if the drpa didn t finish the tram project by 2026 then the camden redevelopment agency was supposed to regain ownership of the parking lot we do not believe that any significant building will be developed on the site unless a buyer also purchases the reversionary interest owned by cra an appraiser for valbridge property advisors wrote in his report to the drpa the appraisal valued parking lot nine at 2 3 million based on comparable land sales but the camden redevelopment agency did not sell its rights to parking lot nine rather on april 13 2016 the cra simply voted to terminate its interest in the property in advance of the vote agency officials received drafts of the resolutions including language that the cra would give up its reversionary interest from a parker mccay attorney the firm led by philip norcross was representing liberty at the time attached are the resolutions for the cra related to the liberty project that we were asked to have the cra approve this month attorney kevin sheehan wrote in an april 4 2016 email to agency officials that same month on april 15 philip norcross had a call scheduled with the drpa s deputy general counsel stephen holden and drpa commissioner jeff nash to discuss liberty property trust according to a drpa calendar entry obtained by the inquirer through a records request drpa chief executive officer john hanson now says that holden has no recollection of the call he has no notes on it in any of his personal notes hanson said in an interview there s nothing that came out of that call as far as i can tell that in any way impacted the negotiations nash also told the inquirer he didn t remember the call representatives for philip norcross and his law firm would not comment for this story hanson added that he had a very vague recollection about an occasion in which philip norcross called him and asked for any information that was in the public record about what we were doing with lot nine to the best of my knowledge we never negotiated with phil hanson said he was never involved in any way liberty says the drpa was aware the parking lot might be used by the norcross investor group hanson disputed that saying he wasn t aware of the investor group until after the agency had closed on the sale and that he didn t know george norcross was one of the principals all the parties say resolving the tram rights and selling the parking lot involved a complex series of transactions one of the drpa s appraisals valued the air rights for the tram at 4 2 million and put the authority s share at 1 45 million the appraisal for parking lot nine valued the drpa s interest in the lot at 800 000 the total was 2 25 million ultimately liberty paid the drpa 1 3 million 800 000 for the parking lot and 500 000 to officially kill the tram project and the air rights in addition liberty said the cra and drpa were keenly aware that liberty would be expending tens of millions of dollars for improvements to the roads sidewalks utilities and other infrastructure on the waterfront hanson said the parking lot was a nuisance and the drpa s rights to the property were tenuous the drpa got full value for the property as well as indemnification for potential environmental issues he said besides liberty no other entity had expressed interest in buying the property since hanson started at the drpa in 2004 he said as for the aerial easement hanson said drpa got as much as it could he also said that for the time being the authority was relieved of obligations to pay for the removal of tram structures in the river the sale helped drpa get out of the economic development business he said the authority maintains four bridges between pennsylvania and new jersey and runs the patco commuter line hanson could not cite any specific policies that drpa follows for selling land it s not a very common thing the drpa gets involved in he said and when we do when it happens it s usually because somebody approaches us we re not really actively working the economic development business and we just try to get fair market value for it that s the approach in this case hanson said the drpa s options for selling the property also would have been limited because the land was tied to redevelopment obligations for the tram for its part the camden redevelopment agency received no financial compensation in the deal the agency said it was not a party to the sale of parking lot nine and had no reason to commission its own appraisal the agency which draws funding from grants project management fees rental income and land sales has operated at a loss every year from 2014 to 2018 according to its audited financial statements the cra said its reversionary interest in the property was meant to gain assurance that the tram would be built any implication that the cra directly or indirectly gave away conveyed or transferred property rights at less than fair market value is fundamentally inaccurate mark p asselta the agency s general counsel and a partner at the south jersey firm brown connery said in a statement brown connery partner william tambussi has long represented norcross personally including in the lawsuit against gov murphy tambussi said the firm has not represented any norcross entities in matters before the camden redevelopment agency as the cra and drpa negotiated an end to the tram rights in 2016 emails show that asselta could not participate because of a conflict asselta now says that was because the law firm also does work for the drpa perpetual parking in september 2016 george norcross and his partners acquired the 100 000 square foot ferry terminal building for 16 5 million built in 2007 the four story office complex on the river s edge was the first privately financed building completed in camden in decades the ferry terminal had a lease until 2021 for parking on land that liberty was set to acquire for the big development liberty said the new owners also had a perpetual right to extend the lease but a 2005 developer agreement casts doubt on that assertion showing the ferry terminal could use the land as parking for up to 15 years but that the site had to be developed for a higher and better purpose such as residential retail and hotel projects or the camden redevelopment agency could purchase the land liberty said it couldn t recall whether it was aware of the 2005 agreement though it was referenced in a 2017 contract between liberty and the norcross partners the inquirer found in any event we believed that the parking rights of the ferry terminal building were a material impediment to the camden waterfront project the liberty spokesperson said once liberty purchased the lot from the drpa in early december 2016 the company gave the norcross group a perpetual lease on the site as well as an option to buy it according to property records when liberty gave the perpetual lease to the norcross group philip norcross signed paperwork on behalf of his brother and the partners during this same period the parker mccay law firm where philip norcross serves as ceo was also representing liberty on matters related to waterfront development asked about a possible conflict of interest a liberty spokesperson said we do not wish to comment on the confidential and privileged arrangements with our law firms norcross on liberty i think i m at the end george norcross and william hankowsky s friendship began in camden in the 1970s when hankowsky was director of community development and norcross worked for the city but during the fall of 2016 the relationship between their firms started to fray over a central piece of the waterfront development the office tower where norcross and his business partners wanted to relocate their companies using tax credits one point of contention were the rights held by the developer carl dranoff who built the victor lofts apartment building in camden in the 2000s dranoff s easement restricted how high someone could build on the waterfront and liberty had been working on a deal with him to terminate the rights in october 2016 liberty s general counsel told philip norcross that liberty had been negotiating with dranoff for months and was not seeking input from the norcross camp philip forwarded the message to george they don t view us as party with dranoff that says it all i think i m at the end george norcross wrote to his brother and business partners in an oct 17 2016 email a copy of which was provided to the inquirer by norcross lawyers norcross told lawmakers last month that he and liberty also clashed over the cost of the building norcross and his partners hoped to get tax credits for the project but they d need to invest their own money up front to build the tower in early december 2016 liberty trumpeted a milestone the company had finished the 15 month process of assembling land and development rights for the waterfront project including the dranoff easement now the company was ready to start building its first project a new headquarters for american water negotiations with norcross and his business partners however were another matter by late december liberty was no longer planning to build the office tower leaving the two sides to settle on a payment for land and infrastructure costs a liberty spokesperson confirmed on dec 30 liberty s general counsel herman fala rejected a 4 million offer we have worked diligently and in good faith in an effort to come to mutually acceptable terms with you over the past several weeks fala wrote to philip norcross copying hankowsky we feel that our price for a simple discounted land sale was more than generous considering our directs costs on this lot sidney brown one of norcross partners expressed bewilderment at the standoff i see that we went up 1m correct are we 2m apart are they willing to take a potential loss of 20m or 2m doesn t make sense norcoss representatives would not say what the numbers referred to but george norcross indicated he d had enough i m done he said in an email to his partners and his brother phil can we build on any land around ferry terminal or any other eda or city owned land philip norcross replied the next morning new year s eve saying his law firm would notify the eda to table tax credit application due to economics and inability to reach deal with liberty separately we will inventory all land along waterfront that may be suitable for office building and deck yet in the end norcross office tower remained within liberty s waterfront site norcross and his partners revised their tax credit applications using another builder joseph jingoli son and won approval for 245 million worth of incentives in march 2017 the tax credits are granted over 10 years and companies can use them to offset their tax bills or sell the credits for cash according to the investors june 2017 contract with liberty norcross and his partners paid 3 million for their parcel of land and 3 95 million for infrastructure costs the contract also addressed a parcel next to the tower site liberty had a year to find a buyer for the land and a project in which case liberty would give the norcross group a 50 cut of the deal no less than 1 5 million if liberty didn t find a buyer it would sell the lot to the norcross group for 1 to be used for parking and in the summer of 2018 that s what happened in july 2018 hankowsky told investors that his firm was exiting the camden development because some potential buyers had decided not to proceed with projects or chose other sites he also noted that the tax credit program was set to expire the following year for norcross and his partners however the tax credit program continued to pay off the ferry terminal building under their ownership welcomed two new tenants both won tax credit packages under the 2013 incentive law to facilitate their moves to camden united states cold storage a transportation logistics company was granted a 9 79 million tax credit award and its application indicates that it would pay 867 450 a year in rent based on a rate of 30 per square foot corporate synergies an employee benefits brokerage won incentives worth 15 6 million combined the two companies leased more than half of the ferry terminal building s 100 000 square feet in december 2018 the norcross investor group took out an additional 7 6 million mortgage on the property an attorney for the business partners dismissed the suggestion that norcross benefited from the tax credit law cosponsored by one of his brothers u s rep donald norcross who was then a state lawmaker and written in part by philip norcross law firm some people would like to cast a nefarious light on that by saying three brothers were in it for their own personal gain but right now it s at their own personal loss tambussi said citing negative coverage in the news media and a state task force investigation into the economic development program tambussi said and frankly it s a personal toll on each and every one of them he added that george norcross who is 63 wouldn t see a return on his investments until he s in his 70s time may not allow him to achieve a financial benefit that others might otherwise expect for this type of a deal tambussi said attorney william sasso put it this way you ve got to put it in context he didn t just come out of the blue and say i m gonna make money and benefit financially from camden his whole life has been camden deserves to be turned around and i m going to help do it think about all the good he s done which i think is incredible
swedish climate activist greta thunberg speaks at a protest outside the white house in washington in september the climate protests led by thunberg and movie star jane fonda signal that there is a generational coalition forming to push for action on all fronts afp as 2019 fade the world s financial markets are reaching record high celebrating in truth a sigh of relief that britain has final closure on brexit through a thumping victory for boris johnson and the non announcement of a us china trade truce that seems to postpone more intractable problems to the future the s p 500 index is up more than 27 per cent this year the strongest annual gain since 2013 a truce is not a treaty and the brexit divorce are only the beginnings of a long journey but 2019 has indeed been an eventful and stressful year the hottest on record with outbreaks of protests from santiago chile to hong kong this was a year of intense politicking but there are trends emerging the conservative victory in britain over labour was a clear sign that leadership matters labour party leader jeremy corbyn was a weak 1970s style socialist who had little new ideas to offer as an alternative to the clear choice of brexit led by boris johnson who saw that the british simply want an end to three years of stressful confusion similarly even though us democrats are pushing to impeach president donald trump there is no chance that the impeachment trial will pass through the republican controlled senate and with fifteen democratic presidential candidates still in the field the chances that trump will be re elected in 2020 looks better than ever from his supporters point of view he is one leader who has delivered on his electoral promises rightly or wrongly personal defects aside and the us economy is still the growing economy with fastest job creation in the advanced world while the left dithers the right acts often with power in mind in europe much will depend on how the emerging leadership in the eu will tackle its many challenges french president emmanuel macron was hinting more strongly when he called nato brain death now that britain has left the union the key axis of european leadership is between france and germany will germany loosen her fiscal purse strings by reflating to boost european growth and revive the southern european economies especially italy spain and others if not spain is struggling with catalan s call for independence while the stagnant italian has led to very toxic populist politics but the deeper existential threat facing europe is immigration as long as climate change stresses the north africa and middle east economies through droughts worsened by civil strife and failing governments people will move to cooler climates and richer economies in the north the aging economies in europe need new labour to stimulate growth but can they peacefully assimilate serious cultural ethnic language and religious differences many scandinavian countries are liberal in approach and welcoming to immigration in policy but even they recognise that their schools and urban services are stretched to breaking point trying to deal with huge gaps in language and training skills of the new arrivals in asia no country has escaped the us china trade war with growth in trade slowing and investments in limbo as the outlook becomes blurry china is slowing what the asia supply chain fears most is the decoupling in standards and markets which means that they have to re tool with loss of economies of scale and market share political tensions have flared in south asia between india and pakistan on kashmir and within india on the question of citizenship in assam protests everywhere have flared erupting from serious issues of identity and national security in latin america and africa growing population facing less jobs and climate change are over flowing to populist anger unemployment remains high in a world of slower growth and declines in trade and inward foreign investment inflation in argentina has already reached 50 per cent per annum mexican growth is in negative territory and both nigeria and south africa struggle with rising youth unemployment and unrest toxic politics is only the reflection of the boiling problem of climate warming on top of disruptive technology and inequality true politics was what stopped the madrid un conference of parties cop25 from taking firm collective action before the meeting un secretary general antonio guterres asked do we really want to be remembered as the generation that buried its head in the sand at the end of the meeting he admitted he was disappointed the mindset is still like boiling frogs waiting for someone else to jump first the bad news is that the world is already 1 1c warmer than it was at the onset of the industrial revolution and it is already having a significant impact on the world and on people s lives and if current trends persist then global temperatures can be expected to rise by 3 2 to 3 9c this century which would bring wide ranging and destructive climate impacts but these averages hide the fact that in many parts of the world extreme variations in weather would already make them uninhabitable for humans livestock or growing of plant food the good news is that more and more companies are waking up to climate change as more opportunity than threats to profits certainly asset managers with more than 34 trillion in assets under management are pushing governments to price carbon reduce fossil fuel subsidies and phase out coal based power plants the climate protests led by swedish teenager greta thunberg and movie star jane fonda signal that there is a generational coalition forming to push for action on all fronts ironically having discovered quantitative easing by central banks there is no shortage of finance to take action on climate change only no one has the guts to direct resource allocation to invest in green infrastructure at zero and negative interest rates money is being shoved to rich borrowers who do not need the money not to where our existence is at stake will 2020 be a year of clear vision or another 365 days of muddling through we are still wearing cold war glasses of 1960s vintage tackling the quantum problems of the 21st century get your eyes checked in 2020 andrew sheng writes on

since october of last year a new law has passed in brazil whereby the fee for obtaining a permanent residency was lowered from us 200 000 to us 50 000 you can obtain a permanent residency by investing in a business for example it could be in real estate such a rental apartment or it could be in an investment in a fish farm which is a fast growing industry in brazil it is important to realize that the cost of living in brazil and especially in the northeast part of the country is significantly lower than europe the united states or canada also the cost of living in the brazilian northeast is much lower than in cities in the south of brazil like rio de janeiro or são paulo it is worth mentioning that when you transfer the money legally from your bank through the central bank of brazil banco central to your own bank account in brazil the money remains yours and stays with you at your disposal at all times and under your sole control comparison to central america residency investor programs there simply is no comparison central american countries like costa rica charge us 50 000 to obtain a second residency but the investment goes to government tree planting projects that you have no control over and it is doubtful that you will ever receive a penny of profit consider it a donation you can choose your own investment if you buy an apartment or any other real property it will be registered in your name and the system of registration in brazil is 100 fool proof and has been operating for many years successfully for overseas investors holiday apartment it might be an excellent idea for you to invest your money in a holiday apartment where you could spend your vacations in brazil in fortaleza for example where i live you can enjoy the 5 star shopping center iguatemi and the largest water park in south america beach park your apartment can be managed while you are not here and at your request it can be rented for shorter or longer periods as you wish any

be made for their formation q then what is the next step a the brazilian company must be formed and the permanent visa applied for again the payment must be made for this service and the personal documentation for the permanent visa applicant must be provided brazilian immigration laws the difference between normative resolution 60 and normative resolution 62 in normative resolution 62 it is more rigid as it is for foreign companies who want to form a subsidiary and have a foreign administrator this in the mind of the brazilian government is like taking food away from the table of brazilians as it does not provide a job for a brazilian administrator normative resolution 60 is for providing a work permit for a foreigner therefore it is more strict and in 2 years the brazilian company must demonstrate that it has provided employment for 10 brazilians in normative resolution 60 it is easier as it is not providing a work permit for a foreigner in other words investors only own the brazilian company but do not work there the investor is allowed to manage his employees if there are any employees this law is less strict and only after 5 years does the investor have to prove that there are 10 brazilian employees reality many clients are simply after a brazilian citizenship which can be acquired after 4 years of residency and are not interested in renewing the permanent visa so the reality is that the us 50 000 does not have to be spent at all but can sit in the brazilian company bank account collecting interest a brazilian company does have to be formed and the bank account of that brazilian company must be registered with the central bank of brazil the us 50 000 must pass through the central bank into the investor s brazilian company bank account

as we ve seen recently the threats to houses of worship and other religious community sites are increasing and we must do everything we can to protect them said sen rob portman r ohio by jns the u s senate passed a 1 37 trillion spending bill on thursday that included the annual 3 3 billion in security assistance to israel it also addressed other jewish and israel related priorities the final tally also the last one of the decade was 81 11 the legislation now goes to u s president donald trump who is expected to sign it into law a whopping 500 million was allocated towards u s israel missile defense cooperation the bill also extended the u s defense department s authority to stockpile weapons in israel for two years it also indicated backing for use of the strategic defense acquisition fund to transfer precision guided munitions and related defense articles and services to reserve stocks for israel the legislation allows the president to withhold 5 percent of u s assistance towards any u n agency that acts against the interests of the united states or a u s ally including israel it included new reporting requirements related to the u n interim force in lebanon unifil and expressed concern regarding hezbollah s violations of u n security council resolution 1701 no u s funding will go to the palestinian authority since the united states cut aid to the p a in march 2018 and under the taylor force act the p a s program of rewarding terrorists and their families is not being supported however the bill included a bipartisan agreement on the anti terrorism clarification act atca that will allow the u s agency for international development usaid to resume its operations in the west bank and gaza usaid ceased projects in those areas earlier this year in accordance with atca which provides protections for american victims of international terrorism moreover 75 million each was allocated for palestinian security services and civilian and humanitarian assistance up to 30 million was allocated to boost reconciliation programs for israelis and palestinians not included was u s funding for the u n human rights council which the united states withdrew from in june 2018 the legislation also did not include the 175 million requested by the trump administration for economic assistance to the palestinians as part of its mideast peace plan the economic part which was introduced at the bahrain summit in june the rejection was solely due to budgetary considerations reported haaretz citing a source close to the budget negotiations the bill consisted of 90 million for the u s department of homeland security s nonprofit security grant program nsgp that seeks to protect nonprofit institutions including synagogues this is a 50 percent increase over last year s 60 million funding resources to secure their facilities sen rob portman r ohio pushed this part of the measure i am pleased that the senate passed the final fy 2020 funding bill which includes 90 million for nonprofit security grants so that synagogues religious and cultural facilities and other nonprofits across our country that are at a high risk of a terrorist attack have access to the resources they need to secure their facilities he said in a statement as we ve seen recently the threats to houses of worship and other religious community sites are increasing and we must do everything we can to protect them in ohio and across our country the nsgp provides grants of up to 100 000 each to nonprofits at risk of terrorist attacks so they may improve building security by acquiring and installing items ranging from fences lighting and video surveillance to metal detectors and blast resistant doors locks and windows funding may also be used to train staff and pay for contracted security personnel the nsgp has become more critical for the jewish community in the aftermath of the oct 27 2018 mass shooting at the tree of life or l simcha synagogue in pittsburgh where 11 jewish worshippers were killed and six months later the april 27 shooting at chabad of poway in southern california where one woman was killed and three others injured the bill expressed support for collaboration between israel greece and cyprus especially in the energy sector the east med pipeline will connect israel and the european union u s secretary of state mike pompeo has been involved in the talks between the three allies meeting with the leaders of the three countries back in march finally around 60 39 million was allocated for the u s holocaust memorial museum through 2022
jeffrey frankel three years ago donald trump s victory in the united states presidential election triggered a search for explanations of what is still a shocking outcome one immediately came to dominate his democratic opponents had been insufficiently aware of the problem of income inequality or had neglected to propose effective solutions that is presumably the logic behind the radical proposals to tackle inequality coming from some of the leading candidates for the 2020 democratic presidential nomination sen elizabeth warren for example has proposed an annual tax originally of 2 percent but now up to 6 percent on the richest americans wealth the problem with the wealth tax is not that it is radical like many economists i would support a high carbon tax also a radical policy but the most economically efficient way to respond to the global problem of climate change a wealth tax however simply is not the most efficient way to address the problem of inequality in fact there are at least six practical policy changes that could make the us tax system more progressive they have all been proposed by mainstream democrats such as president barack obama who also advanced the patient protection and affordable care act and other inequality reducing policies but in most cases were blocked by republicans these proposals are practical in two senses for starters if adopted they would be more enforceable than a wealth tax and less likely to have costly unintended side effects moreover studies of recent us congressional elections have found that the traditional median voter approach still holds although radical left economic proposals do attract new voters on the left they repel substantially more voters on the right that suggests us political candidates are more likely to get elected by proposing moderate policies than by advocating radical measures the first policy proposal would be to reinforce the estate tax the us might begin by restoring the tax on all estates worth say 5 million more important however is to eliminate the step up of the valuation of the assets in the estate which currently allows generations to pass on capital gains without ever paying tax on them it would be far easier for the internal revenue service to place a dollar value on assets on a once a lifetime basis that is on the estate before it passes to the heirs than to try to do so every year under a wealth tax and doing this would accomplish the same objective as the wealth tax putting some friction into the intergenerational accumulation of dynastic wealth that as it stands never gets taxed second policymakers should give the irs the resources it needs to collect taxes that are owed natasha sarin and larry summers recently noted that the irs currently fails to collect nearly 15 percent of total tax liabilities primarily to the benefit of those with high incomes it is impossible to close the gap completely but giving the irs more resources sarin and summers argue would have a high benefit cost ratio and generate more than 1 trillion in net additional revenue over the next decade third expanding the earned income tax credit would help to make work pay incentives do matter but it is those americans trying to lift themselves out of poverty and up into the middle class not the rich who often face the steepest effective marginal tax rate taking lost benefits into account extending the eitc to more households would enlarge the economic pie while also sharing it more equally thereby enhancing both efficiency and equity fourth the payroll tax should be made more progressive the us social security system is not as progressive as many think even workers who don t earn enough to pay federal income tax must nonetheless pay a payroll tax the threshold for this tax should be raised with the lost revenue recouped by raising the ceiling currently 118 500 in wages above which americans no longer pay it fifth the us government also should make the income tax more progressive for example by cutting the gap between the tax rates on investment income and wages and clearly it should abolish the carried interest loophole finally the us congress should revisit the december 2017 corporate tax cut to make it revenue neutral there were good arguments for reducing the us corporate tax rate to bring it closer to that of other countries but all republican senators voted for the tax cut in the declared belief that it would boost income growth so much as to be revenue neutral unsurprisingly this has not happened firms turned their windfalls over to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks rather than investing in capital as intended as a result revenue fell us firms now pay virtually the lowest level of tax as a percentage of gdp among major advanced economies the solution is not to limit firms from buying back their shares as sens bernie sanders another leading democratic presidential contender and chuck schumer have proposed rather the key is to close loopholes in order to bring overall corporate tax revenue back to its pre reform level the biggest potential revenue generator is to curtail the tax deductibility of interest payments another proposal that could be good for both gdp and income distribution if there is to be a successor to the 2007 2009 financial crisis it is now more likely to come from an excess of corporate debt especially of the covenant lite variety than from too much housing debt curtailing the interest rate deduction could motivate firms to strengthen their financing structure fortunately few of the democratic presidential candidates have committed themselves irrevocably to extreme policies it is not too late for warren or others to adopt further proposals to address inequality that are more practical than the wealth tax and would naturally precede it jeffrey frankel is professor of capital formation and growth at harvard university ed
the prospect of having medicaid coverage gives the millers hope for their future angela miller intends to return to school and work once she s able to treat her medical conditions but she said those fears from before still haven t disappeared even though she has already signed up and been approved for medicaid she is worried the legislature might tweak medicaid in a way that will prevent her from being covered it angers me because i feel like well i voted for this most of us in idaho did she said it s really sad to know that your vote is supposed to count and your voice is supposed to count but at the end of the day it might not medical system in need of change after waiting for years for the legislature to come to some consensus on medicaid expansion voters here took matters into their own hands they were bolstered by groups called close the gap idaho and reclaim idaho which launched sweeping campaigns to show how the state s legislative indecision had affected the working poor many of whom forgo medical care until it s an emergency not having to wait until the last minute to receive medical care would be life changing many who recently signed up said it could also possibly afford them new career opportunities finding work that can pay close enough to what i make now without destroying my body is impossible said stuart foster who suffers extreme back pain due to fibromyalgia and a birth defect but still works as a roofer to help pay for medical bills i have experience in construction medicaid makes it easier to change jobs and if i can do that it ll change my quality of life for sure but many of the republicans who are skeptical of the cost have also said the campaigns were misleading and maintain idaho s 18 million catastrophic health care fund as well as the counties indigent care fund were sufficient to defray the costs of people who went to the emergency room for life or death care blanksma told nbc news that her particular issue with medicaid expansion and one shared by many of her colleagues is that 15 000 of the 91 000 who are now eligible for medicaid would lose their tax credit for private health insurance and be moved to medicaid that has led to another waiver to expansion that would provide people a similar tax credit to buy insurance on the idaho exchange you have these 15 000 people who had good insurance decent insurance and now they re kicked off to government assistance blanksma said so yeah jan 1 they re going to get a medicaid card in the mail and hopefully they ve been paying attention and looking at their letters so that they know that they re going medicaid but other republicans said that for those 15 000 it s a difference without much distinction those individuals are being provided federal dollars through a tax credit to buy that insurance and medicaid is federal dollars spent more effectively i find the argument strange because they don t want people to go onto a government program but they want their subsidized government program said sen fred martin the republican chair of the health and welfare committee in the idaho senate i guess it s private insurance paid for by the government but it s high deductibles and not very good where medicaid would be a better option that s what turner is hoping for after suffering side splitting pain for days she went to the emergency room where the doctor told her that she would need immediate surgery to remove a large kidney stone turner could die if she didn t act immediately her doctor said missy turner waits for her car to warm up in pocatello idaho janie osborne for nbc news that procedure cost 25 000 which she s still paying off and that debt came on top of the 53 000 she faced after having an emergency surgery to remove her gallbladder another life and death procedure she delayed for fear of the cost the state fund reduced her total bill for both procedures to about 18 000 the story of her health issues didn t just end there doctors told her she needs annual checkups with x rays and cat scans to make sure no kidney stones have formed trouble is turner can t afford the scans which can run as much as 3 000 without insurance she also can t afford the 400 to 500 that it costs to get an x ray but she said her doctor said she had no choice for me i m looking at kidney failure dialysis death and i don t want to die she said tears forming in her eyes as she sat inside the public library before her shift i d do anything to avoid that but it can happen pretty quickly for me with no warning things just seem so backwards medicaid expansion in idaho will likely change life for doctors nurses physicians assistants and medical workers as well it will also affect the future of rural hospitals and small clinics that serve this scenic western state that has only 22 people per square mile on average the clinic in challis has no permanent doctor and the nearest hospital is 56 miles away the largest town in the 4 500 square mile custer county it is home to rugged mountains sprawling plains and about 1 100 people patients arrive early at the challis area health center janie osborne for nbc news steve rembelski the executive director of the challis area health center said that medicaid expansion will save the clinic money in multiple ways first it provides coverage to nearly 200 more people in the area according to the idaho department of health and welfare which would mean they could receive reimbursement for the services they provide to those formerly uninsured patients rembelski estimated it could add as much as 25 000 to their annual budget which he said could help hire another nurse or buy a piece of equipment but the fact that people would come to them for preventive care rather than in cases of emergency would also likely limit the number of life flight helicopter rides to far flung hospitals each flight costs the clinic 45 000 the people that are eligible are people that aren t getting any kind of preventative maintenance rembelski said and so ultimately we know what that costs the system when they come in and crash and in this particular area if somebody comes in and is a time sensitive emergency they may require a helicopter ride out it s a matter of do you want controlled costs or uncontrolled costs he added costs are top of mind for idaho s medical system and medical groups including the idaho hospital association the idaho academy of family physicians and the idaho primary care association all expressed their support for expansion they believe it will not only benefit idaho s working poor but also bring down medical costs for the provider and the patient as well as save financially vulnerable clinics and hospitals expansion can have a real impact after examining hospital closures and their financial performance between 2008 and 2016 a 2018 health affairs study concluded that the aca s medicaid expansion improved hospital financial performance and substantially lower likelihoods of closure especially in rural markets and counties with large numbers of uninsured adults before medicaid expansion keith davis a doctor who runs a small clinic in shoshone idaho was the republican elected coroner for lincoln county for 20 years he said the members of his party attempting to limit medicaid expansion risked sacrificing fiscal responsibility and positive health outcomes to score political points if you are fiscally conservative you want to pay less in taxes davis who is the only doctor in a county the size of rhode island said and that means in health care you should be really encouraging preventive care in coverage for people so they can get the care that they need the basic services we all save money and it s better quality of life and i m fine with my neighbors getting those services and lowering the cost of care for all of us dr keith davis at the shoshone family medical center janie osborne for nbc news davis said it would also help mitigate burnout in a state that ranks 49th in the u s for number of physicians per capita according to a 2019 report from the association of american medical colleges while a big part of the problem is the low number of medical residencies and positions in the state davis said another issue is that employees in his clinic spend much of their time logging the services patients refuse because they can t afford prescriptions procedures tests or examinations which wears on them emotionally it really is very disheartening as a provider to be strapped and left to ask do i order this test knowing that it s really important but that s going to be a 3 000 bill and that you and i both know you can t afford stephanie roberts a physician s assistant at davis s clinic in shoshone said
traffic and roadworks on onewa rd in birkenhead in auckland earlier this year photo file roading the truth is out there john roughan is simply wrong when he states that road vehicles pay all the costs of building and maintaining their infrastructure in the past financial year auckland ratepayers provided 400 million to auckland transport to use for capital projects nzta provided a further 264m from this capital funding 465m was spent on building new roads and road renewals the rest of the capital funding was spent on public transport and parking projects every year auckland ratepayers provide hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies to build and maintain the road network this information is all publicly available roughan might want to familiarise himself with it before writing his next opinion piece alastair cameron grey lynn never profit in rail thank goodness someone in the media mainstream is saying what john roughan is i strongly recommend professor dave heatley s the history and future of rail in new zealand 2009 nz was very unlucky in the timing of its emergence as a nation and the evolution of transport technology our government went into debt for nearly a century to create a national rail network just before the evolution of road transport would render much of it obsolete furthermore its primary purpose was to carry people rather than freight at the time there was no better way for people to travel and the population was projected to hit tens of millions the rate of immigration collapsed from what it had been because living conditions in the old world improved greatly with technology in transport and refrigeration and health our rail network never contributed an operating profit to pay back the capital expenditure it constantly operated at a loss a fiscal black hole the short period it was privatised was a temporary relief michael cullen s buyback of it for 1 right at the end of his term as finance minister was a master stroke of sabotage of the following national government s fiscal options philip g hayward naenae economic crimewave john roughan in his article suggests that using road funding for rail would be an economic crime does he not realise road users benefit from various subsidies trucks rail s main competition are subsidised by other road users road users in general are subsidised by ratepayers who may not drive regardless of how you got there if you shop in a mall you are paying for parking if auckland is anything like the average united states city there are an average eight parking spots for every car most at no charge to the motorist auckland s parking spots are estimated to be worth on average 50 000 that s possibly close to half a million dollars per car looks like there s an economic crimewave robin coleman glenfield opinion piece flawed john roughan makes two elementary mistakes in his opinion piece on the wrong track robbing road to pay rail the first is that road vehicles pay all the costs of building and maintaining their infrastructure trains cannot simply untrue i m afraid roads are subsidised both by general taxation and rates in nz the other is scant regard for the impact of climate change the economy won t function well in a world of uncontrolled warming bevan jenkins hawke s bay new year in sight i was wondering if next year will be dedicated to the year of perfect vision after all it

house over the course of a year it was not covered in plastic what happens to this plastic after the hay is eaten and the house renovations have finished the use of plastic should be banned in both

the republican dominated senate will never remove him after a partisan impeachment and astoundingly flawed trial in legal terms which has been pure political theatre you don t have to be

parties in the quiet and leafy suburbs of northcote pt and birkenhead national party and labour party billboards in the guise of christmas messages such as have a merry christmas have sprung up and the council refuses to remove them on the ridiculous grounds that they are just a christmas message this is despite including photographs of the local national party mp dan bidois the address of the national party and lots of blue colouring ditto for the red version for the labour party candidate for the area shannan halbert the council s unitary plan rules are clear that advertisements of any

traffic and roadworks on onewa rd in birkenhead in auckland earlier this year photo file roading the truth is out there john roughan is simply wrong when he states that road vehicles pay all the costs of building and maintaining their infrastructure in the past financial year auckland ratepayers provided 400 million to auckland transport to use for capital projects nzta provided a further 264m from this capital funding 465m was spent on building new roads and road renewals the rest of the capital funding was spent on public transport and parking projects every year auckland ratepayers provide hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies to build and maintain the road network this information is all publicly available roughan might want to familiarise himself with it before writing his next opinion piece alastair cameron grey lynn never profit in rail thank goodness someone in the media mainstream is saying what john roughan is i strongly recommend professor dave heatley s the history and future of rail in new zealand 2009 nz was very unlucky in the timing of its emergence as a nation and the evolution of transport technology our government went into debt for nearly a century to create a national rail network just before the evolution of road transport would render much of it obsolete furthermore its primary purpose was to carry people rather than freight at the time there was no better way for people to travel and the population was projected to hit tens of millions the rate of immigration collapsed from what it had been because living conditions in the old world improved greatly with technology in transport and refrigeration and health our rail network never contributed an operating profit to pay back the capital expenditure it constantly operated at a loss a fiscal black hole the short period it was privatised was a temporary relief michael cullen s buyback of it for 1 right at the end of his term as finance minister was a master stroke of sabotage of the following national government s fiscal options philip g hayward naenae economic crimewave john roughan in his article suggests that using road funding for rail would be an economic crime does he not realise road users benefit from various subsidies trucks rail s main competition are subsidised by other road users road users in general are subsidised by ratepayers who may not drive regardless of how you got there if you shop in a mall you are paying for parking if auckland is anything like the average united states city there are an average eight parking spots for every car most at no charge to the motorist auckland s parking spots are estimated to be worth on average 50 000 that s possibly close to half a million dollars per car looks like there s an economic crimewave robin coleman glenfield opinion piece flawed john roughan makes two elementary mistakes in his opinion piece on the wrong track robbing road to pay rail the first is that road vehicles pay all the costs of building and maintaining their infrastructure trains cannot simply untrue i m afraid roads are subsidised both by general taxation and rates in nz the other is scant regard for the impact of climate change the economy won t function well in a world of uncontrolled warming bevan jenkins hawke s bay new year in sight i was wondering if next year will be dedicated to the year of perfect vision after all it will be 2020 morris jones papakura plastic use unnecessary i quite agree with wendy galloway when growing up on a farm our hay was not covered with plastic but kept in a hay barn when building our house over the course of a year it was not covered in plastic what happens to this plastic after the hay is eaten and the house renovations have finished the use of plastic should be banned in both covering hay bales and houses being built both uses are unnecessary should not have been allowed in the first place and should have been eliminated well before the ban on single use plastic bags lyn barton beach haven council move cynical displaying cynical disregard for community consultation the humbug auckland council waited until right before christmas to give staff and patrons just one day s notice of the indefinite closure of the historic leys institute library for very low level seismic risks it had been aware of for more than a year mike wagg freemans bay folau career destroyed the reason maria folau went out without a whimper is quite simple the media the media created promoted and exaggerated a non story the media must have known and planned for maria to be dragged into the deliberately created maelstrom all her husband did was quote the bible yippeee big deal highly religious people have been quoting texts from their particular book ever since the religious fantasy was born there was no independent unbiased reporting it was a full out attack knowing full well what the response from an over sensitive section of the community would be effectively the media destroyed two careers three cheers for those brave journalists graham hansen howick trump going nowhere as we go into 2020 could we have less regurgitation of selective us opinion writers on the trump impeachment and foolish lines such as the photo today from the new york times of course that he will face removal by the senate anyone who takes an interest in international affairs knows full well the republican dominated senate will never remove him after a partisan impeachment and astoundingly flawed trial in legal terms which has been pure political theatre you don t have to be misrepresented as a supporter or apologist for trump to observe that reality so let s cut to the end senate will exonerate trump might be re elected and continue to provide a focal point for outrage and fury from the democrats and if he isn t then opinions will shift elsewhere june kearney west harbour political adverts it seems that auckland council no longer cares about enforcing the rules that protect our residential areas from the scourge of advertising billboards and notices plastered over fences and walls what is worse is that these non complying advertisements are promoting political parties in the quiet and leafy suburbs of northcote pt and birkenhead national party and labour party billboards in the guise of christmas messages such as have a merry christmas have sprung up and the council refuses to remove them on the ridiculous grounds that they are just a christmas message this is despite including photographs of the local national party mp dan bidois the address of the national party and lots of blue colouring ditto for the red version for the labour party candidate for the area shannan halbert the council s unitary plan rules are clear that advertisements of any sort are illegal in residential areas except during election periods where does this specious evaluation of council rules end is it now a policy of anything goes as long as it contains an appealing message m carol scott birkenhead comforting message a very good friend who will experience her first christmas without her much loved mother wrote the following to me i lost both my siblings this year christmas will be hard for both of us this year but remember they would want to see us happy and relaxing after such a big year i cannot think of any better words of comfort to everybody in similar circumstances graham edwards sandringham council christmas grinch shame on auckland council as there are no street christmas decorations in devonport i took a trip to queen st on saturday morning to feel the christmas spirit well i am still trying to find a piece of tinsel or in fact anything in the form of a decoration it s unbelievable and not acceptable i can t imagine what tourists must think instead of the council spending taxpayers money on their christmas bash buy some decorations council you need to visit moscow at this time or even whanganui no auckland you are not the city you think you are you probably rank last of the cities in the world when it comes to street decorations i have been in kazakhstan at this time of year and the cities there make a very nice show i am embarrassed and ashamed to be here as i have heard comments from tourists in devonport what a disappointment for them and us shame i have more decorations on my wee balcony than all of auckland jan simonson devonport women should be heard it would be terrific if next year s christmas message from the churches was primarily written by women with a smattering of male voices to provide diversity mary tallon

editorial tensions remain with trade deal following a roughly 20 month trade dispute the us and china finally declared a truce on dec 13 through a phase one trade deal which would have the us cancel planned tariffs on us 160 billion of chinese imports including smartphones toys and consumer electronics that were set to go into effect on sunday last week the us has also agreed to reduce tariffs on us 120 billion out of us 300 billion of chinese goods affected since sept 1 from 15 percent to 7 5 percent however previously imposed tariffs of 25 percent on roughly us 250 billion of chinese goods such as machinery electronics and furniture remain in place in exchange china has committed to a minimum of us 200 billion in increased purchases of us products and services over the next two years including us 32 billion in agricultural goods despite differences in the content of the announcements from washington and beijing on the terms of the preliminary agreement both sides consider themselves winners yet is it a win win for everyone economists and trade experts have polarized views on the matter at first glance it looks as if the us would benefit from this deal as existing tariffs with a big increase in chinese purchases would help lower the trade deficit with china however compared with last year s us 419 2 billion us china trade deficit the benefit is utterly inadequate some people believe the us putting the brakes on new tariffs and agreeing to reduce existing ones in exchange for a large amount of chinese purchases would help us president donald trump s re election bid however beijing does not give specific commitments in the agreement which gives it a brief respite from growing economic headwinds while questions over whether it will honor its pledge remain unanswered even though china has promised to include intellectual property technology transfer financial services currency and foreign exchange issues in the next round of talks there are no signs of progress with regards to structural reforms or other changes to its economic and trade regime such as industry policy government subsidies or state owned enterprises which are major concerns for washington in terms of technology and national security for the time being the us and china can claim to be winners but as long as beijing s structural problems are not resolved the trade row is likely to persist and might evolve into a long term technology competition as well as a political rivalry between a democracy and an authoritarian state moreover the next phase of trade talks is likely to fall apart sooner or later considering that the negotiations have been conducted in fits and starts over the past two years so long as the trade row continues there is unlikely to be a significant improvement for chinese and taiwanese businesses which still need to hasten their global production adjustment plans to diversify risks in the meantime as concerns over credit and investment quality in china increase with the slowdown of the chinese economy taiwanese financial institutions need to further reduce their exposure to china which was as high as nt 1 73 trillion us 57 27 billion at the end of september equivalent to 0 49 times the industry s net value financial supervisory commission fsc data showed while us china trade tensions have eased they have not ended so business uncertainties remain china s financial crisis must also not be ignored the fsc must closely monitor the changes in banks exposure to china and step up its risk management measures

president donald trump who was impeached for abuse of power and obstruction of congress is a bully and world class vulgarian who else would come to michigan a state critical to his reelection and suggest as trump did on the same day of his impeachment that its late revered native son u s rep john dingell d dearborn might be in hell but those hoping that trump will lose his bid for a second term next year because of a weakening economy are likely to be sorely disappointed yes the economy is slowing particularly in michigan and other midwest swing states that trump must win to convulse the nation for another four years a recent new york times analysis found that job growth in the midwest since trump took office at the start of 2017 has lagged most of the rest of the country job growth in michigan has risen a paltry 1 8 during trump s almost three years as president according to the times analysis that s less than in all but eight other states iowa ohio pennsylvania and wisconsin states that former president barack obama won in 2012 but that trump captured in 2016 have posted similarly low job growth rates under trump the question is whether the slowdown will be enough to make midwest voters reject trump in favor of a democratic challenger voters have many available reasons to toss trump from the white house his vile behavior and penchant for law breaking among them but the economy might be the least of trump s re election worries michigan one of the country s top manufacturing states provides a window into the economic climate trump is likely to face as the november 2020 election draws closer the latest university of michigan state economic forecast predicts a significant drop in job growth over the next two years from 2017 and 2018 but the slowdown isn t likely to panic voters the sun has stopped shining on michigan s economy this year but fortunately we are accustomed to capricious weather u of m economists jacob burton gabriel ehrlich donald grimes and michael mcwilliams wrote in their forecast michigan voters might even feel better about the economy next year after the state shakes off the pain of the recent nearly six week long united auto workers strike against general motors the strike temporarily cost the state 11 200 jobs u of m economists say michigan will return to respectable job growth over the next two years if as we expect the national economy avoids recession gm is running its truck plants flat out and requiring mandatory sunday overtime to make up for lost production during the strike of its highly profitable full size pickup trucks and suvs uaw members at fiat chrysler ford and gm are profiting from new contracts that give them higher wages big signing bonuses and no increases in health care costs and the detroit three automakers also have committed to spending billions of dollars in new and refurbished factories that will add thousands of new jobs in michigan there are other positive signs about michigan s short term economic prospects michigan s labor participation rate the percentage of working age adults who are employed or looking for work is slowly rising after years of decline according to the u of m economists the state s jobless rate is expected to fall from 4 1 this year to 3 9 in 2020 and 3 7 in 2021 that rate would be on par with 1999 and 2000 as the lowest annual average unemployment rate in michigan s history since the current data series began in 1976 the u of m economists said not every economic indicator in the state is positive the state s slowdown in job growth has been dramatic falling by more than half from 50 000 new jobs in 2018 to an estimated 20 300 in this year u of m predicts the state will add 29 000 jobs in 2020 and 25 900 jobs in 2021 but after producing an average of more than 10 000 jobs a year since 2000 manufacturing is expected to create only 3 600 of those jobs over the next two years that estimate could prove to be optimistic u s steel announced thursday it s idling operations near detroit in april eliminating 1 545 jobs personal income growth is slowing as well falling from an increase of 4 9 percent in 2018 to a predicted 3 1 jump in 2021 according to the u of m forecast but it s important to note that we re still talking about rising job and income growth just at a slower pace than in the past several years plus there have been several recent developments in washington that could benefit michigan s manufacturing based economy the u s house passed the united states mexico canada agreement usmca on thursday easing uncertainty for automakers parts suppliers and other manufacturers about the future of more than 1 trillion in annual trade among the three countries the usmca which replaces the controversial north american free trade agreement nafta is one of trump s top economic policy initiatives the u s senate is expected to pass it early next year meanwhile china and the united states are said to be nearing a partial trade deal that could reduce tariffs on chinese produced goods and allow u s companies to sell more products to china a potential thaw in a dangerous trade war many including some prominent republicans say trump s lawlessness and authoritarian tendencies are a threat to democracy but he is likely to be defeated at the polls next year only if voters are concerned about more than their own pocketbooks

turkey s president erdogan has recently dismissed almost all the turkish flag officers still in service thus leaving only a small proportion of them with a view to later favouring the quick career of subordinate officers with a nationalist or islamist background and training president erdogan s regime also actively supports all the egyptian members of the muslim brotherhood who fled egypt after mohammed morsi s fall and al sisi s coup moreover the origins of erdogan s akp party are certainly obscure but also clearly shrouded in the networks of the turkish brotherhood and in the more or less moderate political islamism just to use a trivial classification of western political science to some extents the political military choice made by the turkish presidency is still favoured by the long term effects of the attempted coup against president erdogan of july 15 2016 when the turkish armed forces were greatly purged of all officers who had even a slight or hidden secularist inclination just to use again the trivial classification of political science currently only 42 turkish flag officers are still in active service with equal or higher rank of the 325 ones who served in the turkish armed forces at the time of the military putsch moreover authoritative sources maintain that it was precisely the turkish military that temporarily stopped president erdogan s designs in syria who had invasion plans that would have been far more aggressive and long term than the recent turkish occupation of northern syria the military dismissed from active service had also opposed president erdogan s plan to establish an alliance with the russian federation 45 of the officers no longer in active permanent service were harshly purged while 33 retired either voluntarily or not and 6 simply handed in their resignation there were also other options which materialized only for 2 of them transfer to other state administrations consultancy contracts etc but only 14 of the total officers active at the time of the 2016 putsch have remained in service president erdogan thinks not too secretly that the putsch was organized with the consent or the silent approval of the united states and of some eu countries however the interforce chief of staff at the time of the coup general hulusi akar who also stopped any national military mobilization in the early stages of the coup is currently president erdogan s defence minister was it a self coup it may be possible general hulusi hakar knew about the military coup as also disclosed by the then and current head of the turkish intelligence services hakan fidan in 2016 the generals of the turkish armed forces were 325 while they are currently 233 149 generals were purged in the week immediately following the attempted coup later it became known that many high ranking military were either on vacation with their families or in cities other than their workplace or and this should come as no surprise they were countering the putschists actions according to the official data released by the turkish government a total of 8 651 military participated in the attempted coup approximately 1 of the whole turkish armed forces too few to take them seriously how one can think of organizing a coup with so few operatives and the whole operation was carried out by experienced officers of an armed force as good as the turkish one remains a mystery or a suspicion 1 781 of the 8 651 coup operatives were simple conscripts while 1 214 were cadets from military academies 150 generals were involved in various ways in the 2016 coup some of the purged officers were quickly sentenced to long imprisonment while all of them were accused of having systematic ties and connections with the movement of gűlen who currently lives in the united states a charge that however president erdogan s regime has never been able to prove in a barely convincing way it seems to me rather naïve that the us intelligence services which certainly keep gűlen under control could authorize such a severe destabilization operation in a country that is still the axis of nato throughout the middle east and central asia despite the difficulties faced by the us intelligence agencies hizmet service i e fethullah gűlen s movement is still very widespread in turkey at the time of the 2016 coup president erdogan closed down 800 companies as well as 1 100 schools of all levels 850 dormitories and 1 400 volunteer associations all linked to the gűlen movement immediately after the coup of july 2016 president erdogan imprisoned as many as 38 000 people linked to the hizmet movement and expelled over 100 000 civil servants and stateofficials from the police judiciary education and health sectors who according to the turkish police were at the service of the gűlen movement in the public sector hizmet members in various ways range between 1 5 and even 11 of the total civil servants and state employees in each administration in the judiciary the gulenists are as many as 30 and even 50 of the police force while the largest share of hizmet members in relation to the total population is found in eastern anatolia and the aegean area the gűlen movement was president erdogan s greatest support when herose to power in 2002 the hizmet networks produced evidence often false to accuse the members of the kemalist and secularist tradition in all the state bodies in which they were active while the open clash between the gulenists and president erdogan supporters did not begin until 2013 currently however the muslim brotherhood is the main organizational and ideological support of president erdogan s akp and the ikhwanis behind the independent industrialists and businessmen association the powerful musiad as well as behind companies such as turkish airlines and many of the big real estate and construction companies president erdogan s relations with the muslim brotherhood date back to many years ago at least to the early 1970s when the current turkish president was one of necmettin erbakan s brightest aides in 1970 erbakan an academic and a politician founded the milli nizam partisi the national order party which was also a member of milli gorus turkey s largest islamic association both erbakan s party and milli gorus were banned in 1971 while in 1973 erbakan founded the new milli selamet partisi the national salvation party with which erbakan even became deputy prime minister from 1974 to 1978 arrested after the military coup of 1980 he was forced not to carry out political activity any longer said ban ended in 1987 political islamism the fight against turkey s westernization and a new nationalism not separating the state from the islamic religion were the salient features of erbakan s doctrine in its various party connotations erkaban was an anti zionist and anti semitic as well as an anti american and a strong supporter of a new islamic union on the eu model which would bring together all the islamic countries of the middle east those were erbakan s ideas many of which although with some differences seemed to herald president erdogan s akp that party was founded in 2001 as a result of the merger of as many as five islamist parties that had not previously had the possibility of organizing themselves overtly and out in the open all the generals and the other officers who were purged by the turkish armed forces by erdogan s motu proprio were later defined by the turkish secret service namely mit both as gulenists and as pro western and us friends currently after the various purges only 65 of the officer posts in the turkish armed forces are covered recently over 150 000 civil servants have been further sidelined and dismissed due to their membership of fethullah gűlen s network approximately 30 000 of these civil servants linked to gülen shizmet are still in prison while there are currently 6 760 military still confined in turkish jails either on charges of having being involved in the coup or for being members of the gülen movement 5 960 of them are colonels or lowerranking officers and 142 are brigadiers general or higher ranking officers the issue of the 2016 coup and of the islamist repression of the turkish society s traditional ruling classes reminds us of the ergenekon trials ergenekon is a powerful secret society as there were many in turkish history and still many continue to flourish organising some of the secular and pro western power groups in turkey giuseppe garibaldi had a sound relationship with the association of italian workers in turkey a para masonic network while the lodges of the grand orient of italy organized much of the flourishing emigration of italian businessmen and financiers to the ottoman empire indeed italy s lodges covered up and concealed the young turks movement in the ottoman empire ergenekon is also the fundamental legend of the turkish literary and symbolic tradition regarding a grey she wolf called asena which helped the turkish tribal clans of the altai mountains to reach the luxuriant plain of ergenekon where they could thrive and reproduce a further possibility is that the secret society called ergenekon is named after colonel necabettin ergenekon an officer who at the time of its establishment was the second in command of the whole covert network of the secret association probably the secret society we are talking about is one of the many organizations of turkey s deep state which is one of the great political traditions of the ottoman empire which later merged with nato s covert networks in a country like turkey which bordered on the ussr and was close to hot war zones such as the middle east iran and the persian gulf we also need to recall the specific political role played by the military after the 1908 revolution organized by the turkish armed forces and the subsequent self proclaimed function of the military as protectors of secular democracy after the foundation of the turkish republic in 1923 in turkey the deep state networks were organized to work under the cover of official organizations such as the armed forces just think about the feday group born in 1905 to ultimately stage mass mobilizations and demonstrative actions hence to do politics without showing themselves in public the secret societies of the turkish armed forces mainly carried out espionage and counter espionage missions but also organized rebellions throughout the ottoman empire suffice to recall the libyan insurgency against the italians or the one in the balkans against greece and bulgaria or in egypt against great britain they were all turkish nationalist operations without direct ties to the ottoman empire which often did not even know the nature of deep state actions the deep state societies were largely dismantled after the defeat of the ottoman empire in the first world war but some espionage and counter espionage groups remained active such as the karakol yavuz and hamza associations and felah which incorporates the above mentioned feday group ataturk tried to place all these organizations within the police and the intelligence services but he did not fully succeed to do so it should be noted that mit the current secret service was founded in 1960 after the first legal turkish military coup in 1971 there was another constitutional coup and in 1980 there was the so called post modern coup in 1998 a white coup outlawed the welfare party an islamist political group founded by necmettin erbakan that was at the origin of president erdogan s akp in the midst of the political changes occurred in the post cold war period the eu universal geniuses demanded and obtained the stop of the turkish armed forces constitutional operations thus ensuring the rise to power of the akp disguised as a great coalition with other secular political forces furthermore in 1968 the mit operated mainly through the pro western turkish parties to create the conditions for a military coup the political link between mit and the parties in the turkish parliament was the counter guerrilla office a body of the intelligence services having considerable autonomy from the central command the counter guerrilla networks were all connected by a nato command for non orthodox war which was easily penetrated by an east german secret agent much of the western gladio structure was well known to the warsaw pact and sometimes to the communist parties of western europe to which nato belonged this is one of the most rational interpretation of the moro affair and of its effects in italian political history following the assassination of the christian democrat leader nevertheless the networks to which probably also ergenekon belonged were manifold absalon in denmark aginter in portugal with many branches also in italy the auxiliary units in the uk the bund deutscher jugend and the technischer dienst operating in west germany the well known gladio stay behind in italy and central europe including switzerland the grupo antiterorista de liberacion operating in spain informationsbyran in sweden and also intelligence operations in the netherlands the mountain riders in greece nihtilä haathti in finland and the österreichischer wander sport und geselligkeitsverein in austria plan bleu and rose de vents with interconnections also in italy as well as arc en ciel in france which had two gladio structures one in the south and another in the north whose head of the southern network was mitterrand s presidential hunter projekt 26in switzerland rocambole in norway and finally sdra 8 and stc mob in belgium the official turkish network of nato stay behind however was not ergenekon but the tactical mobilisation committee which was at the base of the pogrom against the greek orthodox people of september 6 7 1955 the ergenekon trialsbegan in june 2007 with a raid by the turkish police while coincidentally the constitutional court put the akp on trial on charges of being the core of anti secularist activities the charges against ergenekon concerned 86 suspects in the first phase of police activities and later further 56 ones the trials against the secret society ended in early august 2013 in the end there were 275 defendants 17 of whom were sentenced to life imprisonment only 12 of them were found innocent as stated above the operation against ergenekon started with the search of oktay ildirim s house where several grenades were found and ildirim was a simple retired sergeant the usual eu universal geniuses positively viewed the trial against the pro western secret society which was a clear sign to the military by the akp in power clearly the current crisis of the turkish military world and hence the subsequent replacement of secularist officers with islamist or neo nationalist military in line with president erdogan s project of new turkish ottomanism towards the east is a strong sign of the persistence of secret societies in the turkish deep state and of president erdogan s willingness to have an armed force completely free of the coupist and secularist temptations typical of the kemalist world which is still deeply rooted in the tradition of the turkish armed forces this will create many problems to nato and still many more to the eu

the guardian asked its new zealand readers to put questions to prime minister jacinda ardern as she and her government gear up for an election in 2020 here are her responses q new zealand will find it difficult to reduce carbon emissions to our agreed targets also our impact on global emissions will be small what can nz do to help make significant reductions on other countries especially those without resources to do so could nz could lead an alliance of smaller countries to achieve this cliff turner 72 wellington a right now the minister for climate change james shaw is leading a delegation from new zealand at the annual international climate change negotiations whilst there he has been sharing with other countries the huge progress we have made here at home not least with our historic zero carbon act there is still a lot of work to do as you suggest but after decades of inaction we are finally leading new zealand on a journey that we must all take together to solve climate change our pacific neighbours are among those most uniquely at risk from the changes we are forcing on the climate rising sea levels ocean acidification and disruptive weather patterns are just some of the consequences threatening pacific peoples livelihoods and ability to provide for their families this is exactly why at least two thirds of new zealand s 300m of climate related support between 2019 and 2022 will be provided to pacific nations view image in fullscreen jacinda ardern pictured at august s pacific islands forum with leaders from fiji samoa and federated states of micronesia photograph mick tsikas epa back in september i was proud to announce that we would start negotiations with four other small countries norway iceland fiji and costa rica to remove tariffs on environmental goods such as solar panels or wind turbines and curb fossil fuel subsidies minister shaw is reaffirming that commitment at the international negotiations we have also contributed 15m over four years to the first replenishment of the green climate fund which supports the efforts of developing countries to respond to the challenge of climate change q do you think that the current view on the climate crisis has become too affiliated with the left right spectrum of politics gideon bickler 16 auckland a i don t think most people view their lives in terms of the left right political divide and i hope we don t see climate change that way either i think most new zealanders just want to see us take action on the issues that matter most to them including environmental issues recently our new zero carbon act passed through parliament unopposed in other words every political party has sent a clear message to new zealanders that no matter who is in government we are all committed to significant domestic greenhouse gas emissions reductions the zero carbon act was conceived of by a movement of young people as a way to depoliticise climate change policy so that we can actually start to make some progress that s exactly what we have done q may i know what will be your immigration policy going forward now that new zealand will meet the 5 million population mark soon will your policy be more welcoming to international students like me who might opt to stay on to contribute to your country and will you formulate an attractive policy to lure in more international students whose parents may or will have spent millions to support their children s education in new zealand this is also a way to boost your country s gdp ballerina chong 19 wellington a we have a range of different things our immigration policies are designed to achieve we want to ensure that new zealand businesses can get the workers they need where skill shortages exist our immigration settings respond to regional differences migrants are not exploited new zealand meets its international and humanitarian commitments if students have the skills we need they will be able to work here but we also want to make sure that the courses provided for international students are quality courses that will give them good skills for their future careers wherever they may go q will nz change its name to aotearoa when the queen dies john irving 77 a te reo is an official language of this country so aotearoa is one of the names we are lucky to have already q when is your government going to make the transformational change to child poverty that you promised douglas 75 porirua a we have committed to reducing child poverty by at least half within 10 years the child poverty reduction act requires the government to set targets and report on child poverty every year this is huge as it creates a framework for ongoing action and accountability by this and all future governments achieving our targets will mean our child poverty rates are amongst the lowest in the world every step we take to get closer to our targets represents a tangible improvement in the day to day lives and future opportunities of those families and children who are no longer in poverty our first two budgets have included actions to significantly reduce child poverty and material hardship the most significant of these was our 5 5bn families package which increased the family tax credit and accommodation supplement and introduced the best start and winter energy payments in budget 2020 we indexed benefits to wages and increased the amount that beneficiaries can earn before their benefit reduces these changes are expected to lift between 42 000 and 73 000 children out of poverty we have also taken action to ease the financial pressures felt by low income families by reducing health education and other costs the impact of many of these investments isn t captured in current child poverty reporting the release of new statistics nz data in early 2020 will be the first indication of the progress we re making in reducing child poverty q how will labour address the persistent wealth gap in aotearoa new zealand and allow our children to aspire to own their own homes rachael findlay 57 te whanganui a tara wellington a this government views the economy as a means to an end not as an end in itself a strong healthy economy is vital to new zealand but only is as much as it means we can share the benefits more widely among all new zealanders and their families our wellbeing budget was a big step towards making this a reality when we came into office budgets measured the wealth and success of new zealand on just the narrow metric of economic growth gdp we have fundamentally changed the way budgets are put together and how they are delivered the result is budgets now reflect what new zealanders value including how many children have been lifted out of poverty how much cleaner our environment is and how we are future proofing the economy innovations such as this will help narrow the wealth gap that exists in new zealand and accordingly will put home ownership within reach of more people major investments will continue to be made in health education housing and social programmes to address new zealand s long term challenges and we have also created more jobs and raised wages made it cheaper to pay the bill via the winter energy payment made it cheaper to visit the doctor and to send kids to school we have also banned foreign speculators from purchasing property in new zealand view image in fullscreen homeless people beg for money in the auckland cbd photograph phil walter getty images q what are you doing will you do to ensure free independent journalism in new zealand sincerely a recently graduated jobless journalist gordana rodden 23 wellington a as we all know the media industry has changed hugely in recent years as traditional advertising revenues are increasingly diverted to online social media platforms this has created a real issue for an industry that is now struggling to make the money to pay journalists free independent journalism is a core part of any democracy and something we must guard jealously in new zealand the government funds radio new zealand and tvnz in order to ensure it continues but even then there are funding problems and the organisations are hampered in what they can do with limited resources this is why broadcasting minister kris faafoi is currently looking for potential alternatives to ensure the ongoing strength of independent local journalism he is hoping to announce some more details soon q how can we stop the culture wars growing in nz guns abortion water climate change and the planned referendums have the potential to split nz just like brexit has split the uk ian andrews 55 wairarapa a i agree no one wants to see division but i do think new zealanders have shown they can live happily side by side while holding strong and varying views yes these can be emotional decisions but i trust that new zealanders will have the debates while remaining respectful of one another and of differing views in fact i think that s one of the things that sets us apart q do you think that nz could take an even stronger lead on accepting refugees to australasia including possible climate refugees from the south pacific nations particularly in light of australia s continual refusal to take a fair quota nigel dowdeswell 57 hamilton a we have made a significant increase in our refugee quota this term and we are working hard to ensure that we are ready for that increase new zealand s refugee programme includes a high quality refugee resettlement programme that is internationally acclaimed and provides up to a year of support once in the community increased the refugee quota up to 1 500 each year which will be in place by 2020 and a significant amount of work is underway to support this we have announced new regional settlement plans for six new regions we are making improvements to the mangere refugee resettlement centre to support our refugees for their 6 week induction programme q what practical plans does arden and her government have to resolve the housing issues experienced by many new zealanders whether it be overpriced poor unsuitable rentals the lack of real social housing options the price of ownership being un affordable for many new zealanders or the lack of temporary beds for those in acute need jamie lynch 34 wellington a after significant neglect in housing we re starting to make progress on several fronts so far we have stopped the previous government s sell off of state houses and have added over 3 600 additional houses to the stock there are currently 2 400 state houses under construction and 13 000 in the pipeline in total we know we have an ever growing waiting list but it is possible to meet that demand if the national government had built state houses at the pace of our targeted 1 600 per year we d have an additional 14 400 state houses that s the entire waiting list gone in terms of homelessness we re rolling out housing first across new zealand and as at the end of october there were over 1 000 individuals and families engaged i recognise that kiwibuild homes will be out of reach for some families which is why we re building state houses and making life better for renters by banning letting fees and modernising rental laws we ve recently put 400m into progressive home ownership which will both lower deposits and mortgage repayments we expect this will help thousands of families to buy their own homes we ve also made changes to the first home scheme lowering the deposit required for a government backed mortgage to 5 and allowing family and friends to combine their 10 000 first home grant to buy their first home together these changes will make a significant difference in helping families who have been locked out of the housing market view image in fullscreen a housing development in auckland house prices have grown out of reach of many new zealanders photograph nazar abbas photography getty images q how are you going to safeguard democratic freedoms in new zealand in terms of overseas and internal lobby group interests funding election campaigns jennifer ashby 52 dunedin a we ve already taken action to protect new zealand from foreign interference in our elections by banning foreign donations to political parties and candidates the electoral amendment bill no 2 which passed in early december bans foreign donations over 50 this will reduce the risk of foreign money influencing our election outcomes the bill also extends the requirement to include name and address details on election advertisements to apply to election advertisements in all mediums this means that if someone wants to advertise online they need to say who they are the same as if it was published in a newspaper the minister of justice has also signalled a wider review of the electoral act after the 2020 general election q while china funds and influences new zealand and australian politics burgles and intimidates a critical academic and keeps a million people in gulags your government continues to snuggle up to the panda i fully concede that the opposition would cheerfully do more than snuggle isn t there a more principled path you could take paul kiely 39 wellington a forgive me for pushing back on you there paul although we have a solid and growing relationship new zealand and china are very different countries there is a significant asymmetry in size we have fundamentally different political systems and values and on some issues we have quite different approaches it is only natural that there are areas where we do not see eye to eye and when that occurs we raise it for example new zealand regularly discusses human right issues with china including the situation in xinjiang new zealand closely follows human rights issues in our region and we share international concerns regarding the treatment of uighurs this is why i raised new zealand s concerns about the situation in xinjiang with president xi jinping and premier li keqiang during my visit to china in april i also raised concerns with premier li during our meeting in bangkok in november this year new zealand also joined a statement alongside 22 other countries expressing our concerns the statement was delivered at a united nations general assembly meeting in new york and in in july we signed a letter alongside 24 other countries addressed to the president of the human rights council and the un high commissioner for human rights we will continue to raise our concerns directly with china and use these opportunities to explain the importance that new zealand attaches to human rights standards new zealand also takes any allegations of foreign interference in new zealand seriously some media speculation has focused on china but we do not single out any specific actor the important thing is that we have flexible and adequate protections we have robust measures in place to protect our values institutions and economy q what is one thing you want to accomplish in your second term if you get re elected in 2020 justin lindsay a we haven t set our policy agenda for the next election yet but the plan is to continue to build on the work we have done in the first term to deliver a better new zealand for more people but as finance minister grant robertson said when releasing the budget policy statement foreshadowing the direction of travel for the government we will continue our focus on tackling the long term challenges facing new zealand while also investing to future proof the economy the budget 2020 priorities which would carry work over into the next term are just transition supporting new zealanders in the transition to a climate resilient sustainable and low emissions economy future of work enabling all new zealanders to benefit from new technologies and lift productivity through innovation māori and pacific lifting māori and pacific incomes skills and opportunities child wellbeing reducing child poverty and improving child wellbeing physical and mental wellbeing supporting improved health outcomes for all new zealanders q young women are so commonly treated with such disdain and in blatant forms of sexism amongst male school peers and teachers too how will you battle new zealand s misogynistic culture that s so very rampant in our schools william b 49 auckland a rebel against it we have to do what we can to call out bad behaviour but also to have plenty of role models too i can t say i ve been told our schools are any worse than anywhere else but there s almost always more to do to make sure our young women are treated fairly q why is new zealand risking 1080 invading our food chain kris davies otago 33 a we re using all the tools we ve got in the box to restore the dawn chorus and save aotearoa s precious kiwi kākāpō and whio from the predator crisis 1080 is the best tool for large scale predator control and it dissolves quickly in the environment into harmless substances we do want alternatives but until we find them it s the best we ve got to combat predators q what s the best way to batter snapper and how long do you deep fry it ian 52 tuakau a what a controversial question ian pan fried is best for delicious fresh snapper in my opinion but if you like a wee coating i m a big fan of a bit of panko crumb dip in flour then egg then panko either way when you come to cook it use a rice bran oil it takes higher temperatures well and a dollop of butter go well
simonkolawolelive by simon kolawole thank you for reading this post don t forget to subscribe if you felt intimidated by the public notice on national enforcement on tax defaulters issued last week by the federal inland revenue service firs let s say that is just the introduction by the time president muhammadu buhari signs the nigeria financial bill 2019 into law possibly before january 1 2020 your life will never be the same again the bill has been passed by both chambers of the national assembly all it needs to become active is the green pen of the president the bill amends seven tax laws in the country petroleum profit tax customs and excise company income tax personal income tax value added tax vat stamp duties and capital gains perhaps the highlight of the bill highlight in the sense that it is the aspect hugging the headlines is the increase in vat from 5 percent set by gen sani abacha in 1994 to 7 5 percent in contrast vat is 20 percent in the uk and 12 5 percent in nearby ghana before now the nigerian government had made only one attempt to increase it that was in 2007 when president olusegun obasanjo topped it up to 10 percent in his last days in office but it was reversed by president umaru musa yar adua under pressure from the labour unions any increase in vat is easily felt by consumers so it was not difficult for organised labour to mobilise nigerians against the hike already nigerian manufacturers are nervous over the new vat rate i heared that guinness one of the biggest producers of consumer products is considering increasing its prices although mr baker magunda the md ceo gave nothing away when he spoke recently we do not arbitrarily increase prices he said in fact we have maintained price stability even in the most challenging times our recommended retail prices remained same despite inflation and in the face of major infrastructural challenges we kept our products prices stable by stretching production efficiencies ensuring we do not pass on the additional cost to consumers he appeared to be saying we have tried enough other companies are also weighing their options particularly because the 7 5 percent tax is applicable to almost all goods and services including your phone calls and internet data that means everybody whether rich or poor will feel the pinch i have heard side comments that the benefits of the increase in national minimum wage from n18 000 to n30 000 have already been wiped off in advance by the increase in vat many states have even said they cannot pay the new wage because of revenue challenges that would make it double jeopardy for the unfortunate workers collecting old wage and paying for goods and services at new vat rate many tax experts and economists will argue that instead of increasing vat rate government should focus on bringing more people into the net through a more efficient administration and a more incentivised voluntary compliance increasing vat rate by 50 percent as we are about to do will inevitably raise costs reduce overall consumption especially in these hard times and consequently impact negatively on production that means government may not be able to harvest a commensurate 50 percent increase in vat revenue that is why bringing more taxpayers into the tax net seems to stand a better chance of producing positive outcomes than increasing the rates however it seems government strategy is to increase both the rate and the take at the same time in truth a lot of work has been done in the last three years to increase the tax base under mr tunde fowler as firs chairman we moved from 10 million tax payers to over 20 million but how far can we stretch collection in an economy that is walking on thin ice that is the challenge for mr mohammed nami the new firs boss people and businesses must make money first before you can tax them well economic prosperity will make it easier in the meantime states and councils will argue that the new vat rate will help them as per paying the new wage after all they take 85 percent of the revenue while the federal government gets just 15 per cent let me now detonate the real bomb an aspect of the finance bill that nigerians are yet to wake up to is the requirement to attach tax identification number tin to personal bank accounts in fact the provision says you cannot open or operate a bank account without your tin if this is implemented it means the taxman or woman may just use your tin like bvn to print out all your bank statements and begin to calculate your tax liabilities based on the gross total of deposits so if n10 million passed through your bank accounts in a year your personal income tax could be calculated based on that amount are you not in trouble i get where you are going that is not all the deposits in your account are yours i know your uncle transferred n5 million into your account and asked you to help him buy a car i believe you your company sent n500 000 to you to help buy christmas hampers for some clients i understand unfortunately i am not the one you will have to explain to otherwise i will help you it is the taxman i can only tell you that you will be at his mercy he will give you a tax bill of n3 million based on the deposits in your account and you will start crying and begging for mercy you will definitely be extorted you will say i told you please accept the assurances of my best wishes it should also interest you that the n50 stamp duty that started as a squatter on your bank account in 2016 has now become a landlord basically all bank transfers from n10 000 will now be charged stamp duty even when you are transferring the money to yourself in another bank the only exemption is if you are transferring money to yourself in the same bank i don t know how many people will open two individual accounts in the same bank except of course you have the savings and current variants but we may be forced to ask you why you are busy transferring funds back and forth to yourself in the same bank are you sure you are okay dear stamp duties will now cover electronic documents a coded phrase covering online transactions those of you who like to shop online think you can escape paying stamp duty no way it is now your duty to pay n50 on each transaction some fuel stations are already charging n50 when you pay with your card you d better go with cash dear a country that wants to encourage cashless transactions is taxing electronic purchases it is called dissonance also if you get a compensation pay off of n10 million and above after being relieved of your job you will not go home in peace you will now pay tax for your loss sorry for your loss but the taxman has a job to do but smile the finance bill is not all bad news there are plenty things to cheer certain things are now vat exempt to address concerns about impact on the poor for one women and young ladies will no longer pay period tax all locally manufactured sanitary pads and tampons will be vat exempt the campaign against period tax started a couple of years ago in australia and is going global nigeria has keyed in so early in the day this is something to celebrate hopefully this will change the lives of many students across the country who are unable to go to school at that time of the month however ladies who prefer foreign sanitary products will pay the vat period perhaps most heart warming is the mercy that the law will have on small and medium scale businesses i always advocate for smes so i have a duty to rejoice companies with annual turnover of less than n25 million will no longer be required to file vat returns they will also not be required to pay the mandatory minimum tax on turnover medium sized companies defined as those with annual turnover of between n25 million and n100 million will now pay a lower company income tax rate of 20 percent minimum tax will now be 0 5 percent of the turnover for companies that are required to pay in the absence of profits these provisions are not bad at all overall it is a good thing that nigeria is working hard to become more of a tax economy after being stuck with oil dependency since 1973 circumstances have forced us into this and the transition will take decades to bed it but we have to keep walking we often abandoned fiscal reforms in the past because of the episodic oil booms as soon as oil prices went high we retreated when i was still interested in pursuing a phd some 12 years ago my proposed research was to try and understand the nexus between tax reforms and the cyclic revenue crisis in resource dependent countries my inkling then was that reforms would be inversely related to the boom bust cycle finally i would say it is not enough for the buhari administration to be doing tax reforms just because we are pressed for revenue taxation must create a consensual relationship between the state and the society stakeholders must be carried along multiple taxations issues must be resolved taxation is more sellable when you have accountability and prudence people s confidence needs to be boosted so that they can trust government that the money will be well spent in a country where we will be spending n37 billion to renovate the national assembly complex it will be difficult to convince nigerians that the tax payers money is being spent judiciously and four other things the n37bn damage for a country that is going to borrow to finance most of its capital expenditure i am unable to understand why the national assembly would want to spend a whopping n37 billion to renovate its complex sure the complex is a national asset which must not be allowed to rot away particularly as we have a very poor maintenance culture in this part of the world if we do not renovate it today the condition will only get worse tomorrow i certainly do not have any objections to that at all what has kept my mouth agape is the cost the whole of thirty seven billion naira i am not a quantity surveyor but something in my brain is saying this is obscene damaging fake news again you must have heard the story of gold kolawole the one year old boy declared missing in akure ondo state you must have also heard that his body was found buried under the altar of sotitobire miracle church on wednesday an irate mob attacked the church and set it on fire the real story though is that no dead body was buried or found in the church a tv station broadcast the fake news and the rule of the mob set in imagine if the mobsters had found the pastor or any church official on site they would definitely have burnt them alive only god knows how many innocent people have been killed by mobs over fake alarms in this country scary the borderline the statistics are still coming in according to alhaji ibrahim ciroma adamawa state operations controller of the department of petroleum resources dpr fuel consumption has dropped by 70 in the state as a result of the border closure by president buhari before now 100 trucks used to head to adamawa every day you will be lucky to count up to 30 these days we knew all along that subsidised fuel was being smuggled freely to neighbouring countries because of the opportunity for arbitrage but we are now getting the picture in raw figures they all sound lovely to me but i will keep asking what happens when we eventually reopen the borders interesting trump card since donald trump became us president he has tested the system to the limit doing and saying things that we would never expect from the most powerful office in the world although he has now been impeached it is almost certain that the senate would not convict and remove him no matter the evidence before them partisan politics has triumphed above everything else as the voting pattern during the impeachment clearly showed trump can afford to say and do things anyway he likes because he holds the aces with his republican party firmly in charge of the senate he believes he cannot be moved so much for the almighty american democracy comical
two deals in pocket but no holiday cheer for u s trade chief lighthizer u s trade representative robert lighthizer was looking forward to some holiday peace and quiet after wrapping up trade deals with the united states most important trading partners china mexico and canada last week instead the long standing member of president donald trump s inner circle who normally eschews public appearances found himself doing wall to wall interviews scrambling to correct a misunderstanding with the mexican government and taking heat from his fellow republicans in congress the conservative wall street journal carried an opinion piece that said the trump administration had bowed to politically managed trade in agreeing to democratic demands to revamp the new u s mexico canada agreement usmca while former ustr officials and investment analysts panned the phase 1 u s china trade deal as falling far short of expectations lighthizer 72 is an anomaly in today s hyper partisan washington a powerful member of trump s white house who has won sometimes grudging praise from democrats and republicans while keeping the ear and respect of the president throughout the ustr chief was the most present person from this administration that i have seen in my three years in congress said u s representative jimmy panetta a democrat he was all over the place and i think that helped out quite a bit richard trumka the president of the afl cio labor union whose support for usmca was critical to ensuring congressional backing called lighthizer an honorable man adding i ve worked with him for 35 40 years and we ve always been able to work deals out because i know when he tells me something it s good the usmca which will replace the north american free trade agreement and the china trade deal were two of trump s top priorities and landing them both in the same week was a public relations triumph but the efforts to reel in those deals took longer and proved harder than expected and triggered further questions critics say some of that is a byproduct of lighthizer s tight fisted negotiating style congressional sources and former u s government officials say he is always well prepared but can appear arrogant and unwilling to delegate lighthizer is also prone to slamming down the phone in anger representative richard neal the democratic chairman of the u s house of representatives ways and means committee told reporters last week little daylight tasked with resetting the main u s trading relationships in the world to reflect the trump administration s conviction that the united states has been taken advantage of for years lighthizer has taken to the job like a duck to water there is little daylight between trump and the georgetown university educated ohio native on the key planks of an america first policy that is aimed at rebalancing the global trading arena in favor of u s workers and companies lighthizer who was a deputy trade negotiator in the reagan administration in the 1980s honed his views during a lengthy career as a private international trade lawyer among his clients were u s steel companies struggling to compete against heavily subsidized imports from china he understands the president better than most and wants to significantly change the way trade is done a veteran u s trade negotiator said on condition of anonymity dismantling the world trade organization moving away from multilateral trade agreements and using steel and aluminum tariffs to punish countries accused of hurting u s industry are policies lighthizer accepts the source said but it s his negotiating style as well as that of others in the trump administration that has generated much criticism the trump trade team often refuses to commit negotiations to paper while discussions are underway according to multiple congressional sources and lighthizer unlike his predecessors has clamped down on background conversations with reporters that can lead to misunderstandings and confusion for instance lighthizer insists the first phase of the u s china trade deal is completely done but beijing has not confirmed details released by u s officials leaving markets and key affected industrial sectors befuddled it could be weeks before the 86 page agreement is translated into chinese and further details are released several chinese officials this week said the wording of the deal remained a delicate issue and care was needed to ensure expressions used in text did not re escalate tensions raising concerns it could still unravel jorge guajardo a former mexican ambassador to china who is now a senior director at mclarty associates said both the dust up with the mexicans over u s plans to monitor changes to mexican labor rules and the delayed release of the text of the china deal raised questions about how lighthizer operated both mexico and china seem to have been caught off guard guajardo said it s troubling it does indicate a bit of a pattern on the u s side of presenting different agreements than their parties think they agreed to harry broadman a former senior ustr official said there was no reason the mexico issue should have spilled into public view announcing the trade deal with china before the text was translated was also unusual he said that is not the procedure usually followed in trade negotiations worldwide usually you speak after you have something in writing and both sides release it broadman said an apologetic lighthizer speaking on fox business network on tuesday said the mexico situation was a last minute snag and a misunderstanding that was easily taken care of next battle lighthizer also came under fire from fellow republicans for dropping a 10 year data protection provision for certain pharmaceuticals from usmca u s senator pat toomey a pennsylvania republican and fierce usmca critic said on thursday it was a major setback for a very very exciting new category of medicines and would make it harder for u s drug makers to recoup heavy investment costs lighthizer conceded on fox business network it was a step backwards but said it was a needed compromise to ensure congressional support from the democratic controlled house ultimately trump was the one who wanted to get the china deal done ahead of dec 15 when a new set of tariffs were due to kick in said christian whiton a fellow at the center for the national interest think tank in washington and a member of trump s transition team after the 2016 election at the end of the day lighthizer is a lawyer and trump is his client whiton said under pressure to get a deal done it is entirely possible lighthizer came back with something that is half baked he said lighthizer battling laryngitis briefed reporters about the u s china trade deal on dec 13 he conceded there was hard work ahead and that its success was up to china adding that he had trump s backing the deal s done when the deal s done he said i would walk away on a matter of significance absolutely a minute before it s done and the important thing is that everybody knows it and i know the president would so i don t have to worry about that already he s gearing up for the next trade battle in europe over aircraft subsidies digital tax plans and the geneva based wto i live in a target rich environment so there s a lot to do he quipped source reuters

democrats republicans and president donald trump can work together that was demonstrated this past week when the house of representatives approved a revised north american trade agreement by a 385 to 41 vote one day after the same chamber impeached the president on a strictly partisan vote if the agreement wins senate approval as well as expected it will achieve one of the president s primary campaign promises to replace the north american free trade agreement the original deal approved in 1994 while on balance good for the collective economies of the united states canada and mexico did eliminate several million u s manufacturing jobs as corporations shifted work to mexico because of its cheaper labor and environmental costs while trump got his deal democrats in control of the house also got most of what they wanted it creates new protections for organized labor in mexico which should improve the lot of mexican workers while decreasing the incentive for u s companies to outsource jobs and it establishes a committee to monitor those reforms in a nod to the domestic auto industry the new deal includes pay rules that will shift more car manufacturing work to the united states it will increase car prices however and potentially slow sales of new vehicles the tradeoff is worth it jettisoned were earlier provisions to restrict the availability of generic medications and congress ability to pass laws to reduce drug costs backing more regulations labor rules that could drive up prices and undermining pharmaceutical profits is usually not the sort of thing we would expect to see republicans back but on this issue at least trump proved true to his populist rhetoric and pulled republican congressmen along in backing provisions engineered by the democratic house majority it is telling that progressive pro labor political leaders such as rep rosa delauro a democrat from connecticut s 3rd district and sen sherrod brown d ohio who had opposed past trade agreements as too pro business signed on to this one delauro was assigned by house speaker nancy pelosi to serve on the nine member working group that negotiated changes in the deal with the white house the deal is backed by the afl cio and the teamsters but also by many business groups that feared the failure to get a revised deal passed would have left the neighboring countries without a trade deal inviting trade barriers that would have been collectively bad for north american workers consumers and businesses concerning connecticut the biggest good news may be that the deal expands market access into canada for dairy producers eliminating canada s unfair pricing system and its subsidies for export sales of milk powder and protein this should mean higher dairy prices but again the tradeoff in helping maintain a healthy u s dairy industry is worth that rep joe courtney d 2nd district pointing to the agreement s support for the dairy industry and applauding the elimination of protections for big pharma supported the legislation ultimately however the deal now labeled the united states mexico canada agreement should not result in big shifts in the economic ties between mexico canada and the u s that could have happened for the worse if no deal replaced nafta many of the changes were necessary to simply update the pre internet 25 year old nafta including adding digital trade provisions updating guidelines for food safety to reflect the latest science and bolstering anti corruption protections the three nations could have used the agreement as an opportunity to commit to addressing climate change but that was not going to happen during a trump administration on the economic side the danger may be that in bowing too far toward labor the deal may so hamstring the elasticity of some industries in producing goods it could slow growth on balance however the deal deserves the bipartisan support it received and is far better than no deal we urge the senate to adopt it with the support of connecticut sens richard blumenthal and chris murphy the day editorial board meets with political business and community leaders to formulate editorial viewpoints it is composed of president and publisher timothy dwyer executive editor izaskun e larraneta owen poole copy editor and lisa mcginley retired deputy managing editor the board operates independently from the day newsroom
by robert skidelsky london speaking outside no 10 downing street following his emphatic election victory british prime minister boris johnson thanked long time labour supporters for having lent his conservative party their votes it was a curious phrase whose meaning depended entirely on context the tories had breached labour s strongholds in the midlands and north east england on the promise of getting brexit done leaving the european union as britain will on jan 31 2020 will be johnson s repayment of the debt he owes these voters but getting brexit done won t be enough for the tories to hold on to their parliamentary seats as johnson recognized the conservatives he said will need to turn themselves once again into a one nation party for its part if labour is to regain its heartlands it will need to find a way of reconnecting with its alienated supporters what this double reconfiguration entails is reasonably clear the conservatives will need to break with thatcherite economics and labour will need to loosen its embrace of minorities and minority culture both will need to move back to a middle ground the libertarian dream of a free market in both economics and morals does not resonate with an economically interventionist but socially conservative electorate brexit was a reaction to economic betrayal the british version of a european wide revolt by what french president emmanuel macron called the left behinds this label is precisely right as a description but overwhelmingly wrong as a prescription for it suggests that the future is technologically determined and that people simply will have to adapt to it the state s duty according to this view is to enable the left behinds to board the cost cutting labor shedding bullet express whereas what most people want is a reasonably secure job that pays a decent wage and gives them a sense of worth no one would deny that governments have a vital role to play in providing people with the employment skills they need but it is also governments task to manage the trade off between security and efficiency so that no sizeable fraction of the population is left involuntarily unemployed guaranteed full employment was the key point of consensus of the keynesian economics of the 1950s and 1960s embraced by right and left with the political battle centered on questions of wealth and income distribution this is the kind of dynamic center the conservatives should try to regain any toryism that seeks to be genuinely one nation must acknowledge that the fiscal austerity that the conservatives imposed on the country from 2010 to 2017 caused great and unnecessary harm to millions of people the tories must show that they understand why austerity was wrong in those circumstances and that the purpose of the budget is not to balance the government s accounts but to balance the economy at full employment deficits and surpluses reflect the state of the economy this means that no effort should be made to cut the deficit when the economy is shrinking or to expand it when the economy is growing because that produces deflation in the downswing and inflation in the upswing exactly the opposite of what is needed george osborne s greatest contribution to toryism now would be to explain where and how as chancellor of the exchequer he went wrong between 2010 and 2016 a party pledged to govern from the center should implement policies to stabilize the labor market these should include a permanent public investment program aimed at rebalancing the united kingdom s regions and greening its infrastructure together with a buffer of guaranteed public sector jobs that inflates and deflates automatically with economic downturns and upturns the beauty of the second lies precisely in its automaticity guarding it against the charge of being at the mercy of vote hungry politicians together these policies would limit business fluctuations rebalance the economy geographically and lay the ecological foundations for future growth what they imply is a deceleration of the rush to automate and globalize regardless of social cost labour for its part needs to recognize that most of its voters are culturally conservative which became clear with respect to brexit the election result disclosed a culture gap between remainers and leavers which for a subset of london and university campus based remainers amounted to a culture war between a politically correct professional class and a swath of the population routinely dubbed stupid backward and undereducated or more generously misinformed one symptom of this gap was the common media depiction of johnson as a serial liar as though it was his mendacity that obscured from befuddled voters the truth of their situation political correctness ramifies through contemporary culture i first became aware of a cultural offensive against traditional values in the 1970s when school history textbooks started to teach that britain s achievements were built on the exploitation of colonial peoples and that people should learn to feel suitably apologetic for the behavior of their forbears granted that much history is myth making no community can live without a stock of myths in which it can take pride and normal people don t want to be continuously told that their beliefs habits and prejudices are obsolete in the continuous evolution of cultural norms therefore a new balance needs to be struck between the urge to overthrow prejudice and the need to preserve social cohesion moreover whereas the phrase left behind may reasonably describe the situation of the economically precarious it is quite wrong as a cultural description there are too many cultural left behinds and their cultural re skilling will take much longer than any economic re skilling but such re skilling is not the right prescription metropolitan elites have no right to force their norms on the rest of the country labour will need to remember that normal people want a transpennine railway much more than a transgender future in short just as the right went wrong in forcing economic individualism down people s throats so the left has gone wrong in its contempt for majority culture in the u k the price for elite incapacity in both areas has been brexit in europe and the united states generally it has been the growth of populism economic and cultural utopians alike are destroyers they want to tear down what has been built in order to create something more perfect the dream of perfection is the death of statesmanship politicians who aspire to govern on behalf of the whole community should aim for the best possible result not the best result possible robert skidelsky a member of the british house of lords is professor emeritus of political economy at

president gotabaya rajapaksa chairs a meeting with the newly appointed state ministry secretaries file photo this is the keynote address delivered on the occasion of the international research conference organised by the university of ruhuna inclusive democracy through representative government democracy as against monarchy or authoritarian rule has been hailed as the best form of government due to a number of reasons it permits citizens voice in government allows people to have choice over right to life career faith or property creates an environment conducive for intellectual pursuit helps prospering creativity in members and promotes peaceful cohabitation among diverse social ethnic and religious groups in the older form of democracies that existed in ancient greece or ancient india around 5th century bce these goals were sought to be realised through direct participation of all citizens in society yet one problem with these democracies was that they were not true democracies in today s context that was because a large segment in society such as slaves women or low caste people was not recognised as legitimate members who could participate in the democratic rule hence they could be termed exclusive direct democracies in today s context democracies should be inclusive allowing all citizens irrespective of faith ethnicity or class to participate in the governing process but it would pose a problem because of the sheer largeness of societies not only in terms of number or territory but also diversity and complexity they have gained as a result direct democracy was succeeded by a new form of democracy known as representative democracy in this form citizens are to rule themselves through representatives elected by them for a given period these representatives who are simply agents of the citizens are required to perform their duty as per the wishes of their principals the citizens this model will therefore not succeed if these representatives are not bound by a governance code known as democratic governance governance is how one relates to one s stakeholders governance is simply the way an individual an organisation a company or a government relates himself or itself to those who are interested in his or its affairs known as stakeholders they can be of two types those who stand to benefit or those who are destined to lose as a result of the behaviour of the entity concerned governance requires the entity to have an appropriate balance between the gains and the losses this could be done by incorporating an ethical or moral code to governance the most famous of such codes today relate to the need for ensuring sustainability preserving environment and protecting minority shareholders in a company or in the case of a government protecting and ameliorating minority ethnic or religious groups today the demand of societies has been that their elected representatives should adopt good governance practices however in reality two developments have shaken the very foundation of the democratic governance today one relates to the emergence of evidence that elected representatives have deviated from good governance practices the other is that citizens in their present organisational capacity have failed to keep an effective check on such deviations hence democratic governance is at a crossroads today and if corrective action is not taken it will meet with a natural death sovereignty is in people the elected representatives who are simply agents are required to use the society s scarce resources for the maximum gain of their principals namely the citizens unlike a monarchy or an authoritarian rule the masters of a democracy are the citizens in whom it is claimed sovereignty of the state is vested since people working together have a better and sounder collective intelligence again a claim made from a principle known as synergy such a system should naturally bring prosperity to a nation and help it climb to heights which it has not yet reached this is the promise of democratic governance weaknesses of governance but some economists do not think so they have found weaknesses in representative democracy systems leading to a misuse and a waste of a nation s wealth at two levels one is at the level of the bureaucracy the other is at the level of elected political rulers kautilyan prescription economists had for long known that the allocation of funds by governments to undertake public expenditure programs could involve excesses wastages and misuses in early to mid 20th century ludwig von mises and gordon tullock wrote on the bureaucracy and its inherent tendency to misuse the public funds however it was in 1971 that a formal economic theory of bureaucracy was developed by the american economist william a niskanen in a path breaking publication titled bureaucracy and representative government before he wrote this book niskanen had served as an assistant director at the us budget management office and it was widely believed that his experience at the budget office helped him to formalise his theory today democratic governance is at a crossroads because the enemies are within the system the citizens cannot control them because they are irrationally and emotionally attached to those enemies the citizens are therefore myopic and the enemies of democratic governance are bent on using their myopia to their best advantage to resolve the problem societies should strive to build empowered citizens who will be able to look beyond what they see right now bureaus versus the public according to niskanen in a representative democracy the public elect their rulers commonly known as the government and empower them to tax people in order to carry out public expenditure programs that produce public outputs producing a thousand graduates or treating ten thousand patients are two examples of such public outputs the principle set by the public in this regard is that the government should maintain efficiency at all times in accomplishing this delegated function to avoid misuse or waste of the scarce wealth of the public in other words the government should tax the public at a minimum level and produce the public outputs at the maximum level to complete these public expenditure programs the government is organised in the form of separate bureaus such as ministries departments universities and hospitals the aggregation of these bureaus and the public officials working in those bureaus forms the bureaucracy of a country niskanen says that if the objective of the public and the objective of the bureaucrats are the same then there is no problem about maintaining efficiency in producing public outputs but as it is the objective of the bureaucrats is to maximise their own personal welfare such as the salaries and other fringe benefits known as perquisites or perks bureaus in order to boost their public powers may expand their work programs and the number of officials working in a particular bureau hence this objective of bureaus directly conflicts with the objective of the public who want to keep these expenses at a minimum level as a result a long negotiation takes place and at the end all bureaus over inflate their budgets requiring the government to impose more taxes and make more borrowings to produce a given amount of public outputs niskanen s observation on the behaviour of the bureaus to over inflate the budgets for personal gains is typical of public services in both developing and developed countries political leadership is no different the public s relationship with the political leadership is no different from its above noted relationship with the bureaus in a representative democracy political leaders are expected to provide the maximum benefit to the public by incurring the minimum costs this is exactly what they promise the public when they woo their votes at elections at that point the objective of the public and the objective of the political leaders are identical with each other however after the elections and once the political leaders are voted to power there is a clearly visible divergence between the objectives of the two parties though in a representative democracy the people are said to be the masters and technically in a position to change the political leaderships at the elections this does not happen because the political leaders are capable of changing the public opinions in favour of them again by using the taxpayers money how does this happen economists martin c mcguire of the university of california at irvine and mancur olson jr of the university of maryland have explained the reasons for this unhealthy development in an article titled the economics of autocracy and the majority rule the invisible hand and use of force published in the journal of economic literature in its issue in march 1996 bandit rulers are also public good providers mcguire and olson have started their article by analysing the objective and the mindset of a leader of a roving group of bandits if the bandits do not contribute to produce economic outputs in regions they squander pretty soon they will find themselves in a situation where they cannot conduct thefts anymore because the region would be without economic outputs to take away by force hence it pays the bandit leader to acquire a territory produce minimum public goods so that people could continue to produce economic outputs and at the end rob a major part of their output the people expect the political leaders to tame the bureaucrats and that is why they elect a government to power however this does not happen because there is incentive for both bureaucrats and political leaders to collude together to inflate the public expenditure programs the checks which the people have introduced to eliminate such occurrences are therefore conveniently twisted by the two parties to their advantage the end result is the waste misuse and misappropriation of nation s wealth by both the bureaucrats and political leaders the people have to bear the burden by way of either higher taxation or higher inflation mcguire and olson say that the roving bandit leader who has now settled in the territory as its ruler makes the people within the territory more productive by by providing a peaceful order and other public goods why should he do so because according to the two economists it helps him to obtain more resources for his own purposes than from roving banditry the people within the territory are also better off in a way because they have now more public goods to consume but in the long run since a greater part of their output is robbed by the bandit ruler they are not incentivised to improve the productivity and make the increase in the output a sustainable one since the bandit ruler can control the amount of output which he can take away from people at his will he is incentivised to provide a minimum amount of public goods mcguire and olson say that this is an invisible hand which makes him a public good providing king democratic rulers too have the same incentive democratic rulers are elected by the public but during the election as well as after the election they are invariably surrounded by special interest groups that seek special favours hence it is necessary for the elected ruler to give out pork barrel projects a term coined from the us mid country politicians coming up with projects to woo farmers votes and therefore now applicable to any public expenditure program that benefits a given group or people in a locality and not a nation as a whole this is the fundamental golden rule which the elected ruler has to observe if he is to ensure his survival in politics and return to power in a future election to produce pork barrel projects he needs funds and those funds are raised through taxation if explicit taxes are imposed or through inflation if printed moneys are used taxing people is to take away their wealth by force to use this force as well as to create a peaceful environment democratic rulers are given power to exercise violence on their subjects according to economist jack hirshleifer of the university of california at los angeles anyone who has this power will use it to satisfy his own self interest if that power is not controlled by various checks and balances but the ground realities show that even when such checks and balances have been imposed they are not that effective because the political leaders of representative democracies have learned to outsmart the framers of laws this they do by a number of ways they could always use their majority power in the legislatures to push through their schemes if some of the legislators dissent experience shows that the political leaders could use either the coercive powers they enjoy to subdue dissenters or give out pork barrel projects to silence them but this is done at the expense of the tax payers hence the democratic rulers who have the certainty of returning to power in future elections will provide certain public goods to keep the electorate happy but use a major part of the tax money for their own purposes and for providing benefits to the special interest groups that support them when there are public protests against their misusing the nation s wealth for private and family purposes they resort to the use of force to suppress such protests sri lanka s present state of affairs provides ample evidence for this the root cause the principal agent problem the root cause for both bureaucrats and political leaders in representative democracies to satisfy their personal benefits as against working for realising the objectives of the people has been identified by economists as the principal agent problem or pap the people are principals in both cases and bureaucrats and political leaders are agents who are required to work for the attainment of the wishes of the people hence pap is simply the existence of conflicting objectives between the principal and the agent whom he hires the principal wants to gain the best for himself and that is why he pays the agent to do the job but the agent acting in his own interest may do things which are injurious to the principal thus the bureaucrats hired by the government on behalf of the people or the politicians elected by the people will not satisfy the needs of their respective principals but try to satisfy their own desires which are different from those of the principals the people expect the political leaders to tame the bureaucrats and that is why they elect a government to power however this does not happen because there is incentive for both bureaucrats and political leaders to collude together to inflate the public expenditure programs the checks which the people have introduced to eliminate such occurrences are therefore conveniently twisted by the two parties to their advantage the end result is the waste misuse and misappropriation of nation s wealth by both the bureaucrats and political leaders the people have to bear the burden by way of either higher taxation or higher inflation in many countries both bureaucrats and political leaders are insulated from the twin burdens by extending generous tax exemptions like duty free imports and tax free allowances and paying salaries which are adjusted upward automatically along with the increases in the cost of living a system known as indexing wages the way out for the public mcguire and olson have pointed that limiting the term of a us president to two four year terms has effectively taken out the incentive for him to offer pork barrel projects and use his powers to serve his own personal interests but this is not the case with us senators and congressmen who have the chance of getting re elected again and again in their case it is difficult to prevent special interest groups from surrounding them for various economic favours which are granted at the expense of the public in the absence of an effective checks and balances system political leaders who have the chance of getting re elected will definitely make use of their power to advance their personal causes in many developing countries political leaders are elected for life that is at each subsequent election they get re elected to office by popular vote this system has the same features as the old monarchies in which the monarch will hold absolute powers over his subjects till his death when one realises that he has uncontrolled absolute powers over his lifetime it is difficult for him not to abuse or misuse his powers especially the power to extract economic benefits for his personal use the recent history is abundant with instances where long serving political leaders misuse nation s wealth for the advancement of one s family or one s closest allies when they become institutionalised the way to remove them is only through a violent public uprising involving loss of life and property it is therefore absolutely important to restrict the term of political leaders to a given period if countries are interested in avoiding misuse or abuse of economic powers by their leaders the enemy is within and not out two harvard political scientists steven levitsky and daniel ziblatt in their 2018 book titled how democracies die have identified that the enemy of democracy comes from within and not from out today democratic governance is at a crossroads because the enemies are within the system the citizens cannot control them because they are irrationally and emotionally attached to those enemies the citizens are therefore myopic and the enemies of democratic governance are bent on using their myopia to their best advantage to resolve the problem societies should strive to build empowered citizens who will be able to look beyond what they see right now the writer a former deputy governor of

democrats republicans and president donald trump can work together that was demonstrated this past week when the house of representatives approved a revised north american trade agreement by a 385 to 41 vote one day after the same chamber impeached the president on a strictly partisan vote if the agreement wins senate approval as well as expected it will achieve one of the president s primary campaign promises to replace the north american free trade agreement the original deal approved in 1994 while on balance good for the collective economies of the united states canada and mexico did eliminate several million u s manufacturing jobs as corporations shifted work to mexico because of its cheaper labor and environmental costs while trump got his deal democrats in control of the house also got most of what they wanted it creates new protections for organized labor in mexico which should improve the lot of mexican workers while decreasing the incentive for u s companies to outsource jobs and it establishes a committee to monitor those reforms in a nod to the domestic auto industry the new deal includes pay rules that will shift more car manufacturing work to the united states it will increase car prices however and potentially slow sales of new vehicles the tradeoff is worth it jettisoned were earlier provisions to restrict the availability of generic medications and congress ability to pass laws to reduce drug costs backing more regulations labor rules that could drive up prices and undermining pharmaceutical profits is usually not the sort of thing we would expect to see republicans back but on this issue at least trump proved true to his populist rhetoric and pulled republican congressmen along in backing provisions engineered by the democratic house majority it is telling that progressive pro labor political leaders such as rep rosa delauro a democrat from connecticut s 3rd district and sen sherrod brown d ohio who had opposed past trade agreements as too pro business signed on to this one delauro was assigned by house speaker nancy pelosi to serve on the nine member working group that negotiated changes in the deal with the white house the deal is backed by the afl cio and the teamsters but also by many business groups that feared the failure to get a revised deal passed would have left the neighboring countries without a trade deal inviting trade barriers that would have been collectively bad for north american workers consumers and businesses concerning connecticut the biggest good news may be that the deal expands market access into canada for dairy producers eliminating canada s unfair pricing system and its subsidies for export sales of milk powder and protein this should mean higher dairy prices but again the tradeoff in helping maintain a healthy u s dairy industry is worth that rep joe courtney d 2nd district pointing to the agreement s support for the dairy industry and applauding the elimination of protections for big pharma supported the legislation ultimately however the deal now labeled the united states mexico canada agreement should not result in big shifts in the economic ties between mexico canada and the u s that could have happened for the worse if no deal replaced nafta many of the changes were necessary to simply update the pre internet 25 year old nafta including adding digital trade provisions updating guidelines for food safety to reflect the latest science and bolstering anti corruption protections the three nations could have used the agreement as an opportunity to commit to addressing climate change but that was not going to happen during a trump administration on the economic side the danger may be that in bowing too far toward labor the deal may so hamstring the elasticity of some industries in producing goods it could slow growth on balance however the deal deserves the bipartisan support it received and is far better than no deal we urge the senate to adopt it with the support of connecticut sens richard blumenthal and chris murphy the day editorial board meets with political business and community leaders to formulate editorial viewpoints it is composed of president and publisher timothy dwyer executive editor izaskun e larraneta owen poole copy editor and lisa mcginley retired deputy managing editor the board operates independently from the day newsroom
kwame okoampa ahoofe jnr ph d kevin taylor is at best a nuisance whose propagandistic rants against the akufo addo led government of the new patriotic party npp will amount to the proverbial hill of beans the fact of the matter is that the decision by governor ernest addison of the bank of ghana bog to introduce the new ghȼ 100 and 200 denominations into circulation is based squarely on the economic realities of the times in particular the level of inflation over at least some 10 years there is absolutely no unreflective or auto kneejerk motive behind this policy change unlike the kind of gross incompetence that characterized and precipitated the veritable shinplaster that was the cedi currency notes printed and recklessly circulated by the operatives of the rawlings led junta of the so called provisional national defense council pndc and subsequently the rawlings led veritable one party dictatorship that was the first eight years or two terms of the national democratic congress ndc there is absolutely no policy decision taken by the current governor of the bank of ghana including the introduction of the ȼ 2 coin that has not been done in any of the most advanced civilized democracies around the world one would rather have expected this inveterate critic of president akufo addo and the clinically blind mahama partisan to have either written a column or done a youtube presentation commending his political archnemesis for literally putting his money where his proverbial mouth is by facilitating the salutary refreshingly restorative and therapeutic conferral of citizenship on some 126 diaspora africans largely african caribbeans or afro caribbeans and african americans on thursday november 28 2019 you see when former president john dramani mahama had the chance to wisely reconcile ghana and the rest of the african continent with its hideous slavery past the bole bamboi savannah region native chose instead to grant citizenship and diplomatic status to some arab terror suspects captured in the killing fields of afghanistan and legitimately detained for a dozen years in a maximum security prison in the united states naval base on guantanamo bay cuba into our very peaceful country at least in the post rawlings era this is the kind of self hating leader that mr taylor would have ghanaians and the rest of the world believe has higher moral principles and greater leadership competence than nana akufo addo there is absolutely no irony or contradiction here as some critics of this new currency policy measure would have the rest of the general ghanaian public believe yes it is true that the government has initiated policy measures to eventually move ghanaian society towards an electro cashless economy but even as governor addison aptly pointed out this progressive policy initiative cannot be achieved in the offing or the immediate future while approximately 75 percent of ghanaians in the business community at least for now prefer to deal in hard currency at any rate the introduction of the ȼ 100 and ȼ 200 paper currency denominations has not given our expert economists and policymakers any credible and or reasonable cause to suspect the likelihood of any precipitous cedi depreciation in the offing so where is the waste that ardent and inveterate akufo addo critics like mr taylor are jiving about of course we need to know the total cost of having the new cedi denominations printed but we are also quite certain that the total expenditure for this well considered fiscal policy is quite certain to be much cheaper that the humongous judgment debt payouts gleefully and recklessly engineered and supervised by the four and half year mahama led kleptocratic regime of the national democratic congress as well even as yours truly pointed out in a previous column here in the united stets we have at least 12 paper currency denominations including 500 10 000 and 100 000 one hundred thousand dollar notes we need to also remember that grandstanding and all under the tenure of the self righteous founding father of the national democratic congress that is chairman jerry john rawlings ghana s currency notes were reckoned or commercially calculated in the millions indeed so deeply and cancerously irreparable and practically indelible was the psychological trauma and gash or running sore that was visited on the average ghanaian psyche by chairman rawlings and his p ndc abongo boys that even as i write some ghanaian adults have yet to progressively transition from counting their cedi currency notes in the millions into the far more rational and mathematically manageable current regime of pesewas singles tens hundreds and on occasion a couple of thousands and a few millions if any at all you see the abject hypocrisy of these ndc political scumbags appears to know absolutely no end that is the wasteful change that mr taylor and his blindly pro ndc touts ought to be writing and talking about visit

jetpacks disintegrator rays nuclear energy mars decades ago academics futurists and government agencies cast their predictions of what would happen by the year 2020 would submarines reach historic depths who would lead nations and which ones would be global superpowers would planet earth even exist as we knew it i shall not be surprised if on my 92nd birthday i am able to go for a ride in an antigravity car mathematician and scientist d g brennan wrote in 1968 some like brennan were overly optimistic others were spot on here s what happened what didn t and what was just plain crazy 1 life expectancy will rise past 100 futurist ray kurzweil predicted in 1999 that human life expectancy would rise to over one hundred by 2019 computerized health monitors built into watches jewelry and clothing which diagnose both acute and chronic health conditions are widely used in addition to diagnosis these monitors provide a range of remedial recommendations and interventions he wrote in the age of spiritual machines nope while kurzweil may have accurately predicted health related gadgets such as fitness watches bioscarves and ekg apps for your smartphone he jumped the gun on life expectancy in 2019 the average life expectancy of the global population was 72 6 years according to the united nations that average is slightly higher in the usa at 78 6 years in 2017 according to a report in the journal of the american medical association though life expectancy in many industrialized nations continues to inch up it has been going in the opposite direction in america the united nation predicts the average global life expectancy to rise to 77 1 years by 2050 life expectancy what countries have the longest 2 computers will be invisible kurzweil had several other prophecies for the year 2019 including invisible computers computers are now largely invisible they are embedded everywhere in walls tables chairs desks clothing jewelry and bodies people routinely use three dimensional displays built into their glasses or contact lenses this display technology projects images directly into the human retina keyboards and cables would become rare he said it s true computers are embedded everywhere these days we have smart homes smart tables smart chairs smart desks and more though we may not project images directly into our retinas google glass comes pretty close per kurzweil s prediction scientists are developing smart contact lenses capable of monitoring the physiological information of the eye and tear fluid that could provide real time noninvasive medical diagnostics several groups are testing smart lenses that would measure glucose levels in the tears of people with diabetes 3 books will be dead paper books and documents are rarely used or accessed most twentieth century paper documents of interest have been scanned and are available through the wireless network kurzweil predicted wrong though the net revenue of the u s book publishing industry has decreased since 2014 the industry still sold 675 million print books and brought in nearly 26 billion in 2018 according to the association of american publishers annual report 4 your

do not think it is possible to go through daily life without having data collected about them by companies or the government according to a survey of u s adults by pew research center more than 80 say the potential risks they face because of data collection by companies outweigh the benefits 5 world s population will reach 8 billion in 1994 the international food policy research institute projected the world population would increase by 2 5 billion to reach 8 billion by 2020 india pakistan bangladesh and the continent of africa would add 1 5 billion people the institute predicted close but no cigar the world s population is 7 7 billion according to a report in june from the united nations the report expects the population to grow by 2 billion in the next 30 years around 2027 india is projected to overtake china as the world s most populous country the report says 6 china will be the world s largest economy speaking of china in a 1997 article titled the long boom futurists peter schwartz and peter leyden said china would be on top by 2020 the chinese economy has grown to be the largest in the world though the u s economy is more technologically sophisticated and its population more affluent china and the united states are basically on a par they said close in 2019 china still trailed the united states as the world s second largest economy by nominal gdp recent reports predict that china and india will overtake the united states by 2030 7 we ll have self driving cars self driving cars are being experimented with in the late 1990s with implementation on

reaching 67 to 70 the main motive for this in europe is cost to the state governments feel that if retirement ages are not raised the burden of paying pensions will be so high that working people will not be prepared to pay the tax levels necessary to fund them mcrae wrote no in the usa the average retirement age in 2016 was 65 for men and 63 for women according to the center for retirement research that number has stayed relatively steady for men over the past few decades but has increased for women for full social security benefits the age is slowly climbing and depends on the year that you were born some european countries set 67 as retirement age the earliest age when citizens can start withdrawing pensions and several plan to raise the age in the next few years according to the finnish center for pensions for many europeans the topic is a matter of fierce debate 9 americans will vote electronically from home as the millennial generation comes of age they ll be able to vote electronically from home schwartz and leyden predicted possibly as soon as the presidential election of 2008 not yet amid fears of foreign interference in u s elections lawmakers aren t about to let you vote in next year s presidential election on your iphone proponents of online voting say it could improve turnout and prevent voter suppression at polling stations startups are developing solutions for online voting such as the voatz mobile voting platform which has used biometric facial recognition in at least four public election pilots in the usa last year west virginia began using voatz for absentee voting for military personnel stationed overseas in one utah county citizens with a disability were able to vote electronically on their smartphones in a 2019 municipal general election 10 china will be on a path to democracy schwartz and leyden predicted that despite taking draconian measures to avoid an internal crisis in the first decade of the new century china is generally acknowledged to be on a path toward more democratic politics though not in the image of the west not really china faces scrutiny over human rights abuses against pro democracy protesters in hong kong and against nearly 1 million uighurs a predominantly muslim population members of which have been arbitrarily detained and imprisoned in reeducation camps in china s xinjiang region 11 we ll

refueling schwartz and leyden predicted that by 2010 hydrogen would be processed in refinery like plants and loaded onto cars that can go thousands of miles and many months before refueling by 2020 they said almost all new cars would be hybrid vehicles mostly using hydrogen power what s the future of the auto industry hydrogen cars appear to give way to electric not yet toyota and honda lead the hydrogen powered car market but it s an uphill battle against competitors peddling battery powered electric vehicles in 2018 2 300 hydrogen fuel cell vehicles were sold in the usa less than 1 of the number of electric cars sold according to insideevs which covers electric vehicle news in other green transportation news last year european railway manufacturer alstom launched the world s first hydrogen fuel cell train and next year london is likely to roll out double decker hydrogen powered buses 13 heart disease depression will be world s top diseases in 1996 the harvard school of public health and the world health organization predicted that by 2020 the world s top two causes of the global burden of disease a measurement of the number of healthy life years lost because of sickness disability or early death would be ischemic coronary heart disease and unipolar major clinical depression at the time the leading causes were lower respiratory infections such as pneumonia and diarrheal diseases the study said close in 2017 the most recent year that the data set was published the five leading causes of the global burden of disease were neonatal disorders ischaemic heart disease stroke lower respiratory infections and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 14 global surface temperature will increase climate predictions tend to have a longer range but here s a snapshot of where 2020 stands a report in 1995 by the intergovernmental panel on climate change predicted that the average global surface temperature could increase by about 3 6 degrees fahrenheit by 2100 the report predicted that sea level could increase by about 20 inches by the same year on track with 80 years to go both predictions appear possible the global average temperature has risen a tad more than 1 degree fahrenheit since the mid 90s according to noaa since 1992 the global sea level has risen a total of more than 3 inches according to noaa more were the predictions we made about climate change 20 years ago accurate here s a look 15 humans will set foot on mars a report in 1996 by the space studies board of the national research council said nasa would launch possible human exploratory missions to the moon and mars within the next quarter century predicting that humans would land on mars by 2018 schwartz and leyden envisioned a similar scenario in 2020 humans arrive on mars the four astronauts touch down and beam their images back to the 11 billion people sharing in the moment the expedition is a joint effort supported by virtually all nations on the planet the

antigravity belts will revolutionize warfare imagine a world where battles are fought a few feet above the ground as soldiers hover in midair in 1968 mathematician and scientist d g brennan predicted

photo credit jns labour against anti semitism via twitter originally posted to the besa website the resounding victory of the conservative party in the british general election has brought palpable relief to british jews and advocates of the atlantic alliance advertisement analyses of the results have stressed labour leader jeremy corbyn s personal responsibility for his party s near obliteration a shrill and doctrinaire socialist corbyn was both personally unlikeable and an incompetent manager as well as a notable friend to hamas hezbollah the ira and the soviet union labour under corbyn and the momentum faction abandoned the working class to become a creature of the urban middle class stressing class warfare against the rich avant garde wokeness and fantastically unrealistic investment schemes in contrast the outwardly buffoonish boris johnson pursued a cunning plan he systematically marginalized brexit opponents within his own party ran a leadership campaign against theresa may and chanced a general election all in order to bring about brexit at the same time he promised an end to fiscal austerity and massive new government spending on social concerns other observers have noted that this canny combination of left wing economics and mild nationalism served to rally the working class to the tories as well as to at least partially short circuit the far right arguably this represents a viable approach for the democratic party for britain s jews the labour party s antisemitism crisis was a paramount issue the crisis which began with bds in labour groups on university campuses rapidly embroiled the entire party and its leadership in the process it revealed a sordid antisemitic subculture among labour activists and members and within britain s left wing and muslim cultures at every turn more evidence was uncovered of corbyn s personal antipathy toward jews and israel the situation developed into a very public view into ugly antisemitism from the abuse thrown at public figures such as rachel riley the documentation of antisemitism from hundreds of labour party members leaks from within the party itself that showed strenuous efforts to cover up antisemitism and even statements from intellectuals and from dozens of labour members not to vote for the party the response from british jews was equally unprecedented jews and their allies gathered in mass protest and chief rabbi ephraim mirvis warned gravely of the existential threat to british jewish life the party s response to its antisemitism crisis was to dissemble cover up and blame the victims the greatest lesson of the british experience for american jews and for israel is to avoid complacency famously reticent british jews were late to speak out on the perversion of the labour party and did so in unity only a few months shy of the december election compounding the problem was the fact that in the years prior to the election labour constructed jewish front groups deliberately misled the jewish community and britain as a whole about the party s antisemitism crisis american jews are far less quiet than their british counterparts but their sheer political and religious diversity has long been a source of both strength and weakness still worse for jewish unity is widespread communal ignorance and apathy not least about israel and class based pressures to conform to emergent social attitudes regarding wokeness as in britain american jewish complacency has been exploited by left wing groups first by those constructed by the obama wing of the democratic party like j street and then more recently by far left anti zionist groups like ifnotnow which are funded by wealthy individuals and foundations legacy jewish organizations have proven weak and hesitant about speaking out on the problem of left wing anti zionism and antisemitism following their capitulation to political correctness over islamic terrorism and the subversive effects of american islamism as a whole making matters worse american jews and others are stymied by a stilted and misleading conception of antisemitism as an exclusively right wing phenomenon the latest bloody antisemitic violence in jersey city showed that perpetrators from the left in that instance members of a bizarre black sect inspired by the nation of islam simply cannot be understood in the prevailing american constructs of racism in which jews are white and where racism only emanates from whiteness as with continuing violence against visible jews in new york the denial of the fact that most antisemitic violence emanates from other minorities has blinded too many jews to the nature of the problem and to its political enablers in the democratic establishment reality has thus deepened divisions in the american jewish community adding to the problem a longstanding bias among american jews against both christians and orthodox jews has created an instinct to unthinkingly adopt positions in opposition to those communities regardless of broader communal self interest an unknown majority of american jews will automatically support whatever democratic candidate is nominated regardless of professed socialism antipathy toward israel or empowering effects on left wing antisemitism simply because that candidate is not trump the endorsement of corbyn by prominent progressive democrats including alexandria ocasio cortez and the continuing rotation of antisemites and bds supporters on bernie sanders s and elizabeth warren s campaign staffs shows their willingness to class antisemitism as a separate and lesser form of abuse this is tantamount to its embrace regardless of sanders s jewish background what remains unclear is whether labour will introspect and change or even has the capacity to do so after its resounding defeat corbyn s refusal to resign as party leader before the election of a successor and the laying of blame by frustrated corbynites on the stupidity of the working class right wing media such as the bbc and of course the jews are obviously bad omens and while these responses have been met with sharp criticism of the party s anti semitic conduct under corbyn especially by london mayor sadiq khan it remains to be seen to what extent this vile legacy will be eradicated under labour s new leadership the democrats 2016 loss also sparked a sharp leftward turn and a continuing cycle of investigations and crypto legal efforts to remove trump the polarization greatly exacerbated splits in american society and introspection and centrism have been absent one lesson for the democrats is that stridently left wing positions that smack of punishment confiscation exorbitant taxation nationalization even in the name of fairness are unwelcome to a majority of voters that even britain a country with a long socialist history and longstanding nationalized institutions like the national health service rejected labour is telling democrats might also conclude from the british election result that overt antisemitism is unwelcome while it remains to be proven with detailed polling it appears that the self image and self respect of a majority of voters rejected association with the crude antisemitism represented by corbyn and the momentum faction in the far more vocally philosemitic us the lesson for democrats should be clear they should expunge antisemites from their ranks furthermore much of the electorate recognizes even if media and intellectuals cannot that trump is a philosemite however shockingly inarticulate and needy at the same time the bizarre affections of trump for jews and israel and the excessive embrace between trump and netanyahu have synchronized with the gradual corbynization of the democratic party like labour their turn away from israel and jews is structural a function of their becoming a party of educated middle class urbanites disgruntled minorities and smaller woke demographics their embrace of third worldism and socialism has alienated the american working class and shows little prospect of tacking back toward centrism even if the elderly joe biden becomes the candidate but centrism and a unifying national narrative are vital and american jews should loudly insist on them as economic and religious liberty are inextricably linked for israel the implications of the british elections are more difficult to discern british philosemitism has always been present but is easy to understate given the current political situation and the fraught history of britain s relationship with the middle east american philosemitism is of an entirely different order being foundational to the republic and its cultural makeup with democrats abandoning all aspects of american heritage and republicans locked into a cloying ignorant version the prospects for israel and indeed america itself are uncertain if not grim reestablishing a bipartisan consensus on israel may not be possible when a vocal faction of the democratic party vanguard believes american jews are wealthy manipulative white people and that their israeli cousins are violent settler colonialists israelis would be wise to refrain from commenting on internal democratic politics but they will likely be forced to do so if only to counter the dominance of palestinian islamist and socialist voices within the party traditional lines of argument about israel being the only middle eastern democracy and a dependable ally in an unstable region are also unlikely to work given that democrats appear anxious to jettison existing foreign alliances and re embrace iran nor will appeals to israel s liberal society when the inevitable retort is that such claims simply whitewash the occupation which is equated with israel s existence republican arguments that israel is an expression of god s will only muddy waters and polarize debate further as the 2019 elections were for britain the 2020 elections will be an inflection point for the us israelis american jews and americans of all religious stripes who are concerned about liberty and the two party system should speak out now to forestall the victory of a corbynesque faction in a global superpower alex joffe is a shillman ingerman fellow at the middle east forum and a senior non resident scholar at the besa center

pas and misunderstandings awaiting you in the land of smiles the smiles can be very real but there s also hidden dangers and scams awaiting the newbies a few hours on the internet will save you a lot of pain really it s no different than most other places in the world in that regard top 10 scams in thailand read here top 10 things not to do in thailand read here top 10 hard truths of living as an expat in thailand read here on the plus side there is an established expat community outdoor activities are almost endless and you re living in one of the most dynamic and stable economic regions of the world politics mmmm this is a difficult one to explain to foreigners from the outside it looks like thailand is run by a quasi military government with a veneer of democracy and elections from the inside thai life stumbles along with a growing economy and compared to many other countries a stable economy thailand has a long history of military coups since it became a constitutional monarchy in 1932 the thai royal family still enjoys strong respect amongst thais the new king hm maha vachiralongkorn has certainly become more hands on than his father king bhumibol adulyadej who was on the throne from 1946 2016 but the king with the support of the royal family remains as the head of state in all thai constitutions since 1932 all governments even army coups need the support of the thai monarch to be enacted bottomline the daily political life of thailand provides despite plenty of criticism a stable country for its citizens there is a focus certainly by thai media on the machinations and drama of thai politics but in truth thailand has proven a stable and safe place for expats and retirees over the past five decades visas the first obstacle to entering any country is getting a visa retiring to thailand is so popular that there is a specific visa classification for that the non immigrant o visa covers a number of reasons for entering thailand as the name suggests and one of them is retirement to qualify for a retirement visa you need to meet two basic requirements you must be at least 50 years old you must have proof that you can financially support yourself you can either have a monthly income of 65 000 baht or you must have 800 000 baht in a thai bank account for the 800 000 option you need to be able to prove that the money has been in your account for at least two months before applying for the visa you must also still have at least 400 000 baht in your account for at least three months after you get the visa in other words you need to actually have the money you can t just borrow it for a few days to meet the visa requirements the visa will need to be renewed annually and you ll still need to meet these requirements each time you need to report to an immigration office every 90 days any immigration office around the country is ok these days the 90 day reporting can be completed online once registered if you decide to do a 90 day report in person it doesn t take long once you get to the front of the queue arrive early if you want to keep your visit short dressing with a neat collared shirt will always go down well at the immigration offices actually that goes for just about anywhere in thailand you ll also need visa application form completely filled out passport or travel document with at least 18 months of validity remaining recent passport sized photograph 3 5 x 4 5 centimetre taken within the past 6 months evidence of adequate finances as above proof that you have retired applying for the non immigrant o visa isn t too difficult but requires the paperwork to be properly prepared there are also many agents in thailand who will do the legwork for you and advise you as you go for a fee getting a recommendation for a reliable visa agent is always better than trawling through the internet and hoping for the best there will be a few bumps along the way all the paperwork and forms are in thai language to start with and an agent on your team will make things a lot smoother of course you can do all this by yourself but prepared for a few speed bumps all immigration offices in the main population centres have volunteer international staff who are an excellent first stop when you visit immigration they will check your documentation and advise before you end up sitting in front of a thai immigration official while the requirement of an income when you re supposed to be retired is counter intuitive this can take the form of a pension or passive income so you ll therefore need to set up a means of regularly transferring money into the country there are various options available for transferring your pension or other passive income into the country thai banking is very modern and all banks have safe phone apps to do international transfers the quickest and simplest approach to transferring money from an international port is to use a remittance service as the fees are lower the transfer is instant and the exchange rate is better using a bank transfer is also possible but is slower and generally less cost effective if you re looking at how to retire in thailand from the uk it s worth looking into qrops qualifying recognised overseas pension scheme which may enable you to relocate your pension to thailand so that it pays out directly into your thai bank account according to blog deemoney com however retirees from other countries may have to look into private pension schemes and particularly into the regulations regarding how they pay out cost of living in thailand the good news is that 65 000 baht per month or an 800 000 baht lump sum can go a long way in thailand particularly if you pick where to retire with a degree of care bangkok phuket koh samui pattaya chiang mai and hua hin are the most popular there s also a growing expat community in the north east of the country aka isaan each region has its own benefits and attractions cities and tourist areas are going to be more expensive than up country in central thailand bangkok is a large asian city with a cosmopolitan culture and everything you d expect and more than any other major city in the world getting around is increasingly easy if you re willing to go public and take short hops on motorbike taxis driving yourself around bangkok will drive you insane phuket is the largest island in thailand on the andaman sea it was once a tropical paradise now it s a growing urban island but still has all the same amazing beaches just a lot more tourists approximately the west side of the island is expensive and where a lot of the tourists hangout the east side is a lot cheaper and residential koh samui is the second largest island in thailand but in the gulf of thailand it s a smaller version of phuket with more of an island feel than its larger cousin it suffers from an airline monopoly that makes it expensive to get there by air there s also ferry services connecting you to the mainland pattaya is well pattaya it became famous as an r r location for american soldiers during the korean war then the vietnam war then it built on its r r reputation by becoming a popular destination for western tourists mostly male in the 70s and 80s since then its thrived as a sex tourism destination but over the past decade has become much more cosmopolitan and cleaned up its act with classy tourism attractions food scene and hi rise condos chiang mai is the northern thai capital very laid back and steeped in the lanna culture it s a flat easy to get around city surrounded by beautiful hills and a growing eco tourism scene hua hin is a quieter seaside destination a favourite for bangkok weekenders it now attracts a growing expat scene it s a coastal strip facing the gulf of thailand about 3 4 hour easy drive to the capital cost of living when it comes to figuring out some basic costs of retiring in thailand your personal cost of living will vary a lot depending how and where you choose to live you can probably live as cheaply as 30 000 40 000 baht per month if you re prepared to live as a local and rough it a bit and not in a touristy area for bangkok a comfortable one bedroom apartment about 10 15 000 baht per month utilities including internet phone water and electricity about 2 500 4 000 baht per month food eating local food 100 300 baht per day food eating mostly foreign food about 300 1000 baht per day 1 beer 100 150 baht depending on the brand and where you buy it comprehensive medical insurance 4 000 10 000 baht per month you would be mad not to have full medical insurance some other notes on cost of living foreign goods can be heavily taxed and may cost more in thailand than where you came from anything involving local labour will likely cost a lot less massages maintenance car services etc if you choose to live in a beach resort near the beach eating international food and drinking imported beer all day it will cost you more than you think health insurance health insurance is a big consideration for older expats and will eventually become a critical issue whilst thailand has an excellent and mostly free public health system for thais and employees including foreigners of thai companies that doesn t extend to retirees as an expat you can use the thailand s public health system for a cost the public system gets mixed reviews by foreigners but generally the medical care is good if not as glamorous as the private hospitals but public will cost you a lot less than the country s private hospitals these are very good indeed but come with a high price tag but note that most of the thai doctors working in the private system in thailand usually work in the public sector as well once you re over a certain age 70 maybe 75 many international private health schemes will drop you off their list you need to check these details the age limits and your options once you are left to fend for yourself your best health asset as a retiree is to avoid ending up in a hospital in the first place preventative health is your best option and opportunities for a fun and healthy lifestyle abound in the land of smiles sadly there are many stories of expat retirees that get into bad habits end up with health problems and no insurance who then fall between the cracks of thai life and wither away don t let this be you property you can rent or buy property depending on what your goals are the thaiger would always recommend renting at least for a while to see how you settle in perhaps even renting for a month in a number of locales to give yourself a chance to try before you buy and commit to a long term stay buying property in thailand is an entire post of its own here s a detailed website for just about

depths who will lead future nations and which ones will be global superpowers will planet earth even exist as we known it i shall not be surprised if on my 92nd birthday i am able to go for a ride in an antigravity car mathematician and scientist d g brennan wrote in 1968 some like brennan were overly optimistic others were spot on here s what happened what didn t and what was just plain crazy 1 life expectancy will rise to over 100 futurist ray kurzweil predicted in 1999 that human life expectancy would rise to over one hundred by 2019 computerized health monitors built into watches jewelry and clothing which diagnose both acute and chronic health conditions are widely used in addition to diagnosis these monitors provide a range of remedial recommendations and interventions he wrote in the age of spiritual machines nope while kurzweil may have accurately predicted health related gadgets such as fitness watches bioscarves and ekg apps for your smartphone he jumped the gun on life expectancy in 2019 the average life expectancy of the global population was 72 6 years according to the united nations that average is slightly higher in the u s at 78 6 years in 2017 according to a report in the journal of the american medical association while life expectancy in many industrialized nations continues to inch up it has been going in the opposite direction in america the u n

year 2019 including invisible computers computers are now largely invisible they are embedded everywhere in walls tables chairs desks clothing jewelry and bodies people routinely use three dimensional displays built into their glasses or contact lenses this display technology projects images directly into the human retina keyboards and cables would also become rare he said it s true computers are embedded everywhere these days we have smart homes smart tables smart chairs smart desks and more while we may not project images directly into our retinas google glass comes pretty close per kurzweil

say they do not think it is possible to go through daily life without having data collected about them by companies or the government according to a new survey of u s adults by pew research center more than 80 say that the potential risks they face because of data collection by companies outweigh the benefits 5 world s population will reach 8 billion in 1994 the international food policy research institute projected the world population would increase by 2 5 billion to reach 8 billion by 2020 india pakistan bangladesh and the continent of africa would add another 1 5 billion people

with implementation on majors highways feasible during the first decade of the twenty first century kurzweil wrote kind of dozens of companies including tesla google spinoff waymo and ridesharing

british commentator and editor hamish mcrae foresaw retirement ages reaching 67 to 70 the main motive for this in europe is cost to the state governments feel that if retirement ages are not raised the burden of paying pensions will be so high that working people will not be prepared to pay the tax levels necessary to fund them mcrae wrote no in the u s the average retirement age in 2016 was 65 for men and 63 for women according to the center for retirement research that number has stayed relatively stagnant for men over the last few decades but has increased for women for full social security benefits however the age is slowly climbing and depends on the year that you were born some european countries set 67 as retirement age the earliest age when citizens can start withdrawing pensions and several plan to raise the age in the next few years according to the finnish center for pensions for many europeans the topic is a matter of fierce debate 9 americans will vote electronically from home as the millennial generation comes of age they ll be able to vote electronically from home schwartz and leyden predicted possibly as soon as the presidential election of 2008 not yet amid fears of foreign interference in u s elections lawmakers aren t about to let you vote in next year s presidential election on your iphone proponents of online voting however say it could improve turnout and prevent voter suppression at polling stations start ups are developing solutions for online voting such as the voatz mobile voting platform which has used biometric facial recognition in at least four public election pilots in the u s last year west virginia began using voatz for absentee voting for military personnel stationed overseas in one utah county citizens with a disability were able to vote electronically on their smartphones in a 2019 municipal general election 10 china will be on a path to democracy schwartz and leyden predicted that despite taking draconian measures to avoid an internal crisis in the first decade of the new century china is generally acknowledged to be on a path toward more democratic politics though not in the image of the west not really in 2019 china faces increasing scrutiny for human rights abuses against pro democracy protesters in hong kong and against nearly 1 million uighurs a predominantly muslim population who

refinery like plants and loaded onto cars that can go thousands of miles and many months before refueling by 2020 they said almost all new cars would be hybrid vehicles mostly using hydrogen power what s the future of the auto industry hydrogen cars appear to give way to electric not yet toyota and honda are leading the hydrogen powered car market but it s an uphill battle against competitors peddling battery powered electric vehicles in 2018 2 300 hydrogen fuel cell vehicles were sold in the u s less than 1 of the number of electric cars sold according to insideevs which covers electric

decker hydrogen powered buses 13 heart disease depression will be world s top diseases in 1996 the harvard school of public health and the world health organization predicted that by 2020 the world s top two causes of the global burden of disease a measurement of the number of healthy life years lost due to sickness disability or early death were expected to be ischemic coronary heart disease and unipolar major clinical depression at the time the leading causes were lower respiratory infections like pnuemonia and diarrheal diseases the study said close in 2017 the most recent year that the data set was published coronary heart disease was the second leading cause of the global burden of disease not depression the five leading causes were neonatal disorders ischaemic heart disease stroke lower respiratory infections and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 14 global surface temperature will increase climate predictions tend to have a longer range but here s a snapshot of where 2020 stands a 1995 report by the intergovernmental panel on climate change predicted that the average global surface temperature could increase by about 3 6 degrees fahrenheit 2 degrees celsius by 2100 or anywhere between an increase of 1 degrees celsius to 3 5 degrees celsius depending on global emissions the report also predicted that sea level could increase by about 20 inches by the same year on track with 80 years still to go both predictions appear possible the global average temperature has risen a tad more than a 1 degree fahrenheit about 0 6 degrees celsius since the mid 90s according to noaa and since 1992 the global sea level has risen a total of more than 3 inches according to noaa 15 humans will step foot on mars a 1996 report by the space studies board of the national research

diagnostics several groups are testing smart lenses that would measure glucose levels in the tears of people with diabetes 3 books will be dead papers books and documents are rarely used or accessed

unipolar major clinical depression at the time the leading causes were lower respiratory infections like pnuemonia and diarrheal diseases the study said close in 2017 the most recent year that the data set was published coronary heart disease was the second leading cause of the global burden of disease not depression the five leading causes were neonatal disorders ischaemic heart disease stroke lower respiratory infections and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 14 global surface temperature will increase climate predictions tend to have a longer range but here s a snapshot of where 2020 stands a 1995 report by the intergovernmental panel on climate change predicted that the average global surface temperature could increase by about 3 6 degrees fahrenheit 2 degrees celsius by 2100 or anywhere between an increase of 1 degrees celsius to 3 5 degrees celsius depending on global emissions the report also predicted that sea level could increase by about 20 inches by the same year on track with 80 years still to go both predictions appear possible the global average temperature has risen a tad more than a 1 degree fahrenheit about 0 6 degrees celsius since the mid 90s according to

feature article 22 12 2019 listen kevin taylor is at best a nuisance whose propagandistic rants against the akufo addo led government of the new patriotic party npp will amount to the proverbial hill of beans the fact of the matter is that the decision by governor ernest addison of the bank of ghana bog to introduce the new ghȼ 100 and 200 denominations into circulation is based squarely on the economic realities of the times in particular the level of inflation over at least some 10 years there is absolutely no unreflective or auto kneejerk motive behind this policy change unlike the kind of gross incompetence that characterized and precipitated the veritable shinplaster that was the cedi currency notes printed and recklessly circulated by the operatives of the rawlings led junta of the so called provisional national defense council pndc and subsequently the rawlings led veritable one party dictatorship that was the first eight years or two terms of the national democratic congress ndc there is absolutely no policy decision taken by the current governor of the bank of ghana including the introduction of the ȼ 2 coin that has not been done in any of the most advanced civilized democracies around the world one would rather have expected this inveterate critic of president akufo addo and the clinically blind mahama partisan to have either written a column or done a youtube presentation commending his political archnemesis for literally putting his money where his proverbial mouth is by facilitating the salutary refreshingly restorative and therapeutic conferral of citizenship on some 126 diaspora africans largely african caribbeans or afro caribbeans and african americans on thursday november 28 2019 you see when former president john dramani mahama had the chance to wisely reconcile ghana and the rest of the african continent with its hideous slavery past the bole bamboi savannah region native chose instead to grant citizenship and diplomatic status to some arab terror suspects captured in the killing fields of afghanistan and legitimately detained for a dozen years in a maximum security prison in the united states naval base on guantanamo bay cuba into our very peaceful country at least in the post rawlings era this is the kind of self hating leader that mr taylor would have ghanaians and the rest of the world believe has higher moral principles and greater leadership competence than nana akufo addo there is absolutely no irony or contradiction here as some critics of this new currency policy measure would have the rest of the general ghanaian public believe yes it is true that the government has initiated policy measures to eventually move ghanaian society towards an electro cashless economy but even as governor addison aptly pointed out this progressive policy initiative cannot be achieved in the offing or the immediate future while approximately 75 percent of ghanaians in the business community at least for now prefer to deal in hard currency at any rate the introduction of the ȼ 100 and ȼ 200 paper currency denominations has not given our expert economists and policymakers any credible and or reasonable cause to suspect the likelihood of any precipitous cedi depreciation in the offing so where is the waste that ardent and inveterate akufo addo critics like mr taylor are jiving about of course we need to know the total cost of having the new cedi denominations printed but we are also quite certain that the total expenditure for this well considered fiscal policy is quite certain to be much cheaper that the humongous judgment debt payouts gleefully and recklessly engineered and supervised by the four and half year mahama led kleptocratic regime of the national democratic congress as well even as yours truly pointed out in a previous column here in the united stets we have at least 12 paper currency denominations including 500 10 000 and 100 000 one hundred thousand dollar notes we need to also remember that grandstanding and all under the tenure of the self righteous founding father of the national democratic congress that is chairman jerry john rawlings ghana s currency notes were reckoned or commercially calculated in the millions indeed so deeply and cancerously irreparable and practically indelible was the psychological trauma and gash or running sore that was visited on the average ghanaian psyche by chairman rawlings and his p ndc abongo boys that even as i write some ghanaian adults have yet to progressively transition from counting their cedi currency notes in the millions into the far more rational and mathematically manageable current regime of pesewas singles tens hundreds and on occasion a couple of thousands and a few millions if any at all you see the abject hypocrisy of these ndc political scumbags appears to know absolutely no end that is the wasteful change that mr taylor and his blindly pro ndc touts ought to be writing and talking about visit

does anyone know what cop25 stands for probably very few it s unimportant as unimportant as the whole roadshow itself just for the hell of it for those who read this article cop means conference of the parties cop to the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc the 25 stands for the 25th year that such annual conferences have taken place every year in another country what a tourist bonanza for the hundreds if not thousands of attendees and participants who travel by air many of them business class to these most questionable even useless conferences the first of the cop summits took place in berlin germany in march 1995 the cop s presidency rotates among the 5 un recognized regions and so do the conferences to make eco tourism most of the time for the same un and government bureaucrats and jokers more attractive i can t help thinking of the enormous cost of these conferences travel food lodging and everything in between for two weeks in the case of cop25 madrid 2 16 december 2019 two days more than planned because after the scheduled two weeks no agreements were reached so it was decided to add two days add to this all the preparatory meetings and related travels tens of millions of dollars possibly more are spent for nothing absolutely zilch nada that s the officially recognized outcome at the end of the extended cop25 in madrid nothing there are un staff directors mostly at the un in geneva and in new york who earn huge salaries in the hundreds of thousands a year for doing what some of them are directing their staff to prepare the extravagant but mostly useless cops and of course they are also attending them when i see monetary figures like this and we are now talking of only one kind of un conference it occurs to me that this is money stolen from the poor it is taken from the very people whom the un is committed by its charter to help how many simple drinking water supply and sanitation systems could you build with all this money how many millions of people could you serve with the money wasted for such conferences with safe drinking water and safe sanitation according to the who unicef joint monitoring program jmp some 2 1 billion people have no safe drinking water at home and more than twice this number lacks safe sanitation at the same time these agencies also monitor the death toll among less than 5 year old children from unsafe water and sanitation from the lack of hygiene from diarrheal diseases nearly 400 000 die per year in addition contaminated water and poor sanitation also contribute to the transmission of cholera dysentery hepatitis a and typhoid this does not even take into account those who die due to a famine reduced immune system precious money deviated from the un system by men invented rather unproductive but usually lush conferences of which the cops are just one category could save millions of lives this is a real environmental issue in fact more vital than just environment it is environmental health it is certainly competing in importance with the man made co2 issue climate change is happening no doubt it always did for the 4 5 billion years of mother earth s existence but the way the west is dealing with it is a sheer farce no it s actually worse much worse it s criminal because it s knowingly made into a commercial globalized profit making enterprise knowingly because the elite that pulls the strings behind these events the same who finance greta thunberg are well aware of what they are doing and why they are doing what they are doing it helps none but global corporate finance those who suffer most are the people living in the global south which is as with most natural disasters most affected by naturally occurring climate change it s still worse because the western propaganda message promises actions towards saving the world from climate change which are entirely deceptive so the poor are again being lied to they are being lured into making huge investments with huge loans the world bank imf and bilateral lending institutions let alone wall street stand ready loans and interest which the borrowing countries have to repay if they can t they have to give their collateral meaning let the west privatize their public services and assets and grab their natural resources for a pittance that s how it works the west preventing climate change from happening not to mention the enormous arrogance with which the eminent cop attendees pretend humans can control mother earth s temperature fluctuations i e to less than 2 degrees c or arguing whether we almighty humans should agree on limiting a temperature rise in the next 30 or 50 or 100 years to 2 or 3 degrees c exceeds any reasonable level of human absurdity and conceit our assumed power over nature is at best ridiculous the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc is the united nations body for assessing the science related to climate change ipcc has 195 members and some 2000 scientists who contribute to ipcc s work any serious scientist knows that the main cause for climate change are variations of solar activities but they sell us co2 as chief villain knowing well that the world especially the western world functioning under a turbo neoliberal corporate and finance driven capitalist system based on eternal consumption and eternal growth which drives the ever growing profit margins will not change its behavior vis à vis nature unless it collapses under its own weight not with a million cops it will change its profit making thinking and business motives these mostly famous scientists know it if they don t follow the line they risk losing their reputation and who knows their jobs ice core records studied by scientists combined with many types of proxy records to reconstruct past atmospheres and environmental conditions back from thousands to many millions of years suggest that climate changes in large cycles and within them in smaller cycles for example it appears that between 2 6 and 5 3 million years ago during the pliocene epoch co2 levels were comparable to those of today models suggest global temperatures were 3 to 4 degrees c warmer than pre industrial levels similar patterns were repeated 400 000 to 600 000 years ago what is important to notice though is that temperatures rise first followed by co2 levels which is logical since the sun is heating the earth it is the complete opposite to what today s climate gurus are telling us in the second half of the 1900s nasa studied during some 30 years temperature fluctuations in the pacific ocean investigating causes and effects of el niño the result was similar the higher the water temperature of the pacific the more co2 was released by the sea into the atmosphere high co2 levels are eventually followed by lower temperatures the world still runs mainly on unrenewable energy mostly hydrocarbons oil gas and even coal the chief producers of co2 of course we should stop using hydrocarbons and convert our economic systems to renewable energies hydrocarbons with their carbon dioxide output pollute the air soil surface and underground water ways they contaminate even our food their secondary and tertiary products plastic bottles and plastic related packing materials most of which are not biodegradable contaminate our oceans our landscapes and kill wildlife but who convinces the highly profitable petrol titans packaging giants not to mention the pharma industry which also thrives on petrochemicals to turn the wheel back to the 1950 s and 1960s when we went to the corner stores to buy our staple food like rice sugar flour potatoes in bulk put it in used and reusable paper bags we were not unhappier than we are today to the contrary cancer rates were considerably lower in 1960 co2 levels in the atmosphere stood on average at 316 ppm we had no cell phones time moved slower and importantly in the fifties and sixties we lived even in the west in a world more or less in balance we used less than the total of the resources mother earth generously provides for us in the mid sixties during the post wwii economic boom we started rapidly exceeding the world s resources balance today the west or global north uses some 4 times as many resources as mother earth can provide in africa and some parts of asia that ratio is between 0 5 and 0 6 but no worries there comes a point when mother earth will self regenerate that means with a break from us destructive humans looking at geo history that has most likely happened already a few times civilizations disappeared often suicide by greed and once mother earth has recovered she may give mankind another chance she has a lot of patience in 2009 at the time of the in famous copenhagen climate conference the average level of co2 in the air was 386 ppm the goal was to reduce the level to 350 ppm ten years later the copenhagen climate conference coined the 350 sologan in november 2019 the carbon dioxide level has exceeded 410 ppm and rising it is an illusion to believe that big business big industry big finance and big growth driven profit will yield to environmental or climate concerns and again those who call the shots know it but they keep fooling the world making the purposefully brainwashed and poorly informed populace believe that special taxes for example on flying or other taxes on hydrocarbon based energy will make a difference or that carbon credits will improve the environment this is of course nonsense and the taxes eventually end up in the pockets of the usual villain the globalized private banking system instead of being dedicated to intense research into alternative energies such efforts happen only in china and russia in the west intense research into solar energy the ultimate renewable energy is not allowed to happen the big energy lobbies hydrocarbon nuclear and even hydropower will block any such attempt can you imagine the sun provides the earth with more than 10 000 times as much energy per day than what we use in the entire world in the same period carbon credits are the most ludicrous deceitful banking invention of the last 50 years how do they work a huge corporation in the global north instead of making the necessary investments to reduce their co2 output it buys carbon credits from a country in the global south where the pollution level is below a certain limit so the northern corporation may continue postponing the co2 reducing investments and the country in the global south should theoretically invest the money it got from the carbon credit sale into alternative energy or otherwise environmentally friendly projects it hardly ever happens many of these countries lack the projects and or the absorptive capacity for the required investments and even when it does happen the carbon dioxide pollution of the monster corporation in the north continues what a farce maybe one day in the not too distant future the breakthrough will happen it must if we mankind want to survive and not collapse as civilization under the weight of our own wasteful growth based luxury lifestyle we suddenly see the light the sunlight and use it instead of co2 generating hydrocarbon and we free ourselves from this horrendous petro corporate dependency our arrogant climate control attitude temperature rise fixing and human manipulating by centigrade gone out of the window our linear 30 50 and 100 year projections gone finito what a feeling a feeling of real freedom a full change over of lifestyle this moment may come faster than we think the chinese always bashed by the west have been concentrating at least the last decade much of their research on efficient and sustainable renewable energy sun energy is in their focus the east is the future the east is where the sun rises first published by new eastern outlook neo
china tariffs will still cost us 316 billion by end of 2020 even after trade deal businesses and investors have welcomed the interim trade agreement president donald trump announced with china after more than a year of turbulent attempts to defuse tensions between the two sides but with the vast majority of punitive tariffs still in place and uncertainty about what might happen next the dispute is likely to continue to take a toll on the largest economies in this year alone economists estimate those costs could chip away at 0 3 to 0 7 of gross domestic product an analysis by bloomberg economics found that in 2019 dollar terms losses translate to 134 billion in lost gdp by the end of next year those costs are expected to jump to 316 billion that would more than offset any potential gains the trump administration said would come from the agreement it included unconfirmed purchases of american goods stricter rules around trade secrets and unspecified pledges on technology transfers the so called phase one deal lowered the tariff rate to 7 5 from 15 on chinese products that were hit in september which were valued at about 120 billion in 2017 and stalled the threat of further escalation yet a much steeper 25 tariff remains on roughly 250 billion worth of imports including machinery and electronics the phase one trade deal leaves most of the tariffs in place said ian shepherdson the chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics these are welcome developments for retailers wholesalers and importers of consumer goods but they offer no relief for manufacturers so we expect only a very modest bounce in the business surveys as a result of the deal according to the anti tariff advocacy group americans for free trade about 83 of the costs from the us china trade dispute are still in effect independent researchers from the new york federal reserve princeton and columbia estimated those tariffs would continue to cost roughly 831 per household this year in addition to higher costs businesses could also struggle to make plans as a result of the protracted trade dispute signs of stalled investment have become increasingly evident in sectors highly dependent on international businesses source business insider
jetpacks disintegrator rays nuclear energy mars decades ago academics futurists and government agencies cast their predictions of what would happen by the year 2020 would submarines reach historic depths who would lead nations and which ones would be global superpowers would planet earth even exist as we knew it i shall not be surprised if on my 92nd birthday i am able to go for a ride in an antigravity car mathematician and scientist d g brennan wrote in 1968 some like brennan were overly optimistic others were spot on here s what happened what didn t and what was just plain crazy 1 life expectancy will rise past 100 futurist ray kurzweil predicted in 1999 that human life expectancy would rise to over one hundred by 2019 computerized health monitors built into watches jewelry and clothing which diagnose both acute and chronic health conditions are widely used in addition to diagnosis these monitors provide a range of remedial recommendations and interventions he wrote in the age of spiritual machines nope while kurzweil may have accurately predicted health related gadgets such as fitness watches bioscarves and ekg apps for your smartphone he jumped the gun on life expectancy in 2019 the average life expectancy of the global population was 72 6 years according to the united nations that average is slightly higher in the usa at 78 6 years in 2017 according to a report in the journal of the american medical association though life expectancy in many industrialized nations continues to inch up it has been going in the opposite direction in america the united nation predicts the average global life expectancy to rise to 77 1 years by 2050 life expectancy what countries have the longest 2 computers will be invisible kurzweil had several other prophecies for the year 2019 including invisible computers computers are now largely invisible they are embedded everywhere in walls tables chairs desks clothing jewelry and bodies people routinely use three dimensional displays built into their glasses or contact lenses this display technology projects images directly into the human retina keyboards and cables would become rare he said it s true computers are embedded everywhere these days we have smart homes smart tables smart chairs smart desks and more though we may not project images directly into our retinas google glass comes pretty close per kurzweil s prediction scientists are developing smart contact lenses capable of monitoring the physiological information of the eye and tear fluid that could provide real time noninvasive medical diagnostics several groups are testing smart lenses that would measure glucose levels in the tears of people with diabetes 3 books will be dead paper books and documents are rarely used or accessed most twentieth century paper documents of interest have been scanned and are available through the wireless network kurzweil predicted wrong though the net revenue of the u s book publishing industry has decreased since 2014 the industry still sold 675 million print books and brought in nearly 26 billion in 2018 according to the association of american publishers annual report 4 your every move will be tracked kurzweil predicted that privacy would be a huge political and social issue and that each individual s practically every move will be stored in a database somewhere true most say your tv watches you your smartphone follows you your web browser traces your digital trail in an era when some populations worldwide live under 24 7 high tech surveillance most u s adults say they do not think it is possible to go through daily life without having data collected about them by companies or the government according to a survey of u s adults by pew research center more than 80 say the potential risks they face because of data collection by companies outweigh the benefits 5 world s population will reach 8 billion in 1994 the international food policy research institute projected the world population would increase by 2 5 billion to reach 8 billion by 2020 india pakistan bangladesh and the continent of africa would add 1 5 billion people the institute predicted close but no cigar the world s population is 7 7 billion according to a report in june from the united nations the report expects the population to grow by 2 billion in the next 30 years around 2027 india is projected to overtake china as the world s most populous country the report says 6 china will be the world s largest economy speaking of china in a 1997 article titled the long boom futurists peter schwartz and peter leyden said china would be on top by 2020 the chinese economy has grown to be the largest in the world though the u s economy is more technologically sophisticated and its population more affluent china and the united states are basically on a par they said close in 2019 china still trailed the united states as the world s second largest economy by nominal gdp recent reports predict that china and india will overtake the united states by 2030 7 we ll have self driving cars self driving cars are being experimented with in the late 1990s with implementation on majors highways feasible during the first decade of the twenty first century kurzweil wrote kind of dozens of companies including tesla google spinoff waymo and ride sharing giants uber and lyft are testing self driving vehicles in select locations such as boston las vegas phoenix and columbus ohio widespread use of a truly autonomous vehicle is not yet here experts say it might still be decades before we see a car that can drive anywhere it pleases self driving shuttle why a rhode island police officer pulled it over in april tesla ceo elon musk said the company would have fully self driving cars ready by the end of the year and a robotaxi version one that could ferry passengers without anyone behind the wheel ready for the streets next year tesla owners can summon their cars which can drive themselves from parking spots to the curb where the owner is standing what about flying cars porsche and boeing partnered to create premium urban air mobility vehicles and uber plans to launch a flying taxi service in 2023 planes are landing themselves 8 it will be normal to retire at 70 in his 1994 book the world in 2020 british commentator and editor hamish mcrae foresaw retirement ages reaching 67 to 70 the main motive for this in europe is cost to the state governments feel that if retirement ages are not raised the burden of paying pensions will be so high that working people will not be prepared to pay the tax levels necessary to fund them mcrae wrote no in the usa the average retirement age in 2016 was 65 for men and 63 for women according to the center for retirement research that number has stayed relatively steady for men over the past few decades but has increased for women for full social security benefits the age is slowly climbing and depends on the year that you were born some european countries set 67 as retirement age the earliest age when citizens can start withdrawing pensions and several plan to raise the age in the next few years according to the finnish center for pensions for many europeans the topic is a matter of fierce debate 9 americans will vote electronically from home as the millennial generation comes of age they ll be able to vote electronically from home schwartz and leyden predicted possibly as soon as the presidential election of 2008 not yet amid fears of foreign interference in u s elections lawmakers aren t about to let you vote in next year s presidential election on your iphone proponents of online voting say it could improve turnout and prevent voter suppression at polling stations startups are developing solutions for online voting such as the voatz mobile voting platform which has used biometric facial recognition in at least four public election pilots in the usa last year west virginia began using voatz for absentee voting for military personnel stationed overseas in one utah county citizens with a disability were able to vote electronically on their smartphones in a 2019 municipal general election 10 china will be on a path to democracy schwartz and leyden predicted that despite taking draconian measures to avoid an internal crisis in the first decade of the new century china is generally acknowledged to be on a path toward more democratic politics though not in the image of the west not really china faces scrutiny over human rights abuses against pro democracy protesters in hong kong and against nearly 1 million uighurs a predominantly muslim population members of which have been arbitrarily detained and imprisoned in reeducation camps in china s xinjiang region 11 we ll have personal companions in his 1999 book business the speed of thought bill gates predicted personal devices that connect and sync all your devices in a smart way whether they are at home or in the office and allow them to exchange data the device will check your email or notifications and present the information that you need when you go to the store you can tell it what recipes you want to prepare and it will generate a list of ingredients that you need to pick up it will inform all the devices that you use of your purchases and schedule allowing them to automatically adjust to what you re doing gates wrote hey alexa add milk to my shopping list though alexa isn t sorting through your emails that we know of and your smart thermostat isn t tracking your purchases gates isn t far off siri google assistant amazon alexa and an array of smart tech in the internet of things readily exchange data with your other devices and respond to commands 12 cars will be able to go months without refueling schwartz and leyden predicted that by 2010 hydrogen would be processed in refinery like plants and loaded onto cars that can go thousands of miles and many months before refueling by 2020 they said almost all new cars would be hybrid vehicles mostly using hydrogen power what s the future of the auto industry hydrogen cars appear to give way to electric not yet toyota and honda lead the hydrogen powered car market but it s an uphill battle against competitors peddling battery powered electric vehicles in 2018 2 300 hydrogen fuel cell vehicles were sold in the usa less than 1 of the number of electric cars sold according to insideevs which covers electric vehicle news in other green transportation news last year european railway manufacturer alstom launched the world s first hydrogen fuel cell train and next year london is likely to roll out double decker hydrogen powered buses 13 heart disease depression will be world s top diseases in 1996 the harvard school of public health and the world health organization predicted that by 2020 the world s top two causes of the global burden of disease a measurement of the number of healthy life years lost because of sickness disability or early death would be ischemic coronary heart disease and unipolar major clinical depression at the time the leading causes were lower respiratory infections such as pneumonia and diarrheal diseases the study said close in 2017 the most recent year that the data set was published the five leading causes of the global burden of disease were neonatal disorders ischaemic heart disease stroke lower respiratory infections and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 14 global surface temperature will increase climate predictions tend to have a longer range but here s a snapshot of where 2020 stands a report in 1995 by the intergovernmental panel on climate change predicted that the average global surface temperature could increase by about 3 6 degrees fahrenheit by 2100 the report predicted that sea level could increase by about 20 inches by the same year on track with 80 years to go both predictions appear possible the global average temperature has risen a tad more than 1 degree fahrenheit since the mid 90s according to noaa since 1992 the global sea level has risen a total of more than 3 inches according to noaa more were the predictions we made about climate change 20 years ago accurate here s a look 15 humans will set foot on mars a report in 1996 by the space studies board of the national research council said nasa would launch possible human exploratory missions to the moon and mars within the next quarter century predicting that humans would land on mars by 2018 schwartz and leyden envisioned a similar scenario in 2020 humans arrive on mars the four astronauts touch down and beam their images back to the 11 billion people sharing in the moment the expedition is a joint effort supported by virtually all nations on the planet the culmination of a decade and a half of intense focus on a common goal not quite though we haven t set foot on mars we ve landed eight unmanned spacecraft on the planet s surface 16 boris johnson would lead brexit in 1997 british news organization the independent forecast that in 2020 boris johnson would become a member of the cabinet of the united kingdom a decision making body composed of the prime minister and a team of handpicked members of parliament at the time johnson 32 was an outspoken editor and columnist but had not held public office not shy in clashing with party lines boris would renegotiate eu membership so britain stands to europe as canada not texas stands to the usa the journalists wrote pretty close have you heard of brexit johnson became prime minister in july he served in the cabinet starting in 2016 as foreign secretary under theresa may in december johnson led his conservative party to victory in a national election on the promise to get brexit done 17 antigravity belts will revolutionize warfare imagine a world where battles are fought a few feet above the ground as soldiers hover in midair in 1968 mathematician and scientist d g brennan predicted that antigravity belts would revolutionize the tactics of land warfare writing that even if the antigravity mechanism did not itself provide horizontal propulsion relatively modest sources of thrust could easily be provided he suspected that by 2018 humans would have antigravity cars and jetpacks capable of operating for 30 minutes no unless you re luke skywalker or buzz lightyear 18 nuclear will replace natural gas in 1968 stanford university professor charles scarlott predicted that nuclear breeder reactors would make up the majority of u s energy production by 2018 as natural gas faded energy from water power solar radiation the wind tides or earth heat will not figure large in the totals power from nuclear power plants should be available in large amounts at low cost scarlott wrote wrong in 2018 fossil fuels petroleum natural gas and coal accounted for about 79 of total u s primary energy production in 2018 according to the u s energy information administration about 12 was from renewable energy sources and about 9 was from nuclear electric power for the electrical power sector in particular nuclear creates 19 of energy 19 americans will work 26 hours a week in 1968 physicist herman kahn and futurist anthony j weiner said that by 2020 americans would work 1 370 hours a year or 26 hours a week instead of the 1 940 hours 37 hours a week that was average at the time unlikely though we work less than we did in 1968 the average american worked nearly 1 800 hours in 2018 35 hours a week according to the organisation for economic co operation and development 20 nationalism will wane in 1968 ithiel de sola pool a political science professor at the massachusetts institute of technology predicted that better communication easier translation and greater understanding of the nature of human motivations would make it easier for people to connect across ethnic and national lines by the year 2018 nationalism should be a waning force in the world he wrote the opposite is true fueled by backlash against immigration globalization and the political establishment populist nationalism was a driving force behind brexit the election of donald trump and the rise of right wing politicians in france austria italy hungary and poland among other countries academics said everywhere one looks in fact one sees nationalism at work in today s world stephen walt a professor of

mining stocks are publicly traded companies focused on finding extracting and processing deposits of valuable minerals and materials these substances include precious metals such as gold silver platinum and palladium industrial metals such as iron ore copper aluminum nickel lithium cobalt and zinc construction materials such as sand crushed stone and limestone energy materials including coal oil sands bitumen and uranium fertilizers such as boron potash and phosphate image source getty images many of these metals and materials are crucial to the global economy industries need the raw materials to build and manufacture goods products and infrastructure when the economy is expanding mined materials are in high demand which boosts prices however the mining industry is cyclical demand for mined materials tends to fall when the economy slows down mining stock prices typically decline during a recession that s a concern for investors in 2022 given the worries that surging inflation will force central banks to raise interest rates which could tip the global economy into a recession one factor causing inflation is russia s invasion of ukraine both countries play a major role in the iron and steel industries and are significant fertilizer producers if the war continues it could keep the upward pressure on those commodity prices given the mining industry s cyclicality investors need to focus their attention on mining stocks that can weather future economic storms let s dig into some of 2022 s best mining stocks and take a closer look at investing in the mining industry top mining stocks to buy in 2024 top mining stocks to buy in 2024 these are some of the top mining companies source company websites company description barrick gold nyse gold gold and copper mining bhp group nyse bhp diversified mining operations rio tinto nyse rio industrial metals mining here s a closer look at these top mining companies 1 barrick gold 1 barrick gold barrick gold is one of the largest gold miners in the world with operations in more than a dozen countries it s also a leading copper producer one thing that sets barrick gold apart from other precious metals companies is its focus on tier one mining assets it defines a tier one mine as one that produces more than 500 000 ounces per year has at least 10 years of productive life remaining delivers total cash costs per ounce in the lower half of the industry cost curve tier one mines produce a relatively steady supply of low cost gold and copper enabling barrick to continue making money when prices are low barrick gold s tier one mines can generate lots of cash allowing it to pay an attractive base dividend payment that it complements with a quarterly performance dividend payment that fluctuates with its cash balance data source barrick gold performance dividend level threshold level quarterly base dividend quarterly performance dividend quarterly total dividend level i net cash 0 and 0 5b and 1b 0 10per share 0 15per share 0 25per share 2 bhp group 2 bhp group bhp group is a diversified resources company it operates fully integrated mining assets that extract and process copper iron ore coal nickel zinc and potash its mining assets span the globe bhp group also had an oil and natural gas business but merged those assets with woodside petroleum wds 0 85 in a deal that closed in 2022 the merger transformed bhp into a pure play mining company although bhp group produces several commodities it primarily aims to be a low cost producer it efficiently operates large resource rich mines and uses technology such as autonomous vehicles to reduce costs the mining company s focus on minimizing expenses also helps to mute the impact of inflation bhp group combines its low cost operations with a strong balance sheet which it strengthens by routinely selling its least profitable mines and non core assets the mining company is well positioned to invest in high return expansion projects even when commodity prices are low its production volumes are relatively stable although there s some variability to its cash flow bhp s low costs enable it to generate free cash flow to reliably pay dividends and repurchase stock like barrick bhp group s dividend has some variability the company pays out at least 50 of its profits each reporting period in dividends so its dividend outlay will rise or fall with its cash flow 3 rio tinto 3 rio tinto rio tinto is a diversified mining company it s a leading producer of the three most consumed industrial metals iron ore aluminum and copper rio tinto also mines a variety of other metals and minerals including boron salt diamonds and titanium like bhp group rio tinto aims to be a low cost producer of metals and minerals it s able to keep costs down by operating mining assets that are integrated and big rio tinto s investments in new technologies such as autonomous vehicles and renewable energy reduce costs and increase productivity rio tinto has proven its ability to make money even during weak market conditions it has a strong balance sheet and routinely sells non core mines to reallocate cash to better opportunities for example in recent years it has exited the coal mining business due to the sector s dwindling prospects amid climate change concerns meanwhile in 2022 it offered to buy the outstanding shares of copper miner turquoise hill resources nyse trq that it doesn t already own the deal would simplify its ownership of the massive oyu tolgoi mine in mongolia making it easier to develop its extensive copper resources the company regularly expands its best mines and aggressively repays debt rio tinto is another mining company that pays dividends to shareholders and repurchases its own shares throughout the economic cycle it tries to pay 40 to 60 of its cash flow in dividends with payments varying each period depending on its earnings stay up to date the mining industry is rapidly changing in the current economic climate check out the latest articles in the feed below related investing topics should you invest should you buy mining stocks the mining industry is cyclical and capital intensive mining companies have more money to invest in new mines and expansion projects during periods of economic expansion however the long lead times required to complete projects often cause problems for mining companies projects developed during boom times frequently don t come online until after the cycle changes which affects returns investors in mining stocks should also pay close attention to the

hartford state reps mitch bolinsky r 106 jp sredzinski r 112 and state senator tony hwang r 28 have voted to support an agreement between connecticut hospitals and the state settling a nearly five year old lawsuit that threatened to expose the state to a roughly 4 billion liability the administration of governor ned lamont pulled back the curtain friday december 13 on the negotiations that produced a tentative settlement of a massive hospital tax lawsuit that would pay connecticut s hospitals 1 8 billion over seven years while costing the state 872 million administration officials told lawmakers in an informational hearing that the settlement is structured to limit the state s liability by leveraging 1 billion in federal funds this lawsuit was a mess inherited from a previous administration and legislature and in light of the damage the state could have confronted i think we avoided a real fiscal catastrophe with this agreement rep bolinsky said in a release we are now on a better footing with the hospital industry which provides a vital service to our communities and represents one of the fastest growing job sectors in the state this settlement will help taxpayers avoid a 4 billion potential liability for the state said sen hwang it was wrong that gov malloy abused the hospital tax system for many years promises were broken and hospitals were taken advantage of to balance past budgets ultimately hurting patients and employees and undercutting stability to our healthcare centers this settlement recognizes that the last administration s actions were wrong and it will help taxpayers avoid paying even more for those mistakes rep sredzinski in an e mail received december 19 said as i watched this process unfold over the last few years it became clear to me that this agreement is the best way to rectify missteps taken by previous legislatures ideally we wouldn t be in this situation to begin with but given that the hospital industry provides an essential service to our community and is one of the fastest growing job sectors in the state we as a government owe them fairness and transparency rep sredzinski added that the suit and its protracted resolution is a lesson learned we can t continue to kick the can down the road to avoid our budgetary problems said the lawmaker whose district covers southern newtown and monroe as i ve said all along fiscal responsibility not tax increases and more spending is the only way to dig the state out of the mess that it s in settlement specifics the settlement which was approved during a december 18 special session raises medicaid rates by 14 percent over seven years and it makes supplemental payments the officials say are medicaid eligible the deal will not be deemed final until reviewed and accepted by federal medicaid officials this settlement is perhaps one of the most significant to come before you for your consideration attorney general william tong told lawmakers during the earlier hearing it is the product of hundreds if not thousands of hours of negotiations on some of the most complex financial arrangements involving our state the litigation is an outgrowth of a hospital taxing scheme devised by the administration of governor dannel p malloy to increase federal reimbursements as originally conceived in 2011 hospitals would pay 350 million per year to the state an expense that would generate federal reimbursements the intent was to return the tax money and a share of the added reimbursements to the hospitals but as state deficits spiked between 2013 and 2017 the tax grew while the payments back to the industry shrank by 2017 hospitals were paying 514 million to the state and getting a collective 78 million in return under a new agreement they paid 900 million and received back about 493 million last year at the december 13 public hearing rep bolinsky who sits on the legislature s appropriations committee asked budget secretary melissa mccaw about the state s long term ability to pay for the agreement given projected budget deficits over the next biennium this agreement settles years of disputed and held back medicaid reimbursements said rep bolinsky it s a forward paying look back though into errors of the past have we in light of this agreement also taken a look forward not just in the impact of the settlement itself but how it s going to dovetail with future reimbursements and the state s ability to manage that ms mccaw who heads the state s office of policy and management responded that while the settlement does place fiscal liability on the state that amount is far outweighed by the potential debt service it could have incurred had the lawsuit gone unsettled some lawmakers concerned some legislators including those from cities with tax exempt hospitals and universities balked at some elements of the settlement rep patricia dillon d new haven and others quizzed the administration officials about a guarantee of no changes over the life of the deal to the hospitals current tax exemptions from municipal property taxes corporation taxes and sales and fuel taxes robert clark the governor s general counsel told the legislators the provision was essential to the deal without it he said the hospitals feared that the general assembly would finance the settlement by eliminating some of those exemptions making the hospitals pay for their own settlement we knew this would be difficult and controversial mr clark said this was not lost on us and it was not something we gave up easily on it was just something that at the end of the day we weren t going to get a deal without it to be frank rep dillon was one of the legislators who expressed concern that hospitals might expand into areas that are now taxable i m just saying that like in tennessee at one point it looked like half the state was exempt rep dillon said you know you had churches running theme parks and so i just want to make sure that this is not going to be a burden on our towns that already have a lot of tax exempt property mr clark noted that it does not broaden existing exemptions nor does it protect the hospitals from general tax increases providing that no more than 15 percent of the revenue from new or amended taxes come from hospitals i understand and sympathize with some of the folks who are not terribly pleased with the fact that it s a seven year agreement but the flip side of that is we don t have to pay it all once mr clark said we pay it back over the course of seven years interest free and so i think you d have to just weigh that against the alternative which is a potential catastrophic liability coming due all at once potential liability averted with a potential liability to the state of 4 billion looming ms mccaw secretary of policy and management said the deal was structured to leave the state with significant budget reserves in case the economy slips into recession the deal would require 180 7 million in the current budget biennium money that was set aside she said steve frayne the senior vice president of health policy at the connecticut hospital association urged legislators to look at the settlement in a broader context not only did the state renege on a promise to share in the increased federal reimbursements but it came at a time when hospitals were financially stressed our rates had been frozen since 2008 for basic medical services and in addition to that had been cut multiple times mr frayne said so we were in a position where we had gone from an aggregate loss under the medicaid program of about 300 million a year to in a very short period of time that number tripled we were essentially carrying around a loss from medicaid delivery of services plus the losses of the tax of about 1 billion a year he added and these were enormous changes that were not easily absorbed by the hospitals the deal would provide annual medicaid rate increases of two percent for inpatient care and 2 2 percent for most outpatient services on january 1 in each of the next seven years mr frayne said the settlement was the result of compromise on both sides plus a fresh start in the industry s relationship with the state under a new governor so when we look at this is it everything we wanted no is it as fast as we wanted no is it fair yes he said and it s done in a way in which all of the parties interests are protected so that we can wind up in a relationship in which in a collaborative way we can begin to work on other things as opposed to where we ve been over the last several years which is in constant fights and battles the hearing december 13 was conducted by four committees appropriations finance public health and human services they had the opportunity to question two panels of witnesses the first representing the lamont administration and the attorney general s office the second composed of hospital executives sen hwang said now that the matter appears settled he is hoping the lamont administration and lawmakers learned from the situation and will stop passing policies that expose connecticut taxpayers to more lawsuits he also was quick to shout out two of the largest health facilities serving his constituents hospitals like st vincent s and bridgeport hospital do so much to serve all of our communities said sen hwang this settlement marks a fresh start for the state s relationship with our hospitals that will ultimately benefit patients and taxpayers alike content by mark pazniokas jenna carlesso at the connecticut mirror is used

lower respiratory infections and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 14 global surface temperature will increase climate predictions tend to have a longer range but here s a snapshot of where 2020 stands a 1995 report by the intergovernmental panel on climate change predicted that the average global surface temperature could increase by about 3 6 degrees fahrenheit 2 degrees celsius by 2100 or anywhere between an increase of 1 degrees celsius to 3 5 degrees celsius depending on global emissions the report also predicted that sea level could increase by about 20 inches by the same year on track with 80 years still to go both predictions appear possible the global average temperature has risen a tad more than a 1 degree fahrenheit about 0 6 degrees celsius since the mid 90s according to

itself provide horizontal propulsion relatively modest sources of thrust could easily be provided he also suspected that by 2018 humans would have antigravity cars and jetpacks capable of operating for 30 minutes no unless you re luke skywalker or buzz lightyear 18 nuclear will replace natural gas in 1968 stanford university professor charles scarlott predicted that nuclear breeder reactors

nuclear power plants should be available in large amounts at low cost scarlott wrote wrong in 2018 fossil fuels petroleum natural gas and coal accounted for about 79 of total u s primary energy

british commentator and editor hamish mcrae foresaw retirement ages reaching 67 to 70 the main motive for this in europe is cost to the state governments feel that if retirement ages are not raised the burden of paying pensions will be so high that working people will not be prepared to pay the tax levels necessary to fund them mcrae wrote no in the u s the average retirement age in 2016 was 65 for men and 63 for women according to the center for retirement research that number has stayed relatively stagnant for men over the last few decades but has increased for women for full social security benefits however the age is slowly climbing and depends on the year that you were born some european countries set 67 as retirement age the earliest age when citizens can start withdrawing pensions and several plan to raise the age in the next few years according to the finnish center for pensions for many europeans the topic is a matter of fierce debate 9 americans will vote

draconian measures to avoid an internal crisis in the first decade of the new century china is generally acknowledged to be on a path toward more democratic politics though not in the image of the

what s the future of the auto industry hydrogen cars appear to give way to electric not yet toyota and honda are leading the hydrogen powered car market but it s an uphill battle against competitors peddling battery powered electric vehicles in 2018 2 300 hydrogen fuel cell vehicles were sold in the u s less than 1 of the number of electric cars sold according to insideevs which covers electric

top two causes of the global burden of disease a measurement of the number of healthy life years lost due to sickness disability or early death were expected to be ischemic coronary heart disease and unipolar major clinical depression at the time the leading causes were lower respiratory infections like pnuemonia and diarrheal diseases the study said close in 2017 the most recent year that the data set was published coronary heart disease was the second leading cause of the global burden of disease not depression the five leading causes were neonatal disorders ischaemic heart disease stroke lower respiratory infections and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 14 global surface temperature will increase climate predictions tend to have a longer range but here s a snapshot of where 2020 stands a 1995 report by the intergovernmental panel on climate change predicted that the average global surface temperature could increase by about 3 6 degrees fahrenheit 2 degrees celsius by 2100 or anywhere between an increase of 1 degrees celsius to 3 5 degrees celsius depending on global emissions the report also predicted that sea level could increase by about 20 inches by the same year on track with 80 years still to go both predictions appear possible the global average temperature has risen a tad more than a 1 degree fahrenheit about 0 6 degrees celsius since the mid 90s according to noaa and since 1992 the global sea level has risen a total of more than 3 inches according to noaa 15 humans will step foot on mars a 1996 report by the space studies board of the national research council said that nasa would launch possible human exploratory missions to the moon and mars within the next quarter century predicting that humans would land on mars by 2018 schwartz and leyden envision a similar scenario in 2020 humans arrive on mars the four astronauts touch down and beam their images back to the 11 billion people sharing in the moment the expedition is a joint effort

united kingdom a decision making body composed of the prime minister and a team of hand picked members of parliament at the time johnson 32 was known as an outspoken editor and columnist but had not held public office not shy in clashing with party lines boris would renegotiate eu membership so britain stands to europe as canada not texas stands to the usa the journalists wrote pretty close have

would make up the majority of u s energy production by 2018 as natural gas fades energy from water power solar radiation the wind tides or earth heat will not figure large in the totals power from nuclear power plants should be available in large amounts at low cost scarlott wrote wrong in 2018 fossil fuels petroleum natural gas and coal accounted for about 79 of total u s primary energy production in 2018 according to the u s energy information administration about 12 was from renewable energy sources and about 9 was from nuclear electric power 19 americans will work 26 hours a week in 1968 it was thought that by 2020 americans would work 1 370 hours a year or 26 hours a week instead of the 1 940 hours 37 hours a week that was average at the time according to physicist herman kahn and futurist anthony j weiner unlikely while we are working less than we were in 1968 the average american worked nearly 1 800 hours in 2018 35 hours a week according to the organisation for

nationalism should be a waning force in the world the increasing openness about feelings and identifications may help men to overcome some of the more destructive and hostile motivations that underlie nationalism he wrote the opposite is true fueled by backlash against immigration globalization and the political establishment populist nationalism was a driving force behind brexit the election of

mexico city by approving the united states mexico canada agreement usmca the us house of representatives has removed a major potential obstacle to the trade pact the mexican senate has already approved the deal and the us senate and the canadian parliament are expected to do so early next year once it enters into force the usmca which will replace the north american free trade agreement nafta will have far reaching consequences for mexico in particular the house vote came more than a year after the three countries leaders signed the usmca in buenos aires in november 2018 a longer wait than many had anticipated but shorter than others had expected after the republicans lost their house majority in last year s midterm elections officials and analysts in the three countries had been hopeful that congress would approve the agreement given the important concessions on jobs labour the environment dispute settlement dairy products and intellectual property that us president donald trump had wrested from the mexican and canadian governments they were right to be optimistic yet as recently as the us thanksgiving holiday in late november the trump administration had not even sent the usmca bill to house speaker nancy pelosi raising the prospect of the deal being postponed until after the 2020 us presidential election there were both political and substantive reasons for the apparent impasse the political issue was obvious if pelosi supported the usmca thereby showing that the democrats could do the people s business she would give trump a win at the same time that the house was impeaching him but if she opposed the pact on the grounds that it failed to meet the demands of us labour organisations she would expose the democrats to trump s charge that they are interested only in overturning the result of the 2016 election in the end pelosi came down squarely in favour of reaching a deal calculating that the benefits of a constructive approach outweighed the drawbacks of giving trump something to crow about the substantive difficulties meanwhile related mainly to the enforcement of the usmca s labour environmental intellectual property and dispute settlement provisions in particular american labour unions notably the afl cio and many congressional democrats demanded that the agreement be revised to allow us officials to conduct unannounced in situ inspections of plants and companies in mexico such checks they argued would determine whether mexico was actually fulfilling the pact s provisions regarding collective bargaining and contracts working conditions union elections and leadership and other issues after mexican negotiators initially rejected this demand further talks eventually resulted on december 10 in an agreement acceptable to everyone trump house democrats the afl cio and the mexican and canadian governments like nafta the usmca is far more important for mexico s economy than it is for america s moreover the labour and environmental provisions in the new agreement are essentially directed at mexico but although these additional measures are welcome they come at a difficult time for the country s economy when nafta was finally approved in the us back in 1993 it included only side agreements on labour and the environment with practically no enforcement mechanisms let alone sanctions for non compliance by 2017 when trump forced mexico into renegotiating nafta us democrats labour unions and environmental activists were complaining that mexico had taken the us for a ride over the previous quarter century by failing to improve its labour practices and environmental regulation these critics may have exaggerated their case mexico s new president andrés manuel lópez obrador had already persuaded the country s congress to approve wide ranging labour reforms but they had a point and in the usmca negotiations they and others focused on enforcement of such provisions as a result the revised usmca contains a series of much needed enforcement mechanisms for starters the pact shifts the burden of proof regarding alleged violations of labour or environmental provisions from the accuser in most cases the us to the accused usually mexico it also establishes a rapid response system of independent panels to receive complaints and determine whether labour rights were violated and to impose sanctions if they were finally eight american attachés five of them focusing on labour issues and three on environmental matters will be sent to mexico under the pact to monitor and enforce the country s compliance with its obligations in these areas the labour attachés will report to an interagency labour committee every three months and in principle will be entitled to hear complaints including via a 24 hour telephone hotline and investigate alleged violations of mexican labour laws the mexican authorities have questioned whether these provisions were in fact agreed upon in mexico city on december 10 while the country s business community was blindsided by the measures and is uncomfortable with them but they probably will remain in place because it was these mexican concessions that persuaded us unions and democrats to back trump s deal at the same time it will be difficult to eliminate overnight some of mexico s most significant though embarrassing competitive advantages low wages deplorable working conditions tame labour unions and utter disregard for the environment have all been crucial ingredients of the country s export boom over the last quarter century it is likely and certainly desirable that the usmca by effectively introducing a labour and environmental protectorate will force mexico to abandon these shameful practices but doing so at a time when mexico s economy is stagnant or falling into recession may make matters worse similarly the new labour and environmental provisions will surely make the private sector both foreign and domestic even more reluctant to invest in a country governed by an erratic and ideological president the usmca may well succeed in marginally improving america s position regarding jobs investment labour the environment and dispute settlement but if the pact is intended to boost mexico s economic growth and welfare and bolster the rule of law it will not achieve these goals any time soon jorge g castañeda former foreign minister

do not think it is possible to go through daily life without having data collected about them by companies or the government according to a survey of u s adults by pew research center more than 80 say the potential risks they face because of data collection by companies outweigh the benefits 5 world s population will reach 8 billion in 1994 the international food policy research institute projected the world population would increase by 2 5 billion to reach 8 billion by 2020 india pakistan bangladesh and the continent of africa would add 1 5 billion people the institute predicted close but no cigar the world s population is 7 7 billion according to a report in june from the united nations the report expects the population to grow by 2 billion in the next 30 years around 2027 india is projected to overtake china as the world s most populous country the report says 6 china will be the world s largest economy speaking of china in a 1997 article titled the long boom futurists peter schwartz and peter leyden said china would be on top by 2020 the chinese economy has grown to be the largest in the world though the u s economy is more technologically sophisticated and its population more affluent china and the united states are basically on a par they said close in 2019 china still trailed the united states as the world s second largest economy by nominal gdp recent reports predict that china and india will overtake the united states by 2030 7 we ll have self driving cars self driving cars are being experimented with in the late 1990s with implementation on majors highways feasible during the first decade of the twenty first century kurzweil wrote kind of dozens of companies including tesla google spinoff waymo and ride sharing giants uber and lyft are testing self driving vehicles in select locations such as boston las vegas phoenix and columbus ohio widespread use of a truly autonomous vehicle is not yet here experts say it might still be decades before we see a car that can drive anywhere it pleases self driving shuttle why a rhode island police officer pulled it over in april tesla ceo elon musk said the company would have fully self driving cars ready by the end of the year and a robotaxi version one that could ferry passengers without anyone behind the wheel ready for the streets next year tesla owners can summon their cars which can

reaching 67 to 70 the main motive for this in europe is cost to the state governments feel that if retirement ages are not raised the burden of paying pensions will be so high that working people will not be prepared to pay the tax levels necessary to fund them mcrae wrote no in the usa the average retirement age in 2016 was 65 for men and 63 for women according to the center for retirement research that number has stayed relatively steady for men over the past few decades but has increased for women for full social security benefits the age is slowly climbing and depends on the year that you were born some european countries set 67 as retirement age the earliest age when citizens can start withdrawing pensions and several plan to raise the age in the next few years according to the finnish center for pensions for many europeans the topic is a matter of fierce debate 9 americans will vote electronically from home as the millennial generation comes of age they ll be able to vote electronically from home schwartz and leyden predicted possibly as soon as the presidential election of 2008 not yet amid fears of foreign interference in u s elections lawmakers aren t about to let you vote in next year s presidential election on your iphone proponents of online voting say it could improve turnout and prevent voter suppression at polling stations startups are developing solutions for online voting such as the voatz mobile voting platform which has used biometric facial recognition in at least four public election pilots in the usa last year west virginia began using voatz for absentee voting for military personnel stationed overseas in one utah county citizens with a disability were able to vote electronically on their smartphones in a 2019 municipal general election 10 china will be on a path to democracy schwartz and leyden predicted that despite taking draconian measures to avoid an internal crisis in the first decade of the new century china is generally acknowledged to be on a path toward more democratic politics though not in the image of the west not really china faces scrutiny over human rights abuses against pro democracy protesters in hong kong and against nearly 1 million uighurs a predominantly muslim population members of which have been arbitrarily detained and imprisoned in reeducation camps in china s xinjiang region 11 we ll

siri google assistant amazon alexa and an array of smart tech in the internet of things readily exchange data with your other devices and respond to commands 12 cars will be able to go months without refueling schwartz and leyden predicted that by 2010 hydrogen would be processed in refinery like plants and loaded onto cars that can go thousands of miles and many months before refueling by 2020 they said almost all new cars would be hybrid vehicles mostly using hydrogen power what s the future of the auto industry hydrogen cars appear to give way to electric not yet toyota and honda lead the hydrogen powered car market but it s an uphill battle against competitors peddling battery powered electric vehicles in 2018 2 300 hydrogen fuel cell vehicles were sold in the usa less than 1 of the number of electric cars sold according to insideevs which covers electric vehicle news in other green transportation news last year european railway manufacturer alstom launched the world s first hydrogen fuel cell train and next year london is likely to roll out double decker hydrogen powered buses 13 heart disease depression will be world s top diseases in 1996 the harvard school of public health and the world health organization predicted that by 2020 the world s top two causes of the global burden of disease a measurement of the number of healthy life years lost because of sickness disability or early death would be ischemic coronary heart disease and unipolar major clinical depression at the time the leading causes were lower respiratory infections such as pneumonia and diarrheal diseases the study said close in 2017 the most recent year that the data set was published the five leading causes of the global burden of disease were neonatal disorders ischaemic heart disease stroke lower respiratory infections and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 14 global surface temperature will increase climate predictions tend to have a longer range but here s a snapshot of where 2020 stands a report in 1995 by the intergovernmental panel on climate change predicted that the average global surface temperature could increase by about 3 6 degrees fahrenheit by 2100 the report predicted that sea level could increase by about 20 inches by the same year on track with 80 years to go both predictions appear possible the global average temperature has risen a tad more than 1 degree fahrenheit since the mid 90s according to noaa since 1992 the global sea level has risen a total of more than 3 inches according to noaa more were the predictions we made about climate change 20 years ago accurate here s a look 15 humans will set foot on mars a report in 1996 by the space studies board of the national research council said nasa would launch possible human exploratory missions to the moon and mars within the next quarter century predicting that humans would land on mars by 2018 schwartz and leyden envisioned a similar scenario in 2020 humans arrive on mars the four astronauts touch down and beam their images back to the 11 billion people sharing in the moment the expedition is a joint effort supported by virtually all nations on the planet the culmination of a decade and a half of intense focus on a common goal not quite though we haven t set foot on mars we ve landed eight unmanned spacecraft on the planet s surface 16 boris johnson would lead brexit in 1997 british news organization the independent forecast that in 2020 boris johnson would become a member of the cabinet of the united kingdom a decision making body composed of the prime minister and a team of handpicked members of parliament at the time johnson 32 was an outspoken editor and columnist but had not held public office not shy in clashing with party lines boris would renegotiate eu membership so britain stands to europe as canada not texas stands to the usa the journalists wrote pretty close have you heard of brexit johnson became prime minister in july he

antigravity belts will revolutionize warfare imagine a world where battles are fought a few feet above the ground as soldiers hover in midair in 1968 mathematician and scientist d g brennan predicted that antigravity belts would revolutionize the tactics of land warfare writing that even if the antigravity mechanism did not itself provide horizontal propulsion relatively modest sources of thrust could easily be provided he suspected that by 2018 humans would have antigravity cars and jetpacks capable of operating for 30 minutes no unless you re luke skywalker or buzz lightyear 18 nuclear will

energy from water power solar radiation the wind tides or earth heat will not figure large in the totals power from nuclear power plants should be available in large amounts at low cost scarlott wrote wrong in 2018 fossil fuels petroleum natural gas and coal accounted for about 79 of total u s primary energy production in 2018 according to the u s energy information administration about 12 was from renewable energy sources and about 9 was from nuclear electric power for the electrical power sector in particular nuclear creates 19 of energy 19 americans will work 26 hours a week in 1968 physicist

tis the season for introspection and this year my thoughts are on bitcoin as jewish people around the world celebrate hanukkah this week inspired by the ancient miracle that a sacred flame lasted for eight days although the oil supply was dangerously low i m pondering how the hell i ll keep experimenting with this technology without burning the metaphorical candle at both ends i spent 2019 trying a variety of products and services to test how easy it is to actually use cryptocurrency i ran a casa bitcoin lightning node used decentralized exchanges dexs moved bitcoin from mobile apps to a hardware wallet a ledger then transacted straight from the hardware wallet related multi part payments could bring bigger bitcoin sums to lightning network beyond just running the node i used the casa device to send invoices for a small product a poetry book to learn more about the challenges independent merchants might face lastly i set up a btcpay store which is the stage of this experiment i ll end the year on and after a year of educational tinkering what is my takeaway it s this there s no way this technology is ready for prime time the most common refrain used to deflect from the technology s obvious shortcomings is that it s still too early to build for usability precisely because i agree it is still very early here are some lessons i ve learned about money that fellow bitcoiners might want to keep in mind before evangelizing to the moon to the masses any time soon 1 bitcoin s usability relies on social capital related bitcoin price set to outshine gold and stocks by big margin in 2019 let s start with what it took to sell a few poetry books using a bitcoin node there was an issue with my router which i am terrible at describing other than saying something had to be configured with a port of sorts although the general internet connection worked fine i clicked all the buttons if i didn t have experienced engineers in my rolodex of sources i wouldn t have gotten past that first hurdle i called up two of the smartest engineers i know we opened up the raw code and shared screens so they could see they cursed vigorously assuring me i was doing everything right according to the casa tutorial blog we updated the node with a wee bit of manual configuration and they graciously opened up a channel to me lightning access doesn t automatically offer two way liquidity story continues seasoned bitcoiners are generally able to find workarounds to overcome technical challenges hardware wallet malfunction or incompatibility incorrect updates etc to be fair the devices listed above are those i got to work mostly on my own i tried a few others and failed which i won t list because this isn t a grouchy yelp review however most command line only mountain men with their own custom setups don t realize how fickle some products are at this stage if you actually rely on bitcoin for business many non custodial products and services are so experimental that you need tech support to operate them reliably and why go the service provider route at all with bitcoin be your own bank remember venmo works great so does stripe bitcoin needs to offer something different it does of course it might allow you to choose who you trust and what you trust them with like bouncing a message across a mesh network but we ll get to that later 2 failure to transact some people are surely using bitcoin today to improve their financial self sovereignty the idea that anyone could do so however is laughable even when the wallet node dex setup was working smoothly just a few of my relatively tech savvy customers could find their transaction data with blockchain explorers bitcoin is only transparent to people with the skills to read this data without that knowledge there is no benefit added by the public ledger there may even be risks associated with this ledger for the time being i d recommend any non developer consider private consulting with an engineer or membership to a startup service like casa s as part of a crypto product s price that means you better expect to earn a pretty penny from bitcoiners as consumers or savings liquidators to make this worth it the trouble is bitcoiners rarely want to spend their crypto herein lies the essential dilemma of bitcoin it can t be money without payments it is seen as too valuable to spend unless you are facing censorship and official payment systems require compliance some of the sharpest engineers i know in places like iran still struggle to use bitcoin because there aren t enough people to transact with skills alone don t solve their legal problems they also need a robust network of parties both at home and abroad who aren t subject to the same compliance risks and government woes that caused their isolation in the first place 3 money is never trustless sanctions aside all of these experiments reminded me of what it was like to get money in india during demonetization much like some token traders these days when i was backpacking across india in 2016 my daily commerce relied on arbitrage in short social networks still control liquidity whether it s bitcoin or paper rupees i was at a camel festival in rajasthan the first time i heard about demonetization indian businesses wouldn t accept my bills any more instead travelers were told to exchange them for new bills at the sole local bank but the government didn t print enough new bills to cover the limited allotment each person was allowed per day under 70 when security guards came out with sticks to close the empty bank the sunburnt and thirsty crowd grew rowdy one guard grabbed a protester next to me by the face and shoved him toward the ground so i turned to the black market in the next town a middle aged man with a moustache and a mobile phone shop had a secret stash of new rupees he would swap dollars at a steep premium despite the best efforts of a teenage boy from a nearby village who haggled in the local language on my behalf for a small fee sometimes even my dollars didn t entice the currency dealer this is the same issue iranian bitcoiners face your currency is only valuable to people who believe they can also spend it in turn like some bitcoiners in venezuela who use cryptocurrency to get dollars today foreigners turned to arbitrage during demonetization in india some businesses in 2016 charged foreigners less in euros than in dollars with new rupees getting the lowest price of all so we swapped among ourselves and developed relationships with business owners who would extend us short term credit some banks and atms only had cash once a week premiums might fluctuate based on rumors of cash shipments on the horizon i started obsessively asking people how they managed their finances demonetization broke down stigmas around such topics especially considering i was a petite traveler who could hardly bench press a housecat from pushkar to varanasi and down south past mumbai most indians told me they pooled their families wealth together with a single elder at the helm this echoes what is going on today in lebanon and iraq in fact the indian outlet economic times referred to bitcoin as the new hawala an ancient brokerage system often used for remittances this social system almost resembles a mesh network even in 2019 family networks are still the most popular financial networks my bitcoin experiments got easier when i started treating cryptocurrency like black market rupees it wasn t about going trustless as much as it was compartmentalizing trust across a network of social ties who could i trust to get me to the next step of my bitcoin experiment they d probably be exposed to my security setup if they helped circumnavigate some technical problems but not others where was there opportunity for safe arbitrage book buyers often trusted me with personal information too which i could have connected to their wallet addresses or online aliases if i was nefarious how does one lawfully and privately get a book to a buyer living in rural latin america can bitcoin really connect people to the global economy including but not limited to digital products if so that process requires trust on both ends conclusions for now none of this is to say bitcoin isn t a global currency the technology is already being used in this way transacting with wallets especially european book buyers was the easiest part of my experiments can cryptocurrency be used in a self sovereign way with minimal personal risks to connect people who don t already have access to safer more robust financial products that i can t say yet it may depend on who burns the midnight oil in these early days before prime time hits perhaps bitcoiners will be able to overcome the social challenges of money compliance access liquidity usability by comparison the technical shortcomings are almost trivial in 2020 hopefully more people will try to transact outside their established networks and see what challenges they face in deliberately applying trust rather than eliminating it can we trust in the bitcoin network this crazy idea should have failed long ago and yet for over a decade bitcoin has already proven to be the experiment that flickers but never goes dark almost like a candle related stories
business tech power to the people electric rate cases in nh this means war eversource liberty utilities want automatic rate increases the puc should say no eversource wants 70m we think it only deserves 23m d maurice kreis nh consumer advocate power to the people column indepthnh org this story was originally published by indepth nh by d maurice kreis nh consumer advocate we ve just landed at normandy beach please excuse the glib analogy to the arrival of u s forces in nazi occupied france when your job is advocating for the interests of residential utility customers participating in two electric rate cases at once at the new hampshire public utilities commission puc can feel a lot like waging a global conflict in two distinct theaters of war we ve just filed our written testimony in the pending eversource rate case on dec 6 we did the same for liberty utilities the submission of written testimony is our opportunity to explain why the requested rate increases will unfairly enrich utility shareholders at the expense of utility customers it is the regulatory equivalent of the normandy beach landing the two rate cases have certain things in common take return on equity roe for example baked into the rates of regulated utilities is an assumed amount for what sort of return shareholders deserve on their investment roes move up or down in rate case decisions pending on where interest rates in the overall economy are trending you have probably noticed that interest rates are at or near historic lows but for some reason both of these utilities think its shareholders deserve an roe of at least 10 percent a year that s outrageous especially because roe is supposed to be a function of how risky the investment is when you buy shares in a company that has a monopoly on providing an essential service it s not exactly like investing in a hedge fund our testimony says that liberty shareholders deserve a return of 8 23 percent while eversource shareholders are entitled to a slightly higher 8 27 percent these numbers come from deputy consumer advocate pradip chattopadhyay a phd economist he s a very thoughtful fellow who really believes in the principles of classic microeconomics to a lawyer like me it seems that if anything he s being generous to these companies and their shareholders another thing these two rate cases have in common is a request not just for a rate increase but for automatic future rate increases over the next few years the idea is that because both eversource and liberty have well developed plans to invest in their systems the puc should just go ahead and let the companies put those investments into rates without going through the rigamarole of another full rate case what a horrible idea rate cases are the opportunity to put all of a utility s costs under the microscope and if you re a ratepayer advocate like me to subject all of the company s expenditures to the skeptical scrutiny they deserve allowing utilities to evade this scrutiny via so called automatic step increases is the equivalent of giving them free money we are not unsympathetic to the idea that liberty and eversource need to look to the future and to make new investments on which they deserve a return we share the utilities frustration that a rate cases is an inherently backward looking process that s why one of our witnesses ron nelson of the california based consulting firm strategen is calling for a transition to performance based ratemaking basically the utilities get their proposed step increases if they hit agreed upon performance benchmarks we re talking about stuff like reliability deployment of energy efficiency and the ability to accommodate small scale renewable generation on the premises of customers eversource s proposed step increases will not provide benefits greater than the associated costs said nelson in his written testimony for the eversource case in fact the company s claimed benefits may create more harm than good for ratepayers accountability is the answer one benefit of a backward looking rate case is the opportunity to scrutinize utility investments made since the last rate case and throw out any investment that was not incurred prudently the puc hardly ever does this but every once in a while it is necessary and justified we urge the puc to disallow eversource s 42 million dollar investment in new meters made in 2013 what was imprudent replacing thousands of old fashioned analog meters those devices with a spinning disc and dials that must read manually by a meter reader who goes house to house with so called amr meters amr stands for automated meter reading going from analog meters to amr meters is like replacing your model t with a yugo yes amr meters allow a utility to avoid the expense of meter readers but they are not truly smart meters known in utility parlance as ami advanced metering infrastructure ami meters are capable of providing an ongoing stream of usage data which in turn enables the utility to adopt innovations like time varying rates energy conservation rewards and demand response rebates this saves customers money according to our ami witness paul alvarez of the wired group in colorado eversource also known as public service company of new hampshire psnh should have done one of three things first eversource could have added radio modules to its analog meters which allow meters to be read by vehicles which drive through neighborhoods in exactly the same manner as the amr meters psnh installed but far more cheaply second eversource could have done nothing those old meters were working fine alvarez notes that eversource provided no evidence in its own testimony that all those meters required replacement or finally eversource could have opted for ami technology by july 2013 according to alvarez when psnh installed traditional meters equipped with amr the edison foundation estimated that 46 million ami meters had already been installed in the u s we have a theory about why eversource made such an imprudent choice and it is not pretty by 2013 when psnh made the decision to install meters that could not provide interval usage data it was clear that such data presented several types of economic harm to psnh alvarez testifies for example research indicates that the time varying rates ami meters make possible can reduce both system peak demand and energy use psnh profits increase when the company invests in the transmission and distribution infrastructure required to satisfy system peak demand biasing the company against time varying rates and peak time rebate programs alvarez continues psnh profits decrease when energy sales volumes fall between rate cases biasing the company against the conservation potential offered by ami meters disallowing that 42 million investment as imprudent would send a message to utility shareholders everywhere that in new hampshire we expect investor owned utilities to act in the best interests of their customers if they expect a return on their investment overall eversource is seeking a rate increase of almost 70 million a year even without the future step adjustments we think eversource deserves only a 23 3 million increase which is by the way still a lot of money for liberty a much smaller company we propose trimming a requested 6 6 million increase down to 3 4 million to fight off these ratepayer favorable contentions liberty and eversource will arrive with their armies of lawyers and experts when the scheduled hearings take place at the puc in march and april respectively no

mexico city by approving the united states mexico canada agreement usmca the us house of representatives has removed a major potential obstacle to the trade pact the mexican senate has already approved the deal and the us senate and the canadian parliament are expected to do so early next year once it enters into force the usmca which will replace the north american free trade agreement nafta will have far reaching consequences for mexico in particular the house vote came more than a year after the three countries leaders signed the usmca in buenos aires in november 2018 a longer wait than many had anticipated but shorter than others had expected after the republicans lost their house majority in last year s midterm elections officials and analysts in the three countries had been hopeful that congress would approve the agreement given the important concessions on jobs labour the environment dispute settlement dairy products and intellectual property that us president donald trump had wrested from the mexican and canadian governments they were right to be optimistic yet as recently as the us thanksgiving holiday in late november the trump administration had not even sent the usmca bill to house speaker nancy pelosi raising the prospect of the deal being postponed until after the 2020 us presidential election there were both political and substantive reasons for the apparent impasse the political issue was obvious if pelosi supported the usmca thereby showing that the democrats could do the people s business she would give trump a win at the same time that the house was impeaching him but if she opposed the pact on the grounds that it failed to meet the demands of us labour organisations she would expose the democrats to trump s charge that they are interested only in overturning the result of the 2016 election in the end pelosi came down squarely in favour of reaching a deal calculating that the benefits of a constructive approach outweighed the drawbacks of giving trump something to crow about the substantive difficulties meanwhile related mainly to the enforcement of the usmca s labour environmental intellectual property and dispute settlement provisions in particular american labour unions notably the afl cio and many congressional democrats demanded that the agreement be revised to allow us officials to conduct unannounced in situ inspections of plants and companies in mexico such checks they argued would determine whether mexico was actually fulfilling the pact s provisions regarding collective bargaining and contracts working conditions union elections and leadership and other issues after mexican negotiators initially rejected this demand further talks eventually resulted on december 10 in an agreement acceptable to everyone trump house democrats the afl cio and the mexican and canadian governments like nafta the usmca is far more important for mexico s economy than it is for america s moreover the labour and environmental provisions in the new agreement are essentially directed at mexico but although these additional measures are welcome they come at a difficult time for the country s economy when nafta was finally approved in the us back in 1993 it included only side agreements on labour and the environment with practically no enforcement mechanisms let alone sanctions for non compliance by 2017 when trump forced mexico into renegotiating nafta us democrats labour unions and environmental activists were complaining that mexico had taken the us for a ride over the previous quarter century by failing to improve its labour practices and environmental regulation these critics may have exaggerated their case mexico s new president andrés manuel lópez obrador had already persuaded the country s congress to approve wide ranging labour reforms but they had a point and in the usmca negotiations they and others focused on enforcement of such provisions as a result the revised usmca contains a series of much needed enforcement mechanisms for starters the pact shifts the burden of proof regarding alleged violations of labour or environmental provisions from the accuser in most cases the us to the accused usually mexico it also establishes a rapid response system of independent panels to receive complaints and determine whether labour rights were violated and to impose sanctions if they were finally eight american attachés five of them focusing on labour issues and three on environmental matters will be sent to mexico under the pact to monitor and enforce the country s compliance with its obligations in these areas the labour attachés will report to an interagency labour committee every three months and in principle will be entitled to hear complaints including via a 24 hour telephone hotline and investigate alleged violations of mexican labour laws the mexican authorities have questioned whether these provisions were in fact agreed upon in mexico city on december 10 while the country s business community was blindsided by the measures and is uncomfortable with them but they probably will remain in place because it was these mexican concessions that persuaded us unions and democrats to back trump s deal at the same time it will be difficult to eliminate overnight some of mexico s most significant though embarrassing competitive advantages low wages deplorable working conditions tame labour unions and utter disregard for the environment have all been crucial ingredients of the country s export boom over the last quarter century it is likely and certainly desirable that the usmca by effectively introducing a labour and environmental protectorate will force mexico to abandon these shameful practices but doing so at a time when mexico s economy is stagnant or falling into recession may make matters worse similarly the new labour and environmental provisions will surely make the private sector both foreign and domestic even more reluctant to invest in a country governed by an erratic and ideological president the usmca may well succeed in marginally improving america s position regarding jobs investment labour the environment and dispute settlement but if the pact is intended to boost mexico s economic growth and welfare and bolster the rule of law it will not achieve these goals any time soon jorge g castañeda former foreign minister

age of spiritual machines nope while kurzweil may have accurately predicted health related gadgets such as fitness watches bioscarves and ekg apps for your smartphone he jumped the gun on life expectancy in 2019 the average life expectancy of the global population was 72 6 years according to the united nations that average is slightly higher in the usa at 78 6 years in 2017 according to a report in the journal of the american medical association though life expectancy in many industrialized nations continues to inch up it has been going in the opposite direction in america the united nation predicts the average global life expectancy to rise to 77 1 years by 2050 life expectancy what countries have the longest 2 computers will be invisible kurzweil had several other prophecies for the year 2019 including invisible computers computers are now largely invisible they are embedded everywhere in walls tables chairs desks clothing jewelry and bodies people routinely use three dimensional displays built into their glasses or contact lenses this display technology projects images directly into the human retina keyboards and cables would become rare he said it s true

medical diagnostics several groups are testing smart lenses that would measure glucose levels in the tears of people with diabetes 3 books will be dead paper books and documents are rarely used or accessed most twentieth century paper documents of interest have been scanned and are available through the wireless network kurzweil predicted wrong though the net revenue of the u s book publishing industry has decreased since 2014 the industry still sold 675 million print books and brought in nearly 26 billion in 2018 according to the association of american publishers annual report 4 your
