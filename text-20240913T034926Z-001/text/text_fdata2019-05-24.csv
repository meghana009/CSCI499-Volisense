overview it seems clear that the world s two largest economies slowed before the tariff truce ended many investors believe that the tariff truce helped stop the equity market meltdown through most of q4 18 the net result of weaker stocks and lower bond yields seems reasonable the dollar is an anomaly it began off strong yesterday the euro slid to a new 18 month low sterling approached 1 26 which it has not seen since the flash crash the dollar index made a new since may 2017 however in dramatic price action the major currencies reversed higher the question is whether the move is fundamentally driven perhaps by weak data and a sharp drop in oil prices boosting confidence that the fed will cut rates in h2 or a short squeeze ahead of the large option expiry today 1 4 bln euros at 1 1100 and catching the market wrong footed ahead of the european parliament election where the results will not be announced until sunday and the us is on holiday on monday the dollar is sporting a softer profile against all the major and emerging market currencies today though follow through selling appears limited equity markets are mostly firmer today korea and australia are exceptions the kospi s 0 7 decline pushed it into the red on the week while australia s fall pared this week s gains while the msci asia pacific index finished lower for the third consecutive week indian market boosted by the election added more than 3 on the week and indonesia rose over 4 in the best gain in nearly a year amid hopes that the election results will lift the policy uncertainty european markets paring yesterday s losses and the dow jones stoxx 600 is up 0 7 recouping about a third of this week s decline the s p 500 is also called higher the key may be the gap 2836 7 2866 9 created by yesterday s sharply lower opening oil prices are steadying after yesterday s biggest plunge of the year 5 7 wti for july delivery and 4 5 for july brent asia pacific japan reported april cpi firmed to 0 9 from 0 5 even when fresh food is excluded to derive the core measure the boj targets rose to 0 9 if energy is also excluded the pace slows to 0 6 but it is still the strongest since mid 2016 it had limited impact on the market because it does not change policy expectations because investors focus is on the dramatic decline of equities and just as dramatic rally in bonds there are still downside risks to measured inflation due to cuts in mobile service fees and some government provided education for young children separately trump will visit abe over the weekend suggestions that some trade agreement could be struck heard earlier from washington contacts is being played down in recent days the low hanging fruit was thought to be granting the us the same terms that japan granted the new tpp and the free trade agreement with europe that began earlier this year and especially on agriculture the us demand for either voluntary export restrictions of some kind of quota tariff regime in the next six months casts a pall over the talks some us officials some of the time try to separate the security issues posed by huawei and the broader trade talks however they are not consistent and president trump himself blurs the line consider the precedent set with zte which were removed from the no trade list as a favor to xi trump lifted the prohibitions in for a fine a change in management and some security guarantees after denouncing huawei again trump suggested that it could be part of a broad trade agreement with china the dollar is consolidating yesterday s losses against the yen and remains in the trough it has largely been confined to a jpy109 50 jpy109 75 range there are several sets of options expiring today the roughly 1 7 bln in the jpy109 40 jpy109 50 range may be offering support there are another 2 1 bln or so in options struck between jpy109 60 and jpy109 85 the intraday technicals the sense that bond and equity moves yesterday were exaggerated give the dollar potential to recover more ahead of the weekend but sentiment remains fragile the australian dollar posted a potential key reversal yesterday by making new lows for the move before reversing higher and closing above the previous session high however follow through buying was limited to less than a handful of ticks there is an a 510 mln option at 0 6900 that expires today the chinese yuan finished fractionally firmer on the day to snap a two day decline on the week it finished 0 2 higher and officials in both word and deed are resisting downside pressure europe prime minister may has offered to resign on june 7 after trump s state visit june 3 5 she wants to be the caretaker until the tories complete their leadership contest to pick a replacement this will be negotiated over the next few days and it is not yet set in stone may is leading the tory party into a third electoral defeat having lost the parliament majority she inherited the loss in the local elections was of historic proportions and in the eu parliament election underway the tories are set to come in third and possibly in fourth place her brexit strategy is in tatters the success of the brexit party in the eu election though it might not get much more than a third of the limited turnout the lesson that many tories will draw from the results is that only pursuing a harder brexit will it be able to outflank farage sterling initially rallied on the confirmation of may s intentions which were leaked late yesterday but the gains were quickly sold into and sterling returned to the session lows the uk s economic performance takes second fiddle to brexit but today s april retail sales held in better than expected after surging in march headline retail sales were flat though many economists expected a decline a 1 2 rise in march the year over year pace stands at a healthy 5 2 excluding petrol sales slipped 0 2 after a 1 4 shopping spree in march initially 1 3 in broad terms the uk economy has performed better than many feared given the uncertainty for businesses and investors the eu parliamentary election results will be known before the markets open next week it may take some time to work through the implications for the new leaders of parliament and the commission perhaps one metric to look is whether the two main groupings the center right people s party pp and the center left socialist and democrats s d hold retain a majority what appears to be a short squeeze in the euro fizzled out in late asia just above 1 12 completing to almost the tick the 61 8 retracement of the euro s decline from around 1 1265 on may 13 several large options that are expiring today and this may serve to keep the euro in a range ahead of the long holiday weekend for the us between 1 1150 and 1 1200 there roughly 5 7 bln euros in expiring options sterling is trying to end a three day decline against the dollar it is finding intraday support near 1 2660 and a break could send it back to 1 26 on the upside the brief push above 1 27 where a gbp350 mln option will be cut today may have exhausted the short covering bounce america the us reports april durable goods orders boeing s problems may be evident the headline may fall around 2 but when transportation is excluded a small gain is likely the aircraft manufacturer and its supply change will weigh on other metrics like shipments as well meanwhile the combination of trade conflict with china and the poor flash markit pmis boosted speculation of fed rate cuts in h2 the implied yield of the january 2020 fed funds futures contract fell 9 5 bp yesterday one of the largest moves of the year to 2 04 the current effective average rate is 2 39 none of the fed officials that spoke this week nor the fomc minutes showed any wavering over the patience and wait and see stance the trump administration wants to give us companies the right to seek tariff protection from imports from countries that are found by the treasury to be pursuing a competitive devaluation despite threats from nearly every candidate that has run for president in the recent election to cite china as a currency manipulator the us has not it has cited no country since 1994 however it is too early to dismiss this because there may be some effort to broaden the definition to include under valued currencies this is a can of worms because it begs the question of by what metric and duration countries that are booming and with an external surplus ought to have appreciating currencies and those with weak economies and external deficits ought to have weak currencies that is how textbook adjustment process however even without these questions being answered the impression is one of economic nationalism and the implicit threat of weaponizing the foreign exchange market in the past two sessions the us dollar has covered its full range against the canadian dollar it briefly slipped through cad1 34 in middle of the week and poked through cad1 35 yesterday it remains stuck in the range better equities and firmer oil can see the greenback drift toward the lower end of the range again the dollar is trading quietly against the mexican peso hovering a little above mxn19 00 the high real and nominal yields continue to provide a good bid for the peso on pullbacks the final q1 gdp report is too old to matter much but the april trade figures may draw some attention though it was before the steel and aluminum tariffs were lifted the broader risk appetite may be more important than the economic data for the peso disclaimer

dive after a sharp escalation in the u s china trade dispute the week before in the fx markets safe haven currencies such as the japanese yen and swiss franc were underpinned and risk sensitive commodity dollars were undermined the downbeat british pound whipsawed on friday in reaction to news uk prime minister theresa may has decided to step down as conservative leader after she lost the support of her own party with a record number of members of parliament quitting in protest to how brexit was being handled over the past three years boris johnson the next conservatives leader in the week ahead the pound and uk politics will surely remain in sharper focus may s departure means more uncertainty over brexit and whoever replaces her will have an almost impossible job the pound will bounce here and there but won t be going anywhere far fast a lot now depends on who will become the new tory leader someone like former london mayor boris johnson who is the bookies favorite to replace may could be bad for the pound a hard line brexiteer could re negotiate unfavorable terms with the eu or push for a no deal exit from the union the us china trade dispute will continue to remain the main focal point next week even if there s been little fresh news in this regard this week any further retaliation from china will surely knock risky assets meanwhile next week s economic calendar is light but we will still have a few potentially market moving events to look forward to sunday monday may 26 27 eu parliament election the european parliamentary elections will have concluded by sunday and the outcome of the votes could see the euro gap at the open on sunday night meaning it could be an interesting asian session on monday however with the u s and uk bank holidays

united states and china meanwhile from japan we will have a batch of data releases including industrial production retail sales and consumer confidence figures the yen has become increasingly in

modern technology was supposed to make travel less necessary we can meet by phone video and now in virtual reality but we re still traveling more than ever i certainly am the reason is simple technology can t yet replace face to face conversation and especially group conversations it is genetically hardwired in our species we spend more time on the phone and skype than ever but technology also makes information more complex and nuanced conveying it often requires a personal presence so we fly around and talk in person i thought of that last week at the strategic investment conference i ve been writing about japanification of the developed world economy explaining what i mean by that as best i can in these letters but in talking to conference attendees i found that i have not effectively communicated some of the nuances to be clear i don t want japanification nor do i think it will deliver the desired results i believe that in the next recession policymakers will respond with massive fiscal and monetary stimulus and instead of producing growth it will depress growth and leave us all in the same morass japan has endured for almost three decades in other words i believe that both government and central banks will try japanification of course under other names but i don t expect it to work in the way they would hope when faced with the imminent possibility of recession depression or even a crash authorities will try to do something but they will have very few choices the default option of ever larger stimulus will kick in so like japan the us will see yet more quantitative easing and extraordinarily low interest rates along with annual federal deficits of 2 trillion and higher alternatives like restructuring the tax code and balancing the budget will be nowhere in sight at best this process will result in an even slower growing economy and avoid total meltdown that s the optimistic view given what i understand today about the political and economic realities as i see them i also believe that it is the most likely scenario the others are much darker however i also believe there is an off ramp that could short circuit the japanification effect leading to something closer to normal more on that below today i want to go deeper into the intellectual and academic rationale behind this outlook dr lacy hunt has long been an enormous influence on my understanding of economics in this letter i ll discuss his latest ideas i should note that any errors are mine and not his fault lacy briefly presented two theorems at the sic after his scholarly lecture that s really what it was i brought up my favorite central banker and former bis chief economist bill white the three of us had possibly the most stimulating discussion of the whole conference at least for me you can and should view it all on our virtual pass but i ll share some highlights below this is important and you need to understand it because it is the exact opposite of what many people think let s start with some facts that may be inconvenient for some but are nonetheless facts back in the 1980s and 1990s many of us in the conservative and gold bug movements me included thought excessive government spending and the resulting debt would eventually bring inflation or even hyperinflation we wanted a hawkish federal reserve or better yet a gold standard to prevent it i have many friends close friends who still deeply believe in a gold standard but that s a discussion for another day reality turned out differently federal debt rose steadily inflation didn t here s a chart of the on budget public debt since 1970 using actual dollars instead of the more usual percentage of gdp and with a log scale to eliminate the hockey stick illusion source st louis fed here is the same data in terms of debt to gdp note the brief shining moment when the us was growing faster than the debt rose and actually ran surpluses in the late 1990s these were also times when gdp grew faster than the deficits and debt but the general trend is from the lower left to the upper right there was a significant jump during the great recession you can see the debt growth started to level out in the late 1990s but then took off again yet the only serious inflation in this whole period occurred in the first decade paul volcker stamped it out in the early 1980s like what you re reading get this free newsletter in your inbox every saturday read our privacy policy here first name this is required email this is required subscribe for free recaptcha i am not saying we had no inflation at all obviously we did and in many parts of the economy significantly more than the official average measures reflect some of it manifested in asset prices stocks real estate instead of consumer goods we like that and typically don t consider it inflation but it is but there was nothing remotely like the kind of major inflation that this level of government debt should theoretically have caused based on what we understood in the 1970s and 1980s remember ross perot and his charts it hasn t happened one argument is that technology reduced production costs enough to offset the higher debt burden that s probably part of it but i think a minor part the real answer is twofold first is the way high government debt interacts with interest rates over long periods and with a time lag but almost inexorably second but no less understood is the demand for certain currencies even as government debt and obligations rise a little reminder interest rates and inflation are really two sides of the same coin interest is the cost of money liquidity that cost is heavily influenced by the risk of money being devalued i e inflation expectations if lenders expect higher inflation then they expect to be repaid in cheaper dollars and thus demand more of them via higher interest rates so inflation drives rates higher while lack of inflation keeps them low as we ve seen since 2008 this brings us to lacy hunt s sic session in which he presented two important theorems they are related but i will discuss them separately jeffrey sherman and felix zulauf think the recession has already started find out why with your sic virtual pass i ll start by just quoting lacy then explain what i believe he means federal debt accelerations ultimately lead to lower not higher interest rates debt funded traditional fiscal stimulus is extremely fleeting when debt levels are already inordinately high thus additional and large deficits provide only transitory gains in economic activity which are quickly followed by weaker business conditions with slower economic growth and inflation long term rates inevitably fall that first sentence should come with a little boom cannon icon it will shock many people who think rising federal debt raises interest rates through a crowding out effect that means the government because it is the most creditworthy borrower sucks up capital and leaves less available to private borrowers who must then pay more for it via higher interest rates or a weakened currency that is the case for most countries in the world yet clearly it has not been the case for some countries in recent decades specifically larger developed economies that s not to say it never will be but actual experience supports lacy s point and not just in the us here are four charts he showed at sic in the us japan the eurozone and the uk sovereign rates fell as government debt rose that is not how keynesian or most other macroeconomic theories say debt funded fiscal stimulus should work additional cash flowing through the economy is supposed to have a multiplier effect spurring growth and eventually raising inflation and interest rates this has not happened the reason it hasn t happened is that we have crossed a kind of debt rubicon in recent history past performance really is not an indicator of future results today in much of the developed world the existing debt load is so heavy that additional dollars have a smaller effect the new debt s negative effects outweigh any benefit the higher taxes that politicians often think will reduce the deficit serve mainly to depress business activity we see the result in slower economic growth plus lower interest rates and inflation note we are talking here about fiscal policy i e government spending on jobs programs infrastructure etc when financed by issuing new debt central banks aren t directly involved until they start financing the government debt via qe or some version of mmt which lacy and the rest of the speakers at the sic will hasten to point out are not equivalent lacy s second theorem supports the first monetary decelerations eventually lead to lower not higher interest rates as originally theorized by economist milton friedman as debt productivity falls the velocity of money declines making monetary policy increasingly asymmetric one sided and ineffectual as a policy instrument irving fisher s equation of exchange m2 v gdp says gdp is equal to the money supply times its turnover or velocity the federal reserve heavily influences the former but not the latter that it turns out is a serious problem the fed s phillips curve fixation gives it the illusion that every macroeconomic problem is a nail and monetary policy is the ideal tool hammer to fix it of course that s not true looser financial conditions don t help when the economy has no productive uses for the new liquidity with most industries already having ample capacity the money had nowhere to go but back into the banks hence velocity fell 33 in the two decades that ended in 2018 now if velocity is falling then any kind of fed stimulus faces a tough headwind it can inject liquidity but can t make people spend it nor can it force banks to lend and in a fractional reserve system money creation doesn t go far unless the banks cooperate later in the conference bill white observed that this is why monetary policy is increasingly ineffective the banks respond to each crisis the same way and every time they find that it takes more aggressive action to produce the same effect obviously that can t go on forever bill called it a fundamental intemporal inconsistency like what you re reading get this free newsletter in your inbox every saturday read our privacy policy here first name this is required email this is required subscribe for free recaptcha the result is that public and private debt keeps rising but also becomes less productive lacy showed how in a world of falling monetary velocity the amount of gdp growth produced by each additional dollar of debt fell 24 in the last 20 years that s why we have so much more debt now and yet slower growth this also explains why this year s first quarter notwithstanding growth has been so sluggish since 2014 that was when money supply peaked so for five years now we ve had both a shrinking money supply and slowing velocity that s not a recipe for inflation and the more recent jump in federal deficit spending is making matters worse not better in our q a lacy and bill discussed how linear economic models are just not working and nonlinear analysis is so critical a lot of practical people are turned off by this thinking it shouldn t be so complex but these same people would never tell a physicist to avoid nonlinear concepts the economy is complex and getting more so as the world adds new seemingly critical variables i should also note that lacy only had 30 minutes for his presentation and had to make a complex argument in an abbreviated time there are scores more corollary points we could explore astute readers will quickly point out that rising debt in places like venezuela has brought extraordinary inflation and currency devaluation historically that s what rapidly rising government debt does i simply point you to rogoff and reinhart s this time is different where they examine every debt and currency crisis for the last few centuries the circumstances may have been different but the result was the same yet today things do indeed seem different japan the us the uk and other countries seem able to expand their government debts beyond historically acceptable levels and get away with it interest rates have stayed low often getting lower and going negative while currency valuations have remained relatively stable the operative word here is relatively what is different is the international demand for currencies and debt denominated in those currencies a globalized economy yielded a surplus of savings that seeks a home in what is perceived as safe assets nobody thinks venezuela is safe that is why in a global crisis money flies to the us and other reserve currencies these safe haven currencies have the exorbitant privilege of running large fiscal deficits thought experiment if italy were to remove itself from the euro and reissue the lira does anybody really think that italy would keep today s low rates ditto for greece and other countries left on their own these currencies would devalue relative to stronger ones like germany and their interest rates would rise this is not necessarily a bad thing the safety valves of currency devaluation and bond market vigilantes saved italy numerous times before it joined the euro what most people don t realize is that italy grew faster than germany in real terms for the 20 30 years prior to joining the euro despite its inflation and devaluations how long can this go on the japanese experience suggests much longer than we would think forever no there is a point where the zeitgeist the perceived global narrative about a country and currency changes and currencies and interest rates become unhinged it can happen seemingly overnight again how long can this go on we simply don t want to know the answer to that question we will only know after the fact and it will be a horrible painful fact to experience better to find a viable exit ramp i ll wrap up with a direct quote from lacy hunt which you will probably want to read several times his academic prose takes a little time to sink in but when it does you should be concerned if not terrified the parallels to the past are remarkable but there appears to be one fatal similarity the fed appears to have a high sensitivity to coincident or contemporaneous indicators of economic activity however the economic variables i e money and interest rates over which they have influence are slow moving and have enormous lags in the most recent episode in the last half of 2018 the federal reserve raised rates two times by a total of 50 basis points in reaction to the strong mid year gdp numbers these actions were done despite the fact that the results of their previous rate hikes and monetary deceleration were beginning to show their impact of actually slowing economic growth the m2 money growth rate was half of what it was two years earlier signs of diminished liquidity were appearing and there had been a multi quarter deterioration in the interest rate sensitive sectors of autos housing and capital spending presently the treasury market by establishing its rate inversion is suggesting that the fed s present interest rate policy is nearly 50 basis points too high and getting wider by the day a quick reversal could reverse the slide in economic growth but the lags are long it appears that history is being repeated too tight for too long slower growth lower rates the fed waited too long to raise rates and then overshot the mark when it finally got around to it i was calling for rate hikes in 2012 and 2013 the fed could have hiked 50 to 75 basis points per year normalizing interest rates and letting the economy adjust slowly rather than all at once late in the cycle having realized it fomc members then paused but too late and possibly for the wrong reasons now they re trapped lacy thinks an immediate 50 bp cut might help but he s not optimistic they will do it or that it will work if they do if that s right then we are in for slower growth and probably recession sooner rather than later in a debt laden highly leveraged economy it probably won t be a mild one either i mentioned earlier that i believe there is an off ramp exit for the us economy in the coming weeks i m going to respond to ray dalio s recent two part letter and then his third longer piece seemingly endorsing modern monetary theory mmt it will probably be a multipart series and will allow all of us to have a much larger thought experiment

modern technology was supposed to make travel less necessary we can meet by phone video and now in virtual reality but we re still traveling more than ever i certainly am the reason is simple technology can t yet replace face to face conversation and especially group conversations it is genetically hardwired in our species we spend more time on the phone and skype than ever but technology also makes information more complex and nuanced conveying it often requires a personal presence so we fly around and talk in person i thought of that last week at the strategic investment conference i ve been writing about japanification of the developed world economy explaining what i mean by that as best i can in these letters but in talking to conference attendees i found that i have not effectively communicated some of the nuances to be clear i don t want japanification nor do i think it will deliver the desired results i believe that in the next recession policymakers will respond with massive fiscal and monetary stimulus and instead of producing growth it will depress growth and leave us all in the same morass japan has endured for almost three decades in other words i believe that both government and central banks will try japanification of course under other names but i don t expect it to work in the way they would hope when faced with the imminent possibility of recession depression or even a crash authorities will try to do something but they will have very few choices the default option of ever larger stimulus will kick in so like japan the us will see yet

as trade tensions continue to simmer and there s no end in sight to the brexit turmoil risk sentiment will probably remain the biggest driver for forex markets in the coming week but there will still be several market moving events for investors to keep a watch on pce inflation numbers from the united states canadian q1 gdp estimates and a bank of canada meeting as well as capital expenditure figures from australia will be the main highlights aussie to stay on the defensive as the reserve bank of australia s next policy meeting nears on june 4 traders will be looking for further confirmation from upcoming releases that the central bank will cut rates at that meeting earlier this week rba governor philip lowe gave his strongest indication yet saying the bank will consider the case for a rate cut at the meeting unusually though the australian dollar although it remains on the back foot has not made fresh lows as the surprise election win for the ruling conservative coalition government has provided some support on the expectation that there will be large tax cuts to boost the economy the agenda for the aussie next week is pretty busy april building approvals are due on thursday along with first quarter capital expenditure figures private sector lending data will follow on friday the capex report will be the most important as it s seen as a good indicator of gdp growth which will be published on june 5 pmi numbers from china will also be relevant for the risk sensitive aussie as any weakness in the manufacturing pmis on friday would have a negative impact on the market mood at a time when the global outlook is already deteriorating from a worsening trade war yen bears face a losing battle with the us china trade war entering unchartered territory the threat of a no deal brexit rising renewed jitters about global growth and not to mention flaring tensions in the middle east investors are likely to continue to seek safety in risk free assets such as government bonds and of course the yen and the swiss franc the japanese currency has been a long time favourite for investors at times of market panic given japan s status as the world s number one creditor nation the yen is therefore expected to move in line with risk appetite with next friday s releases out of japan struggling for attention nevertheless with the increasing possibility that the bank of japan will have to ramp up its stimulus at some point later this year data on april industrial output and retail sales will be watched to gauge the health of the japanese economy european elections to set tone for the euro the only noteworthy release out of the eurozone next week is the economic sentiment indicator for may on tuesday following the flash pmis this week that were underwhelming the esi is not expected to paint a significantly different picture for the eurozone economy this means the focus in the coming days will be on politics as the results of the june 23 26 european parliament elections will be known when trading starts on monday if there s a sizeable shift away from centrist parties to populist movements the euro is likely to face some downside pressure however unless there s any big shocks in favour of eurosceptic and populist parties any sell off will probably be limited the uk calendar is also looking very light so politics will be the main driver for sterling too as had been highly speculated and following intense pressure from all sides for her to step down prime minister may has announced she will resign on june 7 paving the way for a new leader all eyes have now swiftly turned to the leadership race specifically the confirmed and rumoured contenders to replace her and what that could mean for the type of brexit the next uk prime

confirmation from upcoming releases that the central bank will cut rates at that meeting earlier this week rba governor philip lowe gave his strongest indication yet saying the bank will consider the case for a rate cut at the meeting unusually though the australian dollar although it remains on the back foot has not made fresh lows as the surprise election win for the ruling conservative coalition government has provided some support on the expectation that there will be large tax cuts to boost the economy the agenda for the aussie next week is pretty busy april building approvals are due on thursday along with first quarter capital expenditure figures private sector lending data will follow on friday the capex report will be the most important as it s seen as a good indicator of

turkey is paying the price for its pre election efforts to tinker with the markets as a controversial vote rerun looms a barrage of interventionist policies by president recep tayyip erdogan s government has backfired starving the economy of investment fuelling demand for foreign currency among households and businesses and further undermining the lira despite repeated assurances that capital controls aren t an option turkey has sought to stabilise its currency by reintroducing a tax on foreign currency sellers and imposing a settlement delay for purchases by individuals of more than 100 000 i can t see any significant flows returning until policymakers become more market friendly said win thin global head of currency strategy at brown brothers harriman co turkey has already shown that it doesn t care if real money can t hedge properly to stem a run on the turkish currency without resorting to another interest rate increase before march elections authorities made it harder for foreign investors to access lira funding while squeezing the local bond market and leaning on state banks to keep borrowing costs low while the measures briefly kept the lira in check after an unexpected drop in central bank reserves they left investors in a bind unable to access lira funding to maintain their positions some foreign investors dumped stock and bond holdings others balked at the prospect of runaway inflation since the squeeze foreign investors have withdrawn close to 2 5 billion from turkish capital markets taking this year s exodus to a net 1 8 billion the most since 2015 that s piling further pressure on the lira which slumped to a fresh eight month low against the dollar this month the currency is continuing to depreciate after wobbling on tuesday when the central bank rolled back a limited tightening of policy it delivered almost two weeks ago the government has also suppressed local currency borrowing to keep yields in check it hasn t sold a 10 year bond in almost a year despite a ballooning deficit instead it s loaded up on short dated lira and foreign currency debt some of the nation s primary dealers have also been asked to buy more government bonds in debt auctions according to three people with direct knowledge of the matter with the central bank s reserves running low turkey has few options should investors turn decisively against it erdogan has ruled out going to the international monetary fund the trouble with these measures is that they are stopgap in nature and are not part of a coherent and comprehensive macroeconomic program to deal with the country s economic woes desmond lachman a former imf official who s now a resident fellow at the american enterprise institute said by email as such they do little to restore investor confidence at least in public officials continue to invoke free markets treasury and finance minister berat albayrak has said the liquidity shortage in the swaps market wasn t engineered by the government and some analysts remain confident that turkey s economy will adjust despite the political challenges and investor confidence will eventually return still erdogan who once called himself an enemy of interest rates is increasingly falling back on invective that demonises banks and foreign investors before the march election he said the currency fluctuation was a us led operation by the west to corner turkey although he s eased off pressure on the central bank since its dramatic rate hike of 625 basis points in september erdogan said this month he was determined to reduce exchange rates interest rates and inflation with markets warped some investors are now worried turkey may struggle to attract the funds it needs as of february the nation had over 177 billion of foreign currency debt to roll over during the next 12 months the lira has weakened almost 8 per cent against the dollar this quarter the most in emerging markets extending its losses for the year to over 12 per cent earlier this month benchmark government bond yields flirted with record highs approaching levels not seen since a rout in august the latest bout of depreciation shows just how damaging the government s tactics have become complicating turkey s economic adjustment after years of credit fuelled growth economists now say this year s nascent recovery from the first recession in a decade may be short lived that the currency weakened so much despite a better current account position is a strong sign of the confidence erosion on the part of investors both foreign and domestic said inan demir an economist at nomura international plc in london the signs are clear foreign ownership in the local currency government bond market tumbled to an all time low as liquidity dried up the share of non residents in the market was at above 13 per cent in early may down from a peak of more than 28 per cent in 2013 central bank data show meanwhile households and companies seeking a hedge against inflation and political uncertainty rushed to convert their lira savings into dollars and euros in the three months before the march 31 vote they bought 20 billion of hard currency driving holdings to a record several of turkey s largest private banks have begun boosting the interest they pay on lira deposits but after four weeks of selling dollar and euros households and companies are buying again a sign the dollarisation trend could be hard to reverse despite the fallout the economy is getting enough of a reboot to eliminate some imbalances such as in the current account amassed during years of big spending

correct their wrong practices adding that only on a basis of equality and mutual respect can the talks continue meanwhile trump announced a 16b aid package for farmers to soften the blow from chinese tariffs suggesting that he is preparing for a drawn out conflict it s hard to see what s going to break the current standoff although trump has form with executing sharp u turns i e from threatening north korea with war to meeting north korean leader kim at summit the market might hope but as we stand there is no sign either side is willing to blink first adding to the negative sentiment the us manufacturing pmi fell to 50 6 its lowest level since 2009 and well below market expectations the market tends to place more weight on the ism manufacturing survey released early next month but the large downside surprise to the pmi led by the key new orders index was enough to reignite concerns about the us economic outlook the services pmi was also well below expectations to its lowest level since mid 2016 and not far above the 50 level that divides expansion from contraction respondents to the survey cited trade war worries and increased uncertainty european data didn t provide much encouragement either both the manufacturing and services pmis slipped further albeit not too far from market expectations while the german ifo fell to its lowest level since late 2014 us treasury

target the current target is that net core crown debt fall to 20 of gdp by 2021 21 but robertson indicated that the government was considering adopting a 15 25 for subsequent years the shift to a range on treasury s advice is meant to ensure that the government can respond to different economic circumstances in the future for instance more government spending to support the economy in a recession which will increase debt gdp the move gives the government more wiggle room with regard to future spending although robertson said the budget would still show the government on track to hit

economies the wild bubble card may 24 king world news while the media continues to blame any retraction and future fears of downturns in economies and equities on the trade wars and tariffs among the greater fears barely reported is the 250 trillion debt bubble that keeps growing that has inflated equities and expanded economies the international monetary fund has warned that high corporate debt has spread to 70 percent of the global economy and there are growing signs that this credit cycle may be maturing and risks of an economic slowdown are rising singling out the u s and china as the most vulnerable they warned that companies continue to borrow more even as profitability falls bonus interview to listen to doug casey s just released kwn interview discussing his prediction of financial and economic chaos and a panic into gold click here or below sponsored further debt bubble warnings were issued by bain capital whose co managing partner johathan lavine noted that increasingly aggressive private equity groups were taking on heavy debt to win merger and acquisition deals heightening the risk of a crash in the sector in the event of a sharp market downturn therefore should interest rates rise so will the debt burden thus the prospects for higher rates remain negligible what a difference a quarter makes on 19 september 2018 the day before the s p hit a record high we had forecast an economic 9 11 would sink stock markets we based our forecast on stated federal reserve policy to aggressively raise interest rates through 2019 perfectly on trend equity markets across the globe tanked many sinking over 20 percent into bear territory following our forecast in fact the dow had its worse december since the great depression however we did a 180 degree turn reversing our economic 9 11 forecast to a trump market bump following u s federal reserve chairman jerome powell s rate hike u turn on 4 january when he pledged to be patient in raising rates in 2019 subsequently by the end of april the s p 500 and nasdaq rallied to record highs immediately after the fed signaled its high probability of no rate increase this year central banks and governments began shooting new rounds of monetary methadone into their financial systems to help counter slowing economic growth by lowering interest rates if they had room to implementing more quantitative easing provisions lowering loan standards and or spend on infrastructure projects global economic slow down in april china s retail sales growth slumped to a 16 year low but in europe consumer spending increased between 0 3 and 0 7 percent in the larger countries and in the u s consumer spending grew 0 9 percent in march although it was the biggest gain in nearly a decade inflation pressures remained low and incomes increased only 0 1 percent thus consumers are spending more while wages remain stagnant and debt burdens grow heavier considering that federal reserve found that 40 percent of americans couldn t afford a 400 emergency when the next economic crisis strikes it will hit with great depression implications and while first quarter 3 2 percent gdp growth in the u s was impressive much of it was the result of sharp increases in exports and not imports a far better economic indicator of consumer and business growth and europe s gdp number comes at a time when business confidence in the eu sunk to a 5 year low as did industrial sector confidence according to the european commission the wild oil card should geopolitical tensions in the oil rich middle east and venezuela dramatically escalate the socioeconomic fallout will be felt across the globe despite u s led attempts to oust venezuelan president nicholas maduro from office have failed we forecast the stage for war has been set and we also have forecast the u s will continue to ramp up pressure against iran indeed both oil rich nations are deeply suffering from the economic warfare i e sanctions imposed by america thus when tensions increase and oil prices sharply spike as a result the already fragile global economy will be hit hard by rising costs at the pump in the usa gasoline has been on a steady rise this year averaging 2 97 a gallon on may 1 and for oil dependent nations whose currencies are declining as the dollar stays strong the rising cost of petro dollar based energy will dampen economic and equity market growth and while new rounds of heightened violence that recently erupted between israel and the palestinians have subsided this never ending tinder box is always ready to explode further israel s continued bombings and missile attacks against syria plus the worsening saudi united arab emirates four year yemen war against the houthi faction who they claim is supported by iran but houthi s and iran deny are major middle east destabilizing factors with the potential to dramatically affect oil prices tj trend forecast should war expand in venezuela and the

fronts it s interest rates stupid while taught in school and parroted by politicians and the media that central bank s monetary policy decisions are not subject to approval be it india turkey the u s etc constant attacks by nation s leaders do not fall on deaf ears indeed as global economies weaken politicians will pressure their central banks to lower rates in hopes of propping up sinking markets and economies and their popularity ratings when up for re election we forecast that as the u s economy slows later this year and next the fed will be under pressure to lower interest rates as needed to maintain strong economic equity and real estate markets throughout the 2020 election cycle while the u s federal fund rate at 2 5 percent is still low by historical standards despite the fed having raised them nine times since 2015 it can lower them nine times we also forecast modest gains in stock markets this year as more cheap money stimulus measures are implemented thus pushing sidelined speculators back into equities and in turn moderately increasing trading volume equity market growth will also be limited since we forecast u s corporate earnings are approaching peak levels the trends journal continues to stress that these artificially induced stimulus measures are temporary not only inflating the 250 trillion global debt bubble as noted they have left economies and business vulnerable to wild card events that could send markets into a tailspin and economies into depression therefore considering the current events forming future trends despite attempts by central banks to boost economies a global slowdown will ensue and recessionary pressures will accelerate from china to europe from australia to argentina the hard numbers in sinking exports slumping housing prices

president donald trump s use of the most vicious aspects of economic warfare prompt another examination of the politics of starvation after george w bush s administration presidents barack obama and donald trump lessened bush s aggressive war policies and leaned to economic warfare sounds harmless when compared to exploding bombs but it is not economic warfare can crush an adversary without firing a shot gone to its extreme economic warfare has the force of a neutron bomb it disables the nation s infrastructure and debilitates its population isolation from the international financial system material embargos and other sanctions reduce living standards and bring populations close to starvation the most serious aspects of economic warfare are major crimes and a form of terrorism iran cuba north korea and iraq endured the most punishing sanctions from the united states results of sanctions against these countries models for the effects of sanctions show that sanctions have rarely accomplished their stated purposes and their intentions may be for other reasons stalling economic progress weakening challenges to antagonistic actions advancing dominance and promoting regime change iran disturbed with the rule of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini and infuriated by the hostage taking of 52 of u s embassy personnel by extreme islamic students and militants president jimmy carter froze several billions of dollars in iranian bank deposits gold and other properties and followed with a 1980 embargo on trade with and travel to iran these punitive actions accomplished nothing for the united states strengthened the ayatollah s authority and hardened the student demands for releasing the captured embassy officials president reagan who partially owed his climb into the executive office to the hostage crisis showed contempt for iran s resolution of the problem driven by the unproven assertion that iran was involved in the 1983 bombing of a marine barracks in beirut and favoring saddam hussein s iraq in the iraq iran war the u s president imposed additional sanctions on the islamic republic and in 1987 banned all imports from iran duriing the clinton administration the iran libya sanctions act ilsa penalized all foreign companies that provided investments over 20 million for the development of petroleum resources iran s entrance into the atomic age provoked a series of new sanctions economic warfare soon reached full scale by subduing iran s earnings from its most precious resource and export oil the u s congress passed unilateral sanctions that targeted iran s energy and banking sectors sanctions did not halt iran s nuclear activities or prevent it from signing contracts with foreign firms to develop its energy resources exports slowly grew to an estimated 82 billion in 2012 with liberated iraq and independent china filling the gap as trading partners nevertheless economic warfare affected iran s industries and welfare in october 2012 iran s currency the rial fell to a record low against the us dollar losing about 80 per cent of its value in one year lack of spare parts and inability to replace planes affected aviation safety real growth rate in gdp at a steady six per cent a year during the first decade of the twenty first century fell to two per cent in 2011 2012 one report citing officials from the u s departments of state and energy concluded that gasoline imports in the shah s former kingdom declined from 130 000 barrels a day in 2009 to 50 000 barrels a day in 2011 machinery wears and the costs and time for repairs rapidly increased a nation of educated professionals who depended upon access to foreign technology and scientific cooperation had their access to knowledge severely curtailed in a october 5 2012 report to the un general assembly un secretary general ban ki moon summarized effects of sanctions on iran s population the sanctions imposed on the islamic republic of iran have had significant effects on the general population including an escalation in inflation a rise in commodities and energy costs an increase in the rate of unemployment and a shortage of necessary items including medicine the embargoes have also hampered humanitarian operations as the imposed restrictions on iran s banking system have halted the imports of medicines needed for treating diseases like cancer and heart and respiratory conditions the obama administration eventually eased restrictions on the sale of medicines to iran and after the joint comprehensive plan of action in which iran halted and downsized its uranium enrichment the un lifted sanctions in a following year iran gdp increased 15 percent on may 8 2018 u s president donald trump announced that the united states would withdraw from the iran nuclear deal and u s sanctions came into effect again in november 2018 president trump articulated his plan for renewed sanctions as to bring iran s oil exports to zero and remove a main source of revenue for the regime trump imposed the ultimate harm afforded by economic warfare starve the people and have them revolt against the regime that has not happened nor is predicted to occur world bank statistics indicate a severe slowing of the economy and steady rise of inflation as shown in the charts oil production and gdp growth dropped monotonically and severely currency value

cuban revolution the united states imposed an embargo against cuba fifty plus years of sanctions have not succeeded in accomplishing the purposes for which the united states proposed the sanctions compensation to u s firms nationalized by cuba and the overthrow of the castro regime the only result of the embargo has been deprivation of the cuban people although the united nations general assembly on november 2 1995 voted 117 to 3 to recommend an end to the u s embargo against cuba president clinton on march 12 1996 signed into law the misnamed cuban liberty and democratic solidarity act this act imposed penalties on foreign companies doing business in cuba permitted u s citizens to sue foreign investors who make use of american owned property seized by the cuban government and denied foreign investors in cuba s industry to enter the u s the world health organization who complimented pre 90 s cuba for its public health system which had been credited with eliminating hunger and malnutrition and wiping out infectious diseases a tightened embargo reinforced cuba s suffering after russia withdrew subsidies and soon cuba of the mid 90 s portrayed another image the american association for world health and the american public health association ascertained that the embargo caused significant deterioration in cuba s food production and health care cuba was banned from purchasing nearly 1 2 of new drugs on the market physicians had access to only 890 medications down from 1 300 in 1989 deterioration of water supply increased water borne diseases daily caloric intake dropped by 33 between 1989 and 1993 in 2000 the clinton administration finally allowed cuba to have some relief from an aggressive economic warfare the administration allowed the sale of agriculture

million in 2008 u s food sales to cuba declined over 50 percent by the year 2011 reasons for the decline were largely economic lack of foreign currency and better financial terms being offered by other countries representatives of a dozen leading u s business organizations including the u s chamber of commerce signed a letter in december urging barack obama to scrap the embargo the letter pegs the cost to the u s economy at 1 2 billion per year the cpf s estimates are much higher up to 4 84 billion annually in lost sales and exports the cuban government estimates the loss to cuba at about 685 million annually thus the blockade costs the united states up to 4 155 billion more a year than it costs cuba dollars and sense 2009 the costs of the embargo by margot pepper after a period of harsh policy toward cuba under president george w bush president obama announced in late 2014 that washington and havana would begin normalizing relations to that end the obama administration achieved three pillars of normalization 1 the removal of cuba s designation as a state sponsor of terrorism which allowed cuba to access international finance 2 the reestablishment of diplomatic relations and 3 relaxed restrictions on travel and trade through executive action the embargo remained in place in 2017 the trump administration reversed some of the changes made under president obama but the vast majority remained u s policy despite some tighter trade sanctions and limitations on authorized travel there are still legal pathways for americans to export and travel to cuba on the list of new sanctions is allowing americans to sue foreign companies in cuba that are profiting from or using properties that were seized during the cuban revolution havana the cuban government announced friday it is launching widespread rationing of chicken eggs rice beans soap and other basic products in the face of a grave economic crisis commerce minister betsy díaz velazquez told the state run cuban news agency that various forms of rationing would be employed in order to deal with shortages of staple foods díaz blamed the hardening of the u s trade embargo by the trump administration economists give equal or greater blame to a plunge in aid from venezuela where the collapse of the state run oil company has led to a nearly two thirds cut in shipments of subsidized fuel that cuba used for power and to earn hard currency on the open market from cbs news may 11 2019 another suffering economy suffering people and no political gain for the u s north korea the proud and impoverished nation of north korea has been continually subjected to sanctions threats of economic sanctions and hastily withdrawn sanctions the media is peppered with the words u s lifts sanctions u s recommends sanctions south korea wary of sanctions it s difficult to know if north korea is being sanctioned or being forced into being sanctioned after its 2006 claim of conducting a nuclear test the dprk democratic people s republic korea leaders responded to intended sanctions by labeling them as a declaration of war the dprk has suffered from economic warfare which includes restrictions on trade and

pyongyang vows to push ahead with a plan to launch a long range missile in defiance of international warnings u s military officials said on wednesday under president obama sanctions increased as a policy of strategic patience the us waited for north korea to change its bad behavior before engaging with the state as a result trade between north korea and china increased and sanctions did not encourage kim jong an to discuss de nuclearization on september 21 2017 president donald trump as part of his administration s maximum pressure campaign allowed severing from its financial system and or freezing assets of companies businesses organizations and individuals who traded in goods services or technology with north korea u s negotiations with north korea have a built in error they request de nuclearization in exchange for improved relations and reduction in sanctions not considered is that north korea s development of a nuclear arsenal was a response to its regard of u s actions in the korean peninsula as a direct threat to its regime and the developments had no relation to sanctions therefore the dprk will not trade de nuclearization for relief of sanctions and that approach is a non starter sanctions intended to collapse the north korea regime have not halted its development of nuclear weapons and guided missile delivery systems they have collapsed the economy and harmed the north korean people starvation during droughts have occurred although some international assistance has been provided to north korea the intensive economic warfare waged against the

iraq began august 6 1990 four days after hussein invaded kuwait and featured a near total financial and trade embargo resultant suffering has been outlined in a un report on the current humanitarian situation in iraq submitted to the security council march 1999 due to the length of the report only significant features are mentioned before the iraq war before 1991 iraq s social and economic indicators were generally above the regional and developing country averages up to 1990 the food and agricultural organization fao cited iraq as having one of the highest per capita food availability indicators in the region according to the world health organization who prior to 1991 health care reached approximately 97 of the urban population and 78 of rural residents a major reduction of young child mortality took place from 1960 to 1990 with the infant mortality rate at 65 per 1 000 live births in 1989 1991 human development report average for developing countries was 76 per 1 000 live births unicef indicates that a national welfare system assisted orphans and children with disabilities and supported the poorest families before 1991 southern and central iraq had well developed water and sanitation systems composed with two hundred water treatment plants wtp s for urban areas and 1200 compact wtp s to serve rural areas as well as an extensive distribution network who estimates that 90 of the population had access to an abundant quantity of safe drinking water from sanctions after the gulf war economist intelligence unit estimates that iraqi gdp may have fallen by nearly 67 in 1991 and the nation had experienced a shift from relative affluence to massive poverty and had infant mortality rates that were among the highest in the world the united nations population fund unfpa estimated the maternal mortality rate increased from 50 100 000 live births in 1989 to 117 100 000 in 1997 the under five child mortality rate increased from 30 2 1000 live births to 97 2 1000 during the same period the united nations department of economic and social affairs desa calculates that the infant mortality rate rose from 64 1000 births in 1990 to 129 1000 in 1995 the human development report set the average infant mortality rate for least developed countries at 109 1000 low birth weight babies less than 2 5 kg rose from 4 in 1990 to around a quarter of registered births in 1997 due mainly to maternal malnutrition calorie intake fell from a pre war 3120 to 1093 calories per capita per day in 1994 95 the prevalence of malnutrition in iraqi children under five almost doubled from 1991 to 1996 from 12 to 23 acute malnutrition in center south rose from 3 to 11 for the same age bracket the world food program wfp estimated that access to potable water decreased to 50 of the 1990 level in urban areas and 33 in rural areas school enrollment for all ages 6 23 declined to 53 according to a field survey conducted in 1993 as quoted by unesco in central and southern governorates 83 of school buildings needed rehabilitation with 8613 out of 10 334 schools having suffered serious damages the same source indicated that some schools with a planned capacity of 700 pupils actually have 4500 enrolled in them substantive progress in reducing adult and female illiteracy ceased and regressed to mid 1980 levels more families are forced to rely on children to secure household incomes figures provided by unesco indicate that drop outs in elementary schools increased from 95 692 in 1990 to 131 658 in 1999 sanctions and its toll on the iraqi people continued until the u s invasion of iraq in 2003 excerpts from invisible war the united states and the iraq sanctions joy gordon harvard university press 2010 describe the extent of irrational economic warfare conducted by the united states against a defenseless iraq while the united states consistently justified its policies in terms of preventing iraq from developing weapons or threatening its neighbors the u s policy went well beyond any rational concern with security there was an elaborate architecture of policies that found a dozen other ways to simply do gratuitous harm that had not the least relation to the threat iraq might have posed to its neighbors or to anyone else for thirteen years the united states unilaterally prevented iraq from importing nearly everything related to electricity telecommunications and transportation blocked much of what was needed for agriculture and housing construction and even prohibited some equipment and materials necessary for health care and food preparation as the criticism grew there is no sign that anyone in the u s administration and only a tiny handful within congress actually took it to heart actually questioned the sanity and legality of reducing an entire civilization to a preindustrial state of bankrupting an entire nation for the purpose of containing one tyrannical man on may 12 1996 madeleine albright then u s ambassador to the united nations appeared on the cbs program 60 minutes commentator lesley stahl asked we have heard that half a million children have died i mean that s more children than died in hiroshima is the price worth it madeleine albright replied we think the price is worth it is that an expected response from a normal human being the u s 2003 invasion of iraq accomplished what sanctions failed to accomplish push iraq to total ruin a question why war if had sanctions or why sanctions if need to go to war conclusion as shown sanctions never accomplished their stated purposes and gravely harmed populations the economic warfare had equivalents to military war the country that took the offensive became the aggressor as in any war and the destruction to the defending state was equally brutal in the one sided engagement the civilian population of the defending nation suffered greatly and the aggressor country suffered few losses the economic wars never achieved the results that the offended party desired and no peace treaties were signed the struggles remained an open issue a limited form of economic warfare may at times have a legitimate purpose a complete economic war that invades all aspects of a country s life and continues until it debilitates the population cannot be accepted in a military campaign atrocities and human rights violations are often committed although no shots are fired and battlefields are not identifiable economic warfare cannot camouflage its atrocities and disguise its human rights violations
by reuters by sarah marsh havana reuters israel hidalgo and his wife left home around 7 30 a m to reach a supermarket across havana because they heard it might be selling chicken a staple of the cuban diet increasingly scarce on the shortage plagued island after cuba started limiting sales this month partly blaming tightened u s economic sanctions on the communist run island the couple wanted to buy as much as possible and lined up for three hours under the caribbean sun to get tickets guaranteeing them their rations inside they lined up again to collect two bags of chicken thighs each as fellow shoppers elbowed one another in pursuit of their own rations and headed for the checkout feeling like they had won the lottery we were born in this revolution and are used to rough times said hidalgo a 61 year old blacksmith we are bracing ourselves for it to get worse long lines outside shops with mostly bare shelves are increasingly common in cuba and the government has indeed signalled that things are going from bad to worse cuban president miguel diaz canel in a speech last month accused the trump administration of engaging in an asphyxiating financial persecution that makes the import of goods and resources of primary necessity particularly difficult the degree to which new u s sanctions due in part to cuba s support for venezuelan president nicolas maduro have compounded its economic woes is open to debate the economy had already stagnated in recent years in tandem with the implosion of strategic ally venezuela resulting in cuts in fuel and energy use by state entities and this year shortages of basic goods such as bread chicken and eggs but the increase in sanctions which have hit the key tourism sector and added to investor and bank jitters about dealing with cuba has some economists predicting the economy will slip from stagnation into a full blown recession later this year the economy has averaged 1 annual growth over the last three years compared with the 5 to 7 rate economists say is needed to recover fully from the depression caused by the fall of its former benefactor the soviet union in 1991 while the crisis will not be as bad as in the 1990s it will have a worrying social impact on the most vulnerable households which are already on subsistence salaries said pavel vidal a former cuban central bank economist who teaches at colombia s universidad javeriana cali bracing for harder economic times the government has resorted to what it knows best to manage the crisis and prevent social unrest more control interior commerce minister betsy diaz said two weeks ago the government would temporarily ration sales of a handful of basic products like eggs on a monthly basis using ration books distributed after the 1959 revolution and limit the sale of others like chicken to ensure everyone gets their fair share a critical moment some cuban economists say the developing crisis stems fundamentally from an inefficient centrally planned economy that imports more than two thirds of its food needs calling rationing little more than a short term solution they say the government must open up to a series of market oriented economic reforms before the crisis deepens this could be a critical moment that generates the consensus necessary to apply changes said vidal the government needs to give more space to the private sector and investment advertisement cuba has enacted some economic reforms in recent years including expanding the private sector from 2010 onward and introducing a new foreign investment law that cut taxes by around 50 in 2014 but local economists like omar everleny say the reforms undertaken have been too cautious so far the government has backtracked on overhauls of areas like agriculture and the dominant public sector remains deeply inefficient cuba was already behind on an estimated 1 5 billion 1 1 billion in short term commercial debt and warning of austerity before u s president donald trump started the latest round of tightening of the decades old u s trade embargo aid from venezuela in the form of subsidized oil had long masked the true extent of cuba s economic problems but it started to fall from 2015 when a drop in oil prices roiled that opec nation s economy venezuela s crude shipments to cuba are now about half what they were four years ago and they could soon fall further last month the united states also began targeting vessels and companies that ship oil to the island from venezuela for sanctions threatening the energy grid and transportation advertisement u s sanctions against its old cold war foe are also hitting the two bright spots in the otherwise glum economy tourism and foreign investment both had boomed briefly after the announcement of a cuba u s detente in 2014 tourism revenues dropped by 4 6 in 2018 according to official data released last month the announcement in 2017 of tighter travel restrictions on u s citizens played a role at one point u s visits dropped more than 40 percent cuban tourism minister manuel marrero told reuters adding he still hoped tourism would grow this year meanwhile the trump administration has activated a long dormant law under which cuban americans can sue foreign companies that profit from their properties nationalized during the first years of the 1959 revolution western diplomats and businessmen have called the threat of potentially costly u s court battles another clear disincentive for banks and outside investors to do business with cuba advertisement the united states has also threatened to further tighten restrictions on travel and to impose a cap on cash remittances to cuba measures that could hit the economy hard siege mentality cuba s government has said it will continue moving down the path toward reform but it has failed to respond so far to calls from the island s entrepreneurs for basic changes such as the creation of wholesale markets for the private sector and the right to import and export instead of opening the economy further some western diplomats and analysts say there is risk cuba s leadership will adopt a siege mentality in the face of increased u s hostility that could mean turning to allies like russia vietnam and china for help to muddle through while keeping its stranglehold on economic life advertisement the u s sanctions could be counterproductive said one diplomat who asked not to be identified cuba has historically closed up at times like these cubans are not going hungry like they did during the so called special period after the collapse of the soviet union but they are increasingly connected to the rest of the world via the internet and foreign travel and many have grown weary of government attempts to blame the u s embargo for the bulk of their country s woes we are in total freefall said hidalgo s wife carmen lozano 55 clinging to her two bags of rationed chicken they should have allowed free production and sales from the beginning of the revolution inequality has risen in recent years in cuba and many believe the economic crisis could have a more disproportionate impact now than it might have in the past in a country where the government s claim to legitimacy rests to a large extent on ensuring a certain level of equality the authorities seem well aware that most people lack the cash to stock up on whatever basics they need on the black market advertisement the government s new rationing program is trying to address that simmering discontent by making the small quantities of goods that are in stock more widely available said william leogrande a professor of government at american university the government understands that discontent over the economy is their biggest political vulnerability so they will do everything they can to maintain supplies of basic goods reporting by sarah marsh additional reporting by marc frank and nelson acosta editing by daniel flynn and tom brown
as manitoba farmers wrap up seeding they face more uncertainty than usual including the potential unravelling of the international rules based trading system that has become almost as essential as rain meanwhile crop prices are down after a decade of relatively good returns spurring global production to exceed demand exacerbated now by african swine fever decimating china s hog herd making it worse after 25 years of increasing trade liberalism protectionism is on the rise exemplified by the expanding united states china trade war and linked to china s de facto boycott of canadian canola seed and all but dried up soybean purchases advertisement read also canadian beef digging in against avian influenza beef cattle producers in alberta and manitoba are taking biosecurity measures should the bird flu strain infecting some u s dairy herds jump the border and into canadian beef cattle as a result marketsfarms is forecasting a 100 per cent increase in canadian canola ending stocks when the current crop year ends july 31 because of the trade war the u s is subsidizing its crop producers further distorting world markets and undercutting canadian farmers competitiveness advertisement it raises the spectre of the mid 1980s when surplus world grain stocks and the u s european union grain subsidy war depressed world grain prices for a decade that and other factors including high interest rates forced many western canadian crop producers to quit land values started to fall cutting farmers net worth triggering a downward spiral pushing thousands off the land i am not looking at things optimistically today maybe it s just the day but i do see those who are raising the 80s and early 90s as examples and there are a lot of indicators that we re sort of on the edge of going in that direction cereals canada president cam dahl said in an interview may 16 again if you look back to the 80s it wasn t a good time for farmers someone asked me the other day if farmers should be concerned and yes farmers should be concerned ironically last year the value of canada s agri food exports hit a new record at 59 3 billion advertisement there could be a silver lining though short term pain for long term gain says mike gifford former chief agricultural trade negotiator for canada the americans have deliberately created a trade crisis as they did with the eu in the mid 1980s grain subsidy war in order to force change in china and to also force change in the wto world trade organization gifford said in an interview may 7 if there s a failure in the chinese u s negotiation then you could be in for a real rocky ride with retaliation and counter retaliation if the china u s deal was primarily preferential then you could be concerned that this would have the effect of unravelling the multilateral trading system advertisement there s a sense of deja vu says university of saskatchewan agricultural economist richard gray the u s china trade dispute isn t helping but the real problem is supply exceeding demand he said in an interview may 15 if one set of countries puts a set of tariffs on the other it s not a big deal but if there s too much grain in the world the whole price regime comes down and that s where we re at gray said that s where we were in the 80s and early 90s as well a whole new generation of farmers hasn t experienced tough times especially those farming since 2006 when world grain prices began to take off mainly because billions of bushels of primarily american corn was being made into ethanol university of manitoba agricultural economist derek brewin said in an interview may 16 the only thing they saw was the positive he said normally the cure for low prices is low prices farmers produce less or sell more and as supply and demand become more balanced prices rise but the u s china trade dispute and other non tariff trade barriers muddy the waters distorting market signals adding uncertainty and risk advertisement it s the trade dispute that s causing new risk to farmers brewin said it makes things significantly worse last year u s president donald trump created a 12 billion commodity specific subsidy program to compensate american farmers for lower prices due to import tariffs china placed on american crops in retaliation for tariffs trump put on imports of chinese goods of the estimated 9 6 billion all figures u s dollars paid out an estimated 7 7 billion or 1 65 a bushel went to american soybean farmers that makes it harder for canadian soybean growers to compete advertisement trump says the program will run again this year if it s 1 65 for every bushel they produce then they are not going to reduce their production gray said i think it really matters for their production levels once this stuff is produced and sitting on the market it s going to continue to have an impact on price regardless whether it s the export market or domestic market even more concerning is trump s musing that the u s government will buy surplus american grain production and donate it as food aid something that s illegal under world trade organization wto rules such action is not only tantamount to an export subsidy also illegal because of how it distorts world prices but it can destroy local markets making countries even more food insecure by driving subsistence farmers out of business despite the dire outlook dahl says canadian farmers have some advantages if you look right now at the financial stability of grain farmers here and in the u s we re actually in a lot better shape he said part of that of course is the exchange rate lower canadian dollar but another part of it is our diversity of cropping options canadian farmers have been getting market signals and we have a much more diversified crop base and that a very good thing arguably it s a holdover from the 1980s when western canadian farmers were desperate to find alternative crops less affected by the subsidy war making matters worse the united states department of agriculture expects global wheat production in 2019 to hit a record of 777 million tonnes most of that wheat will be middle protein dahl said that distinction is important because we have something a little bit different in cwrs canada western red spring wheat and we re going on to the world market with a major class that is differentiated from a lot of that he said again that s a big advantage the fog of trade wars not all agriculture subsidies are created equal some can be downright deadly as a new subsidy war looms keep in mind agriculture subsidies have always been part of the economic picture for the sector they become problematic when governments stop using them for policy goals like smoothing out the highs and lows of the market and instead use them as political tools in the 1980s and 1990s the u s and european union were locked in a bitter fight to clear a global grain backlog that saw both subsidize exports placing canadian farmers squarely in the middle in the end the battle contributed to the transformation of gatt the general agreement on trades and tariffs into the world trade organization and the curtailment if not elimination of export subsidies however subsidies that didn t encourage overproduction for the export market still remained

metric to assess our operating and financial performance before the impact of investing and financing transactions income taxes and certain non core and non recurring items in our financial statements the presentation of adjusted ebitda and core net income should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by other charges and gains we consider to be outside the ordinary course of our business the use of adjusted ebitda and core net income has certain limitations because it does not reflect all items of income and expenses that affect our operations items excluded from adjusted ebitda and core net income are significant components in understanding and assessing our operating and financial performance depreciation and amortization expense for various long term assets income tax and share based compensation have been and will be incurred and are not reflected in the presentation of adjusted ebitda each of these items should also be considered in the overall evaluation of our results additionally adjusted ebitda and core net income does not consider capital expenditures and other investing activities and should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity we compensate for these limitations by providing the relevant disclosure of our depreciation and amortization interest expense income gains losses from investments in equity securities income tax expenses share based compensation share of loss in equity investees government subsidies and other relevant items both in our reconciliations to the corresponding u s gaap financial measures and in our consolidated financial statements all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance the term adjusted ebitda and core net income is not defined under u s gaap and adjusted ebitda and core net income is not a measure of net income operating income operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with u s gaap when assessing our operating and financial performance you should not consider this data in isolation or as a substitute for our net income operating income or any other operating performance measure that is calculated in accordance with u s gaap in addition our adjusted ebitda and core net income may not be comparable to adjusted ebitda and core net income or similarly titled measures utilized by other companies since such other

another round of punishing austerity in ontario canada may 24 2019 greg albo bryan evans and carlo fanelli the eminent conservative scholar of public budgeting aaron wildavsky characterized annual budgets as a record of victories defeats bargains and compromises the province of ontario s 2019 budget the first of the new conservative government of doug ford does indeed tell us something of this additional fiscal supports for business erosion of social expenditures in general and for the most vulnerable in particular large expenditures on public programs needed now spread far into the future and generous symbolic gestures for this and that political constituency few surprises here after all ontario is long standing as canada s pre eminent fiscally conservative jurisdiction with an unbroken legacy of clientelist politics greased by the public purse of the provincial state but budgetary policies also reveal deeper structural features such as the regional setting of the world market the administrative form and policy regime of the state and social struggles over justice and democracy such a shift in focus immediately registers a line of continuity extending back from the ford government to the 1995 2003 common sense revolution of the conservative government of mike harris and ernie eves their market expanding and labour disciplining agenda established ontario as a low tax low cost regional production zone of north america dominated by an increasingly powerful financial class and a state committed to extensive growth at whatever the costs to ontario s ecology first nations and workers neoliberalism with its core tenets of a constitutionally constrained and coercive state buttressing of a free market guided budgetary policy and all else despite the shift to a more inclusionary political discourse the liberal governments of dalton mcguinty and kathleen wynne from 2003 18 never departed from this fiscal legacy and consolidated for the most part a variation of the same policy regime and development strategy there is no single neoliberal budgetary framework that has guided every single state other than an underlying faith in expansionary austerity fiscal restraint to encourage business investment after the shock therapy of the initial harris budgets in the mid 90s ontario fiscal policy has been focused on budgetary balance and total debt reduction ontario budgetary practice has been to keep nominal growth in spending below the combined rate of growth in inflation and output to steadily reduce the size of government as a portion of the provincial economy as a result ontario sits last among the provinces in per capita government expenditures and more than 2000 below the average for the rest of canada since 2010 program spending in ontario has been growing at half the rate it has been in the rest of canada the ford budget aggressively amplifies this austerity logic and makes absurd the austerity lite verdict of the mainstream media and business economists undermining fiscal capacities first since harris budgetary strategy has deliberately undermined the fiscal capacity to fund program spending adequately ontario now trails other provinces with lower personal and corporate tax rates and the lowest per capita revenues still potential revenues are cut in the order of 3 3 billion from scrapping carbon pricing reducing the average marginal effective tax rate on business from 16 to 12 6 well below the u s average of 18 7 through accelerated capital cost allowances and cutting the small business deduction surtax from 11 5 to 3 5 with a further reduction in the small business tax to come as well as a substantial cut to the middle income tax rate remains for the future while budget 2019 forecasts public expenditure in the aggregate to grow the tory plan is to further ratchet down the existing trend rate of growth of program spending beginning with the levelling out of nominal spending as a whole for the current budget year indeed considering inflation and a growing population this entails a radical cut to per capita program spending and a spending cut in real terms if inflation runs above 1 5 directly recalling the harris period as a td bank budget commentary approvingly notes as a consequence the ontario public service has already been reduced by 3 5 through voluntary attrition alone with further employee cuts coming across the public sector with teachers and support staff in the education sector already receiving layoff notices as the restraint to revenue growth and spending cuts take hold ontario s net debt to the provincial gdp ratio will steadily decline from a current 40 2 to 38 6 over the term of the government and after accounting changes the tories used to boost up net debt the post budget spring economic and budget outlook of the financial accountability office of ontario tersely notes that the government s plan for balancing the budget relies on restraining the growth in program spending to historic lows the fiscal consequences of this punishing austerity for social provisioning in ontario are shocking as the fao projects on the ford government fiscal strategy specifically the government plans to hold program spending growth to just 1 0 per cent on average over the next five years which would be the slowest pace of spending growth since the mid 1990s as a result of this restraint provincial spending on public services would be reduced by 1 100 per person or by more than 10 per cent over the next five years second while not discarding the liberal efforts to foster an investment climate favourable to the gig economy and financial capital in toronto and southern ontario the tory budgetary strategy reorders an array of departments and agencies to boost the development sector in general and extractive capital investment in particular this includes a major deregulatory agenda to be pursued through a task force with a mandate to reduce the regulatory burden by 25 but also the creation of the office of economic growth and innovation departmental budgetary allocations also disclose this agenda the budget for the environment and parks ministry for example is to be cut by some 35 which will gut already enfeebled enforcement capacities and further open up parks for commercialization and development but the biggest departmental cut is the almost halving of the budget for indigenous affairs this will slow a range of land claim and treaty settlement issues and also undermine processes of consultation and collaboration over resource development the government is seeking to restrict regulatory processes and other obstacles to resource development in the ring of fire in northern ontario as well as a number of areas where conflicts over logging and mining exist as sol mamakwa new democrat mpp representing kiiwetinoong in northern ontario bluntly stated ford is dragging ontario further away from reconciliation third the ford budget explicitly targets reducing social provisioning costs and labour costs for business spending for the education sector for example is to grow on average only 1 for the next three years meaning annual cuts in real terms the training university and colleges sectors are even harder hit with budget allocations to decline on average by 1 over the same period and also facing cuts to student loans and student fees healthcare spending is to grow by a modest 1 6 per year on average over three years but this is far below trend rates of growth in the sector and what healthcare providers were requesting just to stay in the same place the single healthcare agency being set up and the amalgamation of health districts are to facilitate a dramatic restructuring of healthcare delivery to further cut costs the third largest proportional cut nearly 25 hits municipal affairs and housing the budget signals a market driven policy strategy in which regulations are to be streamlined and development costs reduced to increase housing supply but while the words alcohol and beer appear 46 times in the budget the crisis of housing affordability does not merit a mention the stock of toronto community housing units in need of major repair continues to grow with an estimated backlog of more than 3 billion the budget also walks back a planned hike to the municipal portion of gas tax revenue estimated to cost the city of toronto 1 1 billion in planned transit investments as ontario municipalities continue to struggle with fiscal capacities incapable of funding public transit needs

less capacity than they had on april 10th including a 1 billion cut to social assistance alone according to the conservatives own figures budget 2019 puts 5 billion back into the pockets of the business community nearly 1 3 billion resulting from the cancellation of the planned increase in the minimum wage another 1 4 billion is estimated to come from a 30 reduction to workplace safety insurance premiums for employers although the wsib agency is already plagued with problems of understaffing backlogs and denied claims the budget also moves away from proactive ministry of labour investigations toward a self reliant model along with a planned 10 million cut by 2019 20 employment blitzes carried out by the ministry of labour between 2015 17 found high levels of violations including non compliance rates of 84 for young workers 61 for temporary foreign workers 54 in the construction industry 75 for those in precarious jobs and 72 of repeat violators these changes follow on the heels of new regulations that allow employers to pay less for overtime work the fiscal guidelines of budgets are but one aspect of state economic policy attempting to manage the competitive imperatives of capitalism budgetary policy provides however the outline of the economic mechanisms taxes resource allocations across departments and agencies agendas for monetization and dispossessions of public assets and lands strategies for debt management that will be deployed to support capital accumulation and the policy regime that will skill employ and discipline workers the first ford budget vigorously affirms ontario s commitment to neoliberal economic policy and austerity the government will offer a sweeping set of material incentives and regulatory changes to encourage business investment while inefficiencies in social spending will lead to program cuts far past this fiscal year development at whatever the ecological and social costs is what is meant by the conservatives tired slogan of ontario being open for business for the conservative party of doug ford democracy is but one more inefficient entanglement getting in the way of business the permanent austerity that has been at the core of ontario budgetary policy for two decades now illustrates all too well the democratic limits of the ontario state but the budget also makes clear the alignment of the ford regime with the authoritarian right wing populisms gaining traction across the world this is the political terrain upon which the growing social movement of teachers healthcare workers parents first nations tenants ecologists will be forming its strategy and building its resistance in a so called era of disruption the most decisive act of rupture from the way things are will be to make possible another ontario freed from the constraints and pressures of market imperatives bryan evans is full professor in the department of politics and public administration toronto

sputtering growth and political fracturing is starting to coalesce into a true threat to systemic complacency there is a potentially seismic fundamental shift afoot for the euro and the pound but at least one will wait for resolution to move see how retail traders are positioningaudusd eurusd s p 500 along with the other fx majors indices goldandoilintraday using thedailyfx speculative positioning data on the sentiment page risk aversion threatens a tide change just before a liquidity drain there was no mistaking the smell of fear across the capital markets this past session we have been floating through treacherous fundamental waters for some time amid the escalation of trade wars a slowing in economic activity and a more obvious state of political instability around the world but it seemed investors decided to finally pause and take notice of their predicament this past session what we should be evaluating now is whether this was just a temporary pang of self awareness that leaves the real resolutions to the indeterminant future or if it is the unstoppable spark of a self sustained immolation of speculative excess while i think there are various measures that can speak to the intensity and to certain originations of any collapse in sentiment i will start with the s p 500 equities are the most common asset class in global portfolios and the us market is the largest in the world as such the s p 500 which channels the heaviest derivative trading through etfs futures etc is an appropriate single source reflection of risk it was therefore noteworthy this past session when a terminal wedge one essentially running out of room finally found its resolution with a stiff break lower while the technical jog was inevitable the intensity of the move was still a surprise the slump through intraday lows was a significant contrast to what we have seen these past few weeks of measured movement while this and other us indexes were end well off their respective

to turn 2019 s bullish ambitions chart of s p 500 with 20 day and 100 day moving average daily while we can pick a single measure to reflect speculative intent across the entire financial market for ease it is far more useful to evaluate sentiment across regions and asset classes to establish conviction the bigger picture perspective renders the same signals for caution global equity indices suffered the same drop on the day and many have nearby support levels to contend with emerging market assets junk bonds and carry trade were all under pressure even at a steeper discount to the

metric to assess our operating and financial performance before the impact of investing and financing transactions income taxes and certain non core and non recurring items in our financial statements the presentation of adjusted ebitda and core net income should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by other charges and gains we consider to be outside the ordinary course of our business the use of adjusted ebitda and core net income has certain limitations because it does not reflect all items of income and expenses that affect our operations items excluded from adjusted ebitda and core net income are significant components in understanding and assessing our operating and financial performance depreciation and amortization expense for various long term assets income tax and share based compensation have been and will be incurred and are not reflected in the presentation of adjusted ebitda each of these items should also be considered in the overall evaluation of our results additionally adjusted ebitda and core net income does not consider capital expenditures and other investing activities and should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity we compensate for these limitations by providing the relevant disclosure of our depreciation and amortization interest expense income gains losses from investments in equity securities income tax expenses share based compensation share of loss in equity investees government subsidies and other relevant items both in our reconciliations to the corresponding u s gaap financial measures and in our consolidated financial statements all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance the term adjusted ebitda and core net income is not defined under u s gaap and adjusted ebitda and core net income is not a measure of net income operating income operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with u s gaap when assessing our operating and financial performance you should not consider this data in isolation or as a substitute for our net income operating income or any other operating performance measure that is calculated in accordance with u s gaap in addition our adjusted ebitda and core net income may not be comparable to adjusted ebitda and core net income or similarly titled measures utilized by other companies since such other

file photo people buy goods in a state store in downtown havana cuba may 10 2019 reuters alexandre meneghini by sarah marsh havana reuters israel hidalgo and his wife left home around 7 30 a m to reach a supermarket across havana because they heard it might be selling chicken a staple of the cuban diet increasingly scarce on the shortage plagued island after cuba started limiting sales this month partly blaming tightened u s economic sanctions on the communist run island the couple wanted to buy as much as possible and lined up for three hours under the caribbean sun to get tickets guaranteeing them their rations inside they lined up again to collect two bags of chicken thighs each as fellow shoppers elbowed one another in pursuit of their own rations and headed for the checkout feeling like they had won the lottery we were born in this revolution and are used to rough times said hidalgo a 61 year old blacksmith we are bracing ourselves for it to get worse long lines outside

s sanctions due in part to cuba s support for venezuelan president nicolas maduro have compounded its economic woes is open to debate the economy had already stagnated in recent years in tandem with the implosion of strategic ally venezuela resulting in cuts in fuel and energy use by state entities and this year shortages of basic goods such as bread chicken and eggs but the increase in sanctions which have hit the key tourism sector and added to investor and bank jitters about dealing with cuba has some economists predicting the economy will slip from stagnation into a full blown recession later this year the economy has averaged 1 annual growth over the last three years compared with the 5 to 7 rate economists say is needed to recover fully from the depression caused by the fall of its former benefactor the soviet union in 1991 while the crisis will not be as bad as in the 1990s it will have a worrying social impact on the most vulnerable households which are already on subsistence salaries said pavel vidal a former cuban central bank economist who teaches at colombia s universidad javeriana cali bracing for harder economic times the government has resorted to what it knows best to manage the crisis and prevent social unrest more control interior commerce minister betsy diaz said two weeks ago the government would temporarily ration sales of a handful of basic products like eggs on a monthly basis using ration books distributed after the 1959 revolution and limit the sale of others like chicken to ensure everyone gets their fair share a critical moment some cuban economists say the developing crisis stems fundamentally from an inefficient centrally planned economy that imports more than two thirds of its food needs calling rationing little more than a short term solution they say the government must open up to a series of market oriented economic reforms before the crisis deepens this could be a critical moment that generates the consensus necessary to apply changes said vidal the government needs to give more space to the private sector and investment cuba has enacted some economic reforms in recent years including expanding the private sector from 2010 onward and introducing a new foreign investment law that cut taxes by around 50 in 2014 but local economists like omar everleny say the reforms undertaken have been too cautious so far the government has backtracked on overhauls of areas like agriculture and the dominant public sector remains deeply inefficient cuba was already behind on an estimated 1 5 billion in short term commercial debt and warning of austerity before u s president donald trump started the latest round of tightening of the decades old u s trade embargo aid from venezuela in the form of subsidized oil had long masked the true extent of cuba s economic problems but it started to fall from 2015 when a drop in oil prices roiled that opec nation s economy venezuela s crude shipments to cuba are now about half what they were four years ago and they could soon fall further last month the united states also began targeting vessels and companies that ship oil to the island from venezuela for sanctions threatening the energy grid and transportation u s sanctions against its old cold war foe are also hitting the two bright spots in the otherwise glum economy tourism and foreign investment both had boomed briefly after the announcement of a cuba u s detente in 2014 tourism revenues dropped by 4 6 in 2018 according to official data released last month the announcement in 2017 of tighter travel restrictions on u s citizens played a role at one point u s visits dropped more than 40 percent cuban tourism minister manuel marrero told reuters adding he still hoped tourism would grow this year meanwhile the trump administration has activated a long dormant law under which cuban americans can sue foreign companies that profit from their properties nationalized during the first years of the 1959 revolution western diplomats and businessmen have called the threat of potentially costly u s court battles another clear disincentive for banks and outside investors to do business with cuba the united states has also threatened to further tighten restrictions on travel and to impose a cap on cash remittances to cuba measures that could hit the economy hard siege mentality cuba s government has said it will continue moving down the path toward reform but it has failed to respond so far to calls from the island s entrepreneurs for basic changes such as the creation of wholesale markets for the private sector and the right to import and export instead of opening the economy further some western diplomats and analysts say there is risk cuba s leadership will adopt a siege mentality in the face of increased u s hostility that could mean turning to allies like russia vietnam and china for help to muddle through while keeping its stranglehold on economic life the u s sanctions could be counterproductive said one diplomat who asked not to be identified cuba has historically closed up at times like these cubans are not going hungry like they did during the so called special period after the collapse of the soviet union but they are increasingly connected to the rest of the world via the internet and foreign travel and many have grown weary of government attempts to blame the u s embargo for the bulk of their country s woes we are in total freefall said hidalgo s wife carmen lozano 55 clinging to her two bags of rationed chicken they should have allowed free production and sales from the beginning of the revolution inequality has risen in recent years in cuba and many believe the economic crisis could have a more disproportionate impact now than it might have in the past in a country where the government s claim to legitimacy rests to a large extent on ensuring a certain level of equality the authorities seem well aware that most people lack the cash to stock up on whatever basics they need on the black market the government s new rationing program is trying to address that simmering discontent by making the small quantities of goods that are in stock more

five more years president elect joko jokowi widodo is accompanied by running mate ma ruf amin as he delivers a victory speech to residents of johar baru in central jakarta on tuesday jp seto wardhana five more years president elect joko jokowi widodo is accompanied by running mate ma ruf amin as he delivers a victory speech to residents of johar baru in central jakarta on tuesday jp seto wardhana the election is over and the results are in the question now is how joko jokowi widodo s second term will play out will he be bolder in tackling vexing issues or more conservative t he election is over and the results are in the question now is how joko jokowi widodo s second term will play out will he be bolder in tackling vexing issues or more conservative the first time around jokowi s honeymoon was short this time it is straight to work early indications do not point to a clear path for example the president said he would push ahead with necessary reforms as he is not running again but the government is still intervening in the market the latest example is ordering airlines to cut ticket prices what is the global environment the government faces and what is the state of the domestic economy that constrains policy both appear to leave less room to maneuver compared to when jokowi took office in 2014 back then shifting fuel subsidies to infrastructure spending was obvious now such low hanging fruit is harder to find in the global arena strong united states growth is no longer clear hence it is more difficult to predict if the us federal reserve will no longer raise interest rates slower us growth will likely slow down global growth as well especially with china already in the slow lane these will have a severe impact on emerging economies especially a commodity exporter like indonesia and now we are entering the perilous trade war between the us and china the large size of sanctions the two countries have hurled at each other means the fallout will also be big for example the us recently raised tariffs on us 200 billion of imported chinese goods china immediately retaliated with tariffs on 60 billion of american products another 300 billion in us imports from china is now at risk higher tariffs not only hurt consumers but producers as well the fallout is lower growth for both countries which might end up pushing the us economy into recession slower global growth affects emerging economies through three channels trade finance and currency the first is when demand for our exports drops in volume and price the second is when equity and bond flows decline or even reverse meanwhile the currency weakens when sentiment sours on the domestic side there are three big issues fiscal and monetary policies as well as direct market intervention fiscal revenue growth appears to be slowing tax revenue by april only grew 0 5 percent compared to last year in the same period gross domestic product gdp grew around 5 percent this is bad news for the already low tax to gdp ratio of only 12 percent raising the tax rate now is not appropriate given the slowing economy hence enlarging the tax base appears to be the best option but it will not be easy or quick one proposal would be to broaden the value added tax base this can have an income distribution impact which needs to be addressed separately what about expenditure its two key features here are large mandated portions and low efficiency mandated expenditures include regional transfers education health and rising subsidies in regional transfers a new item the village fund has now grown to around rp 75 trillion us 5 2 billion yet its efficiency remains questionable another example is education spending despite the large amount spent students test scores remain abysmal other social spending also needs to be based on empirical studies and continued funding tied to measurable outcomes beyond this year s challenges are the longer running issues population aging is coming rising demand for pensions and health care will strain the government budget unless policy changes are made now one is the move from a defined benefit to defined contribution pension scheme pension funds also need better risk management but they also need more flexible investment policies universal health coverage also requires better management and funding on monetary policy it has been appropriate for the central bank to remain firm so far but at one point it has to throw the dice monetary policy changes can take up to 18 months to move the needle in the real economy still the bank needs to balance financial stability versus growth aspirations two other policies need attention fuel subsidy and state owned companies debt now is the time to start phasing in an automatic fuel price adjustment mechanism such that fuel prices adjust gradually to reflect market conditions in this way the subsidy can be avoided and the impact on inflation can be contained the debt level of state owned companies especially those in infrastructure needs careful monitoring one way to reduce leverage is to raise more funds from the equity market another is to speed up government payments for infrastructure so that their cash flows are not stretched in short what needs to be done appears clear sticking to any set agenda may sound like limiting one s choices but there is no better way to gain credibility which in itself can help in achieving your goals the writer is a lecturer in the school of economics and business university of indonesia

the united states has increased tariffs on 200 billion worth of chinese products to 25 percent and beijing has responded in kind on 60 billion worth of american goods more tit for tat appears to be on the way the trump administration is now openly deliberating whether to impose additional tariffs on a further 325 billion of chinese goods exported to the united states national security concerns are also being increasingly invoked not only is huawei the chinese telecommunications group already largely shut out of selling its products in the u s domestic market but trump is also now taking steps to ban the sale of u s made components to huawei as well what was once a mere trade skirmish therefore appears to be metastasizing into cold war 2 0 this creates a conundrum for the trump administration beijing is increasingly viewed by many countries as an economic rival or a security threat to be contained rather than a collaborative trade partner to be accommodated but the president s america first trade policy is undermining broader multilateral efforts to contain china because trump s incessant focus on reducing his country s bilateral trade deficit with beijing means diverting chinese purchases away from other trade counterparties that means for example china buying more u s cars made on american soil than say german ones more u s soybeans than brazilian or more u s semiconductors than japanese or south korean ones all designed to help reduce the bilateral deficit this sort of a trade deal however is clearly not in the interests of the eu brazil japan or southeast asia and is making them averse to collaborating with the united states with regard to any chinese security concerns they might share which they do especially when one considers that the basis for the west s successful containment strategy against the former soviet union was that it was both collaborative and multilateral in scope semiconductors are a perfect case in point to highlight the new contradiction if trump bans the export of u s made semis to huawei he has now offered a temporary 90 day waiver then the latter will naturally gravitate toward buying them from other countries in fact the sino u s trade dispute is just one of many growing points of friction between the u s and its traditional allies many are increasingly ignoring trump and competing for chinese markets or investment as the italians have recently done in response to beijing s belt and road initiative the sino u s dispute throws up other challenges for the administration tariffs are certainly effective as an attention getting mechanism but if the goal is ultimately to encourage more jobs at home they will be ineffective if unaccompanied by a national industrial policy that focuses on american re industrialization in order to create skilled high paying private sector jobs capable of profitably supporting workers with solid middle class incomes a corollary is that a national development policy must be geared toward jobs that reflect the needs of the 21st century economy rather than nostalgically working to sustain industries that may be headed toward obsolescence like steel or even fossil fuels many share the president s belief that a harder line on chinese trade is necessary this reflects a growing loss of faith even among those formerly well disposed to beijing that the country s market reforms will inevitably lead to multi party liberal democracy along with mounting skepticism that free trade and commercial co dependence can displace military rivalry a similar historic miscalculation was made before world war i but support for the president s current stance particularly from democrats is conditionally tied to the embrace of a more activist form of state industrial policy to ensure that american workers derive maximum benefit from the reverse engineering of existing chimerica supply chains and that argues professor michael lind means adequate and permanent production on u s soil not just innovation in america and production elsewhere this means some combination of managed trade along with national industrial policy managed trade which prioritizes concrete purchases of u s goods as opposed to increased market access or structural changes to china s economy is not really new ronald reagan pursued a similar policy against japan during the 1980s nor is the idea of a national economic development strategy particularly contrary to american historical traditions since the days of alexander hamilton industrialization and the concomitant role of the state have long been viewed as the joint basis of modern military power and prosperity by both major parties whether the president was a republican like lincoln or eisenhower or a democrat such as fdr or jfk it is only with the rise of multinational industry in the past few decades where the notion has taken hold that the state should limit its role in economic development borders have come second to measures of growth and corporate profitability when there has been greater growth potential with policies that go across borders the policies generally got the green light even at a cost of eroding america s homegrown manufacturing base as industry became even more profitable when it went offshore the focus for staying on top of the world s economic food chain shifted principally in the fields of advanced research in the fields of computing biology and of course military and space but americans themselves often did not experience the benefits of these shifts as more and more industry moved offshore international monetary fund imf and world bank loans ensured that the developing world would increasingly depend on western agriculture to feed itself western engineering expertise to supply energy infrastructure and western finance centers to manage and leverage their economies the muscle memory of state involvement in industry at this point is a matter of bailouts and buyouts what remains of the old state level involvement in national economic affairs has evolved into a washington consensus that engages in a more limited government role modest incentives and subsidies to avoid sudden and sharp economic convulsions a 25 year decline in manufacturing rather than all at once until the latest disruption on trade wall street and the markets had come to believe trump would get a trade deal with china that promised increased access to beijing s domestic market e g the credit card companies and the u s rating agencies but not much in the way of a changed status quo one of the reasons why the president may have pulled back from this kind of an agreement is that expanding u s corporate access to china s domestic markets actually deepens chimerica integration rather than disrupting it and bringing much industry back to the united states american blue collar workers a growing trump constituency will neither benefit from a status quo plus arrangement nor is that kind of a deal consistent with the growing belief among trump s advisers that beijing constitutes a growing national security threat which leads to one of the new dimensions of this trade war it is occurring against a backdrop in which long standing contradictions with regard to trade and national security concerns have finally collided these tensions are not new as michael lind has observed under presidents of both parties the pentagon drew up war plans against china while the commerce department blessed the offshoring by u s based multinationals of much of america s industrial base to chinese soil this combination of containment and engagement inspired a name that itself was a contradiction congagement trump is attempting to unravel congagement via the embrace of a more nationalistic industrial policy that means returning to the time tested and successful hamiltonian industrial strategy of using whatever means are necessary tariffs subsidies procurement tax breaks even overseas development loans to countries that purchase u s manufactured exports to ensure that strategic industries necessary to u s military power are introduced to america or remain here as lind writes so with regard to china this means exporting u s goods made on american soil it therefore disrupts existing supply chains it s not free trade by any stretch but the virtue of numerical targets is that they are actually easier to monitor and enforce than vague promises to respect intellectual property or eliminate state subsidies under a managed trade framework if china does not meet its quota of american goods then trump could slap on new tariffs for america s trade nationalists this sort of a deal also has the happy byproduct of undermining the multilateral trade framework established by the world trade organization because enforcement mechanisms are left in the hands of the two parties to the agreement with regard to national security considerations it means preserving domestic manufacturing capacity in dual use industries important in both defense and civilian commerce but in resolving one contraction trump might well be introducing a new one while managed trade might well dislocate many existing chimerica supply chains such disruption would likely come at the economic expense of america s traditional allies in europe japan taiwan and korea if beijing were to accept specified quotas it means some other country loses out not only will this likely prove unacceptable to china s non u s trade partners but it will also further exacerbate widening divisions between the united states and its traditional allies making coherent economic diplomacy against beijing less likely especially against a backdrop of rising national populist movements that have rendered problematic any idea of a united european response in a protracted rivalry with china and if it comes against a backdrop of china viewed as a national security threat beijing itself has even less incentive to accept such a deal even if it means risking some short term economic damage there are also economic pitfalls for the united states in embracing such a narrowly nationalistic approach high tech knowledge industries e g biotech health care ai robotics etc are crucial for future growth prospects at the same time growing concerns about climate change risk consigning one of america s major comparative advantages namely its dominance in the fossil fuel industries to obsolescence as the rest of the world works to decarbonize their economies the issue here is that only a few countries matter in these industries as opposed to say resource based exporters if the global economy continues to evolve into a series of regional balkanized competing military economic blocs in a post unipolar world it behooves the united states to be part of the biggest most advanced of those geo economic blocs that becomes harder to do if the eu japan korea etc increasingly view america as an unreliable partner pursuing a narrowly nationalistic policies that damage their own economic interests or the united states pursues more preemptive wars of choice without any degree of international support e g iran all of which stands in marked contrast to the post wwii period where the united states consciously made trade offs that often worked against narrowly nationalistic considerations but which sustained a coalition that ultimately won the cold war for example it largely tolerated asia s mercantilist trade practices in order to secure the region s cooperation as part of a u s dominated security umbrella even though the resultant asian export onslaught proved damaging to a number of american manufacturing interests trump has evinced little awareness of or inclination to pursue these trade offs in fact america first almost makes it impossible to consider them in any case the breakdown in these trade negotiations is yet another sign that we have likely passed the high water mark of globalization both in economic terms and also ideologically we are long past the point of making the naïve assumption that the end of the cold war means a universal embrace of western liberal capitalist democracy i e the end of history beijing may in reality have relatively limited options to retaliate against the trade sanctions imposed by the trump administration but it won t stand still and will seek out new partners to offset this containment as much as possible at the same time trump will find it hard to sustain a multilateral coalition to contain china if the united states continues to pursue narrowly nationalistic managed trade goals that damage its allies something will have to give

reflecting seasonal trends in the u s credit card and auto portfolios expenses increased 8 reflecting continued investments in employees supporting business growth and strategic initiatives please turn to slide 8 canadian retail net income was 1 8 billion up 1 year over year reflecting higher revenue partially offset by charges related to the greystone acquisition as well as higher expenses insurance claims and credit losses adjusted net income increased 2 revenue increased 8 reflecting volume growth margin expansion higher insurance and fee revenue and the acquisition of greystone average loans increased 6 year over year and average deposits increased 3 reflecting growth in both personal and business volumes margin was 2 99 up 5 basis points sequentially reflecting a refinement in revenue recognition assumptions in the auto finance portfolio and an increase in the prime ba spread total pcl decreased 10 quarter over quarter with reductions in both impaired and performing pcls total pcl as an annualized percentage of credit volume was 27 basis points down 2 basis points quarter over quarter expenses increased 11 reflecting higher spend supporting business growth including additional fte and volume related costs charges related to greystone and increased investment in strategic initiatives including marketing and capability builds in data and digital technology please turn to slide 9 u s retail segment net income was us 948 million up 23 year over year on a reported basis and 15 on an adjusted basis u s retail bank reported earnings rose 14 on strong revenue growth of 6 average loan volumes increased 5 year over year reflecting growth in the personal and business customer segments deposit volumes excluding the td ameritrade s suite deposits were up 4 including 5 growth in core consumer checking accounts net interest margin was 3 38 down 4 basis points sequentially primarily due to seasonal increases in deposits net interest margin was up 15 basis points year over year largely reflecting higher deposit margins total pcl including only the bank s contractual portion of credit losses in the strategic cards portfolio was 170 million down 26 sequentially reflecting lower provisions for the commercial portfolio and seasonal trends in the credit card and auto portfolios the u s retail net pcl ratio was 45 basis points down 14 basis points from the last

same quarter last year the contribution from td s investment in td ameritrade increased to us 195 million and segment roe increased to 13 2 please turn to slide 10 net income for wholesale rebounded sequentially to 221 million reflecting higher trading related revenue and advisory and underwriting fees as market conditions improved net income was down 46 million from the same quarter last year revenue was comparable with q2 of last year but reflecting higher advisory and underwriting fees offset by lower trading related revenue non interest expenses increased 16 reflecting continued investments in the global expansion of our u s dollar strategy and the impact of fx translation please turn to slide 11 the corporate segment reported a net loss of 161 million in the quarter compared

our common equity tier 1 ratio was 12 at the end of the second quarter consistent with the first quarter we had strong organic capital generation this quarter which added 40 basis points to our

in the quarter our leverage ratio was 4 2 and our liquidity coverage ratio was 135 we announced our intention to initiate a new ncib for up to 20 million common shares subject to regulatory approval i will now turn the call over to ajai ajai bambawale group head chief risk officer thank you riaz and good afternoon everyone please turn to slide 13 credit quality remains strong in the second quarter across all business segments as evidenced by reductions in gross impaired loan formations gross impaired loans and credit losses gross impaired loan formations were 1 34 billion or 20 basis points down 6 basis points quarter over quarter and up 2 basis points year over year the quarter over quarter decrease in gross impaired loan formations reflects higher prior quarter formations in the u s commercial portfolio primarily attributable to the power and utility sector and seasonal trends in the u s credit card and auto portfolios consistent with recent quarters there were no new formations in the wholesale segment please turn to slide 14 gross impaired loans ended the quarter at 3 3 billion or 48 basis points down 5 basis points quarter over quarter and stable year over year the u s retail segment was the primary contributor to the bank s 238 million quarter over quarter decrease in gross impaired loans reflecting a reclassification to performing for certain u s heloc clients current with their payments and seasonal trends in the u s credit card portfolio the wholesale segment maintained is zero impaired loan balance quarter over quarter please turn to slide 15 recall that our presentation reports pcl ratios both gross and net of the partner s share of the u s strategic card credit losses we remind you that credit losses recorded in the corporate segment are fully absorbed by our partners and do not impact the bank s net income the bank s pcls for the quarter was 636 million or 39 basis points down 11 basis points quarter over quarter and up 3 basis points year over year the 219 million quarter over quarter pcl decrease was driven by typical seasonal trends in the u s credit card and auto portfolios and the canadian consumer lending portfolios please turn to slide 16 both impaired and performing pcl decreased quarter over quarter reflecting u s seasonal trends as already mentioned generally lower performing pcl across canadian retail and higher prior quarter impaired pcl in the u s commercial portfolio primarily attributable to the power and utilities sector in summary credit quality was strong across the bank s portfolios and we remain well positioned for continued growth with that operator we are now ready to begin the q a session questions and answers operator thank you we will now take questions from the telephone lines operator instructions the first question is from sumit malhotra from scotia capital please go ahead sumit malhotra scotia capital analyst thanks good afternoon first question is for riaz on capital riaz one of your counterparts this morning talked to us about ifrs 16 and the impact that would have in to start 2020 just thinking about that for td and especially with your larger branch footprint are you able to give us an idea what you re expecting from a capital impact for that implementation riaz ahmed group head chief financial officer we re working our way through the standards sumit and as you can appreciate there are some interpretational items that we need to work our way through and some choices that need to be made so we re not prepared to quantify what the impact would be however as you well know when the right of use asset gets capitalized at the beginning of the next fiscal year it will be risk weighted and in fact i assume i m expecting the impact to be very manageable sumit malhotra scotia capital analyst all right so that s something as you said there s some choices to be made we can revisit that later in the year riaz ahmed group head chief financial officer yes sumit malhotra scotia capital analyst and then i ll wrap up with a question on the wholesale side so i think you communicated to us last quarter revenue would stabilize we ve seen that here i just want to focus on the expense side of the equation and specifically the build out that has been referenced a few times when we look at the headcount in this segment it s about it s up about 10 year over year and you ve had a pretty steady climb over that period of time just maybe two questions here if you can give us an idea of how this expansion is going to trend is there a number you have in mind as to the amount of full time complement that has to be added to get to the scale in wholesale outside of canada that you re looking for and then secondly i hope i m not putting you on the spot but i didn t see this in the annual report approximately how much of your revenue in this segment is being generated outside of canada if we use full year numbers for 2018 bharat masrani group president chief executive officer okay thanks yes we have as we ve mentioned on the way through invested in building out both the global markets businesses as well as the corporate investment banking business particularly to grow u s dollar revenue both in the u s region as well as in other parts of the world in which we operate we have had a fairly aggressive build in people on the front office side in the last two and a half years we have added approximately 200 front office people roughly half and half a split between global markets and corporate investment banking and then of course you need to also invest in infrastructure and people and support and control et cetera so it s been a relatively large investment for td securities we feel we re at a point now though where would that will slow down fairly meaningfully we re still looking to add a person here and there in some of the areas but now we re more focused on achieving the revenue that we re making the investment for and that there is a j curve in that some businesses are further along in the cycle we ve been working at them our ssa u s dollar business has been up and running now for a number of years and we re at a market share there where we re in the top five banks in the u s dollar ssa space in that business now we re starting to add euro and sterling but it s a fully invested business contrast that primary services or prime services i should say in the u s it s a couple of years old the first part of that was investing in systems and policies and metrics and people but that is now running and you know the focus there is adding the clients that we now need to make it a more profitable business and we have probably more of the latter type than we do the ssa business so bottom line sumit at we ve the growth in fte will be relatively small on the front office side riaz ahmed group head chief financial officer on the matter of sumit malhotra scotia capital analyst part two was on the revenue mix or geographic mix riaz ahmed group head chief financial officer yes i think sumit it s riaz on the matter of geographic mix of the revenue you know as you know we make very careful choices about how we define segments and i think you should look at td securities as an integrated global segment yes we do make disclosures in the annual report about where the sources of revenue are and that is more a legal entity reflection of the accumulation and aggregation of earnings but you know when you have global centers for example from a trading perspective that are in london singapore new york toronto you have funding sources that come from variety the trading book really shouldn t be thought of more as an integrated business unit so i don t think it makes sense to break it out the wholesale results in that way sumit malhotra scotia capital analyst yes i ll leave it here i mean obviously some of the canadian peers anyway who have expanded more into the u s in the wholesale business have provided that information and i think really what i m getting at here is as bob has detailed you ve certainly added full time complement in the u s and it would be interesting to see how the revenue progression for the expense that you ve made is trending and i think that would be helpful to gauge that so i hear you but hopefully that s not the one we re going to revisit going forward okay thank you bharat masrani group president chief executive officer thanks for your time operator thank you the next question is from meny grauman from cormark securities please go ahead meny grauman cormark securities analyst hi good afternoon if i look year to date adjusted eps growth about 4 so i m wondering how confident you are that you can still get to the bottom end of your 7 to 10 range for 2019 bharat masrani group president chief executive officer meny this is bharat last quarter when we talked about this we said there is a lot of headwinds and there is tailwinds that does not change in my remarks up front i talked about some of the risks that we see out there but overall the way we ve set up technical difficulty where our medium term target of hitting 7 to 10 earnings growth continues to be applicable from td and we ll try very hard as i said last quarter to try and get toward the bottom end of that range going forward meny grauman cormark securities analyst okay so it s still realistic and then just in terms of expenses what s the outlook in the past you ve talked about sort of a slowdown in the second half of the year in terms of expense growth and ramping up in operating leverage can you update us on how you re thinking about expenses in the second half of the year and operating leverage riaz ahmed group head chief financial officer yes absolutely meny it s riaz as we said coming out of 2016 that we were making room to make investments and then if you look at our expense growth coming into 17 and 18 you can see that steady ramp up of expenses and particularly in 2018 over the four quarters we had an increasing expense profile which is now beginning to plateau out and we re seeing a more level set of expenses from a quarter to quarter basis so what that means is that we have brought our expenses to a level where we feel that we re making the investments that we need to make and still driving out the right productivity but it just turned out that the result of that is in the first half you see a larger expense growth number which will moderate quite a lot in q3 and q4 but at a comparable expense absolute expense spending levels meny grauman cormark securities analyst thank you operator thank you the next question is from ebrahim poonawala from bank of america please go ahead ebrahim poonawala bank of america merrill analyst good afternoon i guess just wanted to clarify something to your previous statement on expenses from what i recall like we saw pretty meaningful ramp up in the back half of last year so what s the point there that we should see pretty healthy operating leverage in the back half of the year when we look at third and fourth quarter riaz ahmed group head chief financial officer yes i think that s exactly right ebrahim that as our expense spending growth rate and investment growth rate will normalize or moderate in the second half it could create better operating leverage and as you know we always strive to create operating leverage year after year after year and so i do expect that you ll see much better metrics on that front ebrahim poonawala bank of america merrill analyst got it and i just wanted to focus on the u s retail margin one in terms of riaz if you can just talk about what you re seeing in terms of deposit pricing pressure with the fed on hold and your outlook for the margin and secondly if you can talk about any actions you re taking to protect the margin if the fed ends up cutting interest rates at some point over the next 12 months given sensitivity to your margin as well as sensitivity at ameritrade to declining interest rates greg braca president and chief executive officer td bank america s most convenient bank ebrahim thank you for the questions it s greg braca i would just first start on the margin question if we think about the quarter over quarter you saw we were down 4 basis points but i would like to point out that year over year we re still up a healthy 15 basis points and generally you know the way we would look at this sequential quarter over quarter a little bit of a dip is riaz upfront mentioned some seasonal deposits or we could talk about it in terms of mix of loan and deposit volumes in quarter over quarter and that contributed to the decline but the way i would think about it and i ve talked about this for a couple of quarters now is the quality of the deposit growth and what we re seeing in the u s is a very competitive and dynamic environment with both large and small organizations really looking to put on deposits and show some ability to grow some are going about it with core franchise growth and some are paying up for it we clearly are not in that latter half camp and our betas remain very well in check and we ve done a very good job growing core dda and core checking account growth and we ve talked about that in the past as well core consumer checking account grows up year over year of up 5 is really is healthy household acquisition and goes to our whole model around primacy and convenience and all the things that we talk extensively about to your second question when you think about protecting that margin of interest rates would it go the other way or whatever the case may be i do think it goes back to the way i answered this first question is that our goal here regardless of the environment is to drive core household growth not pay off for hot deposits drive core checking account growth and we re seeing that across all of our lines of business including small business and consumer so that s how i would answer that ebrahim poonawala bank of america merrill analyst so just a quick follow up on that so the margin went down seasonally impacted because of the deposit mix shift is the outlook that it should hold relative to 2q levels or do you expect incrementally more compression as the year progresses greg braca president and chief executive officer td bank america s most convenient bank yes so the way we look at any quarter over quarter or the next few quarters these things are going to tend to bump around a bit and very difficult because in addition to just volume there s a whole host of things that we always talk about that goes into it long term rates investments loan yields so there s a whole suite of things that would go into that margin story but what i would generally say is with a stable outlook from the fed and borrowing anything further dramatic on the long end you generally tend to see a general statement over several quarters fairly stable margins ebrahim poonawala bank of america merrill analyst got it thank you operator thank you the next question is from robert sedran from cibc capital markets please go ahead robert sedran cibc capital markets analyst thanks good afternoon riaz i just wanted a quick clarification actually on the comment you made about the canadian margin which was the impact of i guess the change in revenue recognition around the auto finance book can you a little more color on whether that is a one time item on the revenue line that will fall away or if that was a recurring thing that will keep the margin at the level it got to riaz ahmed group head chief financial officer yes no rob what that s about is that we re seeing faster prepayments in the auto book which would therefore result in faster revenue recognition so it wasn t a methodology it s actually the underlying assumptions and so i think that as we continue to see those prepayments we ll see more around faster revenue recognition along in that portfolio robert sedran cibc capital markets analyst so as long as consumer behavior remains what consumer behavior has been the margin is going to evolve from here as opposed to giving back 2 basis points or 3 basis points that was up this quarter riaz ahmed group head chief financial officer yes i don t think that it should have a big impact on margins going forward it may just come off every as things level off a little bit in our new assumptions so similar to what greg said about the u s i think canadian margins probably bumped around a bit from here but that would be an adjustment to assumptions that doesn t occur all the time robert sedran cibc capital markets analyst and so the rest of the margin trajectory from here is consistent with the prior guidance bit of a leak upwards i guess riaz ahmed group head chief financial officer i think that is slight biased upwards but i would say as greg indicated it s true in canada as well that lots changes in terms of product competition and consumer behavior so i think it s better to say that it will bump up and down a little bit here and there robert sedran cibc capital markets analyst okay thank you operator thank you the next question is from steve theriault from eight capital please go ahead steve theriault eight capital analyst thanks very much if we could go back to capital markets for a moment and focusing on expenses so the last couple of quarters the expense line has been about 600 million plus or minus a few million wondering how like if that should we think of that as a new run rate and i look at year on year the revenue line was identical expenses were about 80 million higher how much of that 80 million or so year on year increase is from the higher u s expenses as you build that out bharat masrani group president chief executive officer yes i think there is some i think we re of the view that the 600 a quarter is something that we should probably be modeling in ourselves and the reason that s hesitating is that there s also regulatory build and technology build and brexit build and you know some of that may be recurring and some may not be recurring so i think we certainly have been spending money on if you want to call eu 27 regulatory we ve been spending a lot of money on that type of activity so that may slow down i think what the real key though is that we need to grow revenue to make the return on the investment and if that is not occurring at the pace we need then we need to reduce expenses as well so we are focused on both steve theriault eight capital analyst you have a base case on when you like to see that return on equity get back to sort of the high teen level in terms of sort of trying to gauge your level of patients with all that bharat masrani group president chief executive officer this quarter would be good no i mean we still have an objective of making an roe more in the 15 range i think we ve referred to in the last number of years i think the high teens are a little bit of an error in the past given what s going on in the business so that s the focus and we d like to try to achieve that as quickly as we can steve theriault eight capital analyst okay maybe one more for you then after the volatility from last quarter i m curious if there was any actions taken this quarter sort of interaction last quarter that may have mitigated any revenue upside for q2 and what s proving to be a pretty strong capital markets quarter across the whole group here bharat masrani group president chief executive officer i don t think there was anything that we were doing last quarter that was changed and we re doing this quarter that caused anything in the results but what we will continue to do though is the u s markets were strong especially in the latter two months of this quarter and our investments there really are what s going to cause a change in the mix and perhaps more stability in our revenues overall so it s that investment that was that certainly helped the quarter and markets helped that whereas in the previous quarter the lack of market activity in both canada and u s combined with the expense run rate as you spoke of certainly was a negative factor steve theriault eight capital analyst thanks for that operator thank you the next question is from doug young from desjardins capital please go ahead doug young desjardins capital analyst hi good afternoon just two quick ones riaz just in u s retail i think there was a recovery of a legal provision i just want to see if you can quantify that and just that so i have this correct that was netted out of net non interest expense is that correct greg braca president and chief executive officer td bank america s most convenient bank it s greg doug so the way we would talk about that is we re not going to put a number on that and the way we think about expenses in general is if that item had not occurred our expenses would have been up year over year and expenses in general would have been reflecting our continued investment in the business but we wouldn t put an absolute number on that release doug young desjardins capital analyst will that mean i don t know if you can just give us a ballpark there but like the would mix have been up like low single digits is that or greg braca president and chief executive officer td bank america s most convenient bank well as we ve said all along we still would have had positive operating leverage and if i would think about this for the first half of the year we had expenses up 6 and for the first half you re going to have these numbers from time to time in any given quarter so for the first half of the year our expense rate even with this item is running roughly 3 and certainly we ve had positive operating leverage for the first half of the year doug young desjardins capital analyst okay riaz ahmed group head chief financial officer if you doug just look at the trend of non interest expenses over the last six quarters i think you can assume that s a good trend doug young desjardins capital analyst okay that s fair and then just lastly cet1 capital generation i guess i m trying to get a sense of i think historically if we went back 15 basis points to 20 basis points per quarter is typically what people have talked about i think maybe we ve talked about in relation to td we re going into a different environment there s been regulatory rule changes is that still a reasonable level to expect for td or is there something that s changed that would cause that to be lower going forward thank you greg braca president and chief executive officer td bank america s most convenient bank i think doug if you look at slide 12 you can see that the net income less dividends contributed 40 basis points and then off the rwa increases of 27 basis points just a little bit less than half of that was devoted to the migration of the card portfolio from standardized to airb so i think you can see in that that the capital accretion continues to still be very strong even in a very fluid environment doug young desjardins capital analyst and that i guess that move of that credit card portfolio to airb i mean that in and of itself is done so that s one time is there anything else that s on the horizon that would be similar in such that if you move to airb would have a negative impact riaz ahmed group head chief financial officer well really in our business mix cards are one portfolio which when they migrate to airb the risk rates on them are higher than standardized typically it s the other way around and of course you re well aware that our u s non retail portfolio still is in the process of migration to airb but that should be a benefit doug young desjardins capital analyst okay great thank you operator thank you the next question is from gabriel dechaine from national bank financial please go ahead gabriel dechaine national bank financial analyst good afternoon i want to talk first about the commercial book in canada and it looks like you guys didn t have any credit noise there no real losses out of the ordinary like we ve seen from a few other banks this quarter and last mind you i guess i m kind of outside of your in quarter performance we have seen some issues then the bank of canada is raising their own concerns about corporate indebtedness and then we ve also got this massive growth in commercial and wholesale loans in canada i m just wondering what do you think about that growth and what are you seeing differently than what the bank of canada is may be concerned about why are you not concerned about credit quality and commercial lending in canada in general sorry that s bit of a ordinary ph question but ajai bambawale group head chief risk officer it s ajai i ll start with pcl and then teri will talk about growth we re definitely seeing very low pcl and loss rates across the commercial book and you know i would describe the quality as good but that doesn t mean there s no migration there is some migration occurring and i would put it in the category of gradual normalization so it s not like it s not occurring at all i can t speak to the piers and what their book is like but certainly in our book like i feel it s strong it s performing well but there is some normalization occurring and if you actually go to some of the ecl tables and you look at stage two ecls you ll see a bit of an uptick and especially you look at business and government so you ll see some migration there gabriel dechaine national bank financial analyst what s driving that ajai bambawale group head chief risk officer i think we re late in the cycle so it s not abnormal to see some migration so late in the cycle i can t pinpoint a single thing that s pointing that and it s not a single sector but i would say it s broad but it s still low dollars teri currie group head canadian personal banking and then it s teri from a commercial growth perspective i would say we re very comfortable with the business that we re putting on the books we re continuing to put bankers on the streets in markets where they re building great relationships business succession continues to be an opportunity for us and i feel comfortable that i think riaz has quoted earlier this morning we re prudent lenders through the cycle and so we re very comfortable with the business growth that we re seeing and open for business going forward gabriel dechaine national bank financial analyst teri well i have you at the mic but i d ask you something with a bit more positive spin we ve seen the housing market go from source of intense concern last year and in the wake of b20 and start that was dipping lower and lower and in the last few weeks and months we started to see some good starts data some positive sales data coming out of the gta and montreal as well and the industry seems to be i guess bottoming out in terms of mortgage growth resl i would say i m just wondering if you re generally as optimistic as you were about this business a little while ago or maybe if there s some additional optimism today in your growth outlook for resl growth and the ancillary businesses teri currie group head canadian personal banking so i continue to feel very comfortable with we ve been talking for quite a while now about a mid single digit medium term outlook for proprietary total real estate secured lending growth and i feel very comfortable with that for this year and going forward we ve been investing as you know in this business more mobile mortgage specialists more training for our branch advisors a leading capability that is fully digital to apply for a mortgage online we ve got a position as we ve talked about in the past where we are forced in hybrid heloc loan market share and we re continuing to be able to advance there with customers primarily who are already customers of td and so and retention is very strong as well so continue to feel good about that guidance going forward gabriel dechaine national bank financial analyst outside of what you re doing is there anything in the macro that makes you more teri currie group head canadian personal banking certainly we re seeing as you mentioned certainly we re seeing particularly in the gta the kind of start of that spring lending season and some good trends it really is a tale of the two sort of halves of the country if you will a little bit tougher in the west although i would say 100 million in vancouver and condos is still a hotly contested market for purchasers and then you know gta in particular a little bit stronger so you know it s early days in the spring season but we re seeing some green shoots gabriel dechaine national bank financial analyst okay thank you teri teri currie group head canadian personal banking welcome ajai bambawale group head chief risk officer thanks gabriel operator thank you the next question is from nigel d souza from veritas investment research please go ahead nigel d souza veritas investment research analyst good afternoon thank you for taking my question so i had one on the loan volume side and i wanted to focus on your auto book so if i look at the canadian retail segment auto loans are relatively flat and in the u s they re down slightly quarter over quarter you mentioned prepayment rates higher prepayment rates this quarter and so wondering if what we re seeing in q2 here is that just a one off non recurring kind of trend or what is your outlook given that you know autos tend we are a late cycle and autos tend to be kind of a leading lead the cycle where do you see auto finance volumes playing out for the rest of the year riaz ahmed group head chief financial officer i think on the matter of the prepayment nigel it s riaz i ll just say that you know the way we look at these from an accounting perspective is we sort of look at the trend over a period of time so i don t think you should interpret this as a one quarter trend when we look at our revenue recognition policies and this applies across a wide number of products whether it be mortgages auto what or even corporate like you always look at kind of prepayment trends over a longer period of time to see if you ve got an appropriate assumption that is going into it so i don t think you should look at it as one quarter as far as longer term trends go i ll let maybe greg comment on the u s auto piece greg braca president and chief executive officer td bank america s most convenient bank sure so you are right and it would have been similar to last quarter nigel if we looked at q1 over q1 we were really coming down to relatively flat year over year numbers for the last couple of quarters we have a view too that we are later in the cycle we also want an appropriate return we also want to manage relationships and volume and versus just a couple of years ago you would have seen us growing 8 9 10 year over year in auto we think we have the right mix of the business that we ve been positioning this as you know in the u s and i wouldn t be surprised if over the next few quarters you sort of bump around at this level maybe up a couple of points but this is generally where we see ourselves for the foreseeable future nigel d souza veritas investment research analyst that s really good color and i just have one last question on if i could turn to just credit losses and pcl in general there s a step down in provisions for your canadian retail segment and although seasonality has benefited that quarter over quarter there was a larger step down in prior years so it s still fairly elevated up as you noted nearly 30 year over year so wonder if you could provide more color there is there anything at play here in terms of do you expect that to trend more over the coming quarters and have another step down or what are you seeing just on either the performing or impaired side on the canadian retail ajai bambawale group head chief risk officer so i ll talk about the year over year it s ajai so we re kind of moving up very low numbers like if you look to q2 18 our number was 23 bps and the lowest we ve had is 22 bps so we re really moving off those very low numbers into what i would consider a little more normalized numbers and i think 27 bps still remains in a very acceptable range of 25 bps to 30 bps but what i am seeing is and i mentioned this earlier a gradual normalization of credit losses across the various books in canada so my expectation is that normalization will continue to occur at a gradual pace unless the economy turns i should clarify unless the economy turns nigel d souza veritas investment research analyst hey got it that s very helpful appreciate the answers ajai bambawale group head chief risk officer thank you operator thank you the next question is from darko mihelic from rbc capital markets please go ahead darko mihelic rbc capital markets analyst hi thank you i have two questions one for bob dorrance and then an obscure question that anybody can answer i hope so first for bob you mentioned that you didn t really change anything in the quarter and that s cool but i guess the question i have is one of the things that has been changing for you is the way you account for your trading deposits and we ve seen a bit more shift in the fair value through profit or loss and of course this quarter we see trading rebounds to 411 million from 251 million last quarter so the question is sort of twofold first were there any marks from that that suppressed or helped the trading revenue but more importantly from my perspective is as we continue down this path of shifting the accounting regimen will there be any sort of headwinds or tailwinds to trading revenue for the next couple of quarters bob dorrance group head wholesale banking there was nothing meaningful quarter to quarter darko in that particular part of the business i think as you look at i think q3 last year was where we had called out for the first time that there was a meaningful reduction in revenue that occurred as a function of marketing the trading deposits in the way that we were marketing them we have probably migrated roughly 50 of the book to fair value through oci so i don t think we ll it ll be a positive year over year but it won t be on a full amount darko mihelic rbc capital markets analyst okay so in other words just modest headwind or tailwind as opposed to trading revenue bob dorrance group head wholesale banking i would say that yes darko mihelic rbc capital markets analyst thank you and then my obscure question so i appreciate the commentary that quarter over quarter and it looks as though when i look at the presentation and the way you sort of designed it around credit quality is that quarter over quarter we saw a bit of an improvement and there was less stage 1 and stage 2 less non performing i suppose but when i open up the supplementary capital it s a different story in q1 asset quality helped your rwa and this quarter asset quality went the other way and you actually had to increase risk weighted assets because of asset quality movements and the reason why i asked this is typically what we re concerned about in some pieces is that as provisions rise and as things get worse not only will your provisions for credit losses rise but so will your rwas and yet in two quarters we have the opposite sort of phenomenon happening at td so i m wondering if you can maybe connect the dots for me if at all riaz ahmed group head chief financial officer are you darko looking at the flow statements for risk weighted assets darko mihelic rbc capital markets analyst yes riaz ahmed group head chief financial officer yes so i think you know as ajai indicated earlier that you can see a little bit of migration in the books and so that you end up having you can end up having an instance where both the pcls and risk weighted assets are experiencing the similar migration in that way because with the way basel 3 and ifrs 9 works you can get a little bit of doubling up of your procyclicality but as we indicated earlier you know that number you can see in the flow statements is not that significant and so gradual normalization is how we like to describe it darko mihelic rbc capital markets analyst so when i look at it though i mean for year to date i mean you have a 3 5 increase in your risk weighted assets and most of that will be just from portfolio from adding to the loan book but a portion of it is also because of credit quality and i m not singling out td there s much bigger one of your peers but again it s just quarter to quarter i suppose i guess what i m getting from you is the answer is they can go opposite ways but over a period of time when i m just trying to confirm that the general view would be that provisions for credit losses and rwa inflation for lack of a better word should be should go hand in hand it could but there are sometimes differences in how the two are looked at for example the calculation of expected shortfall in capital is different from how it s done for ifrs 9 purposes so that can be methodology differences and if you look at that asset quality line over the last five quarters you can see it was up in q2 of 2018 but it was down in q3 down again in q4 down again in q1 so i your the thesis that there is a general trend indicator here would not be evident in the numbers bharat masrani group president chief executive officer let me just build on that i mean there s definitely some credit migration occurring and that credit migration is going to be reflected in the rwa numbers but if you really look at acl and if you look at acl year over year and go and look at it by stage ok total acl is up 333 million and these are all in the disclosures year over year a big part of that is fx but excluding that the increase in stage three is actually very little it s 50 million and then most of the increase is actually stage 1 which i would describe as largely volume but there s some mix in seasoning there but there is a number for stage two as well and some of that is commercial migration which will naturally show up in the rwa numbers and there s mix and seasoning also occurring across some of the portfolios darko mihelic rbc capital markets analyst okay thanks very much bharat masrani group president chief executive officer good obscure answer to your obscure question as well operator thank you the last question is from scott chan from canaccord genuity please go ahead scott chan canaccord genuity analyst hi good afternoon i wanted to lots of questions on the canadian housing but i want to switch to u s housing and perhaps get your take on kind of what s unfolding there and then when i kind of look at your book share residential mortgage is very solid and your heloc book is trending downwards and maybe some thoughts regarding those portfolios for the balance of the year riaz ahmed group head chief financial officer sure scott so first i would say i m glad you pointed out the mortgage book has been up for several quarters now year over year and we were up 8 this quarter as you might know you know if i just contrast this to just a few quarters ago or back before last year and the cycle of rate hikes really intensified it would have been more of a balanced mix between refinance and purchase and we re seeing this certainly a swing to a purchase market with far less on the refi as rates have been moving up for the last year and a half so the volume that we re seeing is decidedly being driven by jumbo mortgages and certainly not only into the consumer book but also into the private bank and the wealth business in the u s you correctly pointed out that the home equity business is down and we re down 6 year over year but i would also contrast that to many of our peers and they re seeing double digits for quite some time now and that s just evident of when rates started going up there s been a large refinance out of home equity into more permanent or fixed rate mortgages and even we re seeing a little bit of an uptick with that with rates beginning to stabilize over the last three or four months and actually come in on the long end folks have had another bite at that apple on the refi side for home equity balances so relative to peers while we re down in home equities and it s certainly less than half of the sizable book than we are in the mortgage side you know it is you know we are still seeing outperformance relative to peers even though we re down year over year scott chan canaccord genuity analyst that s very helpful thank you operator thank you and the next question is from sohrab movahedi from bmo capital markets please go ahead sohrab movahedi bmo capital markets analyst hey thank you for that just two quickies teri do you does your business do any lending to the private mortgage market teri currie group head canadian personal banking my business does not sohrab movahedi bmo capital markets analyst and so ajai is there a policy around any lending to mortgage investment corporations or otherwise at the bank ajai bambawale group head chief risk officer i m pretty confident there are policies and we limit any of that kind of lending sohrab movahedi bmo capital markets analyst can you quantify it ajai bambawale group head chief risk officer no i don t have that information available sohrab movahedi bmo capital markets analyst okay and then just to just to go back to darko s question if you have negative migration and you are reflecting that negative migration through higher provisions whether it s stage 1 2 or 3 will that then relieve some of the pressure that we would have otherwise expected to see from rwa appreciation riaz ahmed group head chief financial officer well as i said sohrab it might to some extent but the two systems don t really work hand in hand the risk weighting system is different from the ifrs 9 accounting system so as i said earlier you can get overlaps and that just increases the procyclicality of the regime but given the quality of the credit book in our underwriting we wouldn t anticipate that it would give us big swings sohrab movahedi bmo capital markets analyst but so just to play that back to riaz maybe take another kick at it if capital ultimately is intended to defend against unexpected losses and you therefore have expected deterioration in the credit quality and reflected through higher rwas then presumably or through higher provisions then presumably don t need to also account for it through higher capital retention is that fair riaz ahmed group head chief financial officer i think in principle that is the correct framework sohrab and if you go back and look at all the comments that were made to the various authorities around the accounting provisions and the introduction of the various basel rules those provisions were pointed out and i think those papers give you a pretty good understanding of what that how those two interact sohrab movahedi bmo capital markets analyst thank you very much riaz ahmed group head chief financial officer thank you sohrab operator thank you there are no further questions registered at this time i would now like to turn the meeting back over to mr masrani bharat masrani group president chief executive officer thank you operator and nothing obscure about our results i might add td delivered a great quarter and i want to take this

the trade war between china and the united states deepened this week as the us government continued to shift its focus from tariffs to sanctions against individual companies huawei the chinese telecommunications company had already been targeted when it was adding to an entity list that effectively cuts it off from us suppliers but this week it was reported that the us government was considering blacklisting five other chinese companies surveillance camera makers hangzhou hikvision digital technology and zhejiang dahua technology are among those that could face sanctions according to reports from the new york times and bloomberg the white house has so far made no official comment on these reports the us department of commerce said this week that huawei was being given a 90 day reprieve before being blacklisted making it a potential bargaining chip in trade war negotiations us president donald trump said on may 23 that he could see huawei being included in a future trade deal with china although he repeated the line that there were security concerns regarding the company ren zhengfei huawei s founder said this week that the company has contingency plans that could cover the loss of us supply contracts the us has underestimated us huawei s ren said in an interview with the chinese media on tuesday huawei s 5g will absolutely not be affected in terms of 5g technology our competitors are more than two or three years away from catching up with us he added that the 90 day license does not mean much we are prepared well but we are very grateful for us businesses they have contributed a lot to us many of our consultants are from ibm and other us enterprises the onshore renminbi cny has been a major victim of the trade war since the beginning of may the currency has dropped from 6 73 against us dollar to 6 91 on friday traders speculated whether the pboc will allow the currency to break the magical seven on sunday evening pan gongsheng deputy governor of pboc told reporters that the central bank has enough policy tools to stablise the yuan on wednesday evening liu guoqiang another deputy governor of pboc told reporters again that the central bank has sufficient experience in dealing with fx rate volatility there has been sporadic volatility but the market is stable he said there is no accident and will not allow an accident to happen on thursday however the onshore renminbi dropped to 6 92 against the us dollar the lowest point in almost six months apart from verbal intervention the pboc also flirted with the idea of issuing more renminbi bills in hong kong soon state owned news agency xinhua reported on tuesday the report was subsequently republished on the government s official website the central bank issued rmb20bn of renminbi bills in hong kong on may 15 the size and exact timing of the upcoming bills issuance is not known last time around the act was widely interpreted by onshore bankers as a way to drain offshore renminbi cnh liquidty to prevent traders from shorting the currency one potential impact of the trade war is on us inflation rising tariffs by leading to more general rise in prices could encourage the federal reserve to resume its interest rate hikes sooner than it otherwise would but analysts think there is little reason for alarm inflation could pick up slightly in the next 12 months but then we believe the fed will recognise this as a one off event and focus will still be on growth said ian hui global market strategist at jp morgan asset management tolerance for higher levels of inflation is likely to win over restarting the rate hiking cycle and potentially dragging down the us economy nomura economists said on wednesday that they have a new baseline assumption that the roughly 300bn of chinese imports to the us not currently covered by tariffs will be hit with a 25 tariff by the end of the year the us government has so far imposed 25 tariffs on the remaining 250bn of chinese imports around 46 of the total in 2018 according to data from the us census bureau nomura said the next round of tariff increases is likely to come in the third quarter after a meeting between us president trump and chinese leader xi jinping the industrial and commercial bank of china and china construction bank both received green light to set up their own wealth mangement subsidiaries on wednesday according a statement by the china banking and insurance regulatory commission in the same statement the regulator said that there have been other comercial banks who have applied and been approved to do the same bank of china published its monthly credits investment and financing environment difference index cifed on tuesday for the first time this year the index returned to the positive range indicating that offshore renminbi bond yields are lower than onshore ones the general cifed index stood at 7 1 by april a 30 6 increase from march in terms of individual sectors the commercial bank sub index was the highest reaching 48 after a 20 7 point increase from the previous month the sub index for privately owned companies stood at 60 2 indicating that it is still cheaper for private enterprises to raise money offshore than onshore in april sales of passenger cars reached 1 47 million a 22 decrease year on year according to data by the china passenger car association on monday

barquisimeto venezuela ap andreina cordero started the year skipping meals so her three kids could eat her husband a construction worker was out of a job and the family s savings had been devastated by the nation s hyperinflation limiting cordero s children to a diet of rice beans pasta and fried corn patties but the family got a break from their daily struggle to feed themselves this spring when a social worker enrolled them in a program run by a silicon valley startup that is donating cryptocurrency to hundreds of venezuelan families every week from february to april cordero received a deposit of eos tokens through a cellphone app she then traded the digital money for local currency through online transfers and used the funds to shop in market stalls we finally got to eat chicken cordero said and there were also vegetables for the kids the three month trial in crypto transfers is now over and the family is back to skipping meals and eating mostly beans and rice but cordero is thankful for the time that digital currency saved her kids from malnutrition i m very grateful for what they did for us cordero said it would be a blessing if something like that were set up again in this april 11 2019 photo bertha dun shows medicine bought with cryptocurrency through online transfers in barquisimeto venezuela thursday april 11 2019 venezuela s political and economic crisis has now made it a prime testing ground using cryptocurrency to finance social projects or send relief directly to people living in poverty ap photo manuel rueda over the past decade cryptocurrencies like eos and bitcoin have become popular among investors looking to make large profits from a new and anonymous form of storing wealth but a handful of charities are also now using digital currencies to send relief directly to those in need circumventing banks and companies that handle remittances they ve found the ideal testing ground in venezuela where the annual inflation rate by some estimates has soared to a staggering 67 000 forcing millions to scavenge daily to feed themselves crypto has the highest likelihood of being helpful to people in places where money is broken said joe waltman executive director of givecrypto the charity that provided direct transfers to cordero and more than 100 venezuelan families in barquisimeto with the aid of eos venezuela a local blockchain developer and there s probably no better example of broken money right now than venezuela givecrypto s program provided temporary help to vulnerable families by providing them with a weekly deposit worth around 7 or about the same as venezuela s monthly minimum wage the organization is also aiming to make people familiar with crypto apps so they can transfer their own earnings into digital currency and use it to buy goods long after they have stopped receiving free deposits we want to show that people who are not techies or investors can also benefit from this technology said efrain pineda the project s manager and head of operations at eos venezuela anyone can use crypto to protect themselves from inflation and make their daily life easier while many middle class venezuelans already try to protect their savings from hyperinflation by purchasing u s dollars and even gold nuggets saving in crypto offers a solution to store wealth that may be physically safer than holding on to cash or precious metals in a crime infested country online platforms that allow venezuelans to buy and hold u s dollars provide a similar service storing cryptocurrency presents greater financial risks than holding u s dollars though due to the wild swings in the value of some crypto assets including bitcoin but in venezuela where the local bolivar currency has lost two thirds of its value this year some merchants are willing to give this technology a shot in barquisimeto leticia luque an informal merchant said she began to accept crypto payments two months ago at the request of a social worker collaborating with givecrypto s direct transfer scheme she said the technology has helped her gain time to barter for better prices with suppliers and plan what she will buy next we used to be in a rush to purchase goods before our bolivars lost their value said luque whose husband travels every week to colombia to stock up on packaged foods and basic goods that the couple re sells out of their home now we can take our time and we know that our earnings are in a safe place waltman said the barquisimeto experiment was the first stage of a larger effort to promote the use of cryptocurrency in venezuela using stable currencies whose values have less fluctuation than bitcoin a similar initiative known as an airdrop is being developed by airtm a currency exchange platform based in mexico city that plans to donate small amounts of cryptocurrency to 100 000 people in venezuela this summer so far it has raised 300 000 from donations toward its 1 million goal the one time payment of no more than 10 a person will provide only momentary relief but the goal is also to encourage venezuelans to engage with the airtm platform we want to show venezuelans how to hold money outside their local currency said joshua kliot the organization s co founder the biggest impact this could have is to crypto ize the country and it s not just in venezuela where nonprofits are attempting to help vulnerable people by introducing them to digital currency platforms in europe bitnation a humanitarian agency has enabled hundreds of refugees without bank accounts to receive direct donations through bitcoin accounts in jordan the world food program delivers aid to 100 000 syrian refugees by creating digital currency accounts for each recipient using blockchain technology but official currencies to pay for goods refugees only need to have their iris scanned in participating stores paul lamb a nonprofit management consultant based in california says the idea of distributing funding directly to people in need is becoming increasingly popular among humanitarian groups because in some contexts it is cheaper than organizing the logistics required to physically hand out food or medicine usually these money transfers are made through debit cards in the local currency but humanitarian groups are also starting to look at cryptocurrency it s harder for someone to steal cryptocurrency said hugh aprile the colombia country director for mercy corps a nonprofit that has handed out debit cards to 7 000 venezuelan refugees and in situations where you have high inflation it can ensure the stability of the funds being transferred but aid programs that distribute cryptocurrency also face several challenges in venezuela power cuts like the one that recently left much of the country in the dark for days knock out the internet connection needed to use cryptocurrency and connections for many are iffy even when there is power a tightly controlled currency system that punishes financial crimes with jail time has also discouraged some merchants from accepting cryptocurrency merchants who accept crypto and are public about it risk being inspected by the government said randy brito the founder of bitcoin venezuela a cryptocurrency education group poverty is another barrier ariany jaimes a social worker who recruited participants for givecrypto s project in barquisimeto said she had to keep some of the neediest people out of the program because they didn t own smartphones with modern operating systems we realize that this technology is not going to become widespread overnight jaimes said but i do hope that these programs continue because they make our life a little easier ___ manuel rueda on twitter in this april 11 2019 photo customers choose groceries that will be paid using

prepared by jeff halley senior market analyst a bonfire of vanities it s taken quite a while but finally markets appear to be starting to price in the effect of an extended us china trade war on global growth the two strongest bastions of denial the equity and oil markets led the way as oil plunged in its biggest one day fall of the year this collapse was the final straw for wall street which had already noted less than impressive sessions from asia and europe where investors rushed en masse for the exit doors the us 10 year treasury was clearly the destination for much of the exit flows with its yield falling to 2 31 leaving the curve unambiguously inverted out to ten years even the mighty us dollar suffered as investors tarred everything american made with one brush the japanese yen jpy and swiss franc chf outperformed on safe haven flows rising 0 6 to 109 60 and 1 0030 respectively even the beleaguered euro eur australian dollar aud and new zealand dollar nzd managed to record small gains against the greenback japan singapore and malaysia data points today will likely be smothered in the rush for safety as the theme continues from overnight fx the greenback faded against most of the majors as the us yield curve moved lower overnight the effect may be transitory however as the usd remains the big dog on the block purely from an interest rate carry perspective that carry may have closed up somewhat but once the dust settles it will still be there and will remain supportive of the dollar throughout 2019 regional markets can expect no such luck though asian currencies will almost certainly come under pressure against the dollar as the rush for the exit on wall street overflows into regional markets both aud and nzd staged small rallies overnight but with such a high correlation to china it s hard to see their overnight strength being sustained if asian currencies are falling against the dollar en masse the exception here will probably be the japanese yen which has its own safe haven status and usually rallies in times of trouble equities wall street s leading indices all fell by more than 1 overnight and that theme looks likely to be the case in asia today as well the nikkei 225 is already down 0 90 and the asx 200 has fallen 0 75 as the rest of asia opens it s hard to envisage anything other than a sea of red as investors exit equities and move to the sidelines ahead of the weekend emerging asia markets could be particularly vulnerable as global wobbles typically see them sold as a group the lower liquidity in regional markets could well exacerbate the moves oil overnight oil plunged in its biggest one day loss of the year as stubbornly high us inventories and global growth worries burst the well head brent crude gushed 4 10 lower to usd68 20 a barrel while wti dropped 5 1 to usd58 15 a barrel the price action completely vindicates opec s stance that optimism not fundamentals powered recent price rises and that prices were fragile that will be cold comfort in the halls of power across the middle east though brent crude broke important daily support at usd69 50 overnight and the charts reveal no technical support until the usd66 00 regions wti broke support at usd60 00 and usd58 00 a barrel and its technical picture looks even more cloudy with no support levels until usd55 00 a barrel after such an aggressive drop overnight it would be nice to say asia may see a small correction however oil remains acutely vulnerable to any trade headlines and with asian currencies and stocks most likely to be dragged lower any rallies may be short lived gold gold finally caught a break as bonfires in other global markets saw safe haven flows push it usd10 higher to usd1 283 00 an ounce one day does not a trend make though and it s too early to say the precious metal is about to emerge from the land that time forgot a continuing meltdown in other global markets as the street finally reprices the real cost to the world of an extended us china trade war could see gold benefit the longer term technical picture shows a series of lower highs through 2019 as each rally faded long before the previous one the last rally stopped at usd1 303 00 an ounce and we would need to see a weekly close above that level before long term optimists get excited gold should be well supported on any dips today in asia

over the past three weeks the macro narrative has taken a decisive turn for the worst the huawei bombshell looks to have made negotiations between the us and china all but impossible in the near term and beijing is circling the wagons it wasn t clear that china s economy was out of the woods and the renewed trade tensions muddy the waters considerably meanwhile things are going off the rails in italy again ahead of the eu elections it took three business days from time the us effectively blacklisted huawei for the trump administration to offer a concession in the form of a temporary general license that permits some transactions with the company and its dozens of non us affiliates until august 19 huawei is permitted to buy american goods necessary to ensure existing networks remain operational and to update software on existing huawei devices the decision came on monday evening following what i described over on my site as a mini panic across the global technology supply chain last week in a post for this platform i suggested the huawei gamble was something of a crossing the rubicon moment for markets in that post i flagged the sox soxx which through friday was headed for its second worst month since may of 2012 by the closing bell on monday semi stocks were on track for their worst month since the crisis you didn t have to be any kind of seer to know that some manner of intervention from the us commerce department was in the cards monday wasn t an especially bad day for global equities on the whole but the rout in semis was disconcerting for what it telegraphed about how the market was interpreting the huawei decision literally minutes before the temporary general license announcement was posted to commerce s website i said the following in a short little post called when the chips are down presumably the commerce department will be forced to adopt some kind of middle ground that ameliorates market concerns and helps cushion the blow otherwise this is going to quickly erode confidence given that the weakness in the chip space is indicative of an actual real world bid to dismantle the global technology supply chain it s difficult to imagine how this doesn t spill over and prompt an across the board rout at some point in the very near future unless the trump administration comes forward with something definitive regarding how they plan to mitigate the fallout from last week s decision if you looked out across the headlines on tuesday evening most financial media outlets attributed wall street s good day to the temporary partial reprieve granted to huawei the sox rallied more than 2 and the spdr s p semiconductor etf xsd bested the s p etf spy after three consecutive days of grievous underperformance the yellow dashed lines in the following visual mark the day the huawei ban was announced to be clear a 90 day partial reprieve from wilbur ross isn t going to cut it when it comes to restoring confidence and convincing market participants that the us fully appreciates the gravity of this situation you might think the rout in the chip space is over done but the reality is that nobody knows where this is headed we would expect that many if not most semiconductor companies will need to lower estimates raymond james wrote tuesday in a note cited by bloomberg for a piece aptly entitled us chipmakers preparing for china trade fight fear that all will suffer beyond the ramifications for semis investors should step back and try to appreciate the big picture i ve attempted to communicate why the huawei story is so momentous in at least a half dozen posts over the past four days in addition to the two linked above this is china s crown jewel on the line huawei is beijing s national champion although the rhetoric from chinese state media was already pretty shrill following the trump administration s move to more than double the tariff rate on 200 billion in chinese goods the tone became overtly hostile following the huawei decision in remarks cited by a widely read piece in the south china morning post xi on tuesday appeared to suggest that china is preparing for an indefinite war of attrition also on tuesday bloomberg said the trump administration has for months held off on punishing huawei for fear of undermining the trade talks that might sound like an innocuous headline but it s not since the arrest of meng wanzhou in december us negotiators have been at pains to insist that trade talks are separate from national security concerns implicit in that insistence was a promise that huawei and meng wouldn t be used as leverage the bloomberg story which cited unnamed sources suggests the us always intended to play the huawei ace in the event the terms of a prospective trade deal weren t deemed favorable enough for washington importantly some of china s recent stimulus efforts have been inward looking seemingly designed to bolster domestic demand rather than rescue the global cycle that could be due to worries that the monetary policy transmission channel is clogged by lackluster demand for credit or it could just be that beijing is taking a china first approach this time around when it comes to stimulus whatever it s attributable to it s reasonable to assume that in an all out trade war scenario that tendency to focus inward will be redoubled consider this from barclays china s stimulus has failed to boost exports from trading partners like korea and taiwan implying that china s stimulus is domestically oriented and that the improvement in fixed asset investment is driven by real estate infrastructure at the expense of manufacturing thereby increasing the efficacy of the policy measures domestically and limiting the amount of pass through of this stimulus to the rest of the world we therefore see risks of a prolonged and soggier soft patch in the global economic recovery compared to 2016 when you throw in the fact that april activity and credit growth data missed estimates you re left with somewhat vexing concerns about the outlook in an environment where the us is turning the screws as tight as they ll go with that in mind remember that for the better part of a decade china has been the engine of global growth and credit creation that s a point that s been emphasized and reemphasized by analysts since 2015 when the yuan devaluation rattled markets and china concerns were top of mind following the global financial crisis washington had too many problems to focus on china plus the chinese were the driving force behind global gdp and debt creation after 2008 in a world hungry for growth bank of america writes in a note dated monday adding that the european sovereign debt crises of 2011 and 2012 made chinese economic activity an even more important pillar of the world economy bofa the recovery from the crisis has been tepid and although 2017 was characterized by synchronous global growth gangbusters isn t a term you ll hear anyone use to describe the pace of economic expansion in developed economies there will probably never be an ideal time to confront beijing on trade and it s true that fiscal stimulus in the us has given the trump administration a growth cushion so to speak when it comes to pushing the envelope but there is a certain sense in which undercutting china s economy amounts to cutting one s nose of to spite the face at the same time the renewal of trade concerns is weighing heavily on emerging market equities which have now erased most of their gains for the year notably recent underperformance has pushed the ratio of the ishares msci emerging markets etf eem to the s p etf below 2018 s nadir top pane meanwhile things are going off the rails in italy again perhaps you ve heard matteo salvini has ratcheted up his signature budget bombast ahead of the eu elections and there s rampant speculation he may attempt to capitalize on league s popularity by forcing a government shakeup the bickering between league and five star is becoming wholly untenable and it s doubtful that salvini wants to wait too long to make a move lest the italian economy should decelerate anew and or italian assets succumb to another bout of turmoil on par with what we saw last may amid the tension italian stocks are on track for their first losing month of the year bottom pane in the visual above here s a bit of color from goldman that gives you some perspective on italy in the context of the recent risk off mood this is from a note out tuesday in order to assess how the deteriorating macro picture has influenced performance we benchmarked cross asset performance to the recent changes of our first three gs risk appetite indicator factors global growth monetary policy and the dollar we found that cross asset performances since beginning of month have been in line with their implied return except the banks sector which has underperformed materially note that the ftse mib i e italian stocks on the whole have actually performed inline with their implied beta which means that things could get a lot worse for italian equities in the event decent earnings are no longer sufficient to offset concerns about the banking sector where exposure to the sovereign is actually running near historical highs to be clear monetary policymakers are on high alert and will do what they can the rba minutes and a speech from philip lowe on tuesday telegraphed a rate cut and the market still expects fed easing meaningful ecb and boj normalization is out of the question for the foreseeable future whether central bank accommodation will be enough this time around is debatable in case it didn t come through in all of the above my current view is that there s not a lot to like about the setup right now take that for what it s worth
a bonfire of vanities it s taken quite a while but finally markets appear to be starting to price in the effect of an extended us china trade war on global growth the two strongest bastions of denial the equity and oil markets led the way as oil plunged in its biggest one day fall of the year this collapse was the final straw for wall street which had already noted less than impressive sessions from asia and europe where investors rushed en masse for the exit doors the us 10 year treasury was clearly the destination for much of the exit flows with its yield falling to 2 31 leaving the curve unambiguously inverted out to ten years even the mighty us dollar suffered as investors tarred everything american made with one brush the japanese yen jpy and swiss franc chf outperformed on safe haven flows rising 0 6 to 109 60 and 1 0030 respectively even the beleaguered euro eur australian dollar aud and new zealand dollar nzd managed to record small gains against the greenback japan singapore and malaysia data points today will likely be smothered in the rush for safety as the theme continues from overnight fx the greenback faded against most of the majors as the us yield curve moved lower overnight the effect may be transitory however as the usd remains the big dog on the block purely from an interest rate carry perspective that carry may have closed up somewhat but once the dust settles it will still be there and will remain supportive of the dollar throughout 2019 regional markets can expect no such luck though asian currencies will almost certainly come under pressure against the dollar as the rush for the exit on wall street overflows into regional markets both aud and nzd staged small rallies overnight but with such a high correlation to china it s hard to see their overnight strength being sustained if asian currencies are falling against the dollar en masse the exception here will probably be the japanese yen which has its own safe haven status and usually rallies in times of trouble equities wall street s leading indices all fell by more than 1 overnight and that theme looks likely to be the case in asia today as well the nikkei 225 is already down 0 90 and the asx 200 has fallen 0 75 as the rest of asia opens it s hard to envisage anything other than a sea of red as investors exit equities and move to the sidelines ahead of the weekend emerging asia markets could be particularly vulnerable as global wobbles typically see them sold as a group the lower liquidity in regional markets could well exacerbate the moves oil overnight oil plunged in its biggest one day loss of the year as stubbornly high us inventories and global growth worries burst the well head brent crude gushed 4 10 lower to usd68 20 a barrel while wti dropped 5 1 to usd58 15 a barrel the price action completely vindicates opec s stance that optimism not fundamentals powered recent price rises and that prices were fragile that will be cold comfort in the halls of power across the middle east though brent crude broke important daily support at usd69 50 overnight and the charts reveal no technical support until the usd66 00 regions wti broke support at usd60 00 and usd58 00 a barrel and its technical picture looks even more cloudy with no support levels until usd55 00 a barrel after such an aggressive drop overnight it would be nice to say asia may see a small correction however oil remains acutely vulnerable to any trade headlines and with asian currencies and stocks most likely to be dragged lower any rallies may be short lived gold gold finally caught a break as bonfires in other global markets saw safe haven flows push it usd10 higher to usd1 283 00 an ounce one day does not a trend make though and it s too early to say the precious metal is about to emerge from the land that time forgot a continuing meltdown in other global markets as the street finally reprices the real cost to the world of an extended us china trade war could see gold benefit the longer term technical picture shows a series of lower highs through 2019 as each rally faded long before the previous one the last rally stopped at usd1 303 00 an ounce and we would need to see a weekly close above that level before long term optimists get excited gold should be well supported on any dips today in asia though with safe haven flows likely to be in full flight after last night s ructions and ahead of the weekend

reconstruction of a social contract based on entrepreneurial partnership and investment in the transition to ecological sustainability this political vision will restore to citizens of the member states a sense of belonging to a wider community to this end argues michel aglietta one of today s most important heterodox economists we must strengthen european institutions at the financial and fiscal levels this means making the euro a full currency endowed with democratic legitimacy old racisms may be structured deep in european thought but they have been revitalised and spun in new ways the war on terror the cultural revolution from the right and the migration linked demonisation of the destitute scrounger drawing on more than three decades of work for the institute of race relations liz fekete exposes the fundamental fault lines of racism an tarianism in contemporary europe fully updated and revised this new edition of john r gillingham s swingeing study explains why the european union is so profoundly unsuited to the modern political economy in a devastating historical account of political failure he takes readers back to the union s postwar origins when it was considered the best means to guarantee peace demonstrating how the flaws of the institution date to its origins today these inherent failings leave it unable to deal with the most pressing issues of our time the refugee crisis britain s exit the foundering eurozone and the increasing disquiet among its member states in a globalised marketplace where technological innovation transcends state boundaries the eu is no longer fit for purpose it is time to let the union dissolve dreams of leaving and remaining is urgent reporting from one of britain s finest journalists james meek asks what we can recover from the debris of an old nation as we head towards new horizons and what we must leave behind there are no easy answers and what he creates instead is a masterly portrait of an anxious troubled nation the founding story of the eu is that it exists to ensure the horrors of the twentieth century are never repeated now as it comes to terms with the worst refugee crisis since the second world war its declared values of freedom tolerance and respect for human rights are being put to the test lights in the distance is a uniquely powerful and illuminating exploration of the nature and human dimensions of the crisis richard seymour tells the story of how corbyn s rise was made possible by the long decline of labour and by a deep crisis in british democracy he shows how corbyn began the task of rebuilding labour as a grassroots party with a coalition of trade unionists young and precarious workers students and old labour pugilists who then became the biggest campaigning army in british politics utilizing social media activists turned the media s project fear on its head and broke the ideological monopoly of the tabloids after the election with all the artillery still ranged against corbyn and with all the weaknesses of the left s revival seymour asks what corbyn can do with his newfound success neoliberalism is fracturing but what will emerge in its wake across the globe politics as usual is being rejected and faith in neoliberalism is fracturing beyond repair leading political theorist nancy fraser in conversation with jacobinpublisher bhaskar sunkara dissects neoliberalism s current crisis and argues that we might wrest new futures from its ruins what is the populist moment and what does it mean for the left we are currently witnessing in western europe a populist moment that signals the crisis of neoliberal hegemony the central axis of the political conflict will be between right and left wing populism by establishing a frontier between the people and the oligarchy a left populist strategy could bring together the manifold struggles against subordination oppression and discrimination eric hazan author of the acclaimed invention of paris takes the reader on a walk from ivry to saint denis roughly following the meridian that divides paris into east and west and passing such familiar landmarks as the luxembourg gardens the pompidou centre the gare du nord and montmartre as well as forgotten alleyways and arcades weaving historical anecdotes geographical observations and literary references hazan s walk guides us through an unknown paris with the aid of maps he delineates the most fascinating and forgotten parts of the city s past and present what does fascism mean at the beginning of the twenty first century when we say the word our memory goes back to the years right between the two world wars and envisions a dark landscape of violence dictatorships and genocide these images spontaneously surface in the face of the rise of the radical right racism xenophobia islamophobia and terrorism the last of which is often depicted as a form of islamic fascism beyond some superficial analogies however all these contemporary tendencies reveal many differences from historical fascism probably greater than their affinities paradoxically the fear of terrorism nourishes the populist and racist rights with marine le pen in france or donald trump in the us claiming to be the most effective ramparts against jihadist fascism but since fascism was a product of imperialism can we define as fascist a terrorist movement whose main target is western domination upward social mobility represented a core promise of life under the old west german welfare state in which millions of skilled workers upgraded their volkswagens to audis bought their first homes and sent their children to university not so in today s federal republic where the gears of the so called elevator society have long since ground to a halt in the absence of the social mobility of yesterday widespread social exhaustion and anxiety have emerged across mainstream society oliver nachtwey analyses the reasons for this social rupture in postwar german society and investigates the conflict potential emerging as a result he concludes that although the country has managed to muddle through thus far simmering tensions beneath the surface nevertheless threaten to undermine the german system s stability in the years to come recipient of the friedrich ebert foundation 2016 hans matthöfer preis for economic writing it is impossible to think of russia today without thinking of vladimir putin more than any other major national leader he personifies his country in the eyes of the world and dominates western media coverage in russia itself he is likewise the centre of attention both for his supporters and his detractors but as tony wood argues this focus on russia s president gets in the way of any real understanding of the country the west needs to shake off its obsession with putin and look beyond the kremlin walls jacques lacan made this gloomy prophesy back in 1959 but doesn t it also apply to our own time faced with a rise in attacks around the world can we really just blame the radicalisation of islam what hope is there for the alienated youth as the wars that have ravaged the middle east spill out across the globe for alain bertho the mounting chaos we see today is above all driven by the weakening of states legitimacy under the pressure of globalisation add to this the hypocrisy of the elites who beat the drum of security measures even as they sow the seeds of violence around the world this disorder is the swamp of despair which can only produce fresh atrocities today s youth are the lost children of neoliberal globalisation the inheritors of the political and human chaos it produces when they find it easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism their revolt tends to take the paths of martyrdom and despair the closing of the revolutionary hypothesis allows only fury the answer bertho argues is a new radicalism able to inspire a collective hope in the future in this highly original and influential work ernesto laclau focuses on the construction of popular identities and how the people emerge as a collective actor skilfully combining theoretical analysis with a myriad of empirical references from numerous historical and geographical contexts he offers a critical reading of the existing literature on populism demonstrating its dependency on the theorists of mass psychology such as taine and freud on populist reason is essential reading for all those interested in the question of political identities in the present day economics for the many edited and with an introduction by shadow chancellor of the exchequer john mcdonnell features contributions from the participants in his new economics conferences including barry gardiner ann pettifor prem sikka and guy standing it

the essays in this volume lay out a vision for a new economics one that works for the many not the few in 2012 five muslim men babar ahmad talha ahsan khalid al fawwaz adel abdul bary and abu hamza were extradited from britain to the us to face terrorism related charges fahad hashmi was deported a few years before abid naseer and haroon aswat would follow shortly they were subject to pre trial

their stories as starting points to explore what they illuminate about the disciplinary features of state power and its securitising conditions teresa thornhill volunteered at hara hotel a makeshift camp on the greece macedonia border an arabic speaker she met syrians from all walks of life as she distributed clothing and organized activities for children one of the syrians was juwan who would later walk through the mountains of macedonia to safety in austria in hara hotel thornhill interweaves a narrative of daily life at the camp with juwan s extraordinary story the recent history of the revolution in syria and an account of the ensuing civil war painting a vivid picture of the predicament of syrians trapped on europe s borders in this fully updated edition of the extreme centre ali considers recent events that suggest despite everything that there is room for hope he finds promise in latin america and at the edges of europe emerging parties in scotland greece and spain formed out of the 2008 crisis are offering new promise for democracy even in the uk with the rise of jeremy corbyn there are indications that the hegemony of the centre may be weaker than imagined over the last six years greece has provided the world with an open air political lesson the country s deep economic and social crisis has exposed the fundamental contradictions of the european union and indeed the capitalist world as a whole it has been a test case for movements seeking to put an end to the authoritarian anarchy of neoliberal capitalism the greek resistance to eu institutions and financial market hegemony offered a beacon of hope yet the movementist politics of 2011 could not build anything lasting and syriza s efforts as a party of government soon led to impasse for alain badiou it is not enough to mourn this defeat we must understand why such a vigorous opposition could fail in the long established democracies of western europe electoral turnouts are in decline membership is shrinking in the major parties and those who remain loyal partisans are sapped of enthusiasm peter mair s new book weighs the impact of these changes which together show that after a century of democratic aspiration electorates are deserting the political arena mair examines the alarming parallel development that has seen europe s political elites remodel themselves as a homogeneous professional class withdrawing into state institutions that offer relative stability in a world of fickle voters meanwhile non democratic agencies and practices proliferate and gain credibility not least among them the european union itself an organization contributing to the depoliticization of the member states and one whose notorious democratic deficit reflects the deliberate intentions of its founders in this new edition of a highly acclaimed book wolfgang streeck revisits his recent arguments in the light of brexit and the continued crisis of the eu these developments are only the latest events in the long neoliberal transformation of postwar capitalism that began in the 1970s a process that turned states away from tax toward debt as a source of revenue and from that point into the consolidation state of today central to this analysis is the changing relationship between capitalism and democracy in europe and elsewhere and the advancing immunization of the former against the latter building on the economic analysis of two of europe s leading thinkers heiner flassbeck and costas lapavitsas a candidate standing for election on syriza s list against the troika is the first book to propose a strategic left wing plan for how peripheral countries could exit the euro with a change in government in greece and looming political transformations in countries such as spain this major intervention lays out a radical anti capitalist programme at a critical juncture for europe the final three chapters offer a detailed postmortem of the greek catastrophe explain what can be learned from it and provide a possible alternative since 2011 pablo iglesias has led podemos a new radical left party in spain that is reframing the nature of modern politics under his guidance the party has unmasked the ideological motives behind european austerity revealing the true nature of this power grab conducted on behalf of elites intent on dismantling the welfare state here iglesias delineates his political vision he skewers not only the spanish establishment but also the anti democratic bloc comprising the troika corporate interests and the wall street party politics in a time of crisis which includes an in depth interview with iglesias is an incisive examination of the current situation in europe as well as a stirring call for international resistance shortly after the hostilities of the iraq war were declared to have come to an end the renowned philosopher jurgen habermas with the endorsement of jacques derrida published a manifesto invoking the notion of a core europe distinct from both the british and the new european candidates for eu membership and defined above all by its secular enlightenment and social democratic traditions a key component of the manifesto was its insistence on the need for a counterweight to the perceived influence of the us a theme that also resonates in recent discussions about the establishment of a european military force outside the command structures of nato this volume provides readers in the anglophone world the opportunity to gain access to the debate as the fallout from the iraq war continues to rumble and eu expansion continues apace this is compelling reading for anyone interested in the future of europe and the transatlantic alliance crisis in the eurozone charts a cautious path between political economy and radical economics to envisage a restructuring reliant on the forces of organized labour and civil society the clear headed rationalism at the heart of this book conveys a controversial message unwelcome in many quarters but soon to be echoed across the continent impoverished states have to quit the euro and cut their losses or worse hardship will ensue the question of europe offers an antidote by collecting some of the liveliest and sharpest commentary on europe across the full political spectrum from leading authorities in the study of history economics philosophy culture and sociology eminent german italian french swedish and irish writers are included as well as key figures from britain and the us looking paranormically at the past present and future of integration the question of europe brings polemic and scholarship together to offer us a new way of approaching the union in violent borders jones crosses the migrant trails of the world documenting the billions of dollars spent on border security projects and the dire consequences for countless millions while the poor are restricted by the lottery of birth to slum dwellings in the ailing decolonized world the wealthy travel without constraint exploiting pools of cheap labor and lax environmental regulations with the growth of borders and resource enclosures the deaths of migrants in search of a better life are intimately connected to climate change environmental degradation and the growth of global wealth inequality newly updated with a discussion of brexit and the trump administration in this innovative work guglielmo carchedi argues that only an analysis centered on class as the basic unit of social life with production and distribution of value understood as the bedrock of the economy can throw light on the internal contradictions of european economic integration rather than adding another theory of nationalism to this maelstrom of ideas miroslav hroch has created a remarkable synthesis integrating apparently competing frameworks into a coherent system that tracks the historical genesis of european nations through the sundry paths of the nation forming processes of the nineteenth century combining a comparative perspective on nation formation with invaluable theoretical insights european nations is essential for anyone who wants to understand the historical roots of europe s current political crisis the new old world looks at the history of the european union the core continental countries within it and the issue of its further expansion into asia it opens with a consideration of the origins and outcomes of european integration since the second world war and how today s eu has been theorized across a range of contemporary disciplines it then moves to more detailed accounts of political and cultural developments in the three principal states of the original common market france germany and italy a third section explores the interrelated histories of cyprus and turkey that pose a leading geopolitical challenge to the community the book ends by tracing ideas of european unity from the enlightenment to the present and their bearing on the future of the union the new old world offers a critical portrait of a continent now increasingly hailed as a moral and political example to the world at large in the french port town of calais famous for its historic lace industry a city within a city arose this new town known as the jungle was home to thousands of refugees mainly from the middle east and africa all hoping somehow to get to the uk into this squalid shantytown of shipping containers and tents full of rats and trash and devoid of toilets and safety the artist kate evans brought a sketchbook and an open mind combining the techniques of eyewitness reportage with the medium of comic book storytelling evans has produced this unforgettable book filled with poignant images by turns shocking infuriating wry and heartbreaking let s take

the negotiations were strained and at times it looked like it would be stillborn but the usmca the new north american free trade agreement linking the economies of the united states mexico and canada was signed in november 2018 and awaits ratification its future is still uncertain although u s president donald trump finally removed tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from canada and mexico something both countries and even some congressional republicans were demanding for the deal to be ratified democrats in the u s are unhappy with its costly monopoly protection for new pharmaceuticals and weak enforcement measures for labour and environmental protection but beneath the political jockeying is a sleeper issue concerning public health that signals a bad agreement health impact assessment we undertook a recently released health impact assessment of the usmca focusing on three specific aspects of the agreement with direct or indirect health effects pharmaceuticals health and environmental regulations and labour and environmental protection for prescription drugs the costs of which have risen dramatically since the era of patent protection in trade agreements the usmca contains provisions the americans wanted in the trans pacific partnership agreement these provisions were suspended by the remaining countries when trump pulled the u s out of that agreement now they re back in but with an even longer 10 year guaranteed monopoly for biologics a new category of costly drugs used to treat cancers and autoimmune disorders generic equivalents known as biosimilars can cut the price by almost half canada currently offers eight years of market protection for biologics the additional two years could eventually add almost 170 million to each year s drug costs hardest hit would be mexico which presently offers no such monopoly rights for biologics the usmca also locks in rules that make it easier for drug companies to evergreen their products through minor changes in their components or in how they re administered extending the years of patent protection and prevent regulators from using for several years the patent drug company s test data when approving generic versions impact on health regulations a more subtle but critical set of changes in the usmca imposes new constraints on the three countries abilities to enact health safety and environmental policies or regulations it is these so called behind the border rules in trade and investment agreements that have garnered the greatest public health concerns the usmca tries to assuage these concerns by affirming countries inherent right to regulate including to protect public health safety the environment and natural resources but it immediately undercuts this right by specifying that it must be exercised in a manner consistent with this agreement that consistent manner includes provisions that could make it harder for mexico to use existing safeguards under world trade organization rules to ensure domestic food security or to guarantee minimum food prices to reduce rural poverty and support small scale mexican farmers it requires the three governments to ensure that any new international standards upon which new regulations might be based do not create unnecessary obstacles to international trade suggesting trade issues will trump new health regulations this became an issue even during negotiations when the u s wanted the agreement to ban any front of package nutrition labelling that would warn consumers of unhealthy levels of fat salt or sugar canada and mexico rejected this but the usmca contains several provisions on labelling that could lead to trade disputes should the two other countries choose to adopt new nutrition labels as canada is proposing to do american and canadian trade associations representing meat processors have already argued that canada s proposal violates the usmca portending a possible trade challenge if the usmca becomes law foxes guarding the hen house other rules open the doors for persons of another party in other words primarily u s based corporations to have a seat at the table when canada or mexico decide to consult on new regulations in a similar way usmca provisions require governments to submit detailed scientific evidence and explanation for any new government regulation which is likely to lead to regulatory chill slowing down or preventing the introduction of novel health protection measures this risk is compounded by an entire and enforceable chapter that aims to have the three governments harmonize their regulations to enable freer movement of goods across borders this runs the risk of regulatory capture by private vested interests akin to inviting the foxes to guard the hen house unaware that your cosmetics are not always healthy or safe the usmca would like to keep it that way requiring governments to wait until a problem shows up and fix it later the economic elephant in the usmca is of course the u s whose regulatory rules will likely set the tone for canada and mexico and the trump administration is keen to undo as many health and environmental regulations as possible there are some less troubling glimmers in the new agreement controversial rules allowing foreign investors to sue governments over regulations that may undermine the value of their investment have been eliminated between the u s and canada apart from a three year window for legacy claims to be made canada fared particularly badly under the old nafta while the u s never lost a case yet it was the united states that scrapped the rules while canada wanted to keep them so go figure the americans hedged their bets however by retaining the rules to protect u s investors in mexico mandatory mexican minimum wage the usmca also contains provisions that claim to protect labour rights and the environment often used by governments to sell trade deals to skeptical citizens a key labour provision however requires mexico to amend its laws to allow workers to more effectively collectively bargain the country recently passed legislation to satisfy this provision but questions remain over implementation and enforcement strategies a second provision mandates a substantially increased minimum hourly wage in mexico s auto manufacturing sector which could help relieve poverty for mexicans although mexican exporters might opt instead to pay the low tariff the u s would levy if they fail to raise wages and while there s lots of references to labour rights and multilateral environmental agreements in the usmca it s unsurprisingly silent on climate change and the paris climate accord and there are escape clauses provisions only become enforceable if a country lowers its existing level of protection to gain a trade or investment advantage this might prevent a race to the regulatory bottom but it s hardly a reassuring reach for the top in the end we have an agreement that binds governments future regulatory options in return for scant evidence of improved labour or environmental protection or even economic gain the imf for example estimates a net economic boost across the three countries of us 550 million a year chump change at best the u s international trade office ito with some fanfare begged to differ announcing american gains of us 62 billion and 176 000 new jobs the rub here is that these numbers rest on a unique modelling assumption reduced policy uncertainty that raised the eyebrows of most conventional trade economists remove this novel assumption and the american study actually shows a net loss in both income and jobs make america great again perhaps not so much as with any trade agreement some economic sectors will be winners and others losers but as far as protecting public health is concerned the usmca is a big step backwards by ronald labonte professor and canada research chair university of ottawa courtney mcnamara senior researcher department

trade tensions between the u s and china are starting to pull foreign exchange markets into the arena yet far from embracing their currencies as a weapon many countries are being forced to take a defensive posture against the almighty dollar central banks seem more intent on keeping their currencies steady and stopping money from escaping rather than engaging in devaluations to boost their competitiveness in trade policy makers in china south korea and indonesia were among those taking steps to buoy their currencies as the prospect of more rapid depreciation raised the specter of capital outflows in the meantime the standoff between the world s two largest economies is pushing uneasy investors into the greenback and u s policy makers may face problems if the stronger dollar which is currently near its highs for the year is seen as crimping their efforts to promote higher inflation the forces roiling currencies are magnifying the focus on china and how it will handle a cheapening yuan options traders are pricing in around a 36 chance that the renminbi will by year end weaken past 7 per dollar a level unseen since the financial crisis at the end of march the

one winner the dollar markets have been buffeted by uncertainty as the trade impasse shows no sign of abating almost all emerging market currencies have weakened this month against the greenback the

20 gathering in osaka as a potential turning point should the two leaders fail to agree and the yuan slides analysts will be watching to see how china responds a weakening foreign exchange rate is the natural means of offsetting tariffs george saravelos strategist at deutsche bank ag said in a note may 17 the trump administration earlier this month increased tariffs on 200 billion worth of chinese goods to 25 and has threatened to also levy the impost on everything else imported into the u s from the world s most populous nation if the white house decided to apply a fresh 25 tariff on the remaining 300 billion of imports not currently affected the yuan would need to depreciate to around 8 12 per dollar to offset it according to calculations published by bank of america strategists on

the world economy is expected to pick up slowly next year but only if washington and china drop their latest tariff moves it was a stark warning about the risks ahead for the global economy even by the forthright standards of the boss of the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd the world economy is in a dangerous place angel gurria said as the oecd announced its latest lower forecasts for growth on may 21 the source of his worry the mounting trade tensions between the united states and china which could hit the rest of the world much harder than they have to date let s avoid complacency at all costs gurria said clearly the biggest threat is through the escalation of trade restriction measures and this is happening as we speak this clear and present danger could easily have knock on effects with much of the world economy still recovering from the after effects of the global financial crisis a decade ago us president donald trump caused alarm when he raised tariffs on 200 billion worth of goods from china on may 10 prompting beijing to say it would hit back with its own higher duties trade tensions are the main reason that growth in the global economy will weaken to 3 2 per cent this year the slowest pace in three years and down from rates of about 5 per cent before the financial crisis a decade ago the oecd said the world economy is expected to pick up slowly next year but only if washington and china drop their latest tariff moves the impact could be a lot more severe if trump follows through on his latest threat to hit a further 300 billion of chinese imports with tariffs and china retaliates again that kind of tariff escalation plus the associated rise in uncertainty about a broadening of the trade war could lop about 0 7 per cent off the world economy by 2021 2022 the oecd said that would be equivalent to about 600 billion or the loss of the economy of argentina but the knock on effects might not stop there a full blown trade war combined with an ensuing debt crisis in china and a shift away from exports to drive its economy could cause a 2 per cent hit to china s economy in turn knocking global growth further the oecd said to be sure that kind of worst case scenario may well be averted given the stakes for the united states and china trump and chinese president xi jinping are due to meet at a group of 20 leaders summit in japan on june 28 29 other g20 nations will be urging them to step back from the fight chief among them germany and japan two export power houses which have much to lose from a long trade war for now the effect of the trade tensions is being felt mostly among manufacturers by contrast consumers buoyed by low unemployment and weak inflation in many of the world s rich economies have shown little sign of alarm at the row between washington and beijing but over the longer term a protracted trade war is likely to drag down the consumer economy too global trade should normally grow at double the pace of the world economy but is expected to lag it in 2019 boding ill for investment by companies the oecd said that investment would normally drive productivity growth which is key for long term prosperity and is urgently needed living standards for many workers in rich countries remain lower than before the financial crisis of 2008 09 the frustration with lower living standards is widely seen as one of the main factors behind the rise of populist politics including trump s presidential election victory in 2016 to put it bluntly this cannot be the new normal said laurence boone the oecd s chief economist we cannot accept an economy that doesn t raise people s living standards world equity markets rebounded on friday from heavy selling the previous day after president donald trump said us complaints against china s huawei technologies might be resolved within the framework of a sino us trade deal but tensions remained high with china accusing us secretary of state mike pompeo of fabricating rumors after he said huawei s chief executive was lying about the telecom network gear maker s ties to the chinese government while trump on thursday said a trade deal could resolve us complaints against huawei he also called the chinese telecommunications giant very dangerous suggesting resolution of the trade spat and stand off over huawei is not near the pan european stoxx 600 index rose 0 50 and msci s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0 37 on wall street the dow jones industrial average rose 72 25 points or 0 28 to 25 562 72 the s p 500 gained 4 92 points or 0 17 to 2 827 16 and the nasdaq composite added 23 54 points or 0 31 to 7 651 83 the dollar edged away from two year highs set on thursday after the weak us manufacturing activity data sparked worries that the trade conflict with china may hurt the world s largest economy and erode the currency s safe haven status agencies
be careful what you wish for is an english expression used to tell people to think before they say they want something and to suggest that they may not actually want it there may be unforeseen and unpleasant consequences be careful what you wish for is an english expression used to tell people to think before they say they want something and to suggest that they may not actually want it there may be unforeseen and unpleasant consequences well i was reminded of that expression after newspaper publisher trevor ncube posted this on social media following the fuel price rise this week dear zimbabwe i am completely outraged by your outrage over things that you have been calling for which have just happened your rush to be part of popular opinion and in with the outraged crowd is so pedestrian yours equally outraged compatriot it was self evident that government had been subsidising fuel all along to the advantage of business and the public at large that can be extrapolated from finance minister mthuli ncube s statement last year that he had decided against a big bang solution in favour of a gradualist approach to lessen the shock in the economy because he knows that there are back and forth linkages in the economy he is not a professor for nothing but some people mistook him for a hopeless fool when he deliberately held the bond note at par with the united states dollar until this week when their wish was fulfilled with the interbank rate extended to fuel prices and they went ballistic it cannot get more confused than that to those who read the situation and connect the dots this week s fuel price rise did not come as a bombshell but was being gradually worked into the system it was coming as soon as reserve bank governor john mangudya announced the monetary policy in february floating the bond note against the us dollar it became a matter of when not if this is not to make light of the suffering of the people not at all egypt among others is also taking the same painful medicine as zimbabwe egyptian president abdel fattah al sisi in january 2019 said the most painful part of his ambitious economic reform programme was over but cautioned there was still some way to go before its completion the same in zimbabwe less than one year into the two year transitional stabilisation programme no one can truthfully and honestly say it has failed two years means two years no more no less the reforms in egypt included floating the currency substantial cuts in state subsidies on basic goods and introducing a wide range of new taxes the measures led to a significant rise in prices and services something critics say has hurt the poor and middle class the hardest as is happening in zimbabwe but al sisi thanked egyptians for enduring the harsh and difficult economic measures he said his government had no choice but to embark on the reform programme anything else would have led to the collapse of the state he said the same is true for zimbabwe anything else besides the austerity measures will lead to the collapse of the state not just the government as some people are being misled to believe by politicians who cannot distinguish the state from the government anyone claiming to have an easy and quick fix is lying to the people that is why the finance minister is taking a gradualist approach to ensure as soft landing as possible as the economy absorbs the price increase shocks but some people led by loquacious politicians see that as economics illiteracy on the part of the minister going to the extent of tutoring the minister that there was no way the bond note had parity with the us dollar whereas this was actually working to their advantage and of course some opposition political parties did not want the people to see it that way as this would increase the ruling party s political capital as serving and protecting the people people who don t think for themselves completely missed that and now they are crying that their advice has been implemented because they outsourced thinking to political demagogues this is what happens when people submit to groupthink groupthink occurs when people s desire to maintain group loyalty becomes more important than making the best choices groupthink occurs when a group of people get together and start to think collectively with one mind the group is more concerned with maintaining unity than with objectively evaluating their situation alternatives and options the group as a whole tends to take irrational actions or overestimate their positions or moral rightness it is destructive to effective thinking some people because of groupthink dynamics laughed at the 1 1 as proving the government s incompetence now that the government has heeded their educated advice they cry foul but didn t they bring this upon themselves maybe where government intended to align the fuel price much later after the strengthening of macro economic fundamentals they did it much earlier while also tying in the opposition to the ramifications of the move now fresh from the egg on the face they ended up with over the fuel price rise they are ridiculing the 50 cents fare being charged by public transport utility zupco as economically unsustainable but those people who exercise individual thinking see sense in that subsidy because the government is now in a cash positive position following the introduction of the 2 electronic transaction tax and will see the subsidy as an immediate and direct benefit to the ordinary person who is shouldering the bulk of that 2 tax burden the lack of logic is staggering they say what s the point of reducing fares to 50 cents while bread costs 3 50 another distinction without a difference because of groupthink they look at things in isolation they just can t get it into their heads that those savings on transport will go to bread groupthink also has a blinding effect because of groupthink the same people who applauded mdc leader nelson chamisa s condemnation of the zimbabwe bird the national emblem as representing institutional idolatry causing national problems have come out in loud support of chief nhlanhlayamangwe ndiweni s claim that ntabazinduna mountain is sacred is that any less idolatrous to use their term as trevor ncube has pointed out you cannot have it both ways and you cannot make demands on the government to deliver while at the same time calling for the tightening of sanctions as one can see groupthink diminishes reasoning which can leave people much worse off conway nkumbuzo tutani is a

economists see gloom ahead though the country s new president says growth investment and currency are strong mexico s economy shrank in the first quarter of 2019 from the previous three month period as services and industrial activity contracted the new data released on friday deal a blow to the new government s drive to convince investors it can boost growth in latin america s second largest economy president andres manuel lopez obrador took office in december pledging to ramp up lackluster growth and improve job creation the economy shrunk 0 2 percent compared with the october december period the first contraction since the second quarter of 2018 according to data from national statistics agency inegi the contraction was particularly sharp in march march was a very bad month for economic activity clocking a 0 6 percent contraction mexican central bank board member jonathan heath said on twitter citing monthly economic activity data also published on friday goldman sachs economist alberto ramos said labour strikes and disruptions to fuel supply in a number of mexico s states early in the year had contributed to the slump after the data was published mexico s s p bmv ipc stock index fell more than 1 percent in midday trading and the peso currency dipped into negative territory there will be growth lopez obrador brushed aside concerns about the data when asked about it at his daily morning press conference investment is growing i said it yesterday our currency is strong lopez obrador said it is appreciating more than other currencies around the globe and inflation is stable and there will be growth much more growth so we re going to wait mexico received some 10bn in foreign direct investment in the first quarter up seven percent from the same quarter last year inflation was slightly lower than expected in the first half of may standing at 4 43 percent in addition the peso has appreciated over six percent since lopez obrador took office still some of the president s economic decisions have rattled investors prompting private sector analysts to cut their mexican growth forecasts for this year the international monetary fund imf on april 9 lowered mexico s 2019 growth outlook to 1 6 percent from 2 1 percent for 2020 the imf dropped the forecast to 1 9 percent from 2 2 percent citing shifts in perception about policy under the new administration in a note ramos said that high interest rates would weigh on consumer spending he added that the investment outlook was lackluster partly due to uncertainty over the ratification of a new trade deal with mexico s top export market the united states the us economy expanded 3 2 percent in the first quarter in annual terms but some economists think that growth rate will be short lived potentially bringing more negative prospects to mexico the projected deceleration of the us economy may also weaken the thrust to activity from exports and foreign direct investment ramos said
as ukraine integrates with the world economy experts say it must bring its taxation system in line with international standards and better abide by rules that are championed globally doing so is in the country s best interests ukraine s allies and financial supporters also expect kyiv to align its taxation policies with best practices worldwide thus the organization for economic cooperation and development and the european union supported by the international monetary fund and the world bank are pushing for the initiative known as beps base erosion and profit shifting part of which addresses transfer pricing rules the goal of beps is to ensure that taxes get collected where economic activities generating the profits are performed and where value is created in turn rules aim to ensure that companies set prices for their in firm transactions at market prices so that such transactions can be properly taxed what is transfer pricing the internal price of transactions involving goods works services between connected economic entities is the issue said ivan shynkarenko of the kyiv based wts consulting firm in principle this opens possibilities for manipulating prices in order to shift profit to be taxed into other jurisdictions with low or no taxes transfer pricing regulations started in the united states in the 1930s accelerated after world war ii when a global financial framework emerged developed economies saw an emerging trend in which enterprises wanted to shift their profits into low tax countries sparking the need for state regulation without the enforcement of rules some countries are starved of tax revenue while low tax jurisdictions collect revenue from production centers located all over the world but more countries are complying with the beps global initiative to redress the unfairness compliance takes place in the form of raising taxes in low tax jurisdictions and through improved exchange of information among fiscal authorities to prevent profit shifting the european union lists tax havens and calls them non cooperative tax jurisdictions currently there are 15 countries on the list the eu has been keeping the list since 2017 and it has proven its worth in promoting the eu s agenda of improving global tax practices fighting tax avoidance and improving good governance and transparency romania s finance minister eugen teodorovici said on march 12 starved of taxes in ukraine it is hoped that the enforcement of rules can replenish the coffers of a state with a national budget of only 40 billion annually the state fiscal service of ukraine claims that since 2013 it has managed to grow the tax base in ukraine by 8 2 billion hryvnias or about 311 million thanks to better implementation of transfer pricing rules simply prohibiting in firm transactions regulated by transfer pricing rules will not solve the issue andriy reun of the kyiv based evris law firm explains transfer pricing is a source for increasing the payments of enterprise profit tax all over the world by prohibiting transfer pricing the state will just fail to collect money needed for development of infrastructure and other socially important projects so prohibition is definitely not a solution svitlana musienko of the sayenko kharenko law firm has been working in tax law for 20 years and says that enforcement of transfer pricing rules including audits performed by fiscal authorities requires so much expertise from both the business and the state auditor that this always takes time business advantage businesses are at an advantage against the state because firms can move faster by employing an expert training him or hiring an external advisor musienko explains the state moves at a slower pace but it s worth the investment shynkarenko says international experience shows that each euro invested into development of the fiscal service in the sphere of profit shifting brings 10 additional euros of paid taxes reun believes that since the moment transfer pricing was introduced to ukraine in 2013 the state fiscal service has undergone a serious transformation into a service centered organization aimed at assisting businesses what they are doing now really looks more like a service function but when they are starting an audit then things can go badly reun said reun said tax authorities have understood that it is much easier to persuade business to pay taxes in full voluntarily than to enforce them in courts musienko is confident that if the state fiscal service keeps developing a service centered culture that respects confidential information companies are likely to reciprocate with better cooperation this will build trust in the state musienko suggests sensitive information to be exchanged by fiscal authorities must remain protected by rules and not get sold at a black market in kyiv she said transfer audits ruling transfer pricing expert olga trifonova of pwc believes that the tax authorities do not act irrationally when selecting businesses for transfer audits but use a risk assessment method in picking their target companies indeed tax authorities select those tax payers with risk areas based upon the results of documentation analysis and visit them spot on she said musienko said that currently 90 95 percent of transfer pricing cases in courts have been dealing with procedural issues rather than with significant violations however the appearance of cases being considered on their merits makes lawyers feel optimistic as court decisions will eventually build case law on transfer pricing musienko praises the supreme court of ukraine for passing its first final ruling on a transfer pricing dispute in ukraine based on the merits of the case the dispute was resolved by the supreme court of ukraine on march 5 the fiscal services and a company called sis group clashed in the case in which the court supported the position of the ukrainian taxpayer in particular the court supported the company s position that market prices had to be established at the moment of entering into a transaction and not while the title was transferred from seller to buyer the court also ruled that tax authorities needed to rely on several methods for establishing market prices and use several sources of information for doing so plus the judges ruled that operations performed after july 27 2017 with british partnerships had to be considered as controlled operations this and other final decisions in ukrainian courts on the subject of transfer pricing will help both the business community and the fiscal authorities in properly understanding the law and in their correct structuring of transactions in general however the courts still need to build up their expertise trifonova explains unlike the tax authorities which have had six years to learn about transfer pricing and its application our courts regrettably are not well aware of the approaches in application of transfer pricing rules the fact that transfer pricing is more of an economic than a legal category can also account for slow learning pace of ukrainian judges but trifonova is confident that the ukrainian judges will learn eventually in eastern

for future growth in our u s business over the past 10 years we ve been rebuilding our core infrastructure and platforms this quarter successfully converting our small business customers to a new digital next generation platform j d power win is a strong endorsement of these continued investments and of our commitment to create experiences that respond to our customers evolving needs rounding

turn to slide 8 canadian retail net income was 1 8 billion up 1 year over year reflecting higher revenue partially offset by charges related to the greystone acquisition as well as higher expenses insurance claims and credit losses adjusted net income increased 2 revenue increased 8 reflecting volume growth margin expansion higher insurance and fee revenue and the acquisition of greystone average loans increased 6 year over year and average deposits increased 3 reflecting growth in both personal and business volumes margin was 2 99 up 5 basis points sequentially reflecting a refinement in revenue recognition assumptions in the auto finance portfolio and an increase in the prime ba spread total pcl decreased 10 quarter over quarter with reductions in both impaired and performing pcls total pcl as an annualized percentage of credit volume was 27 basis points down 2 basis points quarter over quarter expenses increased 11 reflecting higher spend supporting business growth including

turn to slide 9 u s retail segment net income was us 948 million up 23 year over year on a reported basis and 15 on an adjusted basis u s retail bank reported earnings rose 14 on strong revenue growth of 6 average loan volumes increased 5 year over year reflecting growth in the personal and business customer segments deposit volumes excluding the td ameritrade s suite deposits were up 4 including 5 growth in core consumer checking accounts net interest margin was 3 38 down 4 basis points sequentially primarily due to seasonal increases in deposits net interest margin was up 15 basis points year

our common equity tier 1 ratio was 12 at the end of the second quarter consistent with the first quarter we had strong organic capital generation this quarter which added 40 basis points to our

in the quarter our leverage ratio was 4 2 and our liquidity coverage ratio was 135 we announced our intention to initiate a new ncib for up to 20 million common shares subject to regulatory approval i will now turn the call over to ajai ajai bambawale group head chief risk officer thank you riaz and good afternoon everyone please turn to slide 13 credit quality remains strong in the second quarter across all business segments as evidenced by reductions in gross impaired loan formations gross impaired loans and credit losses gross impaired loan formations were 1 34 billion or 20 basis points down 6 basis points quarter over quarter and up 2 basis points year over year the quarter over quarter decrease in gross impaired loan formations reflects higher prior quarter formations in the u s commercial portfolio primarily attributable to the power and utility sector and seasonal trends in the u s credit card and auto portfolios consistent with recent quarters there were no new formations in the wholesale segment please turn to slide 14 gross impaired loans ended the quarter at 3 3 billion or 48 basis points down 5 basis points quarter over quarter and stable year over year the u s retail segment was the primary contributor to the bank s 238 million quarter over quarter decrease in gross impaired loans reflecting a reclassification to performing for certain u s heloc clients current with their payments and seasonal trends in the u s credit card portfolio the wholesale segment maintained is zero impaired loan balance quarter over quarter please turn to slide 15 recall that our presentation reports pcl ratios both gross and net of the partner s share of the u s strategic card credit losses we remind you that credit losses recorded in the corporate segment are fully absorbed by our partners and do not impact the bank s net income the bank s pcls for the quarter was 636 million or 39 basis points down 11 basis points quarter over quarter and up 3 basis points year over year the 219 million quarter over quarter pcl decrease was driven by typical seasonal trends in the u s credit card and auto portfolios and the canadian consumer lending portfolios please turn to slide 16 both impaired and performing pcl decreased quarter over quarter reflecting u s seasonal trends as already mentioned generally lower performing pcl across canadian retail and higher prior quarter impaired pcl in the u s commercial portfolio primarily attributable to the power and utilities sector in summary credit quality was strong across the bank s portfolios and we remain well positioned for continued growth with that operator we are now ready to begin the q a session questions and answers operator thank you we will now take questions from the telephone lines operator instructions the first question is from sumit malhotra from scotia capital please go ahead sumit malhotra scotia capital analyst thanks good afternoon first question is for riaz on capital riaz one of your counterparts this morning talked to us about ifrs 16 and the impact that would have in to start 2020 just thinking about that for td and especially with your larger branch footprint are you able to give us an idea what you re expecting from a capital impact for that implementation riaz ahmed group head chief financial officer we re working our way through the standards sumit and as you can appreciate there are some interpretational items that we need to work our way through and some choices that need to be made so we re not prepared to quantify what the impact would be however as you well know when the right of use asset gets capitalized at the beginning of the next fiscal year it will be risk weighted and in fact i assume i m expecting the impact to be very manageable sumit malhotra scotia capital analyst all right so that s something as you said there s some choices to be made we can revisit that later in the year riaz ahmed group head chief financial officer yes sumit malhotra scotia capital analyst and then i ll wrap up with a question on the wholesale side so i think you communicated to us last quarter revenue would stabilize we ve seen that here i just want to focus on the expense side of the equation and specifically the build out that has been referenced a few times when we look at the headcount in this segment it s about it s up about 10 year over year and you ve had a pretty steady climb over that period of time just maybe two questions here if you can give us an idea of how this expansion is going to trend is there a number you have in mind as to the amount of full time complement that has to be added to get to the scale in wholesale outside of canada that you re looking for and then secondly i hope i m not putting you on the spot but i didn t see this in the annual report approximately how much of your revenue in this segment is being generated outside of canada if we use full year numbers for 2018 bharat masrani group president chief executive officer okay thanks yes we have as we ve mentioned on the way through invested in building out both the global markets businesses as well as the corporate investment banking business particularly to grow u s dollar revenue both in the u s region as well as in other parts of the world in which we operate we have had a fairly aggressive build in people on the front office side in the last two and a half years we have added approximately 200 front office people roughly half and half a split between global markets and corporate investment banking and then of course you need to also invest in infrastructure and people and support and control et cetera so it s been a relatively large investment for td securities we feel we re at a point now though where would that will slow down fairly meaningfully we re still looking to add a person here and there in some of the areas but now we re more focused on achieving the revenue that we re making the investment for and that there is a j curve in that some businesses are further along in the cycle we ve been working at them our ssa u s dollar business has been up and running now for a number of years and we re at a market share there where we re in the top five banks in the u s dollar ssa space in that business now we re starting to add euro and sterling but it s a fully invested business contrast that primary services or prime services i should say in the u s it s a couple of years old the first part of that was investing in systems and policies and metrics and people but that is now running and you know the focus there is adding the clients that we now need to make it a more profitable business and we have probably more of the latter type than we do the ssa business so bottom line sumit at we ve the growth in fte will be relatively small on the front office side riaz ahmed group head chief financial officer on the matter of sumit malhotra scotia capital analyst part two was on the revenue mix or geographic mix riaz ahmed group head chief financial officer yes i think sumit it s riaz on the matter of geographic mix of the revenue you know as you know we make very careful choices about how we define segments and i think you should look at td securities as an integrated global segment yes we do make disclosures in the annual report about where the sources of revenue are and that is more a legal entity reflection of the accumulation and aggregation of earnings but you know when you have global centers for example from a trading perspective that are in london singapore new york toronto you have funding sources that come from variety the trading book really shouldn t be thought of more as an integrated business unit so i don t think it makes sense to break it out the wholesale results in that way sumit malhotra scotia capital analyst yes i ll leave it here i mean obviously some of the canadian peers anyway who have expanded more into the u s in the wholesale business have provided that information and i think really what i m getting at here is as bob has detailed you ve certainly added full time complement in the u s and it would be interesting to see how the revenue progression for the expense that you ve made is trending and i think that would be helpful to gauge that so i hear you but hopefully that s not the one we re going to revisit going forward okay thank you bharat masrani group president chief executive officer thanks for your time operator thank you the next question is from meny grauman from cormark securities please go ahead meny grauman cormark securities analyst hi good afternoon if i look year to date adjusted eps growth about 4 so i m wondering how confident you are that you can still get to the bottom end of your 7 to 10 range for 2019 bharat masrani group president chief executive officer meny this is bharat last quarter when we talked about this we said there is a lot of headwinds and there is tailwinds that does not change in my remarks up front i talked about some of the risks that we see out there but overall the way we ve set up technical difficulty where our medium term target of hitting 7 to 10 earnings growth continues to be applicable from td and we ll try very hard as i said last quarter to try and get toward the bottom end of that range going forward meny grauman cormark securities analyst okay so it s still realistic and then just in terms of expenses what s the outlook in the past you ve talked about sort of a slowdown in the second half of the year in terms of expense growth and ramping up in operating leverage can you update us on how you re thinking about expenses in the second half of the year and operating leverage riaz ahmed group head chief financial officer yes absolutely meny it s riaz as we said coming out of 2016 that we were making room to make investments and then if you look at our expense growth coming into 17 and 18 you can see that steady ramp up of expenses and particularly in 2018 over the four quarters we had an increasing expense profile which is now beginning to plateau out and we re seeing a more level set of expenses from a quarter to quarter basis so what that means is that we have brought our expenses to a level where we feel that we re making the investments that we need to make and still driving out the right productivity but it just turned out that the result of that is in the first half you see a larger expense growth number which will moderate quite a lot in q3 and q4 but at a comparable expense absolute expense spending levels meny grauman cormark securities analyst thank you operator thank you the next question is from ebrahim poonawala from bank of america please go ahead ebrahim poonawala bank of america merrill analyst good afternoon i guess just wanted to clarify something to your previous statement on expenses from what i recall like we saw pretty meaningful ramp up in the back half of last year so what s the point there that we should see pretty healthy operating leverage in the back half of the year when we look at third and fourth quarter riaz ahmed group head chief financial officer yes i think that s exactly right ebrahim that as our expense spending growth rate and investment growth rate will normalize or moderate in the second half it could create better operating leverage and as you know we always strive to create operating leverage year after year after year and so i do expect that you ll see much better metrics on that front ebrahim poonawala bank of america merrill analyst got it and i just wanted to focus on the u s retail margin one in terms of riaz if you can just talk about what you re seeing in terms of deposit pricing pressure with the fed on hold and your outlook for the margin and secondly if you can talk about any actions you re taking to protect the margin if the fed ends up cutting interest rates at some point over the next 12 months given sensitivity to your margin as well as sensitivity at ameritrade to declining interest rates greg braca president and chief executive officer td bank america s most convenient bank ebrahim thank you for the questions it s greg braca i would just first start on the margin question if we think about the quarter over quarter you saw we were down 4 basis points but i would like to point out that year over year we re still up a healthy 15 basis points and generally you know the way we would look at this sequential quarter over quarter a little bit of a dip is riaz upfront mentioned some seasonal deposits or we could talk about it in terms of mix of loan and deposit volumes in quarter over quarter and that contributed to the decline but the way i would think about it and i ve talked about this for a couple of quarters now is the quality of the deposit growth and what we re seeing in the u s is a very competitive and dynamic environment with both large and small organizations really looking to put on deposits and show some ability to grow some are going about it with core franchise growth and some are paying up for it we clearly are not in that latter half camp and our betas remain very well in check and we ve done a very good job growing core dda and core checking account growth and we ve talked about that in the past as well core consumer checking account grows up year over year of up 5 is really is healthy household acquisition and goes to our whole model around primacy and convenience and all the things that we talk extensively about to your second question when you think about protecting that margin of interest rates would it go the other way or whatever the case may be i do think it goes back to the way i answered this first question is that our goal here regardless of the environment is to drive core household growth not pay off for hot deposits drive core checking account growth and we re seeing that across all of our lines of business including small business and consumer so that s how i would answer that ebrahim poonawala bank of america merrill analyst so just a quick follow up on that so the margin went down seasonally impacted because of the deposit mix shift is the outlook that it should hold relative to 2q levels or do you expect incrementally more compression as the year progresses greg braca president and chief executive officer td bank america s most convenient bank yes so the way we look at any quarter over quarter or the next few quarters these things are going to tend to bump around a bit and very difficult because in addition to just volume there s a whole host of things that we always talk about that goes into it long term rates investments loan yields so there s a whole suite of things that would go into that margin story but what i would generally say is with a stable outlook from the fed and borrowing anything further dramatic on the long end you generally tend to see a general statement over several quarters fairly stable margins ebrahim poonawala bank of america merrill analyst got it thank you operator thank you the next question is from robert sedran from cibc capital markets please go ahead robert sedran cibc capital markets analyst thanks good afternoon riaz i just wanted a quick clarification actually on the comment you made about the canadian margin which was the impact of i guess the change in revenue recognition around the auto finance book can you a little more color on whether that is a one time item on the revenue line that will fall away or if that was a recurring thing that will keep the margin at the level it got to riaz ahmed group head chief financial officer yes no rob what that s about is that we re seeing faster prepayments in the auto book which would therefore result in faster revenue recognition so it wasn t a methodology it s actually the underlying assumptions and so i think that as we continue to see those prepayments we ll see more around faster revenue recognition along in that portfolio robert sedran cibc capital markets analyst so as long as consumer behavior remains what consumer behavior has been the margin is going to evolve from here as opposed to giving back 2 basis points or 3 basis points that was up this quarter riaz ahmed group head chief financial officer yes i don t think that it should have a big impact on margins going forward it may just come off every as things level off a little bit in our new assumptions so similar to what greg said about the u s i think canadian margins probably bumped around a bit from here but that would be an adjustment to assumptions that doesn t occur all the time robert sedran cibc capital markets analyst and so the rest of the margin trajectory from here is consistent with the prior guidance bit of a leak upwards i guess riaz ahmed group head chief financial officer i think that is slight biased upwards but i would say as greg indicated it s true in canada as well that lots changes in terms of product competition and consumer behavior so i think it s better to say that it will bump up and down a little bit here and there robert sedran cibc capital markets analyst okay thank you operator thank you the next question is from steve theriault from eight capital please go ahead steve theriault eight capital analyst thanks very much if we could go back to capital markets for a moment and focusing on expenses so the last couple of quarters the expense line has been about 600 million plus or minus a few million wondering how like if that should we think of that as a new run rate and i look at year on year the revenue line was identical expenses were about 80 million higher how much of that 80 million or so year on year increase is from the higher u s expenses as you build that out bharat masrani group president chief executive officer yes i think there is some i think we re of the view that the 600 a quarter is something that we should probably be modeling in ourselves and the reason that s hesitating is that there s also regulatory build and technology build and brexit build and you know some of that may be recurring and some may not be recurring so i think we certainly have been spending money on if you want to call eu 27 regulatory we ve been spending a lot of money on that type of activity so that may slow down i think what the real key though is that we need to grow revenue to make the return on the investment and if that is not occurring at the pace we need then we need to reduce expenses as well so we are focused on both steve theriault eight capital analyst you have a base case on when you like to see that return on equity get back to sort of the high teen level in terms of sort of trying to gauge your level of patients with all that bharat masrani group president chief executive officer this quarter would be good no i mean we still have an objective of making an roe more in the 15 range i think we ve referred to in the last number of years i think the high teens are a little bit of an error in the past given what s going on in the business so that s the focus and we d like to try to achieve that as quickly as we can steve theriault eight capital analyst okay maybe one more for you then after the volatility from last quarter i m curious if there was any actions taken this quarter sort of interaction last quarter that may have mitigated any revenue upside for q2 and what s proving to be a pretty strong capital markets quarter across the whole group here bharat masrani group president chief executive officer i don t think there was anything that we were doing last quarter that was changed and we re doing this quarter that caused anything in the results but what we will continue to do though is the u s markets were strong especially in the latter two months of this quarter and our investments there really are what s going to cause a change in the mix and perhaps more stability in our revenues overall so it s that investment that was that certainly helped the quarter and markets helped that whereas in the previous quarter the lack of market activity in both canada and u s combined with the expense run rate as you spoke of certainly was a negative factor steve theriault eight capital analyst thanks for that operator thank you the next question is from doug young from desjardins capital please go ahead doug young desjardins capital analyst hi good afternoon just two quick ones riaz just in u s retail i think there was a recovery of a legal provision i just want to see if you can quantify that and just that so i have this correct that was netted out of net non interest expense is that correct greg braca president and chief executive officer td bank america s most convenient bank it s greg doug so the way we would talk about that is we re not going to put a number on that and the way we think about expenses in general is if that item had not occurred our expenses would have been up year over year and expenses in general would have been reflecting our continued investment in the business but we wouldn t put an absolute number on that release doug young desjardins capital analyst will that mean i don t know if you can just give us a ballpark there but like the would mix have been up like low single digits is that or greg braca president and chief executive officer td bank america s most convenient bank well as we ve said all along we still would have had positive operating leverage and if i would think about this for the first half of the year we had expenses up 6 and for the first half you re going to have these numbers from time to time in any given quarter so for the first half of the year our expense rate even with this item is running roughly 3 and certainly we ve had positive operating leverage for the first half of the year doug young desjardins capital analyst okay riaz ahmed group head chief financial officer if you doug just look at the trend of non interest expenses over the last six quarters i think you can assume that s a good trend doug young desjardins capital analyst okay that s fair and then just lastly cet1 capital generation i guess i m trying to get a sense of i think historically if we went back 15 basis points to 20 basis points per quarter is typically what people have talked about i think maybe we ve talked about in relation to td we re going into a different environment there s been regulatory rule changes is that still a reasonable level to expect for td or is there something that s changed that would cause that to be lower going forward thank you greg braca president and chief executive officer td bank america s most convenient bank i think doug if you look at slide 12 you can see that the net income less dividends contributed 40 basis points and then off the rwa increases of 27 basis points just a little bit less than half of that was devoted to the migration of the card portfolio from standardized to airb so i think you can see in that that the capital accretion continues to still be very strong even in a very fluid environment doug young desjardins capital analyst and that i guess that move of that credit card portfolio to airb i mean that in and of itself is done so that s one time is there anything else that s on the horizon that would be similar in such that if you move to airb would have a negative impact riaz ahmed group head chief financial officer well really in our business mix cards are one portfolio which when they migrate to airb the risk rates on them are higher than standardized typically it s the other way around and of course you re well aware that our u s non retail portfolio still is in the process of migration to airb but that should be a benefit doug young desjardins capital analyst okay great thank you operator thank you the next question is from gabriel dechaine from national bank financial please go ahead gabriel dechaine national bank financial analyst good afternoon i want to talk first about the commercial book in canada and it looks like you guys didn t have any credit noise there no real losses out of the ordinary like we ve seen from a few other banks this quarter and last mind you i guess i m kind of outside of your in quarter performance we have seen some issues then the bank of canada is raising their own concerns about corporate indebtedness and then we ve also got this massive growth in commercial and wholesale loans in canada i m just wondering what do you think about that growth and what are you seeing differently than what the bank of canada is may be concerned about why are you not concerned about credit quality and commercial lending in canada in general sorry that s bit of a ordinary ph question but ajai bambawale group head chief risk officer it s ajai i ll start with pcl and then teri will talk about growth we re definitely seeing very low pcl and loss rates across the commercial book and you know i would describe the quality as good but that doesn t mean there s no migration there is some migration occurring and i would put it in the category of gradual normalization so it s not like it s not occurring at all i can t speak to the piers and what their book is like but certainly in our book like i feel it s strong it s performing well but there is some normalization occurring and if you actually go to some of the ecl tables and you look at stage two ecls you ll see a bit of an uptick and especially you look at business and government so you ll see some migration there gabriel dechaine national bank financial analyst what s driving that ajai bambawale group head chief risk officer i think we re late in the cycle so it s not abnormal to see some migration so late in the cycle i can t pinpoint a single thing that s pointing that and it s not a single sector but i would say it s broad but it s still low dollars teri currie group head canadian personal banking and then it s teri from a commercial growth perspective i would say we re very comfortable with the business that we re putting on the books we re continuing to put bankers on the streets in markets where they re building great relationships business succession continues to be an opportunity for us and i feel comfortable that i think riaz has quoted earlier this morning we re prudent lenders through the cycle and so we re very comfortable with the business growth that we re seeing and open for business going forward gabriel dechaine national bank financial analyst teri well i have you at the mic but i d ask you something with a bit more positive spin we ve seen the housing market go from source of intense concern last year and in the wake of b20 and start that was dipping lower and lower and in the last few weeks and months we started to see some good starts data some positive sales data coming out of the gta and montreal as well and the industry seems to be i guess bottoming out in terms of mortgage growth resl i would say i m just wondering if you re generally as optimistic as you were about this business a little while ago or maybe if there s some additional optimism today in your growth outlook for resl growth and the ancillary businesses teri currie group head canadian personal banking so i continue to feel very comfortable with we ve been talking for quite a while now about a mid single digit medium term outlook for proprietary total real estate secured lending growth and i feel very comfortable with that for this year and going forward we ve been investing as you know in this business more mobile mortgage specialists more training for our branch advisors a leading capability that is fully digital to apply for a mortgage online we ve got a position as we ve talked about in the past where we are forced in hybrid heloc loan market share and we re continuing to be able to advance there with customers primarily who are already customers of td and so and retention is very strong as well so continue to feel good about that guidance going forward gabriel dechaine national bank financial analyst outside of what you re doing is there anything in the macro that makes you more teri currie group head canadian personal banking certainly we re seeing as you mentioned certainly we re seeing particularly in the gta the kind of start of that spring lending season and some good trends it really is a tale of the two sort of halves of the country if you will a little bit tougher in the west although i would say 100 million in vancouver and condos is still a hotly contested market for purchasers and then you know gta in particular a little bit stronger so you know it s early days in the spring season but we re seeing some green shoots gabriel dechaine national bank financial analyst okay thank you teri teri currie group head canadian personal banking welcome ajai bambawale group head chief risk officer thanks gabriel operator thank you the next question is from nigel d souza from veritas investment research please go ahead nigel d souza veritas investment research analyst good afternoon thank you for taking my question so i had one on the loan volume side and i wanted to focus on your auto book so if i look at the canadian retail segment auto loans are relatively flat and in the u s they re down slightly quarter over quarter you mentioned prepayment rates higher prepayment rates this quarter and so wondering if what we re seeing in q2 here is that just a one off non recurring kind of trend or what is your outlook given that you know autos tend we are a late cycle and autos tend to be kind of a leading lead the cycle where do you see auto finance volumes playing out for the rest of the year riaz ahmed group head chief financial officer i think on the matter of the prepayment nigel it s riaz i ll just say that you know the way we look at these from an accounting perspective is we sort of look at the trend over a period of time so i don t think you should interpret this as a one quarter trend when we look at our revenue recognition policies and this applies across a wide number of products whether it be mortgages auto what or even corporate like you always look at kind of prepayment trends over a longer period of time to see if you ve got an appropriate assumption that is going into it so i don t think you should look at it as one quarter as far as longer term trends go i ll let maybe greg comment on the u s auto piece greg braca president and chief executive officer td bank america s most convenient bank sure so you are right and it would have been similar to last quarter nigel if we looked at q1 over q1 we were really coming down to relatively flat year over year numbers for the last couple of quarters we have a view too that we are later in the cycle we also want an appropriate return we also want to manage relationships and volume and versus just a couple of years ago you would have seen us growing 8 9 10 year over year in auto we think we have the right mix of the business that we ve been positioning this as you know in the u s and i wouldn t be surprised if over the next few quarters you sort of bump around at this level maybe up a couple of points but this is generally where we see ourselves for the foreseeable future nigel d souza veritas investment research analyst that s really good color and i just have one last question on if i could turn to just credit losses and pcl in general there s a step down in provisions for your canadian retail segment and although seasonality has benefited that quarter over quarter there was a larger step down in prior years so it s still fairly elevated up as you noted nearly 30 year over year so wonder if you could provide more color there is there anything at play here in terms of do you expect that to trend more over the coming quarters and have another step down or what are you seeing just on either the performing or impaired side on the canadian retail ajai bambawale group head chief risk officer so i ll talk about the year over year it s ajai so we re kind of moving up very low numbers like if you look to q2 18 our number was 23 bps and the lowest we ve had is 22 bps so we re really moving off those very low numbers into what i would consider a little more normalized numbers and i think 27 bps still remains in a very acceptable range of 25 bps to 30 bps but what i am seeing is and i mentioned this earlier a gradual normalization of credit losses across the various books in canada so my expectation is that normalization will continue to occur at a gradual pace unless the economy turns i should clarify unless the economy turns nigel d souza veritas investment research analyst hey got it that s very helpful appreciate the answers ajai bambawale group head chief risk officer thank you operator thank you the next question is from darko mihelic from rbc capital markets please go ahead darko mihelic rbc capital markets analyst hi thank you i have two questions one for bob dorrance and then an obscure question that anybody can answer i hope so first for bob you mentioned that you didn t really change anything in the quarter and that s cool but i guess the question i have is one of the things that has been changing for you is the way you account for your trading deposits and we ve seen a bit more shift in the fair value through profit or loss and of course this quarter we see trading rebounds to 411 million from 251 million last quarter so the question is sort of twofold first were there any marks from that that suppressed or helped the trading revenue but more importantly from my perspective is as we continue down this path of shifting the accounting regimen will there be any sort of headwinds or tailwinds to trading revenue for the next couple of quarters bob dorrance group head wholesale banking there was nothing meaningful quarter to quarter darko in that particular part of the business i think as you look at i think q3 last year was where we had called out for the first time that there was a meaningful reduction in revenue that occurred as a function of marketing the trading deposits in the way that we were marketing them we have probably migrated roughly 50 of the book to fair value through oci so i don t think we ll it ll be a positive year over year but it won t be on a full amount darko mihelic rbc capital markets analyst okay so in other words just modest headwind or tailwind as opposed to trading revenue bob dorrance group head wholesale banking i would say that yes darko mihelic rbc capital markets analyst thank you and then my obscure question so i appreciate the commentary that quarter over quarter and it looks as though when i look at the presentation and the way you sort of designed it around credit quality is that quarter over quarter we saw a bit of an improvement and there was less stage 1 and stage 2 less non performing i suppose but when i open up the supplementary capital it s a different story in q1 asset quality helped your rwa and this quarter asset quality went the other way and you actually had to increase risk weighted assets because of asset quality movements and the reason why i asked this is typically what we re concerned about in some pieces is that as provisions rise and as things get worse not only will your provisions for credit losses rise but so will your rwas and yet in two quarters we have the opposite sort of phenomenon happening at td so i m wondering if you can maybe connect the dots for me if at all riaz ahmed group head chief financial officer are you darko looking at the flow statements for risk weighted assets darko mihelic rbc capital markets analyst yes riaz ahmed group head chief financial officer yes so i think you know as ajai indicated earlier that you can see a little bit of migration in the books and so that you end up having you can end up having an instance where both the pcls and risk weighted assets are experiencing the similar migration in that way because with the way basel 3 and ifrs 9 works you can get a little bit of doubling up of your procyclicality but as we indicated earlier you know that number you can see in the flow statements is not that significant and so gradual normalization is how we like to describe it darko mihelic rbc capital markets analyst so when i look at it though i mean for year to date i mean you have a 3 5 increase in your risk weighted assets and most of that will be just from portfolio from adding to the loan book but a portion of it is also because of credit quality and i m not singling out td there s much bigger one of your peers but again it s just quarter to quarter i suppose i guess what i m getting from you is the answer is they can go opposite ways but over a period of time when i m just trying to confirm that the general view would be that provisions for credit losses and rwa inflation for lack of a better word should be should go hand in hand it could but there are sometimes differences in how the two are looked at for example the calculation of expected shortfall in capital is different from how it s done for ifrs 9 purposes so that can be methodology differences and if you look at that asset quality line over the last five quarters you can see it was up in q2 of 2018 but it was down in q3 down again in q4 down again in q1 so i your the thesis that there is a general trend indicator here would not be evident in the numbers bharat masrani group president chief executive officer let me just build on that i mean there s definitely some credit migration occurring and that credit migration is going to be reflected in the rwa numbers but if you really look at acl and if you look at acl year over year and go and look at it by stage ok total acl is up 333 million and these are all in the disclosures year over year a big part of that is fx but excluding that the increase in stage three is actually very little it s 50 million and then most of the increase is actually stage 1 which i would describe as largely volume but there s some mix in seasoning there but there is a number for stage two as well and some of that is commercial migration which will naturally show up in the rwa numbers and there s mix and seasoning also occurring across some of the portfolios darko mihelic rbc capital markets analyst okay thanks very much bharat masrani group president chief executive officer good obscure answer to your obscure question as well operator thank you the last question is from scott chan from canaccord genuity please go ahead scott chan canaccord genuity analyst hi good afternoon i wanted to lots of questions on the canadian housing but i want to switch to u s housing and perhaps get your take on kind of what s unfolding there and then when i kind of look at your book share residential mortgage is very solid and your heloc book is trending downwards and maybe some thoughts regarding those portfolios for the balance of the year riaz ahmed group head chief financial officer sure scott so first i would say i m glad you pointed out the mortgage book has been up for several quarters now year over year and we were up 8 this quarter as you might know you know if i just contrast this to just a few quarters ago or back before last year and the cycle of rate hikes really intensified it would have been more of a balanced mix between refinance and purchase and we re seeing this certainly a swing to a purchase market with far less on the refi as rates have been moving up for the last year and a half so the volume that we re seeing is decidedly being driven by jumbo mortgages and certainly not only into the consumer book but also into the private bank and the wealth business in the u s you correctly pointed out that the home equity business is down and we re down 6 year over year but i would also contrast that to many of our peers and they re seeing double digits for quite some time now and that s just evident of when rates started going up there s been a large refinance out of home equity into more permanent or fixed rate mortgages and even we re seeing a little bit of an uptick with that with rates beginning to stabilize over the last three or four months and actually come in on the long end folks have had another bite at that apple on the refi side for home equity balances so relative to peers while we re down in home equities and it s certainly less than half of the sizable book than we are in the mortgage side you know it is you know we are still seeing outperformance relative to peers even though we re down year over year scott chan canaccord genuity analyst that s very helpful thank you operator thank you and the next question is from sohrab movahedi from bmo capital markets please go ahead sohrab movahedi bmo capital markets analyst hey thank you for that just two quickies teri do you does your business do any lending to the private mortgage market teri currie group head canadian personal banking my business does not sohrab movahedi bmo capital markets analyst and so ajai is there a policy around any lending to mortgage investment corporations or otherwise at the bank ajai bambawale group head chief risk officer i m pretty confident there are policies and we limit any of that kind of lending sohrab movahedi bmo capital markets analyst can you quantify it ajai bambawale group head chief risk officer no i don t have that information available sohrab movahedi bmo capital markets analyst okay and then just to just to go back to darko s question if you have negative migration and you are reflecting that negative migration through higher provisions whether it s stage 1 2 or 3 will that then relieve some of the pressure that we would have otherwise expected to see from rwa appreciation riaz ahmed group head chief financial officer well as i said sohrab it might to some extent but the two systems don t really work hand in hand the risk weighting system is different from the ifrs 9 accounting system so as i said earlier you can get overlaps and that just increases the procyclicality of the regime but given the quality of the credit book in our underwriting we wouldn t anticipate that it would give us big swings sohrab movahedi bmo capital markets analyst but so just to play that back to riaz maybe take another kick at it if capital ultimately is intended to defend against unexpected losses and you therefore have expected deterioration in the credit quality and reflected through higher rwas then presumably or through higher provisions then presumably don t need to also account for it through higher capital retention is that fair riaz ahmed group head chief financial officer i think in principle that is the correct framework sohrab and if you go back and look at all the comments that were made to the various authorities around the accounting provisions and the introduction of the various basel rules those provisions were pointed out and i think those papers give you a pretty good understanding of what that how those two interact sohrab movahedi bmo capital markets analyst thank you very much riaz ahmed group head chief financial officer thank you sohrab operator thank you there are no further questions registered at this time i would now like to turn the meeting back over to mr masrani bharat masrani group president chief executive officer thank you operator and nothing obscure about our results i might add td delivered a great quarter and i want to take this

editor s note how will the escalating china us trade dispute affect china s export oriented enterprises will the trade dispute lead to job losses and how should china tackle the trade dispute two experts share their views on the issue with china daily s liu jianna excerpts follow stronger china could withstand a trade war indeed it would have been mission impossible a decade ago for chinese enterprises to withstand a fierce china us trade dispute in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis many chinese enterprises were desperate to receive orders from major importing countries including the united states and a large number of migrant workers in china were forced to return to their hometowns despite the mounting economic pressure the policies to stabilize growth expand domestic demand and restructure the economy prevented the country from suffering further harm as a result china emerged from the crisis much stronger and more competitive it also gained in comprehensive national strength and made remarkable progress in science and technology especially cutting edge technologies such as 5g and artificial intelligence besides compared with 10 years ago the ratio of imports and exports in china s economy has significantly reduced while consumption s contribution to growth has soared to 76 2 percent also trade with the us accounted for only 11 5 percent of china s total trade in the first four months of this year which means china is in a much better position now than it was 10 years ago to deal with trade conflicts with other countries large scale job losses too are unlikely because of the lower contribution of foreign trade which declines in case of trade disputes to economic growth the employment situation has remained steady china had an unemployment rate of 5 0 percent in urban areas last month 0 2 percentage points lower than the previous month moreover the central government is paying greater attention to employment and premier li keqiang stressed at a conference on employment and entrepreneurship last week that the bottom line of avoiding massive layoffs must never be crossed nonetheless china should prepare for the worst and continue to boost domestic consumption and deepen supply side reform it should also make more efforts to explore markets other than the us especially those along the belt and road routes and the asean and european union member states which have strengthened their trade ties with china bai ming a senior research fellow at and deputy director of the institute of international market chinese academy of international trade and economic cooperation china should prepare for worst case scenario washington has triggered a trade dispute with beijing to make a dent in china s economy because it believes that the loss of trade will cause a chain reaction in china s economy for example a decline of one dollar in exports could mean a decline of 1 6 to 1 7 dollars in gdp so china should prepare for the worst case scenario especially because the volume of its trade surplus with the us is huge although china s total trade surplus is not big thankfully there are a number of policy tools such as export tax rebates export credits and export credit insurance that conform to world trade organization rules at china s disposal to withstand the impact of the higher tariffs imposed by the us on its products nevertheless china should fully implement the yuan exchange rate mechanism reform to enhance its flexibility while managing market expectation carefully to prevent the currency s dramatic devaluation because it could lead to capital outflow in addition measures should be taken to realize the full potential of domestic consumption for instance more investment liberalization measures may attract more foreign direct investment to china no matter how gloomy the current situation may look the long term prospect of the chinese economy remains promising yet when it comes to employment which concerns the livelihoods of ordinary chinese the government should make foolproof preparation and if at all should err on the side of caution hopefully a breakthrough could be made in the china us trade talks to save both countries and their peoples from unnecessary trouble cui fan a professor of international trade at the university of international business and economics the views do not necessarily reflect those of china daily

right now the federal reserve seems to be doing very well because the federal reserve seems to be dong very well and seems to be controlling the situation the value of the us dollar has strengthened this year and shows many signs of moving even higher the value of the us dollar is an important indicator of how financial markets feel the federal reserve is doing in terms of its conduct of monetary policy former fed chair paul volcker called the exchange rate of a nationâ s currency the most important price connected with that nation the low for the dollar according to the fedâ s trade weighted u s dollar index broad following the great recession came in july 2011 when the index averaged 94 5 for the month the price of the dollar seemed to follow that of the us economy and the us stock market and trended higher reaching a level of 122 5 in december 2016 the us economy and stock market responded to the monetary policy of the federal reserve during this time consistent with the plan for economic recovery created by then federal reserve chairman ben bernanke in january 2017 the value of the dollar began to decline responding to remarks by the newly elected president donald trump that he believed that the dollar should be a lot cheaper this â talking downâ the dollar resulted in the index dropping to 117 2 in january 2018 financial market participants seemed to believe at that time that mr trump would get his way since then however the dollar value has moved in the opposite direction as federal reserve officials continued to vote for increases in the fedâ s policy rate of interest and follow their own path in december 2018 the us dollar index averaged 128 5 for the month the value of the dollar in terms of the euro followed a similar path in december 2017 it took only 1 05 to acquire one euro in january 2018 one euro cost 1 23 by early february 2019 one euro was back down to about 1 13 two reasons are given for the strengthening of the dollar through 2018 and they are one the consistently growing us economy while europe especially seemed to be acing like it was in a recession and the fact that the federal reserve continued to increase its policy rate of interest the rate increase in december 2018 was especially important because it seem to signal that fed officials were truly acting independently of president trump the foreign exchange market reacted firmly to this action continuing on into 2019 the dollar has consistently strengthened every time federal reserve officials voiced the independence of their decision making or responded to questions about the rate policy in patient and pragmatic ways this was especially true during the recent bout of economic and financial insecurity hitting the world in early march beginning at that time risk averse investors around the world moved a lot of money into safe haven investments us bond markets benefitted from this movement based upon investorsâ trust of united states markets and of the federal reserve system furthermore during this time the federal reserve continued to reduce the size of its securities portfolio although fed officials have signaled that this effort will be ended later this year the fed has continued to reduce the size of its portfolio up to the present time i believe that this is very important for markets to see because it indicates that the federal reserve is not turning its back on the need to continue to act in an prudent and disciplined manner yes the federal reserve has needed to reassess its position on monetary policy but all the evidence put out by the fed has indicated that it would do so in a very patient manner and not upset all that had been accomplished over the past ten years overall the securities portfolio has declined by 586 2 billion since the start of the â reductionâ effort through may 22 2019 since the end of the first quarter of 2019 through may 22 the securities portfolio has been reduced by 92 0 billion or a little over 15 percent of the whole decline thus the reduction of the portfolio in the second quarter of this year has been relatively substantial note that during this whole time period the reserve balances commercial banks hold with the fed a proxy for â excess reservesâ in the banking system have declined by almost 650 billion to the total on may 22 or just over 1 5 trillion since the beginning of the second quarter â excess reservesâ have declined by 100 billion bottom line the federal reserve has been very persistent in overseeing a substantial shrinkage in its portfolio of securities and it has done so without creating any disruption or disturbance to the banking system or to the financial system the fed has done an excellent job i believe in moving from its three rounds of quantitative easing to its effort to â normalizeâ interest rates and its balance sheet it has raised its policy rate of interest steadily over an extended period of time and it has also reduced its securities portfolio in an ordered structured manner one could argue that in both cases the fed could go further in returning the policy rate and the securities portfolio to a â more normalâ level but the fed has gone as far as it has without causing any disruptions to the banking system or the financial markets as i have constantly argued fed officials have always been aware of the down side risk of what it was doing and so erred if they erred at all on the side of monetary ease and in my mind the fed has succeeded in this effort the problem now is of going forward there are substantial threats on the horizon that the fed must be very cognizant of and work through as i have just written there are two major issues that are looming very large the first of these is the united states china â economic warâ the most obvious being the battle over tariff issues this appears to be moving into a major wrestling match involving issues that impact trade government debt currencies technology and many other areas that overlap with one another the second has to do with the us government debt the congressional budget office has just released figures that show that if things go on the way they are us debt will total 152 percent of gross domestic product by 2048 up from 78 percent today there is a lot of federal debt to finance and how this will impact the federal reserve and monetary policy is anyoneâ s guess right now this is why it is so important for the fed to be the disciplined adult in the room and maintain its leadership position the fed must remain in command as it has done so over the past ten years of the current economic recovery if federal reserve officials lose control of the situation i hate to think what could happen within the united statesâ and the world the value of the us dollar gives us a picture of how market participants interpret the actions of the federal reserve investors really need to continue to watch fed behavior very closely and they also need to check out how the markets seem to be reacting to this behavior unfortunately because of what is going on right now and the lack of discipline being exerted here and there federal reserve officials may be severely tested over the next couple of years
more than 160 revolutionaries gathered in toronto may 18 20 for the 19th congress of fightback and la riposte socialiste the supporters of the international marxist tendency in canada the three day congress brought attendees from toronto montreal edmonton victoria waterloo hamilton ottawa oshawa as well as international guests from britain sweden and the united states the energy during the weekend was electric as the congress marked impressive advances for the marxist movement in canada and quebec on the 100th anniversary of the founding of the third communist international the forces of marxism are on the march and putting revolutionary socialism back on the agenda the increase in attendance from last year was combined with a high level of political discussion new areas of work have developed most notably in alberta with preparations for an edmonton marxist summer school at the end of june more and more university campuses are forming socialist fightback student clubs most notably labour fightback is making serious inroads among the working class flying in the face of those who try to present marxism as something purely for students social polarisation worldwide the first session on saturday morning was led by fred weston editor of in defense of marxism on the world economic and political situation weston highlighted the pessimism of the ruling class from the head of the imf to top global economists who continually produce dire warnings about the coming of a deeper and more prolonged global recession than in 2008 weston explained how historic global debt and the rise of protectionism are the logical consequence of the shrinking world market with european countries entering economic and social crises as well as the growing indignation of workers in the united states the traditional pillars of western capitalism can no longer be relied upon to save the system china s role in cushioning the crisis of 2008 cannot be repeated since china itself is experiencing a dramatic slowdown in growth and buildup of debt all the typical schemes used to jumpstart the system from quantitative easing to deficit financing have been exhausted weston explained how social polarisation has spread through countries like france spain brazil south africa the united states and even boring old britain with mass shifts towards formations on the left and the right he explained how many of the traditional establishment parties including many social democratic parties have lost clout as their leaders desperately cling to a middle ground that no longer exists this is an expression of the hatred billions of people have towards the status quo the recent revolutions in sudan and algeria involving millions of people in the streets offer hope for the future as well as the massive shift to the left in the labour party in britain under jeremy corbyn the second session was held on canadian perspectives and presented by fightback editor alex grant grant explained that with oil prices at historic lows household debt at a record 170 of income and a growing housing bubble the contradictions in the canadian economy are coming to a head while canada may have been less affected than other countries after the 2008 collapse weak internal foundations make canada more susceptible to the coming world slump the international process of polarisation is hitting canada with the victories of right populist figures like francois legault in quebec doug ford in ontario and jason kenney in alberta but these reactionaries have a very weak base and are already sparking off a left wing backlash doug ford especially has no mandate for his austerity and this has led to mass demonstrations and opposition some on the left previously said that fightback s call to strike to bring down ford was unrealistic but now we see that thousands are calling for a general strike in ontario this shows the advantage of marxist foresight which is based on confidence in the potential of the working class to struggle unfortunately the union leadership is doing everything possible to put the brakes on that struggle the unifor leadership called off the fight to save gm oshawa for a measly 300 jobs on the political front the federal ndp under jagmeet singh constantly disappoints such as by failing to pick a side in important disputes like the lng pipeline in bc thereby alienating both sides there is growing anger in society which is desperately looking for an expression it is the task of marxists to intervene in the movements of the workers youth and oppressed pointing the way forward to socialist revolution indigenous struggle on sunday morning an important discussion was held on the indigenous struggle in canada led by fightback activist rob lyon lyon started by explaining the origins of indigenous peoples in north america dating back over 18 000 years he outlined the rich cultures economies and ways of life developed by the peoples of that period before it was cut across by the brutal genocidal interference of the european colonisers this brutal treatment of indigenous people was then continued by the canadian capitalist state taking on new forms over time but never subsiding the horrific living conditions for indigenous people today is reflected in shocking statistics with suicide rates incarceration and police brutality all at alarmingly high levels trudeau s talk of reconciliation between indigenous peoples and the canadian state has proven to be a sham despite making token gestures trudeau recently sent in the rcmp to brutalise indigenous land defenders in northern bc at the behest of a large gas corporation the response from the ndp has been tepid when jagmeet singh was asked on his opinion of the rcmp clampdown against the wet suwet en he couldn t offer a clear answer on sunday morning an important discussion was held on the indigenous struggle in canada as marxists we advocate for the right of indigenous people to decide their own fate image fightback the cruel oppression of indigenous people is a defining feature of canadian capitalism and is therefore of burning importance to marxists in canada it is preposterous to suggest as trudeau does that there can be reconciliation between indigenous people and the capitalist state that has held them down for centuries for many on the academic the left the solution has been decolonisation not in the sense of overthrowing the state but by decolonising language and attitudes as well as making tokenistic gestures numerous activists including indigenous members of fightback la riposte socialiste addressed these solutions pointing out similarities with trudeau s approach as well as the disconnect between the academic left and the actual demands of indigenous communities as marxists we advocate for the right of indigenous people to decide their own fate including the right to make decisions about where they live and how they govern themselves as well as advocating for an economic program that can provide indigenous communities with clean water good jobs and ample protection of their lands however this can only be accomplished with the overthrow of the canadian state in alliance with non indigenous workers while recognising that indigenous people suffer a far worse level of oppression than others in canada marxists disagree with the academic notion that non indigenous workers somehow benefit from this oppression both have a common enemy in the capitalist state and only through joint revolutionary action can this powerful enemy be taken down a draft discussion document on the fight against indigenous oppression was approved as part of an ongoing plan to produce a booklet or small book on the question in consultation with indigenous revolutionaries the involvement of an increasing number of indigenous activists with fightback will help to develop our approach from this historic starting point we hope to publish this work by the end of 2019 if not sooner and expect it to be an important addition to the wealth of marxist theory building the imt in canada on sunday afternoon fightback editor joel bergman gave a presentation on how to build the revolutionary organisation with labour struggles erupting across the country like at oshawa gm and with the cupw postal workers the post war social contract has met its end and the need to organise towards a general strike against tory leaders like doug ford and jason kenny is becoming ever clearer with labour leaders currently failing to lead a decisive fight there is a growing demand for militant revolutionary methods bergman explained the crucial role that fightback has played in the fight against doug ford s anti protest law and the role of revolutionary students in sparking off campus walkouts against education cuts fightback s worker and student activists intervened in oshawa gm and on the cupw picket lines in november helping with blockades and other actions on the front lines gm oshawa workers recently passed a resolution spearheaded by fightback activists to nationalise gm under workers control demonstrating that marxist methods are becoming popular and practical for many workers facing austerity this is in contrast to sceptics in the labour movement who have lost hope in the working class on monday morning fightback activist marissa olanick presented on revolutionary finances and the press she spoke about the importance of financial independence to maintaining political independence from the reformist organisations and social democratic parties she highlighted the significant advances made by fightback recently having hired new organisers rented a montreal office and moved la riposte socialiste to a monthly publication all in the last year the capitalists view finances from a profit driven perspective whereas the marxists view it as a political question building an apparatus for the purpose of overthrowing capitalism workers and youth are willing to contribute and make sacrifices for any worthwhile struggle and those who are not willing to engage in the difficult task of revolutionary financing will never be able to defeat the bosses and their state the imt boasts the most organised and largest revolutionary organisation in the country image fightback very successful socials were organised on both the saturday and sunday evenings on saturday evening a financial collection was taken which blasted through the target and raised over 50 per cent more than the 2018 collection this highlights the determination of our activists to do what is necessary to build the revolutionary organisation that the working class needs to overthrow capitalism optimism and commitment like this cannot be artificially generated it comes from a political understanding of the need to build a new society on sunday evening a talent show was arranged with various comrades entertaining the crowd with revolutionary songs poetry and comedy skits songs in french english spanish persian and other languages displayed the diverse backgrounds of the comrades all had a great time sharing experiences and lessons from all areas of the struggle the last session of the congress was a report on the activities international marxist tendency throughout 41 countries around the world fred weston also gave this presentation speaking from the experience of having travelled to assist our sister organisations reports on the activity of marxists from pakistan to south africa from brazil to france from australia to the united states were provided there was a clear perspective that our struggles in canada are intimately linked to the struggle to overthrow capitalism across the globe the comrades marked the end of the congress with a rendition of the internationale with francophone and anglophone comrades singing together followed by the italian revolutionary song bandiera rossa attendees left feeling energetic and hopeful about the very real possibilities opening up for the marxist movement in 2019 and beyond at a time when the left in canada and internationally is in confusion and decline the imt is growing and gaining historic achievements aside from being the most organised and largest revolutionary organisation in the country we are laying solid foundations for theoretical advancements on indigenous oppression and the fight in the labour movement as the late marxist ted grant used to say revolutionaries must have a sense of proportion and a sense of humour we understand that the movement is still in the early stages and our forces are still modest class struggle is beginning to boil to the surface in canada a global recession is looming which will bring forward all the contradictions in the canadian economy but we have built a strong youthful and energetic organisation with the most effective ideas in the struggle to end oppression and emancipate humanity marxist ideas the task of all those who attended the congress is to take the ideas methods and traditions of marxism to the picket lines protest movements and campuses our aim in the coming years is to make revolutionary marxism the decisive point of reference in every mass struggle of the working class and youth in canada this congress points the way forward to make that a reality

as far as we can tell alan greenspan was right only a single time after he took the helm of the fed in august 1987 that was when he flat out said that under the modern banking and financial system it is damn near impossible to measure money let alone track it by the week and month and make monetary policy based on pegging the growth rate of the money supply jeff snider has highlighted this point well in the graphic insert below but the second red bolded sentence cannot be repeated often enough said the maestro a decision to base policy on measures of money presupposes that we can locate money and that has become an increasingly dubious proposition peak trump the undrai david a stockman best price 12 72 buy new 43 07 as of 11 40 utc details note that these words were spoken on june 28 2000 in the very inner sanctum of the eccles building they were recorded word for word in the fomc meeting transcript and released with a ten year lag so as not to disturb the public with knowledge of what the nation s central bankers really thought at a moment which was pregnant with monetary and financial significance or any other time for that matter that is during the late 1990s the greenspan fed had fostered the monumental tech and dotcom bubble inflating the nasdaq 100 egregiously from an index level of 600 during march 1996 to 4700 on march 27 2000 needless to say that fake money based 675 gain was not destined to last in fact by april 14 just 14 trading days later the index had plunged by 32 to 3207 and then kept on keeping on ever lower until it finally touched bottom at 800 on october 8 2002 so those who rode the bubble from start to finish ended up where they started in inflation adjusted dollars while the speculators who jumped on along the way and the mullets who came aboard at the tippy top lost their lunch 85 of it from the march 27 2000 peak needless to say honest capital markets do not make the kind of violent round trip shown below in less than six years that can only happen when the equity markets are contaminated with bad money and when false credit and liquidity fostered by the central bank have overwhelmed the market s normal mechanisms of fact based price discovery two way trading and financial discipline owing to proper weighting of the risk of loss and cost of position carry in june 2000 you did not need to be clairvoyant about the remaining months of the cliff dive it was absolutely clear at the time that the stock market was rife with speculative mania and that the miracles of the computer age or no nothing could possibly justify the 675 gain in the nasdaq 100 index over the previous 48 months the market in june 2000 was a big fat june bug begging to encounter a windshield so greenspan s core recognition that the era of milton friedman s rule based fiat money growth was over and done should have given great pause to the denizens of the eccles building in fact it was either a call to go back to anchoring the dollar to gold from which it had been severed by tricky dick back in august 1971 at uncle milton s urgings or at least urgently suggestive of the need for an extended sabbatical on policy making at the fed until its members contemplated the paradox of conducting monetary policy without the medium of money yet if there was ever a road not taken this was the one with virtually no deliberations at all thereafter the greenspan fed simply abandoned money and wholeheartedly embraced economy so doing it fundamentally transformed the nation s central bank from an overseer of money and the banking system in which it was embedded into a keynesian monetary central planner at length its writ would extend across every asset class in the entire financial system as well as all the economic highways and byways of main street america stated differently at that ripe juncture of history the fed actually had a chance to declare victory and essentially go out of business that s because if there had ever been a need for a central bank the matter perturbing the maestro on june 28 2000 was actually evidence that one was no longer much needed that is the rise of technology and innovation in banking practices symbolized by the sweep account in the early 1990s meant that the ever resourceful operators of the banking system had found a way to essentially eliminate the need for reserves on checking accounts they did this by using technology to cycle non interest bearing checking accounts during the daylights hours to interest bearing time deposits at night presto the 10 reserve requirement for checking deposits at the daily measurement time was eliminated in turn that sharply diminished the need for commercial banks to hold vault cash or reserve deposits at their district federal reserve bank in order to comply with the age old regulatory regime that governed fractional reserve banking needless to say what the modern central bank does is print old fashioned money and its feedstock the former consists of currency via what are essentially subcontract orders for cash to the us treasury department under its state granted monopoly on legal tender and the latter consists of bank reserves which are confected out of thin air via open market operations under its statutory authority to manage the banking system taken together these central bank products are often referred to as high powered money as opposed to actual m1 money consisting of hand to hand currency in circulation and checkable deposit money at commercial banks but if suddenly required bank reserves and vault cash were in far lower demand in the banking system owing to the above referenced innovations exactly what were the printers of hand to hand currency and bank reserves domiciled in the eccles building to do with their time and statutory authorities indeed just in the previous six years fundamental trends in the banking system were making it abundantly clear that central banking in the historic sense of superintending money was going the way of the doo doo bird to wit the sum of vault cash and required reserves at the fed in the banking system in january 1994 had been 98 6 billion representing 2 94 of the banking system s total liabilities of 3 35 trillion by contrast as of june 2000 the sum of vault cash and bank reserves had dropped to 82 8 billion even as total banking system liabilities had soared by 68 to 5 64 trillion this meant that the reserve ratio in the banking system had been cut in half to just 1 47 in only six years moreover that was merely the acceleration of a trend that had been long underway back in 1973 vault cash and required reserved had totaled 39 billion which represented 6 0 of total bank liabilities at 646 billion the reason that required reserves were disappearing relative to the liability base of the banking system of course is that the mix of bank liabilities was steadily moving away from reservable checking money to other deposit and funding forms i e repo and commercial paper in turn that shift was owing to the fact that depositors wanted to earn interest on their money and competition and technology were making it ever more convenient and efficient for banks to meet these demands in fact there was really no need for traditional central banking by the year 2000 because its main product hand to hand currency was largely disappearing from the system owing to the convenience of payment by credit cards and checks indeed without various state driven incentives for the use of currency in the illegal underground evasion of high taxes illegal drugs and other social crimes and international smuggling there is actually no reason why currency couldn t have provided as a service in the form of commercial bank issued money as it had been until the federal government largely taxed it out of business after the civil war likewise there were always plenty of excess reserves at a price or market clearing interest rate sloshing around the banking system for the main form of modern money checkable deposits indeed in june 2000 required reserves against checkable deposit totaled only 38 billion or 0 6 of total bank liabilities and 0 37 of gdp which stood at 10 3 trillion in short financial evolution and technology had more or less eliminated the alleged need for traditional central banking if there was ever a moment when the once upon a time goldbug alan greenspan who had been put in charge of the central bank by our last goldbug president ronald reagan could have pointed out that cardinal fact and sought to steer policy toward a return to sound money that was the moment but june 2000 is also the point at which uncle milton friedman s baleful influence steered history in the exact wrong direction that s because friedman had been a closet keynesian all along he had erroneously claimed that gdp growth and prosperity were a function of money supply growth and that the change rate of the latter in turn could be managed to nearly the decimal point by the rate of growth in high powered money ladled out by the fed in fact that was nonsense heavily influenced by a completely erroneous interpretation of the causes of the great depression but suffice it to say here the velocity of money is far from constant meaning that you can t steer gdp growth with lockstep money growth nor is the money multiplier constant which means you can t steer money growth to the decimal point either yet it was the false friedmanite equation that money drives economy that led greenspan to his fatal error as we will explicate further in part 2 he simply jumped the shark of money and led the fed straight into the business of directly managing economy through the crude instrument of pegging the money market rate of interest at length of course pegging the money market rate was a horrible error because over time it was driven closer and closer to the zero bound by the eager beaver keynesians who steadily took over the fed so doing they thereby also steadily increased the incentive for carry trade speculation on wall street as well the great deformation david a stockman best price 2 00 buy new 9 95 as of 09 55 utc details still

the wall street gambling rot as has always occurred during financial panics of the pre fed era but it was not to be greenspan jumped the monetary shark and during the next four years drove the money market rate to 1 0 causing speculators to believe that they had died and gone to punters heaven in short order they ginned up the mortgage and credit bubble and we were off to the baleful era of

for the american ruling elite life has never been better the father of us treasury secretary steven mnuchin just completed the most expensive purchase of a living artist s work in us history spending over 91 million on a three foot tall metallic sculpture ken griffin the founder of hedge fund citadel recently dropped 238 million on a penthouse in new york city the most expensive us home ever purchased and amazon s jeff bezos the world s richest man has invested 42 million in a 10 000 year clock the stock market is booming and president donald trump is boasting at every turn that the unemployment rate is lower than it has been in five decades however the working class the vast majority of the population is confronting an unprecedented social economic health and psychological crisis the same processes that have produced vast sums of wealth for the ruling elite have left millions of workers on the brink of existence perhaps no segment of the population reflects the devastating consequences of these processes so starkly as the generation of young people deemed the millennials those born roughly between the years 1981 and 1996 more than half the 72 million american millennials are now in their 30s with the oldest turning 38 this year a recent exposé by the wall street journal noted that millennials are in worse financial shape than prior living generations and may not recover the article millennials near middle age in crisis concludes by stating that people born in the 1980s are at risk of becoming america s lost generation the older side of this generation was born at the beginning of the reagan years which heralded in an era of social counter revolution against the working class that saw the dismantling of much of the industrial infrastructure of the country and the restructuring of economic life to benefit the banks hedge funds and other financial firms with the collaboration of the trade unions by the time these youth reached the job market the 2008 financial crash hit vastly accelerating all of the processes begun in the 1980s the obama administration organized the bailout of the banks and a massive transfer of wealth from the working class to the rich the results have been devastating education more millennials have a college degree than any other generation of young adults in 2013 47 percent of 25 to 34 year olds received a postsecondary degree for most however getting a college education has not led to a significant increase in quality of living instead millions of young people are working jobs for which they are vastly overqualified and are shackled with unprecedented levels of debt for the millennials who did not go to college the situation is even worse millennials have taken on 300 percent more student debt than their parents generation the number of hours of minimum wage work needed to pay in state tuition and fees for each year of a four year public college for the baby boomer generation born between 1946 and 1964 was 510 for millennials it is 1996 since 2010 the economy has added 11 6 million jobs and 11 5 million of them have gone to workers with at least some college education in 2016 young workers with only a high school diploma had roughly triple the unemployment rate and three and a half times the poverty rate of college grads average college debt for millennials that have debt is around 33 000 with the median household income remaining the same since 1999 national college debt is now at 1 3 trillion and college tuition has increased by 1 140 percent since the late 1970s by 2014 48 percent of workers with bachelor s degrees are employed in jobs for which they re overqualified jobs and wages many millennials rely on what is referred to as the gig economy where workers often make minimum wage have no benefits or retirement plan and are forced to work two three or even four jobs to make ends meet this work is often paid by task assignment or sales and it requires only a short term relationship between the worker and the customer these include jobs like freelance work driving for uber sales on etsy renting out rooms on airbnb and other various temp jobs the number of workers in the united states participating in the gig economy is expected to triple to 42 million workers by 2020 and 42 percent of those people are likely to be millennials most young millennials have less than 1 000 in their savings accounts nearly half have nothing saved at all the share of millennials with 0 in savings is on the rise from 31 percent in 2016 to 46 percent in 2017 between 1978 and 2017 according to the epi ceo compensation rose in the us by 1 070 percent while the typical worker s compensation over these 39 years rose by a mere 11 2 percent the average net worth of a millennial household is about 40 percent less than gen x households born between 1965 and 1980 in 2001 adjusted for inflation and about 20 percent less than baby boomer households in 1989 the st louis fed recently found the median wealth of a family headed by someone born in the 1980s was a third below the level that they would expect compared with the earlier generation at the same age and adjusted for inflation one in 5 millennials are living in poverty housing between 2001 and 2014 the number of households spending over half their incomes on rent grew by more than 50 percent as housing prices have exploded the number of 30 to 34 year olds the older segment of millennials who own homes has plummeted millennials are half as likely to own a home as young adults were in 1975 in the 40 years leading up to the recession rents increased at more than twice the rate of incomes about one third of millennials owned homes in 2016 compared with half of gen xers at similar ages in 2001 and just under half of baby boomers in 1989 the share of american young adults living with their parents is the highest in 75 years andréa is a 25 year old non profit worker from california i didn t go to columbia or harvard i got a basic education i was responsible and stayed local to pay in state tuition now tens of thousands of dollars in debt the lowest my monthly bill can possibly be is 200 a month it has an impact on every decision i make any extra bill matters i can t think about buying a car or getting sick in the winter i had to go to the emergency room i spent no more than an hour in the er two months later i got a bill in the mail saying they were charging me 9 000 nowadays your money is split so many ways i feel like all my life decisions are made in the shadow of my debt it affects decisions about starting a family where and how to live i honestly feel that there is not really even room to dream of owning a home health and healthcare being poor in america is a clear predictor that the healthcare you receive will be far inferior to that of your wealthy counterparts the statistics on the access cost and quality of healthcare for millennials is above all an indictment of former president barack obama s signature domestic obamacare policy which further restructured the us healthcare system in the interests of big business one in 5 millennials say they cannot afford routine healthcare expenses many of these millennials are uninsured because of the cost an additional 26 percent say they can afford routine health care costs but only with difficulty based on a study of 55 million insured millennials by blue cross blue shield between 2014 and 2017 alone major depression rates increased by 31 percent rates of psychotic conditions increased by 15 percent and rates of substance use disorder rose by 10 percent a 2018 report from blue cross blue shield found that diagnoses of major depression had risen 47 percent for millennials since 2013 in 1980 4 out of 5 employees received health insurance through their jobs now just over half of them do suicide is now the second leading cause of death for those aged 10 to 34 the biggest increase in death rates came among the older millennial cohort from 25 to 34 millennials are reporting the highest levels of clinical anxiety stress and depression of any other generation at the same age emma is a 30 year old from massachusetts she is a college graduate who works as a singer and performer when something hurts or i am sick i wait a while and see if it will go away because i am scared to spend a bunch of money to see a doctor two summers ago i got pretty sick i ended up going to the doctor and had to spend 1 200 to treat strep throat it was a cost i couldn t afford at the time i was between two contracts with the same company because i was not under contract i was no longer something they needed to worry about i think for working class millennials it feels like your whole life is a constant crisis social patterns and societal milestones the precarious financial situation facing millennials has profoundly altered demographic and economic conditions for an entire generation which is expected to last through the end of the century men and women in their thirties are marrying at rates below every other generation on record millennials account for only 27 percent of new vehicles sold in the united states compared with 38 percent of new vehicles bought by gen xers at the same point in life it is predicted that most millennials will not be able to retire until age 75 millennials and the working class while the comparison between generations is useful in marking the significant decline in conditions for the working class as a whole it can give a distorted view of the real issues involved in this immense social crisis many mainstream media narratives obscuring the fundamental class issues attempt to pit generations against each other with headlines such as how the baby boomers wrecked the economy for millennials from vox or the coming generation war which recently ran in the atlantic however millennials as a generation are divided by class just as with all generations among the many historic milestones shattered by the millennial generation is also that of income inequality there is a significant layer of the millennial generation that has entered the ranks of the ultra rich in 2003 there were only 21 billionaires under 40 by 2017 the number had more than doubled to 46 the average wealth of young billionaires is also on the rise seven years ago the average young billionaire was worth 3 2 billion today the richest millennials are worth some 4 1 billion the conditions facing working class millennials are the same conditions facing the entire working class of which those in the millennial generation are a particularly vulnerable layer every age group of the working class has been deeply affected by the decline in living standards over the last forty years recent data shows that suicide deaths and other deaths of despair have increased most dramatically among those aged 45 to 64 largely generation x among those who are older including many baby boomers some 14 7 percent are said to be food insecure totaling at least 9 8 million people compared to 2001 this constitutes a rise of 37 percent with the number of seniors increasing in the same period 109 percent the younger generation has come of age in world of immense contradiction with enormous developments in technology and science while at the same time thrown into living conditions of the past more and more resembling the 1920s instability and uncertainty are among the defining features of everyday life most millennials are just one life event away from losing everything however these conditions have also created the objective basis for a vast radicalization of young people and workers across the globe the past two years have been marked by the reemergence of the class struggle internationally as the journal itself nervously points out the millennial generation is also the first generation to favor socialism to capitalism as poll after poll shows the popularity of socialism among young people is growing at a rapid pace far from becoming the lost generation predicted by the wall street journal this generation of workers carries within it an enormous source of revolutionary potential

more than 160 revolutionaries gathered in toronto may 18 20 for the 19th congress of fightback and la riposte socialiste the supporters of the international marxist tendency in canada the three day congress brought attendees from toronto montreal edmonton victoria waterloo hamilton ottawa oshawa as well as international guests from britain sweden and the united states the energy during the weekend was electric as the congress marked impressive advances for the marxist movement in canada and quebec on the 100th anniversary of the founding of the third communist international the forces of marxism are on the march and putting revolutionary socialism back on the agenda the increase in attendance from last year was combined with a high level of political discussion new areas of work have developed most notably in alberta with preparations for an edmonton marxist summer school at the end of june more and more university campuses are forming socialist fightback student clubs most notably labour fightback is making serious inroads among the working class flying in the face of those who try to present marxism as something purely for students social polarisation worldwide the first session on saturday morning was led by fred weston editor of in defense of marxism on the world economic and political situation weston highlighted the pessimism of the ruling class from the head of the imf to top global economists who continually produce dire warnings about the coming of a deeper and more prolonged global recession than in 2008 weston explained how historic global debt and the rise of protectionism are the logical consequence of the shrinking world market with european countries entering economic and social crises as well as the growing indignation of workers in the united states the traditional pillars of western capitalism can no longer be relied upon to save the system china s role in cushioning the crisis of 2008 cannot be repeated since china itself is experiencing a dramatic slowdown in growth and buildup of debt all the typical schemes used to jumpstart the system from quantitative easing to deficit financing have been exhausted weston explained how social polarisation has spread through countries like france spain brazil south africa the united states and even boring old britain with mass shifts towards formations on the left and the right he explained how many of the traditional establishment parties including many social democratic parties have lost clout as their leaders desperately cling to a middle ground that no longer exists this is an expression of the hatred billions of people have towards the status quo the recent revolutions in sudan and algeria involving millions of people in the streets offer hope for the future as well as the massive shift to the left in the labour party in britain under jeremy corbyn the second session was held on canadian perspectives and presented by fightback editor alex grant grant explained that with oil prices at historic lows household debt at a record 170 of income and a growing housing bubble the contradictions in the canadian economy are coming to a head while canada may have been less affected than other countries after the 2008 collapse weak internal foundations make canada more susceptible to the coming world slump the international process of polarisation is hitting canada with the victories of right populist figures like francois legault in quebec doug ford in ontario and jason kenney in alberta but these reactionaries have a very weak base and are already sparking off a left wing backlash doug ford especially has no mandate for his austerity and this has led to mass demonstrations and opposition some on the left previously said that fightback s call to strike to bring down ford was unrealistic but now we see that thousands are calling for a general strike in ontario this shows the advantage of marxist foresight which is based on confidence in the potential of the working class to struggle unfortunately the union leadership is doing everything possible to put the brakes on that struggle the unifor leadership called off the fight to save gm oshawa for a measly 300 jobs on the political front the federal ndp under jagmeet singh constantly disappoints such as by failing to pick a side in important disputes like the lng pipeline in bc thereby alienating both sides there is growing anger in society which is desperately looking for an expression it is the task of marxists to intervene in the movements of the workers youth and oppressed pointing the way forward to socialist revolution indigenous struggle on sunday morning an important discussion was held on the indigenous struggle in canada led by fightback activist rob lyon lyon started by explaining the origins of indigenous peoples in north america dating back over 18 000 years he outlined the rich cultures economies and ways of life developed by the peoples of that period before it was cut across by the brutal genocidal interference of the european colonisers this brutal treatment of indigenous people was then continued by the canadian capitalist state taking on new forms over time but never subsiding the horrific living conditions for indigenous people today is reflected in shocking statistics with suicide rates incarceration and police brutality all at alarmingly high levels trudeau s talk of reconciliation between indigenous peoples and the canadian state has proven to be a sham despite making token gestures trudeau recently sent in the rcmp to brutalise indigenous land defenders in northern bc at the behest of a large gas corporation the response from the ndp has been tepid when jagmeet singh was asked on his opinion of the rcmp clampdown against the wet suwet en he couldn t offer a clear answer on sunday morning an important discussion was held on the indigenous struggle in canada as marxists we advocate for the right of indigenous people to decide their own fate image fightback the cruel oppression of indigenous people is a defining feature of canadian capitalism and is therefore of burning importance to marxists in canada it is preposterous to suggest as trudeau does that there can be reconciliation between indigenous people and the capitalist state that has held them down for centuries for many on the academic the left the solution has been decolonisation not in the sense of overthrowing the state but by decolonising language and attitudes as well as making tokenistic gestures numerous activists including indigenous members of fightback la riposte socialiste addressed these solutions pointing out similarities with trudeau s approach as well as the disconnect between the academic left and the actual demands of indigenous communities as marxists we advocate for the right of indigenous people to decide their own fate including the right to make decisions about where they live and how they govern themselves as well as advocating for an economic program that can provide indigenous communities with clean water good jobs and ample protection of their lands however this can only be accomplished with the overthrow of the canadian state in alliance with non indigenous workers while recognising that indigenous people suffer a far worse level of oppression than others in canada marxists disagree with the academic notion that non indigenous workers somehow benefit from this oppression both have a common enemy in the capitalist state and only through joint revolutionary action can this powerful enemy be taken down a draft discussion document on the fight against indigenous oppression was approved as part of an ongoing plan to produce a booklet or small book on the question in consultation with indigenous revolutionaries the involvement of an increasing number of indigenous activists with fightback will help to develop our approach from this historic starting point we hope to publish this work by the end of 2019 if not sooner and expect it to be an important addition to the wealth of marxist theory building the imt in canada on sunday afternoon fightback editor joel bergman gave a presentation on how to build the revolutionary organisation with labour struggles erupting across the country like at oshawa gm and with the cupw postal workers the post war social contract has met its end and the need to organise towards a general strike against tory leaders like doug ford and jason kenny is becoming ever clearer with labour leaders currently failing to lead a decisive fight there is a growing demand for militant revolutionary methods bergman explained the crucial role that fightback has played in the fight against doug ford s anti protest law and the role of revolutionary students in sparking off campus walkouts against education cuts fightback s worker and student activists intervened in oshawa gm and on the cupw picket lines in november helping with blockades and other actions on the front lines gm oshawa workers recently passed a resolution spearheaded by fightback activists to nationalise gm under workers control demonstrating that marxist methods are becoming popular and practical for many workers facing austerity this is in contrast to sceptics in the labour movement who have lost hope in the working class on monday morning fightback activist marissa olanick presented on revolutionary finances and the press she spoke about the importance of financial independence to maintaining political independence from the reformist organisations and social democratic parties she highlighted the significant advances made by fightback recently having hired new organisers rented a montreal office and moved la riposte socialiste to a monthly publication all in the last year the capitalists view finances from a profit driven perspective whereas the marxists view it as a political question building an apparatus for the purpose of overthrowing capitalism workers and youth are willing to contribute and make sacrifices for any worthwhile struggle and those who are not willing to engage in the difficult task of revolutionary financing will never be able to defeat the bosses and their state the imt boasts the most organised and largest revolutionary organisation in the country image fightback very successful socials were organised on both the saturday and sunday evenings on saturday evening a financial collection was taken which blasted through the target and raised over 50 per cent more than the 2018 collection this highlights the determination of our activists to do what is necessary to build the revolutionary organisation that the working class needs to overthrow capitalism optimism and commitment like this cannot be artificially generated it comes from a political understanding of the need to build a new society on sunday evening a talent show was arranged with various comrades entertaining the crowd with revolutionary songs poetry and comedy skits songs in french english spanish persian and other languages displayed the diverse backgrounds of the comrades all had a great time sharing experiences and lessons from all areas of the struggle the last session of the congress was a report on the activities international marxist tendency throughout 41 countries around the world fred weston also gave this presentation speaking from the experience of having travelled to assist our sister organisations reports on the activity of marxists from pakistan to south africa from brazil to france from australia to the united states were provided there was a clear perspective that our struggles in canada are intimately linked to the struggle to overthrow capitalism across the globe the comrades marked the end of the congress with a rendition of the internationale with francophone and anglophone comrades singing together followed by the italian revolutionary song bandiera rossa attendees left feeling energetic and hopeful about the very real possibilities opening up for the marxist movement in 2019 and beyond at a time when the left in canada and internationally is in confusion and decline the imt is growing and gaining historic achievements aside from being the most organised and largest revolutionary organisation in the country we are laying solid foundations for theoretical advancements on indigenous oppression and the fight in the labour movement as the late marxist ted grant used to say revolutionaries must have a sense of proportion and a sense of humour we understand that the movement is still in the early stages and our forces are still modest class struggle is beginning to boil to the surface in canada a global recession is looming which will bring forward all the contradictions in the canadian economy but we have built a strong youthful and energetic organisation with the most effective ideas in the struggle to end oppression and emancipate humanity marxist ideas the task of all those who attended the congress is to take the ideas methods and traditions of marxism to the picket lines protest movements and campuses our aim in the coming years is to make revolutionary marxism the decisive point of reference in every mass struggle of the working class and youth in canada this congress points the way forward to make that a reality

president donald trump has heightened tensions with china by escalating his tariffs on 200 billion in chinese goods from 10 to 25 as a tool of national policy tariffs had long been fading into history a relic of the 19th and early 20th centuries that most experts came to see as harmful to all nations involved yet more than any other modern president trump has embraced tariffs as a punitive tool against europe canada and other key trading partners but especially against china the second largest economy after the u s the trump administration asserts and many independent analysts agree that beijing has deployed predatory tactics to try to give chinese companies an edge in such advanced technologies as artificial intelligence robotics and electric vehicles beijing s tactics the u s contends include hacking into u s companies computers to steal trade secrets forcing foreign companies to turn over sensitive technology in exchange for access to china s markets and unfairly subsidizing chinese companies trump has also complained angrily about america s gaping trade deficit with china for which he blames weak and naive negotiating by previous u s administrations last july trump began gradually imposing tariffs on chinese imports after friday s increase the administration is now imposing 25 tariffs on 250 billion in chinese goods beijing has counterpunched by taxing 110 billion of american products focusing on agricultural goods notably soybeans in a calculated effort to inflict pain on trump supporters in the farm belt a look at what tariffs are and how they work ___ what exactly are tariffs tariffs are a tax on imports they are typically charged as a percentage of the transaction price that a buyer pays a foreign seller to use a simplistic example ignoring real world minimum amounts subject to tariffs say an american retailer buys 100 garden umbrellas from china for 5 apiece 500 total and suppose the u s tariff rate for the umbrellas is 6 5 percent the retailer would have to pay a 32 50 tariff on the shipment thereby raising the total price from 500 to 532 50 in the united states tariffs sometimes also called duties or levies are collected by customs and border protection agents at 328 ports of entry across the country proceeds go to the treasury the tariff rates are published by the u s international trade commission in the harmonized tariff schedule which lists u s tariffs on everything from dried plantains 1 4 percent to parachutes 3 percent sometimes the u s will impose additional tariffs on imports that it determines are being sold at unfairly low prices or are being supported by foreign government subsidies ___ what are tariffs supposed to achieve two things increase government revenue and protect domestic industries from foreign competition before the federal income tax was established in 1913 tariffs were a big money raiser for washington from 1790 to 1860 tariffs produced 90 percent of federal revenue according to douglas irwin an economist at dartmouth college by contrast tariffs in recent years have accounted for only about 1 percent of federal revenue tariffs are meant to raise the price of imports or punish foreign countries for unfair trade practices like subsidizing their exporters and dumping their goods at unfairly low prices they discourage imports by making them costlier they also reduce pressure from foreign competition and make it easier for home grown companies to raise prices as global trade grew after world war ii tariffs fell out of favor the formation of the world trade organization and the forging of trade deals like the north american free trade agreement reduced or eliminated tariffs the average u s tariff is now one of the lowest in the world 1 6 percent the same as the european union s the pew research center reports ___ are tariffs a wise policy most economists say no tariffs raise the cost of imports for people and companies that need to buy them and by reducing competitive pressure they give u s producers leeway to raise prices too that s good for those producers but bad for almost everyone else rising costs especially hurt consumers and companies that rely on imported parts some u s companies that buy steel for example complain that trump s tariffs on imported steel leave them at a competitive disadvantage their foreign rivals can buy steel more cheaply and offer lower priced goods in 2002 president george w bush s administration placed tariffs on imported steel a study financed by steel consuming businesses found that the tariffs cost 200 000 american jobs that year more broadly trade restrictions make an economy less efficient with lesser competition from abroad domestic companies lose the incentive to increase efficiency or to focus on

the clash of civilizations has resurfaced albeit in a different form after chinese president xi jinping s remark during his keynote speech at the opening ceremony of the conference on dialogue of asian civilizations in beijing on may 15 it is foolish to believe that one s race and civilization are superior to others and it is disastrous to reshape or even replace other civilizations willfully the chinese leader said various civilizations are not destined to clash xi s remark resembles one by nobel laureate amartya sen who criticized the idea of a clash of civilizations a decade ago in his book identity and violence saying there is no need of clash of civilizations each of us has multiple identities and commitments and makes a compelling case for a peaceful co existence of diverse people the idea of such a clash dominated us foreign policy after harvard pundit samuel p huntington published an article titled the clash of civilizations in the summer issue vol 72 no 2 of foreign affairs in 1993 until the collapse of the soviet union world conflicts had been taking place between the ideological blocs of western capitalists and east european communists in the aftermath of the demise of the soviet union he predicted the great divisions among humankind and the dominating source of conflict will be cultural he added the clash of civilizations will dominate global politics the fault lines between civilizations will be the battle lines of the future the clash of civilizations became the gospel of neoconservative foreign policy after the terror attacks of september 11 2001 this resulted in the us invasions of iraq and afghanistan today amid the trade war between the us and china and the recent tension between the us and iran foreign policy analysts have started to anticipate a possible clash of civilizations again and suggest that humanity is at the brink of devastation an analysis that cannot entirely be discarded amid the trade war between the us and china and the recent tension between the us and iran foreign policy analysts have started to anticipate a possible clash of civilizations again and suggest that humanity is at the brink of devastation an analysis that cannot entirely be discarded about 20 years after the publication of huntington s original essay the foreign policy elites scholars opinion writers and journalists in western and non western countries have suggested that western civilization will be diminished instead of being able to withstand the clash between civilizations death of the west daniel lattier the decline of the west michel kimmage the collapse of western civilization erik m conway and naomi oreskes and crisis of civilization pepe escobar are a few entries in the long list of books articles and opinion pieces along this line in my view western civilization is neither in crisis nor collapsing on the contrary it is the deviation of the west from its stated values from which i take the liberty to coin abandonment of civilization by the west two factors played a very crucial role in relinquishing core values of the western civilization by the west itself on the external front the rise of asian countries notably china s economic military strategic and technological advancement and india s tremendous economic clout made the us perceive the potential adversaries who are non caucasian among internal factors are the economic recession started in 2008 the immigration crisis the crisis triggered by the free trade and economic globalization most important according to the 2010 population census in the us the birth rate of non whites exceeded that of white americans this indicates that by the time of the 2028 presidential election the number of new non white voters will surpass new white voters for the first time in us history besides the population projection suggests that the white population will be in the minority by 2045 in the us that means that by 2050 the white american domination in public policy will come to an end forever the population census of 2011 in the uk revealed a similar story the brexit slogans take back control and i want my country back in the uk and donald trump s make america great again and america first were products of the existential threat perceived by white supremacists on both sides of the atlantic not all of the brexit voters or those who voted for trump were poor or unemployed white people felt they were victims of policies on such issues as immigration free trade and economic globalization that were chiefly architected by the west their desperation and resentment triggered the renunciation of western civilization if as proposed by huntington civilization is a real entity based on certain indispensable core values and these values are known to be the soft power of the west they are rational thinking free market capitalism human rights democracy and the rule of law and rule based global governance scientific worldview pluralism and open society western civilization generally an anglo american civilization notably has been abandoning these core values and the west has been revoking the rules established by its own leaders throughout history let s assess each one very briefly first the us give up rational thinking after the 2016 presidential election the executive power of the us rests on morons and absurd people logic and rational thought have no place in the us for instance trump imposed tariffs on us 200 billion worth of chinese goods recently of course the us can import from other countries instead of china but it cannot improve its trade deficit figures either in the short or long run for two reasons first the high cost of production such as labor in the us as compared with china and other low cost manufacturing countries second re establishing the manufacturing plant within the us will take time second the us has renounced the free market capitalism that was a significant soft power to influence many countries for its part china has adopted the rules and institutions of global governance such as the world bank the international monetary fund and the world trade organization that the west architected immediately after world war ii china s future growth is unstoppable now the chinese president is the chief advocate of free market capitalism and anti protectionism and the us president is the chief advocate of protectionism and anti free trade in the world third the united states human rights record is worse than ever before the us has abandoned the idea of human rights the statement issued by trump over the killing of saudi journalist and washington post columnist jamal khashoggi is enough proof the us president loves money more than the core value of human rights the western countriesare supposed to have championed fourth the brexit chaos and trump s presidency are mockeries of democracy the us no longer can persuade non western societies of the merits of democracy fifth after the hawkish us national security adviser john bolton denounced the international criminal court icc and threatened to impose sanctions against the institution in his federalist speech in washington on september 10 2018 the us has relinquished another soft power of the west the rule of law bolton s speech was triggered by an icc investigation into alleged american war crimes in afghanistan he also decided to shut down the palestine liberation organization s office in washington because the plo called for an icc inquiry into human rights violations by israel sixth right after world war ii rules based global governance was started the world bank the imf the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt which became the wto in 1995 were created under american leadership however the us abandoned the trans pacific partnership tpp agreement in early 2017 in april 2017 it threatened to pull out of the north american free trade agreement if it was not renegotiated it has imposed tariffs on european japanese and chinese goods in violation of the rules set by the wto the us has not been willing to reform such global governance systems as the united nations world bank or imf china s belt and road initiative and asia infrastructure investment bank are the outcomes of america s refusal to reform these institutions seventh a scientific outlook toward the world as huntington claimed is another soft power of the west however the trump administration refuses to acknowledge that capitalist greed has triggered the climate crisis that is now at cataclysmic levels although the national climate assessment report has continuously pointed out the current and anticipated future impacts of climate change on the country the trump administration withdrew from the paris climate accord in 2018 last the myth of western pluralism and open society is now over after american british and australian polities relinquished them the issues of race immigration and xenophobia play central roles in social and economic policies in elections the border wall narratives and the miserable plight of central american migrants on the us mexico border indicate the derailment of pluralism in the us pluralism is the notion of accepting and embracing different people and their cultures beliefs and opinions within society for a good cause the white supremacists in the us and many other western countries have been giving up all the core values of the west for the final battle to maintain the dominance of the white race however if the us and rest of the west fail to uphold the western core values and accept the rise of asia particularly china and india the west will be confined solely to the two sides of the north atlantic very soon at this moment the us seems to be on a voyage aboard a wrecked ship on which the crew has neither a map nor a destiny the march of the us and the west will reach nowhere in the future on a voyage that relinquishes the destination the core values of western civilization
