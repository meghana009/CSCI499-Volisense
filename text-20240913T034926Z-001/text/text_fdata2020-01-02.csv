introduction governments across south asia face many challenges as they seek to improve the lives of the more than 1 8 billion people that live in the region increasing geopolitical competition especially between and among china russia and the united states is one factor that is affecting progress this great power competition including over the south china sea is intertwined with regional rivalries e g india and pakistan india and china and the united states and iran and has important economic military technological and environmental consequences energy is a key strategic sector in this competition as china pursues its expansive belt and road initiative bri infrastructure and trade vision russia uses arms sales and nuclear energy to expand its regional presence and the united states confronts iran and gears up its free and open indo pacific strategy and asia edge enhancing development and growth through energy initiative this issue brief considers the transformation of the electricity sector in bangladesh it is the fourth country analysis in the atlantic council s transforming the power sector in developing countries series this issue brief applies to bangladesh the analytical framework developed in the first report in the series which presents general challenges and strategic priorities for developing countries in the context of their implementation of electric power policies and reforms following the 2015 paris agreement on climate change bangladesh is a large population of 163 million poor nominal gross domestic product gdp per capita of 1 827 and developing country that has seen a steady gdp growth rate of between 6 and almost 8 percent since 2010 this growth has increased energy and electricity demand and placed pressure on domestic gas resources the development of a viable energy sector and expanding electricity access will be of critical importance to its goal of moving into the ranks of the middle income countries by 2021 but bangladesh has had a history of factious politics and the election year of 2018 saw mounting tensions after the arrest of bangladesh nationalist party bnp chairperson and former prime minister khaleda zia despite protests over election fraud sheikh hasina and her awami league party won a landslide victory in the december 2018 national election and now have an overwhelming majority in the parliament bangladesh also faces severe impacts from climate change including frequent flooding and salinity problems that are displacing a growing number of people from the country s huge ganges river delta and furthering the move to urban areas in 2018 bangladesh was hit by heavy monsoon rains which had an especially devasting impact on the thousands of rohingya refugees at the kutupalong refugee camp in cox s bazar kutupalong is reportedly the largest refugee camp in the world with more than 630 000 residents bangladesh signed and ratified the paris agreement in 2016 and has developed plans for increased mitigation and adaption activities this issue brief explores the linkages between geopolitics poverty and climate change as they relate to the transformation of the power sector and the following five key challenges critical challenges the energy sector is critical to bangladesh s progress in improving standards of living and achieving the united nations sustainable development goals sdgs in this issue brief we consider the five common challenges facing developing countries and their specifics in bangladesh these challenges are 1 meeting growing energy demand and moving to a cleaner energy mix 2 improving governance and transparency 3 increasing affordability and access 4 addressing environmental degradation and climate change and 5 achieving power sector financial viability meeting growing energy demand and moving to a cleaner energy mix developing countries are playing an increasingly important role in global energy markets in 2018 countries that are not part of the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd represented almost 60 percent of global primary energy consumption that share is expected to increase as these countries account for as much as 90 percent of future energy growth to 2040 bangladesh is an example of a country with rapid energy demand growth its primary energy consumption has grown at a rate of 6 4 percent over the 2007 2017 period in 2018 while gdp rose by 7 9 percent primary energy consumption increased by 8 6 percent over 2017 figure 1 shows the dominant position of gas and oil in bangladesh s primary energy mix although bangladesh has considerable domestic natural gas production crude oil production in 2018 was only 3 000 barrels per day b d or less than 2 percent of domestic oil consumption bangladesh has seen crude oil and refined product import costs rise from 3 1 billion or 7 percent of current account imports in fiscal year fy 2017 to 3 67 billion in fy2018 and an estimated 4 85 billion in fy2019 although bangladesh s gas production has increased from 19 3 bcm in 2010 to 27 5 bcm in 2018 consumption has grown from 16 6 bcm to 28 4 bcm over the same period in bangladesh demand for electricity has outpaced the growth in primary energy consumption electricity generation growth over the 2007 2017 period averaged a booming 9 percent although installed capacity has grown to about 21 419 megawatts mw in september 2019 bangladesh s peak electricity generation was only 10 958 mw in 2018 and fell short of the peak electricity demand of 14 014 mw resulting in outages and unserved demand the bangladesh revised master plan prepared by the japan international cooperation agency jica for the government of bangladesh in 2016 projects that electricity demand will more than double over the period to 2041 rising to 236 terawatt hours twh from the 2018 level of 79 twh this forecast is driven by the expectation of a large increase in industrial electricity consumption as shown in figure 2 although gas is the leading fuel for power generation in bangladesh figure 3 the country has significant oil fired capacity that its government added in the 2010 2012 period through contracts with private companies for quick fix rental units to meet the emergency electricity supply gap grid connected renewable generation is only at a very nascent stage this issue brief examines more closely the changing power mix in the strategic priorities section improving governance and transparency the management of the energy and electricity sector in bangladesh is highly centralized in the ministry of power energy and natural resources as well as several state owned corporations sheikh hasina holds this ministry portfolio and her energy adviser dr tawfiq e elahi chowdhury has been quite influential in policy decisions e g to pursue coal and gas imports and nuclear power unlike in pakistan which has major hydro resources the evolution of the energy institutions in bangladesh was different with both the early establishment of a ministry of power energy and mineral resources and the separation of water and power the bangladesh power development board bpdb was established in 1972 as the main body responsible for electric power under the ministry given the large rural population the bangladesh rural electrification board breb was created in 1977 with assistance from the us agency for international development usaid and the us rural electric cooperative system model was adopted partial system unbundling in 1995 led to the establishment of the power grid company of bangladesh in 1996 to manage the high voltage transmission system urban distribution operations are split between the bpdb and several public limited companies dhaka electric supply company ltd the dhaka power distribution company ltd the northern electric supply company ltd and the west zone power distribution company ltd a separate division of the ministry of energy oversees oil and gas while petrobangla established in 1974 is the main state oil and gas operator chevron under contract with petrobangla is the largest gas producer and has been working in bangladesh since 1989 when it was awarded contracts to develop the bibiyana jalalabad and moulavi bazar gas fields bangladesh has established two energy regulatory bodies the bangladesh energy regulatory commission established in 2003 to oversee tariffs and operations in electricity gas and oil and the sustainable and renewable energy development authority sreda established in 2014 to promote renewable energy and energy efficiency both bodies are strongly influenced by the ministry of energy and are working to develop their capabilities and increase their autonomy the ministry of energy has made some progress in increasing transparency of the sector and the government has been generally good at honoring its power purchase agreements with the private sector a major ministry digital media marketing program has started disseminating information about the sector to the public and a common web platform linked to social media sites integrates the various ministry websites increasing affordability and access bangladesh is among the top twenty access deficit countries according to the world bank s 2019 tracking sdg7 report however bangladesh is recognized as a leading developing country in improving access electricity access has increased from 55 percent in 2010 to 88 percent in 2017 with rural areas having 81 percent estimated access bangladeshi officials recently indicated that the overall electricity coverage rate has increased to 93 percent reducing the number of people without electricity to as low as 10 million compared with the 2017 estimate of 20 million the government of bangladesh seeks to achieve 100 percent coverage by 2021 this target is well in advance of sdg 7 which aspires to 100 percent electricity access by 2030 the breb started with about thirteen palli bidyut samities pbs or rural cooperatives as the population has grown the number of rural cooperatives has grown to eighty financial viability and losses have been a problem the world bank has helped breb reduce these losses lack of reliable power from the bpdb has restricted development at the same time the country through the quasi governmental infrastructure development company limited idcol has pursued solar home systems and micro grid programs to serve villages where the pbs system has yet to connect bangladesh is noteworthy in having the world s largest off grid solar program and has increased solar off grid access from 9 percent in 2016 to 14 percent in 2018 addressing environmental degradation and climate change the south asian region faces enormous environmental challenges due to its geographical and ecological situation and growing population and urban pressures bangladesh with its low lying coastal position and large dense population that is projected to grow to 202 million by 2050 has been especially vulnerable bangladesh is situated in the extensive riverine system of the brahmaputra jamuna ganges padma and the surma meghna systems and their many tributaries that occupy 79 percent of the country and flow into the massive delta in the south it relies heavily on irrigation and both diesel and electric pumps for its agricultural and urban economies bangladesh experiences regular flooding and cyclones with parts of the country flooding almost every year the german watch climate risk index ranked bangladesh sixth on its list of countries affected by climate change during 1997 2016 with 187 severe climate events inflicting estimated losses of 2 3 billion although bangladesh experiences these damaging climate events it produces minimal amounts of co2 emissions bp estimates bangladesh s co2 energy emissions in 2018 at 90 4 metric tons mt or only 0 3 percent of global energy related co2 emissions despite its very low overall as well as per capita level of emissions bangladesh did put forward in its 2015 intended national determined contribution indc an unconditional contribution target of 222 mt for power transport and industry in 2030 compared with a business as usual bau projection of 234 mt the power sector component of this unconditional scenario totals 86 mt in 2030 or a 5 percent reduction from the bau number and the 2011 base of 21 mt with external assistance the conditional target in power drops to 75 mt an 18 percent reduction from the base but this scenario still sees power sector emissions growing by 257 percent over the 2011 2030 period we conclude that even meeting the relative reduction targets will require major changes in strategy which will be discussed later in this document achieving power sector financial viability like many other developing countries bangladesh struggles with cost recovery in the power sector inadequate revenue generation by the distribution companies has created difficulties for the bpdb and the government which has had to cover the losses to maintain payments to the private generators especially the rental oil units the gap between total revenues and operating expenses of the bpdb has however narrowed as shown in figure 4 the overall net bpdb loss in fy2016 17 was reported as 44 348 900 000 bangladeshi taka about 528 million which was somewhat less than in the previous year purchases of power from non bpdb domestic generators and from india constituted the largest portion of the bpdb s expenses about 75 percent with purchases from independent power producers ipps representing the largest share of these expenses 27 percent the bpdb s financial position was helped in fy2016 17 by a 23 percent increase in revenue collections and a reduction in distribution system losses from 11 percent to 9 percent increasing revenue generation while ensuring affordability for the poor is a huge challenge but it is critical to mobilizing the resources needed to invest in the expansion and modernization of the distribution system to meet the rapid demand growth the world bank has estimated the cost to bangladesh s economy of the subsidies and weak management performance in the power sector to be about 11 2 billion in fy2016 or 5 percent of gdp in large part due to underpricing of domestic gas direct subsidies are provided to both electricity consumers and electricity generators from the bpdb gas is primarily used in power generation where it provides almost 60 percent of electricity generation domestic gas is underpriced for power generators compared to the opportunity costs a second world bank study concludes ncreasing the 2018 price of domestically produced natural gas to import parity so that the weighted average price equals the import price of lng 8 51 gj would result in almost 7 billion of additional government revenue as bangladesh increases its liquefied natural gas lng imports the weighted average price will increase the government has recognized the need to increase gas prices and the regulator in july 2019 raised the average consumer price by 32 8 percent with the power sector receiving a 40 percent increase strategic priorities the government of bangladesh in grappling with the above challenges has had to make a number of strategic choices that have important long term political economic and environmental consequences these choices have been influenced by both external and domestic factors and interests this section describes some of these choices and suggests possible ways to improve the policy institutional and market framework creating a sound policy legal and regulatory environment strategic priority the government of bangladesh needs to take a hard look at its current energy policies and power market design it should consider how to introduce more competition in the market reduce subsidies improve efficiencies in the state companies strengthen the role and competence of energy regulators and develop a more attractive environment for private investment particularly in domestic gas development and renewable energy discussion the government of bangladesh has received myriad advice from other governments and international financial institutions on its energy approach in the power sector a major influence has come from japanese advisers who played a significant role in developing the revised power sector master plan of 2016 there is reason however given the strong interest of japanese companies in exporting coal plants to question one of its central premises i e coal will be the cheapest primary energy now and in the future a comprehensive analysis of the full costs and benefits of this strategic priority needs to be conducted along with a realistic assessment of viable alternatives as discussed below bangladesh has significant renewable energy resources and its proven natural gas reserves are estimated at 7 3 trillion cubic feet mobilizing private investment in both these resource options should be a high priority increasing private investor access to domestic gas fields as well as offshore areas along with domestic gas well head price reform would be important steps reduced losses and full cost recovery of electricity retail prices together with improved access to land would reduce investor risks in renewable energy projects with the increases in renewable energy the greater complexity in the system with the addition of nuclear and coal and the large investment requirements to meet electricity needs the role of the energy regulator will be of even greater importance to furthering transparency ensuring that accounting systems meet acceptable standards rationalizing tariffs and moving to full cost recovery implementing effective licensing systems and formulating new market designs and market monitoring systems the government should provide the resources necessary to strengthen both nerc and sreda and ensure they are independent adequately staffed and receive opportunities for professional development developing efficient institutional and market structures strategic priority the single buyer with independent power generation system needs further reform and privatization to create a more competitive market environment discussion the bpdb is the single buyer in bangladesh s power system it buys power from the generators and sells it to urban distribution companies and the breb cooperatives but bpdb has not been able to pass on the full price of power to the distribution entities with population and income growth breb consumption has grown to more than 42 percent of total electricity sales to distribution to improve local supply the breb has been permitted to develop small ipps in its service areas at least twelve units totaling 225 mw with capacity between 11 and 33 mw each are in operation a key element of the bangladeshi government s overall economic strategy is the creation of special economic zones over the next fifteen years as many as 100 zones are envisioned the bangladesh economic zone authority beza has approved thirty seven zones with eight export zones already in operation companies from countries with strong government support especially china japan and south korea are negotiating deals to establish industrial plants in these zones these economic developments and the growth in incomes and urbanization require a comprehensive review of the electricity market design that bangladesh will need in the future given the investment requirements opportunities should be pursued for private investors to participate both in urban distribution companies and in these new economic zones including the building of grid interactive mini grids and generation plants achieving a cleaner and resilient generation mix strategic priority bangladesh should continue to diversify its electricity mix but reorient its strategy to give priority to lower carbon sources and away from oil and coal by focusing on gas renewables and increased energy efficiency given the growing demand for gas and potential for declines in major gas fields high priority should be given to increasing onshore and offshore gas exploration and development including through the increase in the well head price of gas given the declining costs of renewables and its favorable solar resources bangladesh should also reexamine considering the new world bank solar park model its grid based renewable targets and how mini grids and distributed solar power systems can play a larger role in its future mix discussion with current installed capacity at about 21 419 mw the bpdb seeks to reach 24 000 mw by 2021 40 000 mw by 2030 and 60 000 mw by 2041 bangladesh has had difficulty in meeting peak electricity demand which reached 14 796 mw on may 29 2019 against generation of 12 893 mw peak demand was more than 3 500 mw higher than the recorded level of 11 387 mw on july 18 2018 below is a discussion of the various strategic options for meeting the increases in electricity demand natural gas bangladesh s domestic onshore gas fields have long been the main source of gas for the power and industrial sectors gas production has increased at an average rate of 5 7 percent over the 2007 2017 period and 3 2 percent in the 2017 2018 year chevron s three fields have supplied about 58 percent of the production after considering the sale of its gas assets in 2017 to chinese investors chevron decided to remain in bangladesh and invest in maintaining production in april 2019 the company was awarded rights to explore block 9 an onshore area east of dhaka near the bakhrabad gas field this award is hopefully a sign that the government will begin to open other onshore areas to foreign investors that can make the needed investment but there is concern about the potential decline in production from chevron s bibiyana and several petrobangla fields in the future the government s efforts to attract companies in expensive offshore exploration has been unsuccessful a new model production sharing agreement with improved prices and allowance for exports has been prepared but auctions for new blocks have not yet occurred these factors in the face of the 6 4 percent growth in gas demand have led the government to pursue imported lng to both meet new requirements and reduce dependence on fuel oil and high speed diesel units which represents about 30 percent of installed electricity generation capacity and have been a major drain on the government budget since electricity retail prices do not cover these costs bangladesh joined the ranks of lng importers in 2018 with the connection of a floating storage regasification unit fsru moored at moheshkhali island near chittagong with a capacity of 3 75 million tonnes per annum mmtpa as with pakistan s first import facility us company excelerate energy with partial funding from the international finance corporation ifc and a fifteen year terminal fee agreement with petrobangla supplied the fsru which began regasifying the first qatar lng on august 12 2018 but inadequate pipeline capacity initially limited output and a 30 kilometer km pipeline is being built between anwara and fouzdarhat petrobangla has entered into a fiften year contract with qatar s rasgas for 2 5 mmtpa in addition oman trading international began deliveries to the excelerate energy fsru in january 2019 under a ten year contract for 1 million tons the international gas union igu reports that bangladesh imported 0 7 million metric tons mmt in 2018 in late november 2019 the first shipment of russian lng reached the summit lng terminal in bangladesh bangladesh plans additional lng import capacity to meet the needs of large new gas combined cycle generation plants in march 2018 a 3 billion project between summit power and mitsubishi subsidiary diamond gas was announced for a two 1 200 mw unit plant based on imported lng the japanese company jera has also taken a stake in the power project bangladesh s second fsru arrived in april 2019 with qatar lng under the agreement between summit lng terminal and excelerate energy while these first two fsrus have been installed relatively quickly despite some issues with rough waters during the monsoon season exxonmobil qatar petroleum and twelve other firms have expressed an interest in building bangladesh s first onshore lng regasification terminal with a larger 7 5 mmtpa capacity this strong private sector interest has spurred the government to approve a new policy to allow private companies to import lng while limiting their sales to the state company petrobangla at the same time petrobangla is reported to be talking with chinese and indian companies about building a 7 5 mmtpa onshore lng terminal in cox s bazar as of this writing bangladesh had just announced an agreement between the bpdb and the saudi private power company acwa power for a 3 600 mw gas to power complex including an lng import facility coal bangladesh s master plan envisions coal providing 40 percent of power generation in the high demand case and 34 percent in the low demand case by 2030 with indian chinese japanese and possibly south korean financing power plants using imported coal are under construction at rampal 1 320 mw and at payra 1 320 mw in southern bangladesh and a large 1 3 gigawatt gw coal facility has been proposed for moheshkhali island in cox s bazar district although this may be developed as a gas complex there have been both local and international protests against these coal plants a draft decision memorandum for review by unesco s world heritage committee advised the government of bangladesh to cease development of the power plant until a strategic environmental assessment could be undertaken as well as place the sundarbans the largest mangrove forest in the world where the rampal plant is being built on a list of natural sites that are in danger the decision to place the site on the endangered list was postponed to 2020 in addition to these imported coal projects there have been proposals for the development of a large open pit coal mine in the phulbari region in the northeast of the country there have been local protests against this project due to concerns over potential destruction of agricultural land and displacement of indigenous communities the government had suspended plans for the project but in early 2019 chinese interests were pursuing projects both in phulbari and in dinajpur an agreement was reportedly signed between gcm resources with the chinese company powerchina for a 4 billion domestic coal mine power project in dinajpur district in northwest bangladesh the bangladeshi decision to start developing a greenfield coal power capacity raises serious questions about economic as well as environmental sustainability these investments are creating long term external financial dependence as well as raising concerns as to the possibility that these plants may become economically unviable as the costs of alternatives falls and climate costs rise nuclear bangladesh has been caught up in the aggressive russian nuclear export drive that together with its military sales has expanded russian influence in both the middle east and south asia russia with its long standing political military and energy relationships with bangladesh has been pursuing a nuclear export project since 2009 in late 2015 russia concluded a twenty eight year ten years grace 11 38 billion state loan at a favorable rate of libor plus 1 75 percent for two generation iii vver 1200 reactors at rooppur 87 miles west of dhaka bangladesh is to provide 10 percent of the project costs construction started in late 2017 and the first unit is planned for completion in 2023 with a second unit one year later russia is working with india on similar units and india is training bangladeshi operators indian architectural and engineering a e companies are engaged in some of the civil works for the units in bangladesh russia is pursuing a long term build own operate boo approach in some of its export deals but it is reported that rosatom the russian state atomic energy corporation will operate the rooppur plant for only the first year nuclear power is projected in the bangladesh revised power sector master plan to account for about 4 percent of electricity generation in 2030 given the current us strategic paradigm focusing on great power competition there is concern in the trump administration and congress over russia s nuclear power exports and the implications of the long term dependency this is creating in countries like egypt turkey and now bangladesh security and safety issues for a nuclear start up program are significant even though bangladesh unlike pakistan and india has signed the nuclear non proliferation treaty npt and is a member of the international atomic energy agency iaea despite the iaea s technical assistance to the bangladesh nuclear regulatory commission in reviewing nuclear laws preparing for adhering to international legal instruments developing and reviewing regulations assessing sites and developing a radioactive waste management system transparency concerns exist based on experience with other rosatom projects for example the full cost of the project is not clear based on reported loan amounts it is reasonable to estimate that this cost will be at least 5 000 per installed kilowatt kw suggesting a relatively high levelized cost of electricity lcoe renewables bangladesh has begun to take a greater interest in renewable generation but it has experienced difficulties in pursuing large renewable energy projects for electricity grid connection unlike for off grid applications bangladesh s vision 2021 proposes a 10 percent renewable target in 2021 2 000 mw out of 20 000 mw forecasted and its recent renewable energy development targets call for 2 458 mw of renewable energy capacity to be installed by 2021 most of the new capacity is planned from solar 1 270 mw or 52 percent and wind 1 150 mw or 47 percent and there are also targets for biomass 30 mw biogas 2 mw and small hydro 6 mw the world bank notes that there have to date been no utility scale wind projects and the largest solar project is the 28 mw teknaf photovoltaic project in the cox s bazar region which became operational in september 2018 access to land has been a major factor holding up new projects but in march 2019 the world bank approved an 185 million loan to the government of bangladesh for the first 50 mw phase of a 310 mw solar park in feni district in the southeast in the administrative district of chittagong which will be implemented by the electricity generation company of bangladesh an enterprise of the bpdb world bank officials indicate that this project will require building of dikes and elevation of the photovoltaic modules to prevent flooding thereby increasing costs an alternative expansion scenario bangladesh can move towards a more sustainable lower carbon future by limiting coal development installing efficient natural gas expanding renewables and improving end use energy efficiency figure 5 presents an alternative energy efficiency low carbon case compared to the modified case in the master plan that projects installed capacity growing from the current 20 gw to 40 gw in 2030 and 60 gw in 2040 in the master plan fossil fuel continues to provide more than 80 percent of the fuel for power generation the author s alternative scenario projects a 20 percent lower demand case with an aggressive renewable energy growth to 22 percent in 2030 and 30 percent in 2040 with reduced coal capacity and a doubling of gas capacity by 2040 even in this case fossil fuels still account for more than 60 percent of total installed generation but carbon emissions will be considerably lower given the increase in renewables nuclear hydro imports and less carbon intensive gas generation recent assessments have raised the prospect of lower capacity additional requirements in the future given the many current plants in the pipeline a high level committee reporting to the power cell of the ministry of energy has concluded that the requirement in 2030 with planned plants and improved efficiency would be 29 619 mw a pause in new approval by the bpdb has been debated expanding electricity access to poor and rural areas strategic priority the government of bangladesh should seek to facilitate even faster private deployment of solar power systems in rural areas building on idcol s experience but working with private banks to develop project aggregation mechanisms for the financing of mini grids for communities and with reb cooperatives on system integration discussion bangladesh has followed the us electric cooperative model and with usaid nreca assistance over several decades has developed a system under the breb which has grown to eighty pbs rural cooperatives covering 460 upazillas and serving 66 087 villages with more than 30 million residents as the government has built out the breb and urban distribution grids it has also given support to off grid solar systems more than 4 million solar home systems shs have been installed in bangladesh and private companies like solaric with some commercial financing have advanced to developing small nano grids in rural villages although most of the shs have been financed under idcol s donor supported programs with private providers the breb has begun to support installation of shs solar irrigation systems rooftop solar and some mini grids and conducted training for more than 1 000 technicians idcol and the breb have developed a memorandum of understanding on selection and approval of sites for mini grids at least twenty five idcol mini grids have been approved 4 69 mw and ten are operational idcol was targeting fifty mini grids by 2018 the breb irrigation tariffs are lower than the costs from solar irrigation systems but the solar power systems can compete with diesel gensets idcol had a target of 1 550 solar irrigation pumps by 2018 despite the successes and estimated savings of more than 400 million from shs substitution for kerosene in bangladesh the rapid expansion of shs sales and providers has given rise to problems due to the growth of unregulated entrepreneurs selling cheaper but poor quality systems as well as the rapid extension of breb grid programs and the use of social safety net funds to subsidize low income consumers high priority should be placed on maintaining high standards as well as good cost recovery in order to continue the scale up of system deployment and encourage greater interest by local banks collaborating with neighbors on regional electricity and gas networks and markets strategic priority bangladesh should continue to diversify its electricity imports from india nepal and bhutan as part of an effort to promote peaceful relationships that advance economic development bangladesh should give priority to hydro based imports and avoid dependence on electricity from indian coal generation plants discussion regional energy cooperation has been difficult in south asia but bangladesh and india have been working on forging electricity links for more than six years bangladesh imported about 8 percent of its power from india in 2016 2017 over the 500 kilovolt kv high voltage direct current hvdc line which was put into service in october 2013 as the first international transmission line in south asia it was funded by the asian development bank there are plans to expand its capacity by 900 mw by 2021 the adani group has announced plans to build a 1 600 mw coal plant in india to sell power to bangladesh bangladesh is also pursuing increased imports from hydro facilities in bhutan and nepal and forecasting steadily increasing imports of 1 200 mw by 2020 2 500 mw by 2025 and 5 000 mw by 2030 an ambitious scheme proposes to build a 5 000 mw transmission grid connecting india s northeastern states to the mainland through bangladesh in return bangladesh would get 20 percent of the electricity bangladesh is investing in the 1 125 mw kuri gongri hydro plant in bhutan along with india and nepal and looking to participate in other hydro projects bangladesh is looking to import power from the upper kamali 900 mw hydro plant being built by the gmr group of india in nepal with myanmar s huge hydro resources and prospective offshore natural gas resources it may also be a potential source of electricity and or possibly gas in the coming decades in september 2018 total announced the successful appraisal of myanmar s shwe yee htun 2 offshore gas field with a preliminary reserve estimate of 2 3 trillion cubic feet attracting domestic and international investment and financing strategic priority besides the institutional and regulatory reforms discussed above bangladesh needs to focus on maximizing private investment in the sector and be especially careful as it deals with the pressures to add new generation capacity about assuming external loans from china and other state sources that put unsustainable debt pressure on its fiscal system the gas and renewable energy sub sectors should be given highest priority since they are both economically viable and can attract private equity and debt financing reducing the public debt burden with growing energy demands from rapid urbanization greater attention should be given to improving energy efficiency especially through building envelope appliance and hvac heating ventilation air conditioning system standards and incentives for building owners to invest in modern energy management systems improvement in the transparency professional capability and credibility of the national energy regulators will be increasingly important for attracting transparent and sustainable financial investments in the sector discussion despite the domestic political risks bangladesh s state minister for power energy and mineral resources nasrul hamid said on october 17 2019 that power investment in bangladesh had reached 22 billion bangladesh is looking to a wide range of investment options to meet future requirements including green bonds and capital from insurers and pension funds as well as sovereign wealth funds bangladesh s central bank has been very active in pursuing these options with the ifc adb and other international financial institutions it is even considering deploying foreign exchange reserves to support domestic bond issuances an important issue is the role of china with its large infrastructure financing under the bri of which bangladesh is a signatory while criticism of debt trap diplomacy has been especially aimed at the huge 62 billion bri program in pakistan china has also pledged 26 billion for bri infrastructure projects in bangladesh but unlike in pakistan chinese lending for energy in bangladesh appears to be a much smaller but not insignificant share of the overall package and the debt implications not as severe although bangladesh s external borrowing for domestic energy infrastructure projects is expected to increase external debt which was estimated by the imf at 35 billion at the end of fy2017 or 14 3 percent of gdp the imf debt sustainability analysis designates bangladesh as a medium performer and concludes that the risk of external debt stress is low as indicated above bangladesh has in its coal expansion strategy turned to china and also japan for financing the overseas development institute s recent report on group of twenty g20 coal subsidies estimates that china and japan accounted for 87 percent of the g20 countries 16 billion in average annual public financing for coal projects in 2016 2017 nearly half of their 14 6 billion in coal financing went to pakistan and bangladesh in these years with pakistan receiving 3 975 billion from china and bangladesh obtaining 1 650 billion from china and 1 207 billion from japan as noted above the chinese are supporting a new 2 000 mw coal plant in bangladesh that will use domestic coal with a potential expansion to 6 000 mw officials from the world bank and other financial institutions have increasingly expressed concern over the economic sustainability of these coal projects and the financial risks to the government as witnessed in bangladesh government s prior experience with the imported oil rental plants these projects are according to a senior bangladeshi official likely to have an lcoe of around 8 cents per kwh which may be higher than future gas and renewable costs there are however recent signs that chinese companies are pursuing projects in renewable energy in august 2019 reuters reported that the china national machinery import and export company cmc had entered into a joint venture with bangladesh s north west power generation company to implement 500 mw of renewable energy capacity through an estimated investment of 400 million the competition among sources will be strongly influenced by the domestic gas pricing policy as bangladesh ramps up its lng and coal imports the government in july 2019 increased domestic gas prices by a weighted average of 32 8 percent to take into account the higher lng gas prices compared with subsidized domestic prices s p global platts reports that while this action will help the financial position of petrobangla it will negatively affect textile and other key industries furthermore the government will still need to provide funding through the energy security fund and other subsidies to cover the full cost of the lng imports both the world bank and the adb now have lending policies that focus on lower carbon options recent world bank projects in bangladesh have focused on transmission improvement rural electrification and renewable energy i e the 156 million scaling up renewable energy project and the 155 million rural electrification and renewable energy development ii rered ii project the 450 million enhancement and strengthening of power transmission network in eastern region and the 59 million power system reliability and efficiency improvement project these projects help support policies to reduce losses increase electricity access and off grid solar applications and stimulate investment in grid connected renewable energy the adb has also been a major energy lender to bangladesh current adb projects in bangladesh include a 583 million debt and risk guarantee package for india s reliance power s lng terminal and a 750 mw gas combined cycle power plant south of chittagong which has an overall estimated cost of 1 billion loans totaling 616 million to enhance power transmission and distribution and 526 million in support for the third public private infrastructure development facility ppidf 3 which includes funding for renewable energy and idcol among bilateral donors usaid s energy program in bangladesh while not of the same magnitude as its past capital lending in rural electrification has focused on developing clean energy sources energy efficiency off grid solar systems and clean cooking programs usaid programs helped catalyze cooperation between bangladesh and india that led to the completion of the 500 kv transmission line mentioned above the overseas private investment corporation opic now known as the us international development finance corporation and the us trade and development agency have recently focused on working with us companies on lng and gas development lng and gas fired power generation have opened new opportunities for private sector investment general electric which has had a long presence bangladesh has developed new joint ventures with both summit power international from singapore which is the largest independent power producer in bangladesh and mitsubishi one project with summit is for the 583 mw gas combined cycle meghnaghat ii power plant near dhaka for operation by 2022 and the second project is with mitsubishi and summit for a 3 billion 2 400 mw thermal power and import terminal facility at matarbari on moheshkhali island conclusion the bangladeshi government s policies in the energy sector will be critical to the country s national security economic development and environmental sustainability energy demand in bangladesh has been booming and the country has become increasingly dependent on imported oil and recently gas and coal to sustain its economic growth although gas will remain the main source of power generation a more diversified mix is developing with coal nuclear and renewable energy foreign financing of more than 20 billion from china russia japan and india is expanding electricity capacity while the world bank and the adb have been supporting transmission and distribution projects there are clearly political economic and environmental risks in this heavy external dependence the chinese have increased their presence in bangladesh through the bri and financing for both imported and domestic coal projects russia is using military sales and nuclear and oil and gas project financing to augment its influence and create long term dependencies in contrast to this state driven financing and given a projected need for 70 billion in power investment by 2035 bangladesh should work on attracting increased private investment in the sector by improving its financial viability strengthening the regulatory framework and reforming its market structure priority should be given to gas and renewable generation and energy efficiency from an economic and environmental perspective to minimize debt and fiscal impacts and fulfill bangladesh s commitments under the paris agreement the potential for private investment in generation transmission and demand management should be fully pursued as the government proceeds with the implementation of its ambitious scheme to establish industrial and export zones the united states should increase its engagement with bangladesh under the free and open indo pacific strategy and asia edge initiative work with european countries and international financial institutions to promote clean energy options and raise concerns with china and japan over their continued financing of coal plants finally developing countries like bangladesh face enormous challenges in attaining the un sdgs approved by world leaders in late 2015 the energy sector is central to realizing these aspirations it is precisely for this reason that bangladesh and its supporters should chart a course that can lead to a more efficient clean and affordable power and energy system about the author

as the 2010s draw to a close the global economy is in a very different place at the decade s end than at its beginning many of the sociopolitical events that took place around the world were reflective of the financial world analysts say the election of donald trump in 2016 was the catalyst for significant change in the u s economy and the global economy but his rise was as much an effect of broader forces at work as it was a cause of these movements and moments that reshaped the economy over the last 10 years eurozone in crisis in the wake of the recession unsustainably high deficit and debt levels in several european countries led to a crisis requiring the intervention of third party financial institutions such as a 2012 bond buying program implemented by the european central bank to tamp down interest rates on sovereign debt which were rising as investor confidence shrank the crisis was most acutely felt in greece which had its bond rating slashed slashed to junk status after it was revealed that the government had seriously misrepresented its debt burden leaders agreed to sharp austerity measures in return for bailouts from the union and the international monetary fund in the subsequent backlash and public protests against greek austerity measures there was speculation that the country might leave the eurozone entirely some say these events were a precursor to and a catalyst of britain s 2016 vote to leave the eurozone brexit is kind of the natural outcome of when greece was basically held hostage said brad mcmillan chief investment officer at commonwealth financial network they were forced into a multi year depression in order to save the euro obviously brexit opens up the possibility more concretely that european countries can leave their union and i m sure that s going to have all kinds of ramifications said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics with nationalism growing in prominence he predicted that the eurozone will face a continuation of these challenges in the coming decade nationalism hits trade the 2010s were marked more broadly by a surge of populist and nationalist sentiment both in the u s and elsewhere around the world a sentiment that is fundamentally reshaping trade between countries and changing the calculus for multinational corporations we ve seen this rise of nationalism which is a political issue reshaping financial markets tremendously said joseph heider president of cirrus wealth management for roughly half a century business and industry labored to build manufacturing and production facilities and supply chains to take advantage of the availability of raw materials cheap labor and lax environmental regulations all in a relentless drive for efficiency now that commercial infrastructure is under strain trump s decision to pull the united states out of the trans pacific partnership and start a trade war with china is the most visible and consequential manifestation of this trend with his on again off again threats to impose tariffs on europe mexico and other trading partners a close second politics is now taking primacy over economics over the past several decades we ve been building an economically optimized world right now that is no longer the case mcmillan said political economy is now being prioritized over economic efficiency and that s something we haven t seen for decades that takes us back to the 50s fed intervenes to prop up the economy in the wake of the financial crisis the federal reserve initiated monetary policy with little precedent in modern times it held interest rates at zero for an extended period of time and undertook enormous quantitative easing programs to pump liquidity into financial markets the decade was really remarkable in the sense that for the first six years of the decade we had zero percent interest rates and for the first five years we had quantitative easing said dan north chief economist at euler hermes north america characterizing the central bank s activities as a wild monetary policy experiment some market observers defend the fed s interventionist streak particularly at the start of the decade with the financial crisis still fresh in people s minds the biggest thing in the last 10 years is the continuation of quantitative easing without quantitative easing i think everything would be drastically different way worse than things are now said mitchell goldberg president of clientfirst strategy in hindsight some question whether the fed was too accommodative a stance that could have ramifications for the next recession when the fed cut interest rates to the unprecedented level of zero to 0 25 percent nobody expected it was going to last the seven years that it did mcbride said we ve had way too much easy money for way too long and at some point it s going to come back and get us north said this leaves the fed with fewer tools at hand to boost the economy he said we re leaving very little room for the next recession tax cuts lead to buybacks republicans sweep of the 2016 election facilitated the passage of a massive corporate tax cut financial experts say the passage of the tax cuts and jobs act at the end of 2017 had positive results initially but those short term gains could come at the cost of long term pain trump got elected and went on a path of reducing regulation north said i think honestly the reduction in regulation has helped the economy and i think the tax cut helped the economy as well he said but he added that since economic growth fell far short of republicans forecasts the stimulative effects of the tax cut have faded and the national debt has ballooned a risky combination it s putting america on a less stable financial future because of the structure of this unfunded non sustainable tax cut crowley said proponents of the the tax cuts predicted that companies would spend their windfalls expanding and investing in production facilities technology and human capital instead the cuts spurred a wave of corporate stock buybacks which helped propel the market to new record highs but also potentially limited the broader impact the tax cuts were intended to have it s in part a reflection of the fact that there may be in some sectors more than others limited investment or acquisition opportunities or a lack of appealing valuations on those that make a buyback a more palatable way to boost earnings per share said greg mcbride chief financial analyst at bankrate com every dollar that s going into buybacks is a dollar that s not being used for another form of expansion he said share repurchases have also contributed to stock valuation gains but investing experts warn that this inflation can distort markets more dollars chasing fewer stocks because of all the buybacks isn t something you want long term investors to hang their hat on said john lynch chief investment strategist at lpl financial stock market highs the increase in buybacks is one factor that has contributed to the record long bull market a meteoric rise virtually no one would have predicted 10 years ago when 2010 began the stock market had already begun the long climb out of its recession era hole but the mood was still pessimistic the decade started off very ominously zandi said we began the decade not knowing that the crisis was over we d just suffered the worst economic downturn since the 1930s depression the recession was over officially by june 2009 but it wasn t quite clear that we were out of it since then of course stocks have smashed through one record high after another with valuations boosted by both monetary and fiscal policy mcbride said the fed s trio of rate cuts in 2019 reversed the correction that took place at the end of last year sustaining the bull market for a record setting 10th year that helped cushion the broader economy but it s also helped juiced the equity markets lower interest rates make other investments less appealing he said that enhances the appeal of equities relative to bonds or cash
a harsh economic collapse at the heart of the tumultuous middle east would hurt lebanon s poorest most at a time when public opinion is already enraged by perceived corruption and cronyism it will be very very hard says sibylle rizk public policy director at kulluna irada a lobby group and the possibility of violence and social unrest is high with its nearly 7m population of christians and sunni and shia muslims including over 1m refugees lebanon is surrounded by trouble civil war has raged in next door syria since 2011 and tensions with neighbouring israel are continuous iran backed shia islamist paramilitary and political party hizbollah seen by many lebanese as a defender against israel but viewed by washington as a terrorist group now forms an integral part of lebanon s government souring relations with gulf countries that were once lebanon s sponsors yet even amid these tensions beirut s high life yacht friendly marina and banking secrecy made it a playground for the middle east s wealthy the central bank borrowed from lebanese commercial banks who borrowed from their clients lenders could generate profits at very low risk says nasser saidi a former central bank vice governor for each bank it looked like this was paradise the banks deposits with the central bank grew by over 70 per cent from 2017 to august 2019 to 229 trillion lebanese lira 214 billion for some observers the numbers did not add up what could the central bank be investing in to pay those rates says mr saidi but as banks paid out dividends to shareholders many of whom were politicians lebanon s political elites were happy to go along with it everybody got greedy shrugs one bank board member advertisement meanwhile politicians were spending the country deep into the red buying votes by expanding public hiring and wasting cash on unsustainable solutions for lebanon s chronically malfunctioning electricity sector while its trade deficit ballooned lebanon s biggest protests in a decade forced the resignation of prime minister saad al hariri s government at the end of october hassan diab a computer sciences professor appointed prime minister designate must now corral lebanon s multi confessional political parties shifting alliances between christian sunni and shia muslim factions into forming a cabinet to steer the country out of crisis amid the growing warnings about a looming default mr hariri had begun to beseech international allies for help and started talks with the imf the west has little interest in seeing this crucible of regional tensions explode the rise of iran backed hizbollah means it can no longer depend on gulf bailouts lebanese prime minister saad hariri resigned after widespread protests ap but while many capitals from paris to tehran want influence in the strategic mediterranean nation no state has so far offered to foot the bill asked whether an aid packaged was on the table david schenker the state department s assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs told the associated press lebanon is not being saved from its financial mess lebanon s drastic downturn came slowly then suddenly after months of economic slowdown and a dollar liquidity squeeze rampant wildfires erupted across the mountains in central lebanon unchecked in part because the state had failed to maintain expensive helicopters days later in an austerity measure to curb its deepening fiscal deficit politicians proposed taxing whatsapp calls lebanon snapped advertisement hundreds of thousands have demonstrated since mid october against political corruption bad governance poor infrastructure and economic unfairness beirut s downtown area where bank headquarters are concentrated has been filled with graffiti and tear gas this so called revolution took the lenders by surprise says riad obegi chairman and general manager of banque bemo a lebanese bank the disruption of the protests creates lack of confidence he adds which led to a rush of depositors trying to send money abroad but banks had put half of their assets in the central bank to earn high rates which meant that honouring the transfer requests would have gutted the country s reserves in october the country s banks which had managed to stay open during lebanon s bloody civil war closed for two weeks the union of banking workers said it was for safety economists suspected they were low on dollars and trying to avert a bank run but by closing argues mr saidi the banks themselves triggered panic while their informal capital restrictions generated an accusation that the big depositors were able to get out when they reopened guarded by soldiers clerks told panicked customers they could not send money abroad nor withdraw large sums in dollars we re all in it together bankers told clients but rumours swirled that the politically connected mega rich had already got their money out even as customers could withdraw only us200 per week in cash amid fears about whether their leaders can protect their savings many lebanese worry that the government might choose to prioritise foreign creditors who hold nearly us12 billion worth of lebanon s debt hassan diab must now corral lebanon s multi confessional political parties shifting alliances between christian sunni and shia muslim factions into forming a cabinet to steer the country out of crisis ap advertisement so far the central bank has managed to cover the government s repayments to its creditors who are mostly domestic banks however multiple downgrades of lebanon s sovereign debt in the past few months suggest time could be running out locking down lebanon s traditionally open economy with informal capital controls further discourages the all important inflow of dollars indeed the country had already been witnessing a net capital outflow since january 2018 according to goldman sachs research and it has throttled businesses according to infopro research in beirut 160 000 jobs have been lost since the beginning of october and one in 10 companies have closed hospitals are strained after losing bank overdrafts which they had used to cover money they are owed by the government for years lebanese had been assured that their banking sector was safe and the sense of betrayal is palpable protesters have splattered the locked association of banks in blood red paint people spend hours in banks trying to extract their own money to pay rent you see people how shocked they are by the fact that they can t access their money says ms rizk it s because they have been simply deceived the foundations of lebanon s crisis were laid three decades ago when 15 years of fratricidal civil war finally came to an end in 1990 before he became lebanon s prime minister in 1992 rafiq al hariri who was assassinated in 2005 was a construction tycoon who controlled lebanese lender bankmed saad al hariri the recently resigned premier is his son advertisement to attract investment for postwar reconstruction and having made his fortune in saudi arabia the billionaire enlisted gulf petrodollars to invest in lebanon and although lebanon was variously occupied by israel and syria until 2005 confidence in mr hariri s vision grew and money and people returned to lebanon during the 1990s and early 2000s mr hariri started borrowing from international markets and his successors did the same by 2019 the state was using almost half its revenues to service external and domestic debt the other half largely went on public wages warlords turned politicians had bought votes by hiring public sector workers from their constituencies meanwhile corruption flourished as the state ran opaque tenders for government contracts despite all the money which came to lebanon says ms rizk we have no infrastructure no productive sector we have nothing all this money was burnt on consumption through imports and real estate which is a bubble and to defend the peg holding the currency peg had helped to stabilise the economy but it is not known at what cost and the potential impact of devaluation will fall most heavily on ordinary lebanese savers who kept their money in lebanese pounds the imf says the pound is around 50 per cent overvalued when asked this month where the exchange rate was going mr salame responded no one knows advertisement along with politicians mr salame once rafic al hariri s personal banker has become a figure of fury for the protesters a banker at merrill lynch for two decades he returned to beirut in 1993 to lead the banque du liban and never left as governor mr salame is credited with stabilising an erratic currency by establishing a pegged exchange rate between the us dollar and the lebanese pound his whole legacy his whole metric of success in his mind and the people s mind is the peg says dan azzi a harvard fellow and former top banker with standard chartered in lebanon but from 2011 the dollar flow he needed to defend the pound started to ebb as neighbouring oil economies home to the bulk of lebanese expatriates remitting dollars back to beirut slowed down war in neighbouring syria has also increased lebanon s vulnerability the government continued to rack up debt and imports grew mr salame had to come up with something drastic in 2016 he began a succession of unorthodox measures which he called financial engineering put simply banks lent their customers dollars to the central bank at sky high interest rates in return for buying up swaths of government debt in swap operations on terms that generated profit for lebanese banks the central bank and lebanon s commercial banks balance sheets became overlapping we say there is one bank in lebanon with 40 branches joked the bank board member in his interview with the ft mr salame said that all deposits in the central bank including those of commercial banks were its legal property but by 2016 argues former imf official and economist toufic gaspard who anticipated the crisis in a 2017 paper the central bank became a ponzi scheme it was borrowing from banks to pay them their interest advertisement mr salame rejects this accusation the financial engineering was to buy time he said for politicians to reform the bloated government and curb spending but the stability it bought is not a pretext not to do reforms he insists he warned that banque du liban should not be used for politics the central bank is not an instrument to be used in order to force certain changes the state depends on the central bank to meet its dollar debt servicing obligations which will cost around us4 billion next year but rating agencies say that on a net basis the bank s foreign currency holdings are negative its forex reserves will be us28b by the end of the year yet fitch estimates that the central bank s dollar liabilities to lebanese banks stand at us67b moody s says requests to the imf are credit positive and a new government under mr diab may start talks about a new loan programme which could provide some much needed financial stability but first the fractious political factions including hizbollah have to form a government they will also need to win back the support of a sceptical public the whole political system was bought with this ponzi scheme says ms rizk financial times financial times

reflected by our expectations for higher u s yields and a softer dollar in both g10 and em barclays we expect a tepid recovery to uninspiring trend growth but with diminished economic and policy risks

a favorable backdrop for risk assets but the dovish central bank pivot that drove markets in 2019 is largely behind us inflation risks look underappreciated and the lull in u s china trade tensions

inflation pressures we see china s economy stabilizing but little appetite for replays of the large scale stimulus of the past we see the growth uptick taking root in the first half of the year led by global manufacturing activity and rate sensitive sectors such as housing bmo capital markets our baseline assumption is that the economic damage triggered by the trade war will continue spreading to

not forecasting a global or u s recession in 2020 citi s economists think that global growth will settle in around 2 7 per cent year on year in both 2020 and 2021 as global manufacturing activity rebounds columbia threadneedle our base case is that there is unlikely to be an acceleration in growth and we are equally unlikely to see a deep recession in that environment the long duration element of markets be that in fixed income or equities remains relatively attractive deutsche bank wealth management history suggests that years of sharp gains as in 2019 are not usually followed by falls but

global rebound in 2017 we expect global growth to be slightly stronger in 2020 than in 2019 but much weaker than in 2017 18 barclays our bias for carry is also reflected in our emerging market views where the macro backdrop seems unusually favorable for em fixed income a bottoming of global growth without a strong cyclical rebound means em investors should have few growth worries while also avoiding the double whammy of higher core rates and a much stronger dollar barclays we expect a tepid recovery to uninspiring trend growth but with diminished economic and policy risks in light of the very low returns on offer in core bond markets we think this sets the stage for a grind higher in risk assets barclays the outlook for equities is a bit more promising although equities do not look cheap there remains room for them to become more expensive in an environment of punishingly low returns on core fixed income we also think some improvement in the economic outlook sets the stage for modest growth in corporate earnings these are weak drivers of equity market performance compared with the early stages of an economic recovery but with fixed income as unappetizing as it is no very strong driver is required to generate outperformance by equities a trend like expansion is likely to do the trick barclays peripheral european sovereign spreads have widened over the past month but we see this as an opportunity a fragile political situation in spain disappointing growth in portugal and planned strikes in france could all push sovereign spreads a little wider but for investors with a three month or longer horizon we recommend european peripheral sovereign spreads blackrock investment institute income streams are crucial in a slow growth low rate world we like em and high yield debt blackrock investment institute we see any fiscal support from china as limited and not delivering the countercyclical boost it has in the past a material escalation in u s china trade tensions could shift china s fiscal policy stance but our base case is that tensions move sideways and do not escalate blackrock investment institute growth should edge higher in 2020 limiting recession risks this is a favorable backdrop for risk assets but the dovish central bank pivot that drove markets in 2019 is largely behind us inflation risks look underappreciated and the lull in u s china trade tensions could end this leaves us with a modestly pro risk stance for 2020 blackrock investment institute our base case is for a mild pickup supported by easy financial conditions with a slight rise in u s inflation pressures we see china s economy stabilizing but little appetite for replays of the large scale stimulus of the past we see the growth uptick taking root in the first half of the year led by global manufacturing activity and rate sensitive sectors such as housing blackrock investment institute the main risk to our outlook is a gradual change in the macro regime one such risk growth flatlines as inflation rises this might pressure the negative correlation between stock and bond returns over time reducing the diversification properties of bonds blackrock investment institute we see room for many em central banks to ease supporting em growth this underpins our overweights in em debt particularly local currency and in high yield blackrock investment institute risks are are tilted downward for growth because any renewed escalation of trade tensions could derail the growth uptick we expect inflation by contrast could surprise to the upside particularly in the u s bmo

fundamentals have conspired to reduce fx spot ranges for fx volatility to pick up in 2020 we would need to see meaningful policy or real economic divergence capital economics despite recent progress on trade talks between the u s and china we think that most of their differences will remain unresolved and the recovery in global gdp growth is likely to be lacklustre with china missing out capital economics we project that the returns from risky commodities in 2020 21 will be similar to those from equities however this has more to do with tight supply than a brighter outlook for growth capital economics industrial metals will fare a bit better in both absolute and relative terms in 2020 21 even as china s economy loses momentum given the prospects for supply in particular we think that copper will benefit from stronger demand from the renewable energy and electric vehicle sectors while little new supply comes online capital economics we expect growth in the global economy to remain subdued particularly outside the u s and tensions between the u s and china are likely to persist despite the latest progress towards a limited trade deal both of those developments would probably be positive for the dollar relative to most other major currencies capital economics euro zone growth is likely to be far weaker than the consensus assumes next year as industry stays in the doldrums the services slowdown gathers pace and fiscal policy is of little help capital economics slow euro zone growth will keep core inflation stuck close to 1 per cent in the coming years we expect the ecb to change its inflation target in the coming months and to cut its deposit rate by a further 30 basis points during 2020 which is more than markets expect we also think that it will step up its qe from 20 billion euros to 30 billion euros per month in mid 2020 by buying more corporate bonds capital economics we think that weak domestic and foreign demand will cause japanese gdp to fall outright next year given mounting concerns over the impact of loose monetary policy on financial stability we disagree with the consensus view that a further reduction in interest rates is to come and expect the bank of japan to leave its policy rate unchanged capital economics the strength of chinese construction activity will not be sustained further policy loosening is likely with the pboc in particular acting more aggressively than markets envisage but this will do no more than help struggling sectors to stabilize we expect china s growth to slow from around 5 2 per cent this year to 4 5 per cent next which is worse than generally anticipated expecting slower growth and smaller returns in 2020 craig fehr canadian investment strategist at edward jones offers a 2020 outlook for the markets and economy that includes much more modest returns for investors and slowing economic growth capital economics we think that returns from risky assets equities corporate bonds reits and industrial commodities will generally beat those from safe ones government bonds and precious metals again over the next two years as the global economy finds its feet however in our view both will be weaker than in 2019 capital economics with the euro zone economy likely to struggle next year and no meaningful fiscal loosening on the horizon we think that the ecb will surprise markets with at least some additional easing capital economics even in the u s where the economic outlook seems relatively bright we expect actual and expected inflation to stabilize rather than rebound capital economics our proprietary models show the risks of a u s recession are receding and we expect the drop in market interest rates this year to underpin a gradual cyclical recovery in 2020 and beyond capital economics the risk of the u k trading with the eu on wto rules after december 2020 would limit the size of the rebound in gdp growth and the pound citi risks may still be tilted to the downside but we are not forecasting a global or u s recession in 2020 citi s economists think that global growth will settle in around 2 7 per cent year on year in both 2020 and 2021 as global manufacturing activity rebounds citi leading economic indicators like the brief inversion of the yield curve and some tightening in credit conditions for commercial and industrial firms point to the potential for some economic weakness in the second half of 2020 combined with concerns about a potential change in tax policy and tighter business regulation should the white house flip this could lead to some market volatility in the back half of 2020 columbia threadneedle we believe global economic expansion will continue at a slower less even pace across regions columbia threadneedle geopolitics continues to unnerve investors as trade wars and brexit rumble on against the backdrop of a late cycle economy but secular growth trends will provide long term opportunity regardless of whether we see slight positive or negative growth columbia threadneedle there is inherently more growth in emerging markets than in other places over the long term and the growing middle classes in asia especially india remain key but regionally we favor the u s for the sheer number of companies that have the potential for growth this makes it a difficult market to be underweight in columbia threadneedle our base case is that there is unlikely to be an acceleration in growth and we are equally unlikely to see a deep recession in that environment the long duration element of markets be that in fixed income or equities remains relatively attractive columbia threadneedle more generally a risk to the upside could come in the shape of a sudden acceleration in growth some believe this is likely because costs to businesses are currently low with interest or borrowing rates low as well as commodity and specifically oil prices also the trade disputes could dissipate while governments may increase or prolong fiscal stimulus

accommodative monetary policy in the developed world will ease external financial pressure on these economies axa investment managers we think the fomc will be forced to ease further at the end of 2020 when it realises that overcapacities are rising again but this would be more reactive than pre emptive and even if the fed goes all the way the quantum of support should not be overstated axa investment managers we don t see significant directional moves in fixed income not when monetary policy is anchoring interest rates at such extremely low levels global capital flows are also important should treasury yields rise to the 2 0 per cent to 2 5 per cent range investors from europe and japan are likely to become buyers given the low yields on offer in their domestic markets axa investment managers our high yield teams expect default rates to remain low a bias towards corporate assets in the bond market might continue to be rewarding in europe the fact that the ecb has re started buying corporate bonds is also a strong support for credit spreads remaining relatively tight monetary policy to dominate market performance in 2020 invesco kristina hooper chief global market strategist at invesco joins bnn bloomberg to discuss the trends she s watching for in 2020 axa investment managers our multi asset team s stance is to be more optimistic on equities from a cyclical point of view supportive policy and some hope of resolution on the trade war and brexit should underpin positive sentiment in equity markets axa investment managers growth should re assert its dominance over value in a modest economic growth scenario with low interest rates cyclicals are still very cheap relative to bond like defensives and some further valuation adjustment could take place barclays in europe our 10 year bund forecast of 30 basis points in the first quarter 20 is again close to spot levels in our view bunds are extremely unlikely to go back to the summer lows of around 80 basis points given the less dovish tone from the ecb in recent meetings and somewhat better data barclays following their recent easing the fed and ecb are likely to remain on hold for 2020 while keeping an easing bias in light of subdued inflation dynamics and the remaining risks in the meantime a number of em central banks should be able to ease further barclays the u s recovery is long in the tooth the euro area still faces structural growth issues and we do not expect material new fiscal help in either economy in 2020 most important china does not seem likely to repeat the quasi fiscal stimulus that it undertook in 2015 16 which set the stage for a global rebound in 2017 we expect global growth to be slightly stronger in 2020 than in 2019 but much weaker than in 2017 18 blackrock investment institute any meaningful support in the euro area will have to come from fiscal policy and we do not see this in 2020 ems however still have room to provide monetary stimulus blackrock investment institute we see room for many em central banks to ease supporting em growth this underpins our overweights in em debt particularly local currency and in high yield blackrock investment institute growth should edge higher in 2020 limiting recession risks this is a favorable backdrop for risk assets but the dovish central bank pivot that drove markets in 2019 is largely behind us inflation risks look underappreciated and the lull in u s china trade tensions could end this leaves us with a modestly pro risk stance for 2020 blackrock investment institute our base case is for a mild pickup supported by easy financial conditions with a slight rise in u s inflation pressures we see china s economy stabilizing but little appetite for replays of the large scale stimulus of the past we see the growth uptick taking root in the first half of the year led by global manufacturing activity and rate sensitive sectors such as housing bmo capital markets the next fed move will be a cut it is just a matter of time further accommodation will be needed to achieve inflation consistently near 2 per cent bmo capital markets negative rates are unlikely in the u s during 2020 first a variety of

term fundamentals have conspired to reduce fx spot ranges for fx volatility to pick up in 2020 we would need to see meaningful policy or real economic divergence capital economics we don t expect the fed to hike its policy rate in the next couple of years despite fomc participants median projection in december of a 25 basis point rise in 2021 but we forecast that the 10 year treasury yield will edge up in 2020 to 2 0 per cent as investors expectations for one more cut are dashed capital economics although we forecast that monetary policy will be eased a bit more in 2020 21 in some cases we don t expect yields to fall a lot further where this happens so we project that returns from government bonds will barely exceed those from treasuries with higher initial yields in some other cases we think that returns will actually be worse capital economics with the euro zone economy likely to struggle next year and no meaningful fiscal loosening on the horizon we think that the ecb will surprise markets with at least some additional easing capital economics risk free rates stabilize in the u s but fall further in the euro zone we also think that spreads in the euro zone could fall below those in the u s despite a weaker economic backdrop in the former as the ecb steps up its corporate bond buying capital economics in contrast to the market we expect the snb to cut interest rates further into negative territory next year and while the riksbank is dead set on hiking later this year we remain confident that it will have to ease policy again in mid 2020 capital economics growth is probably bottoming out in australia but we still expect the labor market to ease further over the coming months which should result in weaker wage growth and lower inflation before long we therefore expect the rba to cut rates to 0 25 per cent by early next year and launch qe which markets have yet to factor in capital economics slow euro zone growth will keep core inflation stuck close to 1 per cent in the coming years we expect the ecb to change its inflation target in the coming months and to cut its deposit rate by a further 30 basis points during 2020 which is more than markets expect we also think that it will step up its qe from 20 billion euros to 30 billion euros per month in mid 2020 by buying more corporate bonds capital economics we think that weak domestic and foreign demand will cause japanese gdp to fall outright next year given mounting concerns over the impact of loose monetary policy on financial stability we disagree with the consensus view that a further reduction in interest rates is to come and expect the bank of japan to leave its policy rate unchanged capital economics the strength of chinese construction activity will not be sustained further policy loosening is likely with the pboc in particular acting more aggressively than markets envisage but this will do no more than help struggling sectors to stabilize we expect china s growth to slow from around 5 2 per cent this year to 4 5 per cent next which is worse than generally anticipated citi this environment of lower rates will likely persist for some time as advanced economies continue to embrace monetary easing in the u s citi s economists are expecting the fed to remain on hold for some time however the key point for financial markets is that the fed is now much more likely to serve as a tailwind than a headwind deutsche bank wealth management central banks will remain center stage despite talk of the end of monetary magic for an investor this means that you need to reconcile yourself to living with low interest rates for some while longer current financial repression in the form of negative real bond yields will continue for some time deutsche bank wealth management we do not expect the fed or ecb to cut rates further in the next 12 months but ecb asset purchases will continue at 20 billion euros per month for the foreseeable future and the fed will also indulge in quasi qe although these asset purchases will have the primary intention of maintaining market liquidity rather than interest rate reduction deutsche bank wealth management within developed market corporate bonds we see opportunities in u s investment grade and the euro zone crossover segment i e lower rated investment grade higher rated high yield the likelihood of slower growth keeps us more cautious on high yield in general with the ecb being a large buyer again the hunt for yield will continue and even lower rated european bonds will trade on negative yields against

appreciate albeit at a moderate pace thanks to actions from the bank of japan societe generale in 2020 it seems that only the u s federal reserve could really surprise us on the dovish side which is why we have close to half our sovereign bond allocation in u s treasuries societe generale after a wave of rate cuts and some additional easing by other means we expect most central banks to take a break for now however as u s growth slides we expect the fed to s

the pboc announced a 50 bp cut in the required reserve ratio for bank effective monday january 6 the move had been hinted at in the chinese media and by premier li keqiang recently the move will free up an estimated cny800 bln 114 5 bln and reduce banks funding costs which in turn is expected to be passed on to corporate borrowers this suggests the benchmark one year loan prime rate will likely fall when it is set later this month january 20 the required reserves ratios are set currently at 13 for large banks and 11 for smaller banks which remains among the highest in the world there is scope for additional reductions in the coming year observers and investors debate over the reason that the pboc is easing policy some argue it is due to the weakening economy and others see a preemptive move ahead of the significant liquidity needs around the lunar new year january it does not have to be an either or proposition chinese actions often appear designed to meet more than one

deal will be signed at a ceremony in the white house on january 15 apparently china s xi will not be attending but will send another senior official previously the white house had indicated that xi would probably attend and is not clear what has changed still it would seem naive to think that it was a meaningless coincident or that the two schedules are so tight than a mutually agreed upon date was impossible to find at some unspecified date in the future trump indicated he would go to beijing to start phase two talks the federal reserve succeeded in dampening the year end funding squeeze the overnight repo rate rose to 1 88 on new year s eve but fell back to 1 55 late in the session recall that end of 2018 it spiked to 6 banks took 25 6 bln in the fed s overnight repo operation on december 31 and coupled with 230 bln of term repo funding provided there was 255 6 bln extra liquidity the operation will be gradually unwinding in the coming weeks at first some observers thought the fed would have to intensify its efforts and possibly even purchases of long term assets rather than bills however now the debate has shifted toward how the fed weens the market off its largesse the imf s composition of official foreign exchange reserves cofer is the most authoritative source of international reserve data it is reported at the end of every quarter with a quarter lag the q3 data were reported on december 31 the value of reserves is reported in us dollars so exchange rates can and do influence the time series in the third quarter all the major currencies fell against the dollar including nearly 4 2 decline by the euro and a 3 2 decline in sterling the yen slipped by a minor 0 2 central banks hold roughly 11 66 trillion in currency reserves of which the currency allocation of about 10 93 trillion is reported and of those allocated reserves 6 75 trillion are in usd denominated investments this is almost 27 bln less than at the end of q2 19 but nonetheless its share edged up to 61 78 from 61 49 the dollar value of euro reserves fell by about 53 7 bln and its share slipped to a little below 20 1 its smallest share in a couple of years the dollar value of yen holdings rose by 2 bln and its share rose to 5 6 its highest since 2000 the chinese yuan depreciated by nearly 4 against the us dollar in the july september yet the dollar value of reserves increased by about 2 5 bln to 219 6 bln over the past year its share of allocated reserves has edged higher to 1 8 to 2 the us dollar sold off to record the lows for the year on new year s day eve against the

introduction the 2019 visit of pakistan prime minister imran khan to washington and his july 22 meeting with us president donald trump focused attention at least briefly on both the prospects for peace in afghanistan and broader south asia regional security issues energy security is an important aspect of the geopolitics of the region and while it is common to focus on india as the third largest primary energy user in the world after china and the united states pakistan also is significant given its growing economy and large population of 207 million from a geopolitical standpoint though pakistan takes on more importance amid rising great power competition rivalries among china russia iran india and the united states in the region and specifically as china expands its presence through its belt and road initiative bri and the china pakistan economic corridor cpec pakistan s politics has been tumultuous with rival parties struggling for power khan s august 2018 election as prime minister has ushered in a new political era in pakistan his pakistan tehreek e insaf pti party which defeated the outgoing pakistan muslim league nawaz and pakistan people s party for seats in the legislature has already faced many challenges including a slowing economy and continuing energy crisis pakistan is a poor country with a per capita gross domestic product gdp of us 1 909 in early 2019 and 58 million people lack access to electricity with growing incomes population and urbanization energy demand is increasing placing pressure on domestic resources despite the existence of indigenous natural gas renewable and coal resources pakistan has become more dependent on imported oil gas and recently coal resources although it is a small emitter of carbon dioxide co2 unlike india or china pakistan is likely to increase its greenhouse gas emissions depending on the fuel choices and investments it makes the turn to embrace coal is an emerging concern in the broader asian context and in the wake of the paris agreement on climate change which pakistan ratified its nationally determined contribution ndc affirmed its desire to join the global effort to mitigate and adapt to rising emissions including from the power sector that is the leading source of pakistan s emissions poor countries often suffer the most from climate change and pakistan has long been experiencing the direct effects of severe climate events like floods and heat waves in 2018 pakistan was hit with heavy monsoon rains reported to have been the heaviest in thirty eight years in 2019 the nation experienced a record heat wave as the monsoon rains were delayed with an all time high temperature of 120 degrees fahrenheit recorded june 2 3 in jacobabad in sindh province although the international donor and private investment community has had a substantial engagement with pakistan s energy sector for many years considerable obstacles remain in reforming the energy sector and mobilizing critical energy investments the security environment especially outside the punjab and sindh provinces is problematic and the large and pervasive circular debt problem described later has deterred investors us pakistan relations have been strained over pakistan s harboring of the haqqani network a sunni islamist insurgent group involved in the afghan war trump s suspension of military and security assistance and the enhanced us defense partnership with india khan s visit however seems to have improved relations between the nations with the development of a common understanding of the need for a negotiated peace in afghanistan as well as enhanced energy cooperation this report is the third country analysis in the atlantic council s transforming the power sector in developing countries series this series initiated following the historic paris accord of 2015 considers the political economy of implementing the paris targets and commitments focusing on the obstacles and strategies for decarbonization of the important power sector the initial report presented a generic framework and strategic action plan for power sector transformation and subsequent reports have applied this approach to both specific countries such as china and indonesia and issues this analysis turns to south asia and attempts to tie together the geopolitical dimensions of the energy transformation process with the severe poverty and climate change challenges faced by pakistan a separate companion issue brief examines nearby bangladesh critical challenges as a large developing country pakistan faces a wide range of problems especially related to overcoming poverty and improving the health education and employment opportunities for low income groups the energy sector is critical to progress in addressing these problems but inadequate investment unreliable energy supplies weak governance and poor fiscal management of the sector have been major constraints the problem of creating a viable energy sector that can mobilize the needed investments and support sustainable economic growth is a fundamental challenge this section examines the position of pakistan with respect to five common challenges affecting power sector transformation as identified in the initial strategy report namely 1 meeting growing energy demands and moving to a cleaner energy mix 2 improving governance and transparency 3 increasing affordability and access 4 addressing environmental degradation and climate change and 5 achieving power sector financial viability meeting growing energy demand and moving to a cleaner energy mix pakistan s economy over the past five years has been growing at more than 4 percent and reached 5 2 percent in 2018 although primary energy consumption in 2018 grew by 5 percent primary energy growth has historically lagged behind economic growth between 2007 and 2017 the average rate of primary energy growth was 2 7 percent compared with a 3 8 percent average annual increase in gdp pakistan depends principally on oil and gas for over 70 percent of its primary energy and has become increasingly dependent on oil and gas imports although pakistan has some domestic crude oil production about 90 thousand barrels per day in 2018 this only accounts for 18 percent of total oil consumption the growing oil import bill puts great pressure on budgets and reserves the international monetary fund imf estimates pakistan s 2017 18 oil imports at us 14 6 billion or about a quarter of total estimated current account imports and 2019 20 imports are expected to be at least us 17 billion the depreciation of the pakistan rupee in 2018 added an additional burden to the import bill pakistan has had to turn to gas imports as domestic gas consumption has grown by 7 percent in 2018 and outpaced domestic production pakistan s indigenous gas production has stagnated at about 34 billion cubic meters bcm in 2018 accounting for 80 percent of domestic consumption expansion of electricity generation to meet rising demand and reduce the endemic power blackouts and outages has been a high priority of the pakistan government installed generation capacity has greatly expanded from 23 337 megawatts mw in 2014 to 33 836 mw in february 2019 and electricity generation increased by 11 percent from 2017 to 2018 pakistan continues to have a gap however of several thousand megawatts in the non summer months when hydropower output is lower and electricity demand is high although natural gas fired generation provides the largest share of electricity output pakistan has significant hydropower production some nuclear power and increasing renewable energy generation see figure 2 we examine more closely the transformation and diversification challenge in the strategic priorities section improving governance and transparency although pakistan has made progress in developing its institutions in the energy and power sectors much remains to be done to improve their governance and transparency a separate professional energy regulatory body the pakistan national electric power regulatory authority nepra has been in place since 1997 however it still needs to improve its autonomy authority and accountability becoming less dependent on the ministry of energy the evolution of energy institutions in pakistan has been shaped by the relationship between electricity and water the priority of water management in pakistan and the construction of tarbela and other major dams and hydropower plants led to the development of a combined ministry of water and power while the development of the large sui and other gas fields was overseen by a separate ministry of petroleum and minerals as thermal power generation expanded in the 1980s and 1990s state utility company water and power development authority wapda was unbundled with wapda retaining hydropower at the same time four separate state thermal companies were established in 1998 along with a separate authority for electricity transmission the national transmission and dispatch company ntdc a central power purchasing agency cppa responsible for billing and financial settlements was separated from ntdc in 2015 heightening transparency in power transactions and financial relations in the major karachi electricity market the main supplier is k electric formerly the karachi electric power corporation for several years k electric had been a target of acquisition by china s shanghai electric company but the majority shareholder the dubai based abraaj group collapsed in 2019 separately many privately owned electricity generating companies ipps are involved in the thermal hydro and renewable subsectors and have established a pakistan independent power producers association it was then prime minister shahid abbasi a former minister of petroleum from the pakistan muslim league who in his brief tenure succeeded in establishing the ministry of energy which combined the ministry of petroleum and natural resources and the power division of the ministry of water and power in august 2017 it remains to be seen whether this institutional restructuring will improve governance and transparency given the close relationship between electricity and gas both indigenous and imported the creation of a single ministry may help achieve better planning and coordination between the oil and gas and power sectors in general energy policy and governance has been quite fragmented in pakistan involving the pakistan ministry of finance the planning commission the provincial governments as well as the state energy organizations major decisions on energy policy and investment are usually reviewed and approved by the economic coordination committee chaired by the prime minister former prime minister nawaz sharif tried to improve coordination in the sector through an interagency energy group and brought in from abroad a pakistani with experience working in western companies as his energy adviser upon his election as prime minister khan assumed the position of minister of energy as well as minister of the interior but in september 2018 he appointed omar ayab khan also from the pti party as minister of energy the prime minister also created the task force on energy reform which is headed by his energy adviser naseem babar increasing affordability and access as a largely rural country pakistan faces major challenges in providing affordable and reliable electricity to its population as mentioned above 58 million people lack access to electricity and the challenge is particularly acute in rural areas where only 54 percent have access pakistan s progress in expanding access has been slower compared to some other countries for example nearby bangladesh boosted its access level to 88 percent in 2017 from 55 percent in 2010 and more recent estimates are as high as 95 percent pakistan aspires to achieve universal electricity access by 2030 and priority towns in each province have been identified pakistan s rural electrification programs are heavily focused on grid expansion by the various regional distribution companies many of which are constrained in their ability to finance grid expansion especially in the remote and sparsely populated areas of baluchistan and tribal areas decentralized renewable systems are beginning to be introduced but not at the same scale as in bangladesh where several dozen nongovernmental organizations ngos and private companies are marketing these systems for household and village applications tackling environmental degradation and climate change pakistan and the south asia region as a whole face enormous environmental challenges due to the geographical and ecological situation population growth and urban pressures pakistan s population is expected to grow to 309 million by 2050 as a result water and energy will become critical to its survival key to pakistan s future is the indus river basin and system both for irrigation and as a water supply for major urban centers in the east and south the basin is subject to regular flooding and cyclones in 2010 pakistan suffered especially severe flooding that seriously damaged the electricity system and caused an estimated us 25 3 billion in costs or 5 4 percent of gdp the global climate risk index ranks pakistan as the seventh most affected country during the period 1997 2016 with 141 severe climate events incurring estimated losses of us 3 8 billion in pakistan these events have included droughts and heat waves e g 1998 02 and 2014 17 and glacial lake outburst floods in the northern mountains pakistan s initial submission in the run up to the paris climate summit the intended nationally determined contribution indc presents a useful summary of the threats that pakistan is facing from climate change many sectors activities and target groups are vulnerable to the threats of climate change in pakistan these among others include increased variability of monsoon rapid recessions of glaciers of hindu kush karakoram in the himalayas threatening water flows in the indus river system increased siltation of downstream water reservoirs increased risk of floods and droughts heat stressed conditions in arid and semi arid regions leading to reduced agriculture productivity intrusion of saline water in the indus delta affecting coastal ecology and fishery production and increased cyclonic activity in the coastal belt due to high sea surface temperatures while these climate impacts have taken their toll pakistan emits quite small amounts of co2 i e only about 0 6 percent of global energy co2 emissions pakistan s indc reports energy emissions in 2015 of 185 97 metric tons mt out of total emissions of 405 mt bp estimates that pakistan s energy co2 emissions rose in 2018 to 195 7 mt a 3 8 percent increase over 2017 overall energy related co2 emissions are projected to increase to 898 mt in 2030 pakistan s conditional commitment at paris was however to reduce overall emissions by 20 percent from the projected 2030 levels if an estimated investment of 40 billion were forthcoming for abatement actions in energy industry and agriculture meeting this reduction target will require major changes in strategy and financing which will be discussed later in this document achieving power sector financial viability the establishment of a financially sound power sector in low income developing countries is a common problem and pakistan is continuing to struggle to reduce losses improve collections and rationalize tariffs the power crisis in pakistan has received much attention including front page stories in major western papers the shortage of power supplies coupled with a large deficit in collections and pervasive circular debt has represented a persistent political problem stemming back to well before the sharif and khan governments at the root of the problem is both high technical and commercial losses and especially nonpayment by the government and its state companies the issue of losses and inadequate collections is problematic in most of pakistan s ten electricity distribution companies which had average losses of 17 95 percent in 2016 17 with three reporting losses of over 30 percent see figure 3 although estimates vary the cumulative debts of the power system including the shifting circular debt among state gas companies power distribution companies independent power producers consumers and the government s central purchasing agency have continued to build up over the years and were estimated to have reached a cumulative level of 1 55 trillion pakistan rupees abbreviated as rs and the amount equivalent to us 11 7 billion as of june 2018 with the average tariff of rs11 70 kilowatt hour kwh well below the determined power supply cost for 2018 19 of rs15 53 kwh although the early 2019 level was widely reported at rs1 4 trillion one independent analysis places the official designed circular debt at rs829 billion as of july 2019 not including loans of the syndicated term finance facility which if added would total about rs1 8 trillion the government with donor support has sought to reduce payment arears and has tried to cap the overall level of circular debt as much as rs600 billion of this debt has been parked in a state holding company the power holding private ltd phpl private power producers through the independent power producers advisory council ippac have disputed the effectiveness of government efforts highlighting a rising circular debt claiming that their share was rs254 billion in 2017 these independent power producers have long term power purchase agreements with government entities that have been criticized as too costly with their take or pay arrangements and for renewables high feed in tariffs which are designed to promote installation of renewable electricity technologies in 2017 the government decided to move generally to shorter term competitively bid tenders i e terms of fifteen years instead of twenty five to thirty years and take and pay formulas the world bank and the imf have reported lower estimated levels of circular debt the world bank estimated rs420 billion or us 4 billion by the end of fiscal year fy 16 or 1 percent of gdp and the imf rs514 billion at the end of 2017 what seems to have occurred is that the government reduced the budgeted power subsidy from rs349 billion in 2012 13 to rs118 in 2016 17 and this contributed to a buildup of circular debt besides low tariffs a major contributing factor to circular debt is the large transmission and distribution t d losses the target for t d losses for fy2016 17 was 15 3 percent while the reported losses in distribution alone were almost 18 percent as indicated above if transmission losses are included the total difference between electricity generated by the producers and electricity sold by the regional distribution companies discos amounted to 21 6 percent of generation in fy2016 17 arrears in the gas sector also have been rising to a reported us 1 billion for sui northern and sui southern gas companies and the government increased gas prices by 200 percent on july 1 2019 in summary the overall cost to pakistan of the power sector s poor economic and financial performance is large a world bank report estimates that the total economic cost of power sector distortions in pakistan was us 17 7 billion in fy15 or about 6 5 percent of gdp stemming from the negative impacts us 12 9 billion a year of unreliable electricity to firms and households strategic priorities this section presents policy directions that pakistan should consider taking to address the above critical challenges it takes the general prescriptive approach from the first report in the series and offers suggestions on specific strategic priorities for pakistan these priorities address the following 1 creating a sound policy legal and regulatory environment 2 developing efficient institutional and market structures 3 achieving a cleaner and more resilient generation mix 4 expanding electricity access to the poor and rural areas 5 collaborating with neighbors on regional electricity and gas networks and markets and 6 attracting international investment and financing creating a sound policy legal and regulatory environment strategic priority the pakistan government urgently needs to develop a comprehensive energy plan and formulate legal and regulatory measures that tackle critical reforms in the parastatal energy companies and power market enhance revenue collection create a more favorable environment for investment and accelerate efforts to develop its indigenous renewable energy and gas resource development for its energy security economic growth and environmental sustainability discussion the creation of a sound longer term energy policy has been difficult as domestic and external political and economic pressures buffet the government the imperative of addressing short term energy shortages the severe budget and financial constraints and the dramatic swings in international energy prices has made it hard to develop an optimal strategy that balances energy security economic growth and environmental sustainability pakistan has pursued high cost short term fixes while at the same time accepting billions in large infrastructure loans notably from china for coal and nuclear plants that are problematic given the financial difficulties faced by the government and the power sector policies to promote domestic renewables and gas development have not received sufficient priority vis à vis projects to develop imported coal and liquefied natural gas lng increasing power sector revenues is of critical importance especially through tariff rationalization and the reduction of both technical and nontechnical losses in the system pakistan committed to raise tariffs and reduce circular debt in its july 2019 extended fund facility eff agreement with the imf and the imf released the first us 1 billion tranche of the us 6 billion package after pakistan adjusted tariffs by over 10 percent with further increases planned developing efficient institutional and market structures strategic priority the pakistan government should restructure the single buyer system and fully unbundle the power sector while maintaining a priority focus on improving the revenue and financial position of the sector the privatization of better performing distribution companies in major cities like lahore islamabad and faisalabad should be pursued to improve commercial operations and provide resources for the government discussion pakistan has the potential to develop a more competitive power market but the highly politicized single buyer system i e one in which transmission is controlled by the government is holding back progress although private generation has overtaken public sector generation distribution losses are still too high and major investments in transmission and distribution are needed to keep up with surging power demands the economic competitiveness of renewables and the potential for distributed gas systems open up new possibilities for a less centralized and more transparent commercial operation of the system policy makers should now begin to unbundle the system fully and move to a bilateral contracts approach and the introduction of third party access in pakistan the world bank s appraisal report concludes that that the discos and ntdc are not at arm s length from the power division of the ministry of energy and remain in an entrenched bureaucratic culture the cppa proposal to become a market operator which has been under review by the national energy regulatory commission is a positive sign but further restructuring is needed in its early days the sharif government announced plans to privatize distribution in the major cities of faisalabad lahore and islamabad where incomes and affordability are higher and initial disco privatization was a condition of the previous imf us 6 6 extended fund facility political opposition however kept the sharif government from pursuing this objective and it was abandoned in 2016 khan has an opportunity to revive this process and in march 2019 the minister of privatization indicated that nine distribution companies would be included in the list of state owned enterprises for privatization along with several generation companies although experience in other countries shows that losses can be reduced with proper metering billing and collections systems and investments it is clear that the circular debt overhang and government nonpayment obstacles need to be overcome and political support for strong legal enforcement of collections including by government entities and rationalization of tariffs will be essential achieving a cleaner and resilient generation mix strategic priority pakistan should continue to diversify its electricity mix but reorient efforts to accelerate the move to lower carbon sources and away from oil and coal by focusing on gas renewables and increased energy efficiency it should seek to facilitate the private investments needed to meet its 30 percent renewables target by 2030 and ensure that the transmission investments required to integrate these sources into the grid are realized and carefully coordinated with generation expansion plans given the declining costs of renewables its favorable solar resources and high electricity access requirements pakistan should give greater priority to minigrids and distributed solar power systems for towns and villages discussion pakistan has ambitious plans to expand electricity generation capacities currently pakistan s installed capacity stands at about 34 282 mw and pakistan s target is to increase generation capacity to about 50 000 mw by 2022 and 62 186 mw by 2025 meeting peak load estimated at over 25 000 mw in 2019 is a problem exacerbated by transmission and distribution limitations to address the frequent outages and rising electricity demands pakistan has turned heavily to imported natural gas and coal natural gas pakistan has already achieved significant reductions in oil generation especially through substitution of natural gas with both the level and share of oil declining from 30 22 terawatt hours twh 26 49 percent in 2017 to 14 32 twh 11 54 percent in 2018 the substitution of gas for oil has substantially reduced pakistan s fuel import bill by more than us 2 billion pakistan has rapidly increased the use of gas in its power generation since the initiation of lng imports in march 2015 in march 2018 gas power generation accounted for 43 percent of total power generation 3 013 gigawatt hours with lng providing 19 percent and domestic gas 24 percent three major new gas power plants in punjab province totaling 3 6 gigawatts gw accounted for the significant increase pakistan has two floating storage regasification unit fsru lng facilities at port qasim the excelerate nakilat 3 8 million metric tons per annum mmtpa fsru at the engro elengy group terminal and a 5 7 mmtpa unit owned by pakistan lng terminals ltd the main lng import contracts are for supplies from qatar the cabinet economic coordination committee in july 2019 endorsed planning for a third terminal and other projects by major oil companies including shell exxon and total have been proposed lng imports are expected to grow with estimated levels of 14 million metric tons mmt by 2022 and 21 mmt by 2025 up from just 6 7 mmt last year pakistan s focus on lng and gas fired power generation has opened new opportunities for us lng exports and investment by the private sector general electric has a long standing presence in pakistan and plays a major role in pakistan s power system with its technologies providing as much as 25 percent of pakistan s total generation this work includes new gas units both large and small gas field units steam systems and wind turbines coal despite environmental concerns and its paris ndc commitment to reduce projected co2 emissions pakistan is counting on coal to play a significant role in the nation s future power mix with a combination of both coal imports as well as domestic resource development pakistan has 6 6 gw of coal plants under construction with coal capacity additions totaling 11 353 mw projected for 2025 the pakistan vision 2030 targets installed coal capacity of 19 910 mw by 2030 representing 19 percent of the projected installed generation mix estimates foresee pakistan s imports of coal rising from about 12 million metric tons mmt in 2018 to 30 mmt in 2020 and 40 mmt in 2025 imports will increase to meet the needs of two new large coal plants at sahiwal and port qasim pakistan is therefore moving rapidly to implement its policy decision to develop almost from scratch a coal power industry with all the attendant infrastructure requirements for import and transport although this follows the trend in some other south and southeast asia nations there are serious questions about the viability of this strategy from both economic and environmental standpoints even though both the sahiwal and port qasim coal plants are efficient and use super critical coal combustion technology in pakistan one recent study using data from the energy regulator shows see figure 5 that both renewables and gas are less costly than coal with wind at 4 3 cents per kwh solar at 5 3 cents gas at around 6 cents and hydro averaging a little over 8 cents compared with 8 4 cents for super critical coal plants such as the china huanang coal plant at sahiwal have been given a power purchase agreement price of 8 36 cents per kwh these investments create long term obligations and the coal plants may become stranded assets potentially obsolete and weighing on balance sheets as renewable energy costs decrease and the costs of climate change increase nuclear important developments are evident in global nuclear markets as russia and china seek to expand their political and economic influence in developing regions through the export and state financing of nuclear power plants china and russia are building over 60 percent of the nuclear reactors currently under construction in the world today pakistan is thus far the only foreign country operating chinese commercial nuclear reactors chinese nuclear engagement with pakistan dates to 1993 when the china national nuclear corporation cnnc began construction of the first of four small chinese cnp300 nuclear reactors at its chashma complex in central pakistan with commercial operation in 2000 2011 2016 and 2017 as it pursued export opportunities china in 2015 began to construct near karachi two of its larger indigenous designed hualong one plants 1 000 mw each the first and only chinese generation iii plants thus far to be built outside china they are expected to be completed by 2021 and 2022 and will be an important showcase together with the four hualong one plants under construction and ten planned plants in china cnnc is building these units with reported financing from a us 6 5 billion loan in 2014 from the chinese export import bank a third hualong one unit for the chashma complex is at the tender stage but it is unclear whether the financing has been finalized pakistan envisions 8 800 mw of nuclear capacity by 2030 providing 20 percent of its electric power although nuclear energy is a small part of pakistan s power mix these huge projects create a long term financial technological and energy dependency on china and its authoritarian system and state companies they reduce transparency in the sector and raise concerns about safety and security pakistan like india has not signed the nuclear non proliferation treaty but the nation is a member of the international atomic energy agency iaea in 2018 pakistan established a four year joint program with the iaea to work on ensuring the safety and security of the new plants the economics of the new plants are still unclear but given the reported size of the loans it is reasonable to estimate that the plants in pakistan will cost about us 4 000 per installed kw assuming they are completed on schedule even with high capacity factors they will likely be among the highest cost power generation units renewables interest and investment in renewable energy have picked up over the past four or five years however excluding large hydropower capacity renewables only accounted for 4 percent of pakistan s generation in 2018 as pointed out in the renewable readiness assessment by the international renewable energy agency irena pakistan has substantial wind energy potential i e 6 9 to 8 6 meters per second in the sinh corridor and solar resource potential and international companies from many countries are establishing facilities particularly in the sindh and punjab provinces chinese companies have been major investors in wind projects accounting for 397 5 mw or 36 8 percent of the new wind power capacity developed in pakistan between 2014 and 2018 in total 1 500 mw of wind solar and bagasse a biowaste had been installed as of 2017 and nepra projected in 2017 that more than 3 500 mw of these sources will be added by 2024 25 a july 2019 report of the us commercial service indicates that a 400 mw installation at the quaid e azam solar park is operating with expansion planned and an additional twenty four solar projects of different scale are producing 550 mw of power at least six bagasse plants of 201 1 mw are in operation besides its large hydropower potential pakistan has many favorable sites for small hydro projects 877 projects are underway and will add to the current generation of 128 mw the khan government has recently announced ambitious plans to increase the share of renewable energy in total power generation to 30 percent by 2030 including wind solar small hydro and biomass the new plans are expected to expand renewable capacity by as much as 7 000 mw by 2025 to around 20 percent of generation in addition there is a target to raise the share of large scale hydro more than 50 mw currently around one fourth of the country s electricity supply to 30 percent by 2030 reaching 60 percent renewable and hydro generation by 2030 would be a tremendous achievement and counter the growing trend of fossil fuel imports pakistan has been moving to further its investments in hydropower which has long been a pillar of the electricity system accounting for between 25 percent and 30 percent of nationwide generation depending on water availability pakistan s installed hydro capacity reached 9 389 mw in 2018 with the commissioning of the 108 mw golen gol 2 the 1 410 mw tarbela fourth extension and the 969 mw neelum jhelum projects work is beginning on the large world bank funded 4 320 mw dasu project which has experienced major delays due to land issues and the government has announced an 800 mw mohmand dam project on the swat river in the khyber pakhtunkhwa province pakistan is experiencing historically low water flows and the potential for further climate impacts may affect this important subsector despite the value of the projects in terms of increasing water storage and management capacity expanding electricity access to poor and rural areas strategic priority pakistan should develop a high priority program to support private entrepreneurial and ngo efforts to commercialize solar power systems in rural areas and ensure high standards for reliability and service they should encourage banks to lend for these projects as well as facilitate cooperation between solar system providers and the regional distribution companies especially on technology interface issues for minigrids and microgrids pakistan should consider the adaptation of the bangladesh infrastructure development company limited idcol public private partnership model which has been so successful in mobilizing over 500 million in donor funding for wide spread installation by private organizations of off grid solar photovoltaic systems discussion pakistan is taking steps to introduce solar power to rural villages the world bank has approved a new project the sindh solar energy project that will finance 200 000 solar home systems and larger grid connected units pakistan needs to tap private entrepreneurial talent in developing these programs and ensure that sound technical standards are adopted it can learn from other experiences in south asia and east africa where substantial commercialization of both solar home systems and minigrids is occurring collaborating with neighbors on regional electricity and gas networks and markets strategic priority pakistan should continue to pursue diversification of its electricity and gas imports from central asia promoting peaceful relationships and advancing economic development while resisting iranian pressure to expand electricity and gas import from iran discussion attempts at energy cooperation in south asia have been a challenge given the conflicts and historical legacies a few signs of progress are emerging however as pakistan pursues overland imports of electricity and gas in addition to its major focus on maritime imports of lng and coal for power pakistan has long been eyeing the potential for electricity and gas imports from central asia for more than a decade the turkmenistan afghanistan pakistan india tapi gas pipeline and the casa 1000 electric transmission line projects have been pursued to bring gas from turkmenistan and hydro generated power from tajikistan and central asia turkmengas leads the tapi consortium which includes the afghan gas corp pakistan s interstate gas system ltd and india s state owned gail construction started on the 1 840 km 10 billion project in turkmenistan in december 2015 and in afghanistan in february 2018 it will supply 33 bcm of gas from the large galkynysh gas field in turkmenistan to the border with india with pakistan and india taking up to 14 bcm each and afghanistan 5 bcm commercial contracts are under negotiation among the four companies with possible financial closure by the end of 2020 the asian development bank adb has been a major supporter of the project but chinese and south korean banks are financing the development of the galkynysh field and the processing plants the united states has consistently taken the position that the project s commercial viability depends on the openness and willingness of international petroleum companies to be involved in the upstream development turkmenistan has however moved ahead to develop the field itself and expand production to 40 bcm by 2025 with the continuing conflict in afghanistan there are clearly risks to the project the taliban have stated assurances of protecting the pipeline despite the history of fighting to control farah a western province and city adjacent to herat near the iranian border where the pipeline will traverse the pipeline will also pass through quetta in pakistan s baluchistan province where militant and terrorist groups operate thereby adding to pipeline security risks the outcome of ongoing negotiations among the taliban and the afghan government with us chinese and russian involvement will likely be critical to the project s fate and the attitude of india toward continued participation another long pursued project is the casa 1000 high voltage direct current hvdc electricity transmission line that will bring seasonably available hydropower from tajikistan and the kyrgyz republic through afghanistan to pakistan the world bank is the major financier but additional funders include the islamic development bank the european bank for reconstruction and development the united kingdom and the united states although construction began in may 2016 progress has been slow especially in tajikistan contracts the main components of the project include 500 kilovolt kv alternating current ac line from datka in the kyrgyz republic to substation sugd 477 kilometers or 296 miles away in tajikistan 1 300 mw ac dc converter station at sangtuda tajikistan 750 km hvdc line from sangtuda to nowshera pakistan and 1 300 megawatt dc ac converter station at nowshera power purchase agreements have been completed between the participating national transmission companies and commercial operations are expected to begin in 2022 the adb did not support casa 1000 instead pursuing the turkmenistan afghanistan pakistan tap project a 500 kilovolt kv electricity transmission project that would use the same route as the tapi pipeline and potentially would allow larger power flows than casa 1000 the tap framework agreement was signed in may 2018 and has two main phases the first phase to be completed by 2021 will use the existing infrastructure under the adb financed turkmenistan uzbekistan tajikistan afghanistan pakistan tutap power interconnection project which aims to export power from turkmenistan to afghanistan and pakistan the second phase to be completed by 2022 will transfer power from turkmenistan through the border of serhetabad in turkmenistan and torghundy into herat kandahar and spin boldak in afghanistan and export to chaman and quetta in pakistan another factor in the regional equation is of course iran that nation has proclaimed its desire to be a regional electricity hub with exports to the caucasus through armenia and azerbaijan and to central asia through turkmenistan and directly to turkey afghanistan and pakistan iran s power exports generated us 3 37 billion in revenue between september 2013 and may 2017 according to a pakistan press report citing iran s energy ministry with iraq ranking as the largest market 1 400 mw per year although iran s electricity exports to afghanistan and pakistan are presently only about 130 mw iran has indicated its readiness to provide as much as 3 000 mw to pakistan the current confrontation with the united states and us sanctions on iran pose a problem for pakistan s pursuit of this option as well as pakistan s long delayed import of natural gas from iran the latter project which dates over a decade envisioned the completion of an 8 bcm pipeline although iran has finished its segment pakistan has not proceeded with its leg due to us pressure and sanctions and iran has threatened to take the issue to the international court of justice in the hague attracting domestic and international investment and financing strategic priority pakistan needs to step up its efforts to improve the financial position of its power sector reduce quasi fiscal deficits and increase the efficiency of the state energy companies if it is to attract the capital and financing needed to meet the growing electricity demands the emphasis should be on attracting private capital and the government should be more careful in assuming external state loans from china and other sources that exacerbate the public debt position and increase co2 emissions the gas and renewable energy subsectors should be given highest priority since they are both economically viable and can attract private equity and debt financing with growing energy demands from rapid urbanization greater attention should be given to improving energy efficiency especially through building envelope appliance and hvac system standards and incentives for building owners to invest in modern energy management systems improvement in the transparency professional capability and credibility of nepra will be increasingly important to assuring sound and sustainable financial investments in the sector discussion although the recent slowdown in pakistan s economy has raised concerns the energy sector continues to attract considerable interest from private and state investors donors and international financial institutions ifis prime attention has focused on the expansion of chinese financing for infrastructure including energy under the bri substantial international criticism including disparaging comments on china s debt trap diplomacy lack of transparency and state dominated nonmarket approach from senior us administration and congressional leaders has been aimed at china s us 62 billion cpec program to construct roads mines power plants ports and other infrastructure the official cpec website as of july 2019 contained fifteen priority energy projects involving over 11 000 mw of new capacity us 16 billion in estimated investment several coal mines and two major high voltage transmission lines these projects do not include the more than us 6 billion of financing for the nuclear plants that china is building near karachi and planned for chasma or the ongoing us 10 billion port development at gwadar in baluchistan which china has leased for forty three years and which may become important for future oil and coal imports there has also been speculation that china intends to use gwadar port for its naval expansion especially in light of china s agreement to sell pakistan eight submarines china is sending thousands of workers to pakistan for these projects posing a challenge for pakistan security officials the sahiwal coal fired power plant was commissioned in may 2017 after being constructed in twenty two months the pakistan government allocated us 1 71 billion in the 2017 18 budget for cpec projects significant vehicles for chinese government energy finance include the two so called policy banks the china development bank and the chinese export import bank a boston university dashboard that tracks energy financing from these institutions reports us 19 098 billion in chinese energy loans from these banks to pakistan during 2014 18 mainly for nuclear coal and hydro projects this major borrowing comes at a time when pakistan is already facing an elevated current account deficit and a ballooning external public debt estimated by the imf at us 105 8 billion in march 2019 public and public guaranteed debt is projected by the imf to increase to us 234 billion in 2019 20 in part driven by the cpec related outflows loan repayments and profit repatriation pakistan s current chinese debt is estimated to be us 15 billion in public loans and us 6 7 billion in commercial finance obligations this weakening external financial position will be a major challenge and require significant external resource mobilization to meet the debt service obligations as the imf pointed out in approving the us 6 billion eff pakistan officials have argued that official debt to china is limited since many of the projects involve commercial loans and foreign direct investment by chinese companies and official debt is only a small portion of the overall national debt of us 100 billion and the annual investment program of the government international criticism of chinese actions goes beyond the long term financial dependency aspects and political ramifications of these projects to include the environmental and climate change impacts of its lending for coal projects and the weak environmental standards in the hydro and other projects pakistan has been a major focus of chinese international coal financing the overseas development institute s june 2019 report estimated that group of twenty g20 countries provided coal financing and subsidies of us 16 billion during 2016 17 with china and japan accounting for 87 percent of this amount pakistan received us 3 975 billion from china during this period boston university s china s global energy finance tracker indicates that coal was a major part of the us 3 3 billion in chinese funding from the chinese development bank and chinese export import bank during 2017 the contradiction of china seeking to reduce coal s role domestically through the substitution of gas renewables and nuclear and its aggressive support for overseas coal plants is quite stark and reflects the political influence of the large chinese state industrial companies this trend in encouraging coal use is alarming in terms of both global efforts to combat climate change and reduce co2 emissions and in terms of pakistan s future policy direction chinese officials indicate that they are just responding to the desires of the country officials that view coal as the least cost option the evidence increasingly see figure 5 shows however that renewables and gas are competitive and certainly less expensive if environmental health water and other factors are considered chinese support for overseas coal projects contrasts with the position of the ifis which are supporting hydro gas and other renewable energy projects for example the world bank is a major donor in pakistan and is supporting a us 425 million national transmission modernization project a tarbela fourth extension hydro project of us 390 million which provides additional funding to the original us 840 million tarbela extension loan a us 588 4 million dasu hydro stage 1 project and a us 100 million sindh solar energy project although the asian development bank did finance the us 900 million jamshoro coal plant in pakistan over the objections of the obama administration and other countries it has since focused on noncoal projects in transmission distribution renewable energy and energy efficiency over the period 2005 17 adb provided us 6 2 billion for energy in pakistan accounting for 28 percent of its operations in the country of the bilateral donors active in the sector the us government through the us agency for international development usaid overseas private investment corporation opic and the us department of energy has provided energy assistance and financial support to the power sector and us investors over many decades this assistance has helped finance both human and physical infrastructure from hydro facilities to thermal power plants electricity distribution improvement rural electrification and more recently wind projects and transmission investments in pakistan s sindh province since 2011 alone usaid financed projects have added over 3 500 mw of electricity to pakistan s national grid this includes 1 049 mw of generation capacity from new and rehabilitated hydro and thermal power plants and 2 505 mw of transmission and distribution capacity improving the performance of the distribution companies also has been a central focus of usaid programs helping to realize through loss reduction efforts 212 mw in distribution capacity and the recovery of over us 429 million in revenue although pakistan with its favorable renewable resource potential and feed in tariff policies has been relatively successful in attracting project financing from both private and public sources it will need to further improve the investment climate if it is to realize the new ambitious targets of the khan government an important aspect will be the implementation of a major renewable energy auction system that has become the global norm as they move away from rigid feed in tariffs these efforts should be coordinated with broader power sector restructuring and plans are developing to allow direct sales of power from renewable generators to industrial consumers investment in transmission capacity will be critical and the world bank and others are working with the government to consider options for both siting and financing opening up some transmission projects to private investors is certainly an option that should be evaluated conclusion south asia with its rapidly growing energy sector is poised to play an expanding role in global energy markets and geopolitics this issue brief has focused on pakistan which faces challenges in meeting rising energy demands and addressing security poverty and climate change issues the intensifying great power competition among the united states china and russia is playing out in this region and the energy sector is one critical arena the united states has long standing strategic interests in the region given us investment in aiding a peaceful and viable afghanistan as well as mitigating tensions and potential conflict between the nuclear states of pakistan and india china is expanding its influence in the region and has made pakistan a top focus of its belt and road initiative and the china pakistan economic corridor with its heavy investment in electric power and infrastructure projects energy is critically important to raising pakistan s per capita income levels and achieving universal electricity access is an important objective faced with rising energy demands from increasing urbanization incomes and population pakistan has increased its reliance on fossil fuel imports despite the fact that according to the us geological survey it has petroleum resources of 164 million barrels of oil and 24 6 trillion cubic feet of natural gas although this paper has not discussed the upstream oil and gas sector pakistan should consider ways to further investment in domestic exploration and development of these resources pakistan s power sector diversification program concentrates on expanding coal generation from both imported and domestic sources the planned scale up of coal generation from almost nothing a few years ago is very troubling and adds to international concerns that countries especially in asia are not seriously implementing their paris agreement commitments to mitigate co2 emissions united nations un secretary general antónio guterres in his closing remarks at the un climate conference in new york on september 23 2019 called for countries to stop building coal plants after 2020 although this call is highly aspirational and not very realistic in terms of pakistan s situation pakistan s leaders would be wise to reorient their policies away from coal and greatly ramp up their renewable energy energy efficiency and gas and lng development efforts as the new khan government targets seem to suggest improving the financial viability of the power sector and ameliorating the circular debt problem are vitally important to attracting the needed investment for projects and establishing credible power off take agreements pakistan can build on the success it has had in attracting investment in wind and solar development to complement its large hydro development program and ensure that investments in transmission are made to accommodate this expansion international financial institutions and us and european donors should continue to encourage this direction while raising with high level chinese officials the issue of its aggressive coal project financing given the growing climate change impacts of storms and stresses on water resources it is critical for pakistan to elevate

many factors affect the emerging markets including the 2020 us presidential election alex rolandi canvasses opinion about bonds and equities since the us federal reserve cut interest rates in july for the first time in a decade redemptions from emerging markets equity funds have been slowing while bond funds have ebbed and flowed following two more cuts and after five months in the red emerging market equity funds finally saw a relative trickle of positive flows again in october 12 3 million 11 1 million globally according to data from morningstar emerging market bonds funds saw a strong 16 months up until april 2018 more recently in august 2019 they suffered outflows of 2 9 billion then in september there was another turnaround as 4 3 billion was invested followed by just over 2 billion in october from an equity perspective the prospects of select emerging markets especially in europe and asia rank high relative to other asset classes particularly relative to us and australian equities as well as real estate investment trusts says michael kruger investment analyst at morningstar investment management south africa in the medium term depressed developed market bond yields should drive investment toward higher yield emerging market sovereign debt despite this tentative turning of the tides for both asset classes emerging market growth is strongly linked to the uncertainties defining our times investor appetite for emerging markets is cyclical with sentiment influenced by trade issues between the us and china as well as future gdp growth expectations as many countries have export economies says kruger however central banks in emerging market countries have generally been more prone to lowering rates this year against a backdrop of slowing economic growth expectations declining inflationary pressures and easing monetary policy in developed countries this makes some managers positive chetan sehgal a portfolio management director at franklin templeton believes the trend is set to continue with rate cuts in various markets such as india brazil russia and mexico coupled with improving earnings expectations and relatively undemanding valuations and dividend yields we believe the outlook for em equities remains attractive he says we expect overall corporate earnings to strengthen in 2020 as upturns in some parts of the technology sector offer support but for maarten jan bakkum senior emerging markets strategist at nn investment partners nnip the emerging markets growth outlook for the next few years is bleak for both bonds and equities his not so optimistic forecast is due to limited growth coming from demographic drivers and from china as well as negative growth due to higher levels of protectionism global interest rates remain low enough to sustain yield searching portfolio flows to em debt but these positive capital flows are unlikely to compensate for the expected slowdown in foreign direct investments to em he says a decade of underperformance for emerging markets equities should create room for better performance in the future but if growth remains as weak as we think it will it remains hard to make a convincing investment case and though em debt looks better at first sight with local currency bond yields at 5 the risk reward is challenging particularly given the increasing political risk he says taking to the streets one risk that is not being priced in according to gustavo medeiros a fixed income portfolio manager at ashmore group is inequality inequality is the big issue that we re going to have to grapple with over the next ten years in terms of causing volatility and concern basically because of the way the system is anchored today he says not only was inequality the root cause of the 2008 mortgage debt crisis medeiros says but it is also a driving force behind demonstrations in many emerging markets countries from beirut to santiago in lebanon for example where people have been taking to the streets since october bond prices are at 30 year to date following a mass sell off while the index is up around 12 according to medeiros a lot also hangs on us politics especially with an election on the horizon next year where the inequality issue could also play a key part he says inequality is going to be a very strong force for people and how policy decisions are made across the world that s going to start becoming a reality in 2020 with the election in the us the outcome of the us election could have a trickle down effect on emerging markets if the government swings to the left it would have a very strong impact in terms of capital flows which could cause a spike in volatility though medeiros says volatility tends to create opportunities for active investors at some point when enough is priced in you can take the opportunity to buy some exposure if us chinese or european growth plummets emerging markets will suffer but even if the us economy grows at a better rate compared to the rest of the world and the fed looks to raise rates it won t bode well for emerging markets assets either says sergey dergachev lead emerging markets debt manager at union investments a lot depends on the path of the us dollar this year it has not been that volatile but a key risk will be strong and quick us dollar appreciation and the risk of more renminbi depreciation and its second round effect for emerging markets currencies he says bakkum at nnip says em currency risk remains high due to the difficult global trade outlook and the depreciation trend of the chinese renminbi trade uncertainty remains and protectionism is likely to affect growth in em in the coming years for morningstar s kruger there are competitive advantages in several technology and consumer related companies according to him they have the potential to extend their market positions even in a challenging environment franklin templeton s sehgal is of a similar mind technology is expected to become a key driver of global growth especially in emerging markets where companies have been using innovation and technology to leapfrog and disrupt traditional business models he says increasing internet use in emerging markets is also accelerating opportunities for efficiencies cost savings and the general ease of doing business sehgal adds medeiros describes emerging markets as like small ships navigating this sea of liquidity which is mainly driven by the reserve currency of the world and with the european central bank already at what he calls a reverse rate any more interest rate cuts could also have unintended consequences country selection choosing which emerging market and which sector to invest in is key dergachev says this year we had positive support from monetary policy feedback but there are many geopolitical hotspots like hong kong latin america chile ecuador bolivia etc it will be crucial to determine where country specific risks will either ebb down or where there is potential that they will critically affect institutions and a country s credit metrics so careful country and corporate selection will matter a lot one country medeiros cites for opportunities for those who can stomach them is argentina where bonds are trading at around 45 cents to the dollar assets are relatively cheap there and there is the prospect of a strong rebound from the perspectives of both bond prices and economic growth if alberto fernandez proves to be more pragmatic increases taxation of the market closes the primary deficit of their fiscal account so it becomes a primary surplus argentina could reprofile its debt he says polina kurdyavko senior portfolio manager and head of emerging market debt at bluebay asset management also sees opportunity in argentina where other investors might shy away the recent uptick in volatility has created a good entry point and even in argentine assets we believe that the market reaction is overdone she says kurdyavko believes that risk posed by trade issues economic growth and brexit have decreased emerging markets credit remains resilient with a supportive backdrop for emerging markets performance the generally dovish tone from global central banks is counterbalancing weakened global growth the value trade remains in foreign exchange and higher yielding hard currency bonds but for this trade to perform there needs to be less concern over a global recession mainstream em countries with positive reform momentum will be rewarded she says whatever unfolds in the geopolitical landscape next year is going to be crucial for emerging markets investors both in equities and debt thanks to factors like the us election one thing investors can be sure of is that this uncertainty is not going away any time soon especially when it comes to the us and chinese diplomatic squabbles it is a recurring theme that crops up again and again any escalation in the us china trade war says medeiros and all bets are off 2019 funds europe
overview equities have begun new year like well last year with most asia pacific markets advancing led by more than 1 gains in china hong kong and thailand only south korea and indonesian markets fell in europe the dow jones stoxx 600 is up almost 1 in late morning turnover us shares are trading higher as well and the s p 500 is up nearly 0 6 core benchmark 10 year yields are up 1 2 basis points

the pboc announced a 50 bp cut in the required reserve ratio for bank effective monday january 6 the move had been hinted at in the chinese media and by premier li keqiang recently the move will free up an estimated cny800 bln 114 5 bln and reduce banks funding costs which in turn is expected to be passed on to corporate borrowers this suggests the benchmark one year loan prime rate will likely fall when it is set later this month january 20 the required reserves ratios are set currently at 13 for large banks and 11 for smaller banks which remains among the highest in the world there is scope for additional reductions in the coming year observers and investors debate over the reason that the pboc is easing policy some argue it is due to the weakening economy and others see a preemptive move ahead of the significant liquidity needs around the lunar new year january it does not have to be an either or proposition chinese actions often appear designed to meet more than one

would probably attend and is not clear what has changed still it would seem naive to think that it was a meaningless coincident or that the two schedules are so tight than a mutually agreed upon date was impossible to find at some unspecified date in the future trump indicated he would go to beijing to start phase two talks the federal reserve succeeded in dampening the year end funding squeeze

fed would have to intensify its efforts and possibly even purchases of long term assets rather than bills however now the debate has shifted toward how the fed weens the market off its largesse the imf s composition of official foreign exchange reserves cofer is the most authoritative source of international reserve data it is reported at the end of every quarter with a quarter lag the q3 data were reported on december 31 the value of reserves is reported in us dollars so exchange rates can and do influence the time series in the third quarter all the major currencies fell against the dollar including nearly 4 2 decline by the euro and a 3 2 decline in sterling the yen slipped by a minor 0 2 central banks hold roughly 11 66 trillion in currency reserves of which the currency allocation of about 10 93 trillion is reported and of those allocated reserves 6 75 trillion are in usd denominated investments this is almost 27 bln less than at the end of q2 19 but nonetheless its share edged up to 61 78 from 61 49 the dollar value of euro reserves fell by about 53 7 bln and its share slipped to a little below 20 1 its smallest share in a couple of years the dollar value of yen holdings rose by 2 bln and its share rose to 5 6 its highest since 2000 the chinese yuan depreciated by nearly 4 against the us dollar in the july september yet the dollar value of reserves increased by about 2 5 bln to 219 6 bln over the past year its share of allocated reserves has edged higher to 1 8 to 2 the us dollar sold off to record the lows for the year on new year s day eve against the canadian dollar to almost cad1 2950 it is consolidating today and holding below cad1 30 the thin market conditions may have exaggerated the price action the mexican peso is firm near its best level since last april the us dollar is trading between mxn18 85 and mxn18 95 essentially the range it was in before new year s the dollar index is firm but it remains near the five month lows set earlier

4th president of the world bank group january 1 1963 march 31 1968 george david woods 1901 1982 woods came to the bank full of vigor and with strong views about the changing role of the bank his bank would not be the same as the bank of his predecessor eugene black he would transform the bank by putting his own ideas to work in the process he became one of the bank s most innovative presidents reinforcing the bank s role as a development institution and preparing it for the global development role it was to play woods recognized the evolving state of development and moved the bank to meet the new challenges the horizons of bank lending expanded economic analysis took a central role ifc was strengthened and aid coordination through the rapid expansion of consultative groups allowed more effective use of donor resources woods oversaw the evolution of the bank from a primarily conservative financial institution to a development institution by redirecting its focus and resources to the analysis of development and the support of more relevant economic activities he emphasized the importance of ida and pushed for an increase in the bank s level of activity his grand assize represented the larger global role of the bank in correcting the disparity between rich and poor north and south his successors would further elaborate the scope of the bank s activities in its global position personal history george woods was born in boston in 1901 after high school he entered the work force as an office boy at harris forbes co a leading underwriter of municipal and utility bonds he quickly made his talents evident and the company s senior executives persuaded him to attend night school in banking and finance he became a buyer in the underwriting department and at age 26 was promoted to vice president responsible for major projects in 1930 the firm was acquired by chase bank and woods was made vice president of the new firm he later became vice president and member of the board of first boston corporation a newly formed securities company first boston became one of america s largest investment banking firms and woods played a major role in the firm s most successful bond issues in 1947 he became one of two executive vice presidents in 1948 chairman of the executive committee and in 1951 chairman of the board woods became an acknowledged master of corporate finance because he was innovative and not limited by conventions in dealing with the problems emphasis on development woods oversaw the evolution of the bank from a primarily conservative financial institution to a development institution by redirecting its focus and resources to the analysis of development and the support of more relevant economic activities under woods the bank analyzed the factors that hindered growth in developing countries trade barriers and changing terms of trade limited export earnings and opportunities heavy burdens of external debt lack of diversification in the structure of production weak institutions and shortages of skills and economic and financial policies which failed to support effective mobilization and allocation of resources given the wide range of difficulties woods saw that the bank would have to add new dimensions to both its lending and technical assistance activities mr black 3rd world bank president and mr woods woods moved the bank beyond the analysis of country creditworthiness to a more comprehensive country focus to do this he greatly increased the numbers and importance of economists within the bank staff he expanded the role of the economists into development economics analyzing the issues debt trade and others which affected the performance and prospects of the developing world woods appointed irving friedman formerly of the imf as the economic adviser to the president and greatly expanded the economic staff friedman revitalized the staff economic committee and sought to influence decision making in the operational field he advocated country performance as the most important criterion for lending and for regular consultations and active policy dialogues with the bank s borrowing members in addition to strengthening the role of economists woods looked to strengthen the younger professional staff of the institution the bank had typically recruited staff in mid career but in 1963 the junior professional program later young professional program was instituted as a means of recruiting graduates from leading universities development agenda woods believed that the bank needed early intervention in the development process and continue its involvement to the later stages this belief led woods to promote a more serious involvement by the bank in agriculture a sector in developing countries that predominated as an employer and a source of demand and a vital resource in a world of sharply increasing population while the bank had previously supported large scale investment projects such as irrigation flood control and land clearance woods thought the bank should be more involved in activities that had a direct impact on agricultural operations such as land settlement farm credit livestock production seed improvement grain storage facilities and training and extension work woods established two permanent missions in africa nairobi and abidjan composed of specialists in agriculture and transportation woods belief in early intervention also meant an increased emphasis on education as a focus for bank lending the bank s first funding for education had occurred three months before woods came to the bank woods believed that secondary and vocational schools would have a rapid impact on development by providing middle level manpower and specialists in agriculture administration and other areas crucial to economic growth he greatly increased the level of funding for educational projects and by the end of 1967 the bank and ida had financed a total of 142 6 million for 18 different education projects 80 of these projects came from ida concessional funds and 60 of these projects were for african countries woods also emphasized the role of industry as a nucleus for stimulating economic development he realized that the bank s requirement for government guarantees for development projects could hinder private enterprise and thus stressed an increased role for the international finance corporation ifc the bank group s private sector arm in industrial investments accordingly he transferred the industrial projects staff from the bank to ifc and directed that the bank lend capital to ifc which could be used for investment in member countries without the need for a government guarantee he called for larger commitments by the ifc and for the ifc to make direct loans to its clients without equity features woods considered the growth of population one of the major obstacles to economic development but stopped short of claiming a role for the bank in this field each country within the framework of its own culture and its own social values must decide for itself whether and if so by what means to control population growth the importance of this issue can hardly be overemphasized mobilizing resources woods came to the bank with a clear sense of the important role the bank would play in the development field he recognized that the development problem was a uniquely economic problem not only one of the many issues within the context of the east west conflict and he clearly recognized the impediments facing the bank s poorest members he believed that ida with its concessional lending terms would play an increasingly important role in the world bank group mr woods and mr pattberg chairman of the first boston corporation sign documents regarding bond issue being sold by world bank 1967 in 1964 woods introduced the practice of transferring a portion of the bank s net income to ida rather than automatically transferring the surplus to the bank s reserves as had been the practice between 1964 and 1966 the bank transferred some 200 million to ida demonstrating the shift in the character of the bank from an institution governed strictly by banking principles to one that focused on development with the decrease of ida replenishment by 1967 woods recommended a token transfer of 10 million to ida thereby displeasing both the donor countries which thought that no transfer should take place and the developing countries which thought that the amount was insufficient but woods saw the need for concessional lending as a responsibility for the entire bank group not as an issue for ida alone he proposed that the bank modify its terms of lending by extending the grace period and the maturity of loans to better match the requirements of extended project implementation periods and the slow attainment of borrower capacity woods promoted the concept of aid coordination to provide more effective targeting of foreign assistance from various sources the first year of woods presidency saw the creation of the first bank organized consultative group for colombia and by 1967 there were eleven aid coordinating groups in existence he also recognized the need for close cooperation with the united nations and felt that the bank should work closely with the specialized agencies such as the food and agriculture organization fao and the united nations educational scientific and cultural organizations unesco a cooperative agreement with the fao in 1964 helped initiate a large number of ida projects in the agriculture sector the bank also served as executing agency for a large number of undp financed studies woods realized that the burden of external debt as a major difficulty for developing countries in his view the problem was not excessive borrowing as long as the borrowing was put to productive uses but the rate of interest and the structure of the debt he appealed to donor countries to soften the terms of their assistance and urged developing countries to act not according to internal politics or narrow self interest but to implement policies and conditions that would foster productive investment ensuring political and financial stability and reforming land tenure and tax systems he believed that the development process itself is essentially a matter of domestic effort for which no amount of external help can be a substitute in calling for structural reform woods served as advocate for the structural adjustment policies that the bank promoted in the early 1980s woods faced difficulties in expanding the bank s borrowing in the u s capital market congressional opposition prevented the bank from some borrowing in 1965 by the next year the bank was still facing difficulties raising funds and woods began to worry that the bank might not be able to borrow the funds it needed to meet its obligations to its borrowers lending commitments declined from 1965 through the end of woods tenure and at one point woods briefly suspended all lending activity by the bank the grand assize mr and mrs woods greet staff at the bank s christmas party 1962 woods presidency was a period of unusual ferment in the field of economic development the 1960s had been declared the un development decade and donors had high hopes that development goals could be reached within a short period of time but toward the end of the decade donor funding was stagnating the economic outlook of borrowing countries was not improving as rapidly as envisioned and developed countries were facing their own budgetary crises the sluggish economic performance of the developing countries in asia and latin america contrasted sharply with the postwar prosperity in europe and japan in addition newly independent african countries presented significant challenges to economic development realizing these constraints woods looked for extraordinary means for increasing development funding in 1967 he spent a weekend with like minded people to discuss these problems the result of these discussions was the call for a commission of authoritative experts to examine the state of development and to propose to political leaders and the public at large the steps necessary for maintaining hope and progress in an address to the swedish bankers association in october 1967 woods unveiled his proposal for a grand assize of experts to examine the development problem although this commission headed by lester pearson of canada came into existence after woods departure from the bank woods sponsorship of this body and his linking it to the world bank gave greater prominence than it may otherwise have had investment disputes woods recognized that the developing countries needs could never be satisfied by the bank and ifc by themselves and that private foreign investment was essential but many foreign investors were hesitant to become involved in some countries for fear of government expropriation of assets or other acts which discouraged private investments woods sought to overcome this hesitation by allaying investor fears he embraced the proposal by aron broches the bank s general counsel to establish a facility which could resolve investment disputes in october 1966 the international centre for settlement of investment disputes icsid was established which provided much needed assurance for foreign private investors funding for ida mobilizing resources for ida was a challenge throughout woods tenure he was in the bank at the time of the first ida replenishment in 1963 but by the mid 1960s development funding was stagnating at a time when the income of the industrial countries was rising and the capacity of the developing countries to absorb development financing was also increasing he proposed a highly ambitious target for ida s second replenishment 1 billion annually but this target met stiff opposition in the developed world which after the initial optimism of the early 1960s was beginning to experience donor fatigue woods personal negotiating style did not help donors felt that he was playing them off against each other and it was not until the responsibility for ida negotiations was transferred from woods to vice president burke knapp that the second replenishment of ida for 400 million per year was agreed to india india represented both the challenges and the successes of the development field woods had been fascinated by india since his time at first boston when he made several trips to india at the request of the world bank for financing various projects and his interest in the country remained high during his tenure at the bank one of the many measures related to india during woods tenure was the supplemental agreement to provide additional funding for the indus basin works in india and pakistan mr subramanian minister of agriculture of india and mr woods 1965 in his efforts to help india woods pushed the bank to innovative approaches due to its lack of foreign exchange india suffered from shortages of raw materials and spare parts woods urged lending policies that would allow maintenance import loans the bank began to provide funds for raw materials and spare parts through a series of annual program loans these program loans were accepted only hesitantly by the executive directors and each was examined in detail to determine their worthiness in addition woods decided that the bank should participate in a debt relief exercise india was not in danger of default but woods saw that debt service absorbed a major portion of its export earnings and deprived the economy of badly needed foreign exchange he placed up to 50 million of india s debt service payments on deposit in the reserve bank of india the bank participated with other creditors in the india consortium in general debt relief these actions were highly controversial and the executive directors approved them with reluctance only two weeks before woods left the bank but relations between india and the bank were taking a down turn india also became a target of the critics of foreign aid who were becoming skeptical of the efficacy of foreign assistance in response woods sent bernard bell to carry out a comprehensive review of the country s economy the bell mission was met with little enthusiasm by the indian government bell s report recommended many policy changes including simplification of the elaborate controls system the introduction of intensified agricultural production and the devaluation of the indian currency in return the mission supported india s request for addition assistance especially quick disbursing assistance initially opposed to devaluation woods came to accept the recommendations of the bell report in response to pressure from the bank the imf and the u s treasury india devalued the rupee in 1966 through a combination of factors the devaluation was too small and it coincided with two serious droughts which required massive food imports and induced a sharp recession the predicted improvements in the indian economy did not materialize the indian government was furious they deeply resented the criticism of their performance and the pressure to reform the need to devalue was seen as a price to pay for needed foreign assistance and when this assistance failed to materialize the indian government and press blamed the bank and woods personally an ironic turn considering woods great love for and interest in the country
introduction the 2020 us presidential election will have a profound impact on global energy markets and broad implications for us trade foreign energy and climate policies today the republican and democratic parties are farther apart on these issues than at any other moment in recent history the republican party led by us president donald j trump will continue to prioritize his energy dominance agenda this agenda favors expanded production and access to all fuels with a focus on abundant us fossil fuel resources and a sharply circumscribed role for emissions reductions and climate policy early proposals from the democratic presidential candidates suggest an alternative vision where formulating a national climate policy with an emphasis on largescale emissions reduction would foster rapid decarbonization through a massive investment in clean energy infrastructure and the deployment of zero and low carbon fuels throughout the us economy on foreign and trade policies a second trump administration will maintain its nationalistic and isolationist tone which prioritizes transactional relationships over conventional alliances and shared values reshoring of manufacturing and jobs will be at the heart of trade agreements although a democratic administration may share the sense of skepticism toward globalized and multilateral trade the party s leading presidential candidates firmly support the traditional us alliance system place greater emphasis on human rights and democracy and would enshrine leadership on climate change as a cornerstone of foreign relations and especially future trade agreements the competing visions of a republican and a democratic administration could hardly be more disparate this issue brief compares the salient energy policies under two scenarios the first is a reelected trump administration the second anticipates a democratic administration each scenario is collated under domestic energy climate change foreign and trade policies the authors conclude that industry and external stakeholders should prepare for a volatile outlook regardless of the outcome on november 3 2020 the deep and entrenched energy challenges that face the united states and the mounting pressure from climate change cannot be fully managed or surmounted by a single us presidential administration however dynamic much depends on the 2020 electoral cycle but policy uncertainty will persist regardless of the outcome of the election scenario one donald j trump is reelected the trump administration s energy agenda in its first term provides a guidepost for its probable approach in a second term on the domestic front this includes completing the deregulation agenda expanding domestic production and export dominance further curtailing the consideration of climate concerns in permitting of infrastructure and restricting the right of us states to exceed federal minimum environmental standards on the international stage a second term for trump will likely mean a constrained role for us leadership abroad and pursuit of bilateral trade agreements that protect domestic industries completing the deregulatory agenda the trump administration has pursued with varying degrees of success a robust slate of deregulatory policies throughout the us energy sector since the administration s earliest days us officials have prioritized the growth of us fossil fuel production and exports through a stated policy of energy dominance trump himself has proclaimed that under his leadership the golden era of american energy is now underway the administration has pursued a thorough rollback aimed at rewriting and in some cases rescinding a range of environmental and land use policies at the federal level at the us department of the interior doi the administration has curtailed protections in the endangered species act attempted to open nearly all of the outer continental shelf to offshore oil and gas leasing and replaced the obama era methane waste prevention rule at the environmental protection agency epa the administration has developed the affordable clean energy ace rule to replace the clean power plan finalized a new waters of the united states wotus rule to limit federal authority to block infrastructure under the clean water act relaxed emissions standards for new coal fired power plants under the new source performance standards and eased technical requirements and timelines for methane leak repair at the department of transportation the administration has proposed the safer affordable fuel efficient safe vehicles rule which would amend existing corporate average fuel economy cafe by retaining the model year 2020 standards for both programs through model year 2026 the epa meanwhile has tried to revoke california s waiver of preemption under section 209 of the clean air act to set tougher vehicle fuel efficiency standards perhaps most importantly the administration is using executive authority to assert federal supremacy over energy infrastructure in unprecedented ways it is developing new council on environmental quality ceq guidance on the implementation of the national environmental policy act and limiting states authority to stall or deny infrastructure under the clean water act an area particularly rife with tension between the federal government and progressive state governments that are skeptical of new fossil fuel infrastructure against this backdrop republican control of the us senate has proven instrumental most notably in the confirmation of key political appointees at the federal agencies who share the president s vision and have worked to implement it in a trump reelection scenario it is likely that the senate will remain in republican hands even if full control of congress proves elusive for the party accordingly our discussion below assumes a compliant republican controlled senate in a reelection scenario energy dominance encore the trump administration has prioritized expanded domestic fossil fuel production midstream infrastructure buildout and downstream export infrastructure e g new approvals for liquefied natural gas or lng export terminals as the core of energy dominance critically however many of the administration s hallmark efforts ace future corporate average fuel economy cafe standards and epa and doi methane regulation are just now seeing final or even draft rules announced in the federal register democratic state governments are vowing to fight these federal efforts in court more broadly federal rulemaking is deliberately slow leaving ample time for litigation and may ultimately end up in the us supreme court which now has a conservative majority other efforts couched in executive authorities e g one federal decision protocol for permitting and time limits on environmental reviews do not carry the weight or impact of legislation and regulation these could be undone with a mere signature by a democratic administration despite the rollback of policies very little in the domestic energy space is settled as the campaign season swings into high gear the key question for energy producers in 2020 is will the trump administration s deregulatory pro fossil fuel agenda be entrenched or reversed in a reelection scenario entrenchment will prevail but not without consequences the administration will continue pursuing lower cost and regulatory barriers for permitting all types of fossil fuel projects the trump administration s april 2019 executive orders on infrastructure and permitting are meant to exert federal control over permitting the administration will defend the draft epa rules published on august 9 2019 limiting state and tribal authorities under section 401 of the clean water act if the administration is successful states and interested stakeholders may be increasingly handicapped when it comes to opposing or even delaying new infrastructure buildouts by requesting stays or seeking to overturn existing permits by challenging the administration s implementation of federal environmental laws these issues are unlikely to be decided in the courts by november 2020 but likely will be by 2024 lower courts have already rejected several of the fast track regulatory decisions because they contravene federal legislation of the marquee cases at the center of the regulatory battles as of october 4 2019 the us supreme court has agreed to hear the case concerning atlantic coast pipeline s acp previously revoked forest service permit during the court s current term in the meantime the lower courts are divided even the eventual supreme court ruling will not fully decide acp s fate and numerous pertinent issues remain unresolved among various levels of regulators a doubling down on federal supremacy over permitting will if successful improve the outlook for fossil fuel operators and builders invested in these massive projects and raise the prospects for oil and gas production takeaway capacity and exports at the federal energy regulatory commission ferc trump s reelection would ensure a republican majority on the key five member commission entrusted with reviewing and approving infrastructure for interstate transmission of electricity natural gas and oil with the departure of commissioner cheryl lafleur at the end of august 2019 two of five seats at the commission are vacant ferc will as a result likely move more slowly through ongoing applications and project decisions a reelected trump administration will bring ferc to full strength with a republican majority facilitating expeditious approval timelines for applicants and a likely favorable view of fossil fuel midstream infrastructure e g oil gas and product pipelines and export projects e g lng terminals although recent legal setbacks may require ferc to conduct more thorough reviews of downstream greenhouse gas ghg emissions for fossil fuel infrastructure applications a republican majority at ferc under a trump administration would neither require operators to calculate the upstream or downstream impact of their projects nor offset emissions so long as the permits themselves can withstand legal scrutiny us land under lease to oil and gas developers february 12 2006 flickr us bureau of land management wyoming on land use a reelection would empower the administration to continue opening public lands and possibly offshore acreage for oil and gas leasing despite significant opposition from local and tribal organizations one analysis earlier in 2019 estimated that the doi has offered nearly 16 8 million acres of federal land for oil and gas leasing since trump took office with a centerpiece effort to open as much as 1 6 million acres in the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr in alaska a reelected administration will double down on these efforts recent efforts to revise to the national endangered species act and alter specific species protections e g for the greater sage grouse in major oil and gas producing states are designed to ease new private upstream development although some of these efforts are already facing litigation plans to restrict or rewrite protections for ecologically sensitive or cultural sites e g the new bears ears oil and gas leasing program have similar goals these outcomes may not be confined to on shore the doi s efforts to rewrite the five year offshore leasing plan ended ignominiously earlier in 2019 as a result of fervent state opposition spearheaded by bipartisan governors from coast to coast an administration guaranteed four more final years could resurrect the five year plan and open huge swaths of the us coastline to new oil and gas drilling without fear of political repercussion a successful effort to revamp and finalize the extant five year plan would make a successor administration s job of curtailing it more arduous and time consuming curtailed climate policy in the second term the united states is due to withdraw formally from the paris agreement on the morning after the election november 4 2020 since trump announced his decision in june 2017 to withdraw the united states unilaterally from the climate pact us delegations have had limited participatory engagement with the subsequent conferences of the parties cops and the president has undertaken a secondary campaign to expunge climate science in total from official white house committees and documents if reelected trump will not pause the us withdrawal from the paris agreement and the administration will fall back on its skeptical isolationist position vis à vis global climate policy lacking firm us leadership the parties to the paris agreement may be increasingly hard pressed to implement its terms and maintain global cohesion on the need to reduce emissions quickly in the united states the trump administration will prioritize a hands off approach to the regulation of all types of ghg emissions especially carbon dioxide and methane a second trump administration would defend the inside the line approach of the finalized ace rule published on june 19 2019 which relies on limited internal efficiency improvements at existing power plants to achieve modest emissions reductions methane emissions will likely rise with one estimate projecting 480 000 tons of additional methane emissions by 2025 on the back of growing production and limited takeaway capacity if revised epa regulations are fully implemented all of this may suggest a rosy outlook for producers and operators and continued bearish signals for oil and gas markets from more us supply but there are some important caveats most importantly progressive state governments will not easily bend to a reelected trump they will most likely redouble their efforts to curtail fossil fuel infrastructure and enforce robust climate policies and emissions reductions in lieu of federal leadership the president can only push federal supremacy so far states and municipalities retain important rights to regulate land use and water quality operators may find opposition as strident as ever with denial of local permits occurring more quickly and frequently grassroots activism in opposition to infrastructure is rising especially as young consumers learn to use their power to influence corporate behavior e g the rising tide against single use plastic polling data is clear that young americans across the political spectrum are deeply troubled by climate change and may be ready to use their dollars accordingly populist driven consumer or product boycotts targeted at industry and partner companies as well as pressure on the major investment firms to divest from fossil fuels could accelerate under a second trump term finally industry should not discount the risk of international backlash as overseas buyers particularly in europe look for additional ways to decarbonize trial efforts at international border adjustments for carbon may quickly follow unregulated methane flaring for example could be an impetus justifiable or not for new penalties on us lng even as the market remains hotly competitive for suppliers investment and climate disclosure or lack thereof is another area where pressure on us multinational companies will mount especially as european multinational companies press forward with mandated disclosures the trump administration has already tried via the securities and exchange commission sec to block climate focused corporate shareholder resolutions it is not clear however for how long the administration can insulate us companies from this particular rising tide fundamentally the trump administration s top priorities are the reshoring of us jobs and manufacturing and the delinking of global supply chains this stands in stark contrast to conventional us policy favoring multilateral trade and more robust market interconnections if it succeeds industry may find that us producers access to burgeoning international markets will ultimately contract over the long term a weakened hyper nationalist global economy bodes poorly for the gdp energy demand growth and ease of trade foreign policy will congress compete for control assuming that ongoing trends continue and major black swan scenarios e g eruption of a war in the middle east or a global recession are avoided the foreign policy outlook in a reelection scenario may still produce headwinds for industry the trump era has seen a rise in authoritarian and revanchist governments around the world repression of opposition parties targeting of minority populations intimidation of neighboring governments and expansion of regional or global hegemony in some cases with trump s tacit approval congressional reaction to authoritarian actions even if those actions have the blessing of the trump administration could produce sanctions and other obstacles to trade with russia china turkey or other countries russia will continue to upgrade its arctic facilities and military capacities as it looks for ways to develop the region s lucrative resources despite us sanctions a confident russian government certain of us neutrality may seek further inroads political military or otherwise in ukraine and the baltics the russo chinese alliance will persist as long as the supply and demand needs of both countries align and as long as the chinese view russian engagement as an inroad to the arctic in its own neighborhood china may be emboldened by a retrenched divided united states to attempt to control the south china sea more aggressively as it did throughout the summer of 2019 in vietnamese waters seek new ways to undermine hong kong and taiwan s autonomy and intimidate southeast asia wary of international entanglements the trump administration is unlikely to apply pressure or enforce consequences for rogue behavior the us congress may be less acquiescent even with the senate safely in republican hands maintaining pressure on russia and perhaps also iran to a lesser extent is one area where lawmakers could unite across the aisle especially if provoked by the executive branch via tweet or otherwise the surge in sanctions legislation throughout trump s first term is likely a trend marker future sanctions bills targeting adversarial energy producers could boomerang back to us industry if us retrenchment continues congress will not hesitate to use its most powerful toolset to take back the reins us president donald trump appears before workers at cameron lng export facility in hackberry louisiana may 14 reuters leah millis the administration will continue to prioritize bilateral alliances with governments including in israel and saudi arabia that oppose iran this strategy has already fostered instability in the middle east especially as tehran opts for kinetic asymmetric responses to us pressure such as the attacks in september 2019 on saudi oil processing infrastructure the trump administration has not as yet articulated exactly what a new deal with iran will entail and iran will seek fresh leverage before it commits to any humiliating compromises trade policy more tariffs ahead the trump administration has left an indelible stamp on us trade policy this has been marked by a robust use of tariff powers shaking extant alliances and undermining decades of conventional wisdom in support of multilateral trade agreements in favor of a new brand of economic nationalism us tariffs on steel imports have raised the cost of energy infrastructure this protectionist agenda is far more likely to push manufacturers to different low wage countries even as automation accelerates globally retaliatory chinese tariffs have dramatically curtailed us oil and natural gas exports to china and have made financing lng export facilities that aspire to export to one of the world s fastest growing lng markets challenging frictions with mexico over steel and automobile tariffs and the threat of tariffs on goods to pressure mexico on migration issues have led to concerns in what is today the largest export market for us natural gas and petroleum products over the reliability of us natural gas exports these headwinds for us exports from trade tensions are likely to persist while the united states mexico canada agreement usmca may win ratification in 2020 the balance of the trump administration s trade agenda to negotiate comprehensive bilateral deals with europe japan and china is likely to be suspended pending the election results in 2020 if trump is reelected his administration may make slow progress toward negotiating final agreements but industry should not expect rapid or fully satisfactory results a second trump administration will thus likely mirror the first in terms of aggressive support for us fossil fuels limited engagement on any aspect of climate policy and a nationalistic trade and foreign policy agenda the key differences in a second term will be the ability to complete the first term s rulemaking to reshape regulatory bodies to achieve victory in the courts as republican appointees populate the judiciary and to refocus and potentially rebrand the united states as a supporter of economic nationalism transactional diplomacy and foreign policy restraint with the freedom and flexibility inherent to a new electoral mandate and the elimination of the pressure of campaigning a reelected administration will be less constrained than before to follow its deepest instincts and redesign us energy policy in its image in this environment finding areas of cooperation within congress and particularly between the legislative and executive branches will be challenging nevertheless there are a few areas where republicans and democrats may be able to work together in congress as we have seen over the past two years it is likely that both sides of the political aisle will defend a robust budget for the department of energy especially its research and development capacities as well as the national laboratories certain technologies especially efficiency carbon cap ture sequestration and transport battery storage and hydrogen production and fuel cell development could find enough support among bipartisan coalitions even if some on both sides are not fully on board with all of these emerging toolsets and their respective applica tions importantly however a recalcitrant white house that pushes full steam ahead with deregulation could be a problematic ally to congressional republicans seeking to build bipartisan support in any of these areas making compromise more challenging scenario two election of a democratic president it is impossible to project with certainty which two individuals will populate the 2020 democratic ticket let alone the final details of their energy and climate proposals nevertheless the baseline for a future democratic platform has been clearly demarcated in recent months the future of any such proposals depends heavily on the eventual makeup of congress as we have seen under trump the white house has considerable power to steer policy by virtue of executive authority but any major decisions on government spending require congressional input and oversight even if democrats take the senate in 2020 their majority will not be filibuster proof while it is possible to end the filibuster even democrats are divided over crossing this rubicon and opting instead for a liberal use of budget authority requiring a simple majority to pass is more likely governing as ever is far removed from campaigning our scenarios assume that a democratic administration will face serious congressional and likely judicial limitations on what it can and cannot implement if not a divided government outright a climate focused energy policy if a trump reelection means doubling down then a democratic victory will mean doubling back with a return to the 2016 status quo as the minimum starting point a democratic administration will be deeply skeptical of new fossil fuel infrastructure especially large interstate and international projects where public opposition from activists for example the keystone pipeline is all but guaranteed it will be sympathetic to national and grassroots activists who oppose new buildouts and may tacitly support state level efforts to delay or refuse new fossil fuel projects a democratic president might prefer to strengthen the national environmental policy act nepa to clarify the scope of climate and emissions reductions disclosure and include explicit mitigation mandates in federal environmental law in the absence of democratic control of congress a democratic administration would revise the ceq guidance and regulations as the trump administration is doing now but in the opposite direction as the next best option certainly a democratic administration will return to obama era policies around the implementation of the clean air and clean water acts and revive its expansive wotus definition to slow or constrain new buildout at ferc a democratic administration will at minimum fill out the agency with two new democratic commissioners it will likely seek commissioners whose records suggest support for measurement and offset of significant ghg emissions for major infrastructure projects as articulated by current democratic commissioner richard glick us sen elizabeth warren d ma a democratic presidential candidate has suggested an overhaul and renaming of ferc to federal renewable energy commission with the stated mission of reducing ghg pollution ironically a democratic administration may be inclined to employ trump era tools specifically federal supremacy an administration with ambitious renewables generation goals for example may try to expedite federal approvals for locally controversial infrastructure e g offshore wind fields the democratic presidential candidates and much of the electorate at large agree on the importance of expanding renewables generation the most ambitious plans envision a wholesale replacement of fossil fuel energy throughout the us economy in power generation buildings and transportation demanding that utilities achieve 100 percent clean renewable electricity by the 2030s for example would be an unprecedented and prescriptive intrusion of federal power into the us electricity markets and infrastructure investment decisions moreover hard political realities may temper these proposals when it is time to craft policy one recent estimate suggests that taken together there are nearly one million jobs in the petroleum coal and natural gas sectors while a further 130 000 americans are employed in fossil fuel power generation in addition millions more livelihoods builders retailers public service providers are adjacent to or supported by the energy industries the impacts on labor of a rapid systemic transformation will require careful attention as will the unavoidable impacts of a rapid systemic shift on the us gross domestic product gdp and wall street with serious and immediate consequences for retirees and others wind farm in turlock california unsplash american public power association a ban on new public lands leases for fossil fuel development could be an immediate high priority agenda item it is preeminent on nearly every democratic presidential candidate s platform beyond the relatively narrow confines of public lands a democratic administration will pursue quick high publicity wins for progressives these may include forbidding future leases in the anwr in alaska a revival of the restrictive obama era five year offshore plan or perhaps a moratorium on new offshore drilling the reinstatement of pre trump era species protections and the reestablishment of controversial protections for sensitive ecological regions and national parks beyond the relatively small percentages of oil and gas currently produced on public lands it is much less clear how a democratic administration would pursue the more complicated goals of stopping or preventing specific forms of fossil fuel production everywhere as some progressive candidates have vowed some proposals from the most vociferously progressive candidates indicate that they will ban hydraulic fracturing on all us soil including privately owned land where the vast majority of us oil and gas is produced if private lands can be targeted for hydraulic fracturing further inroads against other types of upstream development are not inconceivable of course such ambitions will prove far easier said than realized getting little help from congress such efforts would likely force the administration into a long and difficult rule making process at epa and might prove legally vulnerable without legislative changes to the clean air and clean water acts faced with an expansive domestic policy agenda tax reform healthcare reform immigration gun control even an ambitious progressive administration may hesitate to expend that level of commitment to stall or outright block some types of fossil fuel development from sea to sea moreover the attacks on the saudi oil processing facilities at khurais and abqaiq in september 2019 highlighted the importance of energy self sufficiency for supply security and price stability even a democratic administration will be loath to cede the energy security that has been the focus of us energy strategy since 1973 until low carbon alternatives are readily available climate policy historically high ambitions every democratic presidential candidate has said that the united states will rejoin the paris agreement under their leadership since rejoining can be done via executive powers this will be a day one priority and will immediately reinvigorate the global conversation on climate change a democratic president will resubmit the us nationally determined contribution ndc a required submission for any party to the agreement and will likely commit to deeper emissions cuts over the original obama administration version in line with carbon neutrality by 2050 if the trump administration can defend the ace rule a democratic administration will need one to two years to develop and finalize a replacement akin to a clean power plan 2 0 a new plan must feature deep emissions cuts facilitated by a total phaseout of coal rapid uptick of renewable generation and constraints on new natural gas generation democrats are increasingly thinking in terms of economy wide emissions not simply replacing or phasing out coal fired power generation to secure what they see as critical deep reductions the transportation sector which is prominent in the green new deal and many democratic candidates climate strategies will be a target whereas the trump administration is looking to revoke california s state authorities under the clean air act to enforce tighter emissions standards a democratic administration may see the california standards as a baseline not ceiling for new cafe standards in a reinvigorated push toward fuel efficiency and technological innovation warren who has adopted many key tenets of the climate strategy of washington governor jay inslee s now defunct presidential campaign has promised historically ambitious efficiency standards reaching a requirement for 100 percent zero emissions for all new light and medium duty vehicles by 2030 cafe standards are among the policy areas where a democratic administration s priorities may dovetail with those of industry and the private sector notably some us and international automakers investing in high efficiency and low carbon technological improvements within their sectors for industry especially independent operators the most immediate changes of consequence may come in methane regulation the democratic candidates roundly agree that methane emission reductions are equally if not more important than reducing carbon dioxide emissions any democratic president will reinstate stricter technical and leak repair requirements for operators and demand measuring and reporting of methane leaks although some have vowed to go further in 2019 for example democratic candidate us sen cory booker d nj promised to institute a requirement for fossil fuel companies to stop methane leaks from both new and existing sources or face heavy penalties another candidate us sen bernie sanders d vt has suggested that if he were to become president the epa would regulate methane in the same way as it regulates other emissions such as carbon dioxide under the clean air act and will toughen the obama era rules on leak detection and repair these proposals could raise upstream costs throughout the domestic oil and gas sector limit supply and stall export growth indeed this outcome is the official goal for some candidates notably sanders and warren however a democratic administration particularly one facing a divided congress will labor under the same restraints that have slowed the trump era rollback rewriting rules and arguing for more expansive federal powers to pursue ambitious emissions reductions will be a multiyear process carrying the risk of legal defeat from the district courts up to the us supreme court these historically high ambitions may pose risks to a new democratic president as expectations may exceed the party s legislative mandate and the speed of the policy process however deeply a new administration is committed to its climate agenda the machinery of government grinds slowly an attempt to expedite it can mean stinging losses and wasted effort moreover a first term democratic president must be extremely careful with constituencies in swing states where the oil and gas industries are major employers and local economies are highly dependent on fossil fuels e g pennsylvania ohio and colorado a complete hydraulic fracturing ban now supported by some leading democratic candidates could dislocate rural and semi rural economies in these high value purple states a new administration cannot afford to anger these voters ahead of the 2022 midterms and a 2024 reelection campaign proposals to end crude or fossil fuel exports entirely face a similar problem the newly acquired mantle of net exporter status has economic benefits for american workers throughout the value chain and arguably climatic benefits overseas for asian markets looking for alternatives to coal for power generation and industry even if a progressive democrat is elected in 2020 the headiness of victory must sooner or later give way to the realities of governance to be sure the rapidly growing sectors around renewable and zero carbon energy production and operation will see a new dawn under a democratic presidency but there are important areas where conventional producers may be able to cooperate with democratic priorities prominent among these are carbon capture technologies utilization and storage as well as direct capture and carbon pricing both of which already enjoy strong and growing industry support and are popular among some of the 2020 democratic candidates carbon pricing in the united states faces an uphill battle in congress despite no lack of bills on the table carbon capture research and development on the other hand could find immediate and robust bipartisan support us industry is firmly behind improving available technologies and reducing costs as quickly as possible a democratic administration on the other hand may be inclined by virtue of necessity to prioritize carbon capture in order to cut near and medium term emissions growth in the midst of climate emergency a characterization that is increasingly a truism on the progressive left another emerging area where a democratic administration may bring federal resources to bear is promoting carbon sequestration through the agriculture sector where decarbonization alone has proven particularly difficult among the candidates mayor pete buttigieg has most prominently featured agriculture and rural communities more broadly in his climate proposals he has recommended refocusing usda s research and development budget to reduce agriculture s carbon emissions to net zero or even net negative and supporting soil management techniques geared towards optimizing carbon sequestration through techniques such as crop rotation advanced grazing methods and nitrogen management some of these proposals could feature in executive orders others such as financial incentives for farmers to sequester carbon may require congressional approval and tax code alterations it is less clear however if and how nuclear energy will figure into a democratic presidency the progressive left as epitomized by the sanders campaign is uncomfortable or neutral with respect to nuclear power the senator himself has listed nuclear among false solutions his administration would fight or deprioritize other campaigns former us vice president joe biden booker us sen amy klobuchar d mn and the now defunct inslee campaign are warmer toward nuclear power but remain concerned about waste management and safety like the oil and gas industries nuclear power has high state level salience and in some communities provides an economic lifeline recent state legislative efforts to preserve extant nuclear resources affirm the importance of nuclear facilities to local economies this is one area where the moderate progressive democratic divide may be in sharpest relief at the federal level but even a firmly progressive administration may hesitate before pushing back against local efforts in favor of nuclear infrastructure seeking a us competitive advantage and new job markets a democratic administration will also explore emerging fields in energy research and development specifically the advent of artificial intelligence and autonomous tools drones trucks sensory technology and would invest heavily in modernizing the us grid network within a broader infrastructure package while republicans are certainly not opposed to these technologies especially when used voluntarily and in support of conventional resource development democrats will favor mandatory applications to climate and emission reduction such as methane monitoring the conventional energy industries are already hard at work in these fields suggesting another potential open door for joint efforts with the agencies and residual benefits favoring the early movers in these new fields zero emission hydrogen fuel cell technology is another emerging storage solution alongside new types of battery storage that a democratic administration might pursue if clean hydrogen production can be cost efficient major international oil companies iocs notably total in japan are actively working on scaling up hydrogen fuel cell vehicles hydrogen research and development could be a source of bilateral cooperation as well given strong interest in japan and europe bipartisan support for us national energy laboratories for research and development and energy efficiency measures has had a leveling effect on republican and democratic administrations in the past and should provide significant opportunity for common ground in the future foreign policy strategic reassurance with a dose of climate policy democrats at every level of government have decried trump s approach to foreign policy particularly his administration s seeming overtures to authoritarian regimes and geostrategic adversaries a democratic administration especially a progressive one is unlikely to seek out foreign adventures nevertheless the united states post world war ii history is clear in our view that diplomacy backed by credible use of force is usually the most effective a democratic administration will likely rebuild and reempower its state department as part of a broader multilateral coalition centric vision for us leadership strategic reassurance to european asian and latin american allies will be a day one priority a new administration will vocally reaffirm the us commitment to nato the european union eu and the transatlantic partnership industry should beware that a new administration may demand further investigations into 2016 russian election interference and publicly back one or more of the major russia sanctions bills presently waiting to move in congress possibly facilitating a rapid passage within the first 100 days a new administration will likely maintain an adversarial relationship with china like the trump administration many democratic presidential candidates see chinese economic manipulation as the core challenge facing us workers and the manufacturing sector sanders has decried current trade and tax agreements that make it easier for multinational corporations to ship jobs overseas and throwing american workers out on the street warren has criticized china directly noting the suppression of pay and labor rights poor environmental protections and years of currency manipulation the more moderate mayor pete buttigieg of south bend indiana has affirmed a serious challenge from china that cannot be fixed through tariffs economic distortions aside democrats have a much longer list of concerns a new administration will likely press china on rising carbon emissions coal consumption and exports rampant human rights violations against religious and ethnic minorities efforts to dominate the south china sea and its regional neighbors and recent attempts to undermine democratic and populist movements in hong kong and taiwan using these issues as leverage a democratic administration may be able to stabilize the trade relationship with a limited agreement that includes drawing down the current expansive tariff regime on both sides especially if a deal could include a rapprochement on global climate priorities even a modest deal at this stage would be immediately beneficial for us crude and lng exports languishing under retaliatory tariffs but the long term us china relationship will likely remain more fractious than harmonious industry should not rest comfortably but should prepare for long term headwinds in the us relationship with the world s fastest growing energy consumer the starkest foreign policy reversal could come in the middle east where a democratic administration could cast a sharply critical eye on two of the trump administration s most important allies israel and saudi arabia in congress the democratic caucus is divided on support for both countries and foreign aid budgets will likely be contested bills that sought to limit arms sales or end the war effort in yemen that were rejected by trump earlier in 2019 might see a more welcome reception from a democratic president a democratic president might reopen investigations into the 2018 murder of washington post columnist jamal khashoggi at the saudi consulate in istanbul and could tacitly or vocally endorse a version of the justice against sponsors of terrorism act jasta legislation facilitating foreign lawsuits against saudi arabia in the event that the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec restrains oil production to levels that elevate oil prices to unpopular levels a democratic us department of justice investigation into opec as an anti trust matter with particular focus on the opec deal to prop up global oil prices could strongly appeal to the democratic base even as mere signaling twelve democratic us presidential candidates debate during the fourth us democratic presidential candidates 2020 election debate at otterbein university in westerville ohio october 15 2019 reuters shannon stapleton most democratic candidates support a renegotiation aimed at resurrecting the iran nuclear deal formally known as the joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa as with the trade agenda a jcpoa 2 0 will be a priority but iranian negotiators will find the bar for complete reversal of the secondary sanctions regime higher than in 2015 if a democratic administration can secure a handful of additional concessions on nonnuclear issues related to iran s regional conduct and ballistic missile program even if only on paper it can claim to have secured a deal superior to former us president barack obama s and accomplished what the trump administration never could in that scenario iranian crude exports presently down to 100 000 barrelsper day bpd from 2 5 million bpd in april 2018 should quickly bounce back with deeply bearish implications for global oil markets downward pressure on already limp crude prices an economic headwind to a new us administration could send opec starting with saudi arabia back to the drawing board or even running for cover trade policy fairer trade for growth and a counterweight to china democrats have so far struggled to craft an alternative answer to trump s unconventional trade agenda indeed many progressive democrats share the administration s basic skepticism toward multilateral trade but for wholly different reasons more broadly trump s vision of economic nationalism articulated since 2015 will not disappear from the minds of voters overnight democratic presidential candidates are divided into those seeking fairer trade and those who have found nearly all prior trade deals fatally flawed yet support for trade among democratic constituencies and the electorate overall is on the rise facing these countervailing forces democrats cannot simply patch up the trans pacific partnership tpp or transatlantic trade and investment partnership ttip rush to undo all existing trump era retaliatory or product specific tariffs offer a cordial handshake to beijing and proclaim that bygones are bygones however much industry and multinational corporations may hope nor will democrats be willing to admit that the trump administration succeeded on any front particularly trade it may however be willing to build on existing work done under the current us trade representative ustr seek stronger labor and environmental protections and craft what it will try to argue are better deals for which it can then claim credit the usmca is a case in point house democrats insisted on stronger enforcement labor and environmental provisions and won sufficient gains to obtain the support of the afl cio with so many democrats in swing districts dependent on trade speaker pelosi agreed on an updated usmca with bipartisan support passage is likely in 2020 beyond north american trade industry should expect a much warmer us mexico relationship especially under a more progressive democratic administration which will be sympathetic to leftist mexican president andrés manuel lópez obrador amlo and his efforts to work with the united states on immigration if the ongoing negotiations over export pipelines into mexico can be resolved south of the border a democratic administration will be hard pressed to block increased gas exports to mexico despite likely tepid support within a democratic administration for fossil fuels exports a us eu and a more comprehensive us japan agreement may quickly follow an approved usmca as a democratic administration will be keen for first year wins and public reaffirmation of important strategic alliances via trade relationships there may be consideration given to finding a way for the united states to join a rebranded tpp 12 as a counterweight to china although industry can confidently expect that major trade deals will go through and meet a supportive congress it should not expect a bright future for investor state dispute settlement isds protections the current ustr has pushed back against comprehensive isds throughout its extensive negotiations on the usmca and there appears to be no constituency on the other side of the aisle wishing to revive it the agreements will come eventually but investors should anticipate higher investment risk than they previously enjoyed democrats will not simply polish trump era agreements and move them through congress they will try to augment future agreements with progressive flavor through environmental side agreements and possibly climate policy demands environmental issues among others have been a sticking point between the ustr and house democrats on the uscma the democratic presidential candidates across the ideological spectrum appear united on integrating climate strategy into a new trade agenda biden has said his administration will impose carbon adjustment fees or quotas on carbon intensive goods from countries that are failing to meet their climate and environmental obligations and condition future trade agreements on partners commitments to meet their enhanced paris climate targets warren has promised that any potential free trade agreement partner must pass a litmus test including membership in the paris agreement with an independently verifiable national emissions reduction plan and the elimination of domestic fossil fuel subsidies all of these requirements may prove fungible and negotiable in practice but climate policy will become a core component of any new trade agenda as a means to shore up domestic progressive constituencies and put pressure on carbon intensive economies overseas to clean up their act or risk losing access to us markets the utility of trade as a driver of global climate policy and the need for wider coalitions to address chinese and russian revanchism may make a fairer trade policy a focal point of a democratic administration s international economic policy the more things stay the same volatility ahead the disparity between the old and a potentially new administration can be fairly described as a sea change with numerous immediate and near term implications for energy markets producers and operators both scenarios present their own challenges as well as bearish and bullish market signals in this sense the 2020 election is profoundly consequential unfortunately the broader context suggests that the major overarching challenges facing the us and global energy markets will remain unresolved nowhere is this problem more stark than with climate change whichever administration takes office in january 2021 it will not be able to solve the long term energy transition puzzle that has bedeviled policy makers and their increasingly angry constituents the world over overseas especially in developing asia emissions growth continues to accelerate while low and zero carbon fuels struggle to compete against cheap native coal resources entrenched local and national interests challenging land use and geographic problems subsidized power prices uncompetitive investment frameworks and extant young coal infrastructure despite some new efforts including the 2018 better utilization of investment leading to development build act to facilitate modern infrastructure in developing countries us diplomacy and money is far behind on the climate challenge within the united states the democratic primary has shown just how far the progressive climate agenda has become mainstream all of the democratic candidates are focused on the urgency of climate change and the drastic measures needed to fight it the green new deal has thrown down the gauntlet for both parties as its advocates will remain a vocal wild card for years to come trump s reelection will frustrate and motivate these constituencies while a new democratic administration will find itself facing unrelenting pressure and a steep list of demands most of which will be beyond the political capacity or willpower of any singular presidential administration against this backdrop the physical consequences of climate change will intensify and growing numbers of moderate and independent voters will demand a more comprehensive and effective response from the federal government in short us energy policy is quickly entering uncharted waters it is not at all clear that any one candidate has viable solutions for the breadth and complexity of the challenges ahead while these issues remain unresolved industry should expect that the politics around us production of all fuels permitting processes the evolving us

we all were worried in 2019 says michael gapen chief u s economist at barclays investment bank even now we don t see a lot of catalysts for a major pickup in growth but our global growth outlook is still stronger for the united states many forecasters now believe growth will remain positive with the pace slackening to a low in the first quarter or half and then beginning to improve according to this view global growth will follow a similar path as fears of tighter monetary policies and a u s china trade war have eased between the u s china trade war and the uncertainties of brexit 2019 was marked by economic anxiety the turn of 2020 may come as a sigh of relief the improved outlook as the world economy enters 2020 offers promise for everyone from workers benefiting from a tight labor market to investors who enjoyed a sparkling 2019 and look forward to solid stock returns in 2020 it could also have political implications since strong economies tend to benefit political incumbents seeking reelection this year that includes president donald trump last year stock traders and economists widely predicted a u s recession in 2020 or certainly by 2021 the risk isn t totally gone but perspectives have grown more optimistic lately a nuanced optimism has crept into the stock markets and forecasts about the world economy where traders and economists once predicted a u s recession in 2020 or certainly by 2021 many now believe instead that growth will remain positive this year with the pace slackening to a low in the first quarter or half and then chugging forward at a moderate rate according to this view global growth will follow a similar path that outlook suggests good prospects for everyone from workers benefiting from a tight labor market to investors who enjoyed a sparkling 2019 and look forward to solid stock returns in 2020 it could also have political implications since strong economies tend to benefit political incumbents seeking reelection this year that includes president donald trump why we wrote this between the u s china trade war and the uncertainties of brexit 2019 was marked by economic anxiety the turn of 2020 may come as a sigh of relief we all were worried in 2019 says michael gapen chief u s economist at barclays investment bank the u s china trade war was escalating job growth was slowing in the service sector even now we don t see a lot of catalysts for a major pickup in growth but our global growth outlook is still stronger behind this shift in outlook is the resolution or expected resolution of four key uncertainties that weighed on markets during much of 2019 a phase one u s china trade deal a replacement for the north american free trade agreement nafta brexit and monetary policy for the leading central banks with paths becoming clearer for all four the crystal ball for 2020 appears a little less foggy giving businesses more confidence to invest in new products and factories the global economy seems to have dodged a recession says nariman behravesh chief economist of ihs markit in a recent report last summer the business information provider pegged the risks of a 2020 recession at 1 in 3 it now puts it at only 1 in 5 perhaps the biggest sigh of relief came in december when the united states and china said they would sign a deal this month that puts at least a temporary stop to their tit for tat trade war instead of tariff increases on chinese goods which mr trump had threatened to institute dec 15 he and president xi jinping have agreed to a pact set to be signed jan 15 that rolls back some tariffs on both sides and includes chinese pledges to buy more american goods take various steps to protect intellectual property and open its financial sector to foreigners the phase one deal represents more of a cease fire than a breakthrough analysts say wall street has even coined a term for it peak tariffs the idea is that neither side will raise tariff levels as negotiations continue for the next several months and perhaps through the november election as president trump will not want to upset markets the deal will provide a little bit of a floor that will probably help us see some bounce back of private investment in china says scott kennedy a china expert at the center for strategic and international studies a washington think tank but we should not expect that this phase one deal will fundamentally calm things down another key resolution is the passage of the u s mexico canada agreement which by many accounts is a significant improvement over the nafta deal it replaces after more than a year of talks between the white house and democrats the democrat controlled house passed the deal in december the senate is expected to follow suit this month giving companies in all three nations more certainty in trade rules going forward another boost for investment british voters resolved another key political uncertainty in december brexit by strongly returning the conservative government of boris johnson to power the vote has given the prime minister the mandate to definitely pull britain out of the european union by jan 31 economically however the future remains as fuzzy as ever since both sides still have to negotiate a trade deal and no one is quite sure what the prime minister really wants if mr johnson really expects to complete that by the end of this year as his conservative party has pledged that is barely enough time to negotiate a bare bones trade agreement says olga bitel a global strategist at william blair a chicago based investment firm that means substantial short term disruption for the united kingdom s already anemic economy on a multiyear view forecasts so far point to the uk economy being smaller under any brexit scenario she writes in an email most of the past seven decades and thousands of years of human history point to economic integration for a small open economy to elect going it alone is a substantial departure from trend finally key central banks have made clear they re not going to raise interest rates anytime soon the federal reserve which entered 2019 expecting to raise rates instead cut them three times when economic indicators started flashing warnings with recession fears receding the central bank now looks set to stand pat for months to come the european central bank has also made borrowing cheaper and china s central bank on wednesday said it would cut cash reserve requirements for banks effectively pumping more money into the economy none of this suggests the beginning of a 21st century roaring twenties last year was the slowest for world economic growth since the financial crisis a decade earlier according to the organization for economic cooperation and development and this year will be only slightly better outside of a very few outliers such as an accelerating brazil most nations are expected to see only muted improvement and a major reason for that china s huge economy continues to slow while it is tempting to blame much of the recent slowdown on the u s china trade war the decade long deceleration is the result of both structural and cyclical factors such as an aging population and falling productivity says mr behravesh of ihs markit already china s 6 2 growth rate in 2019 was the slowest expansion in three decades he points out and he expects growth to fall below 6 this year other analysts such as mr kennedy of the center for strategic and international studies are more sanguine he says growth already bottomed out last year and will pick up slightly as china continues to transition from its reliance on exports to the growth of its huge domestic market get stories that empower and uplift daily by signing up you agree to our privacy policy already a subscriber log in to hide ads the upside sources of growth are going to be expanding consumption by chinese consumers he says china has more middle class consumers than anybody in the u s too hopes for a better 2020 rest on consumers the upside story is built around continued durability of consumer spending says mr gapen of barclays
this article is more than 4 years old when trying to forecast or analyze what is going to happen in economic policy in a particular country i focus on four factors ideas incentives leadership and providence or luck when some of these factors align as in 2017 when u s leadership embraced a policy of tax reduction and regulatory reform i forecast an increase in growth i was right other factors that i usually include are uncertainty in leadership the push or drag of major players in the world economy and medium and long term rule of law and overall economic freedom in the country or region in focus another factor i usually include is national and international security for instance i consider the threat of a violent nuclear incident as the greatest menace to domestic and international prosperity and north korea has been back in the news in this regard the less catastrophic but more widespread threat of islamic terrorism is also a concern whatever one may think of president trump s approach to islamic extremism i think it is safe to say that there is a new level of unpredictability and extremist groups do not know where or when another strike and response may come table by alejandro chafuen as usual let me focus on what i follow most closely the economy and its legal framework as in recent years the u s economy will not get a boost from outside the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd the intergovernmental organization representing 36 of the top world economies forecasts the lowest gdp growth since the 2008 9 recession around 3 the imf is more optimistic expecting 3 5 growth which is still higher than the growth expected in the united states i believe that with greater economic freedom growth rates above 3 would be normal and i am still surprised when i read analysts write that a steady 2 makes the u s economy the envy of most of the developed world los angeles times via getty images china s growth continues to moderate and hover around 6 india is poised to grow at 4 which is high for us but low for them at least two factors having a negative effect on china are trade skirmishes with the united states and the situation in hong kong both will still be with us in 2020 2019 was a horrible year for xi jinping s china was the headline of a recent article in the french newspaper le monde in mexico latin america s second largest economy and one of the most relevant for the united states continues to slow its president andrés manuel lópez obrador has limited populist measures to redistribution by which i mean he has not jumped on the protectionist bandwagon or given in to the temptation to impose exchange controls or expand price controls unlike other populist leaders the economy is at a standstill with no growth expected for 2020 the united states other major trading partner canada is predicted to grow at a modest 1 5 during the last stretch of the recent electoral campaign the re elected prime minister justin trudeau promised increased government spending as if this were a magic formula for growth among the top ten economies france has the largest consolidated government spending per gdp 56 and yet its growth is even slower than canada s not much help will come from other countries in europe either their bloated welfare states and hostile climate of ideas especially on the environment continue to be anti growth the attitude towards the environment in many european countries seems driven more by religious fervor than science and economic reality i was in italy during the student anti growth demonstrations in september and in madrid during the recent environmental summit they canonized their saint greta of sweden as a powerful and effective weapon against the demons of economic development if they move from merely show to actions a regulatory push on climate could have an even higher negative effect on growth the harm will be mostly in western europe in other regions most of the large economies have governments which will not follow the so called environmental policy consensus the two largest economies of the americas the united states and brazil have a similar approach and understanding of environmental matters a more prosperous economy can and should contribute to better ecological stewardship in asia independently of what agreements their bureaucrats sign the governments of the two largest asian economies china and india will prioritize growth even more than the united states and brazil last january i forecast a slowdown in growth rate due mostly to two factors an all out war of the deep state against president trump and a tightening by the fed there was a modest decline in the rate of growth and the deep state s efforts against donald trump and his allies in the administration were as i expected but i was wrong in believing that the fed was going to stick to the measures that they hinted at in late 2018 independently of what the numbers and monetary economists say the leadership of donald trump and the acquiescence of the fed played a big role in the reversal seeing the large deficits coexist with very low interest rates is not something that we studied in depth at universities yet in the west the united states and canada still have the highest central bank interest rates so it is not irrational for leaders in both countries to call for even lower rates table by alejandro chafuen given that almost all the candidates in the democratic party promise a reversal of the regulatory and tax policies of the trump administration economic agents face a scenario of fear uncertainty and doubt or fud this scenario similar to the situation in the united kingdom during these past few years of brexit impasse puts a damper on investment decisions the efforts of most of the entrenched bureaucracy against trump will continue and so will their effect of creating uncertainty about the future direction of economic policy but the danger of the deep state impact has diminished during 2019 some in their camp began to show their cards and acknowledge the deep state s existence while in the past those who alleged the existence of the deep state were ridiculed now we find those who proudly assert thank god for the deep state one of these latter was john maclaughlin former central intelligence agency deputy director for him and those of his ilk they are the grown ups protecting the country from trump he actually said with a straight face that the cia is different than other agencies because it is institutionally committed to objectivity and of telling the truth thus what happens in the u s economy will influence the world more than the other way around to put things in perspective our economy is more than 10 times larger than that of brazil india or canada the bottom three in the top 10 among the top 10 economies only china and india will grow more than the united states in 2020 in this group growth is expected to accelerate only in brazil and the united kingdom and even there not by much both are currently headed by leaders who favor a free economy and who are seen as a threat by many in the international and local entrenched bureaucracies on issues that affect long term growth such as rule of law and transparency the world is at a standstill six of the top 10 economies have shown deterioration in their rule of law and transparency scores sound money and free trade are two areas of grave concern for lovers of the free economy in both areas president trump has generated doubts it is in these two areas that the indices of economic freedom have shown greatest improvement over the last quarter century the forces that led to improvements in trade and monetary stability are still with us and they feed my optimism that the major economies will not push for major protectionist measures and that we will not enter a sustained inflationary period in the near future we still do not know where the average tariffs will end up after peter navarro s reciprocity bouts especially when it comes to major u s trading partners with regard to sound money those who measure it mostly by price level or inflation do not seem alarmed apart from the dwindling ranks of libertarians few seem concerned with government spending not only trudeau but also president trump prime minister boris johnson and other leaders of the top 10 economies are willing to sign increases in government spending and at least in the united kingdom and the united states the opposition wants even more spending sadly sebastián piñera the president of the freest economy in latin america has also announced a plan to expand government expenditures and interventionism given its small size 1 5 of the united states chile is less relevant to the world economy but until now it had served as a positive example for those who promote freer economic systems that is gone now we have never had so much economic data at our fingertips but given leadership doubts and a new quasi consensus on higher spending and low interest rates we have nothing close to a 20 20 vision of the 2020 economy balancing all these factors however and with none of the economic trends pointing to a crisis in the short term the u s economy like a slow moving giant ship will continue to push forward and ahead of most western economies
george bernard shaw the famous irish playwright once memorably quipped if all economists were laid end to end they would not reach a conclusion it is very often the case that two experienced knowledgeable economists study and analyse the same data sets relating to an economy and each comes up with a different forecast for the nation s economic future the time may have come by now to extend shaw s insight to institutions specifically the kind spawned in bretton woods new hampshire during the closing stages of the second world war namely the international monetary fund and the world bank while the imf s main purpose may still be focused on europe even as it morphs into some new role under the leadership of christine lagarde the first woman to lead the imf as its managing director the world bank continues to inspire some copycats the latest being the beijing led aiib much earlier than them and so naturally as things stand today far more experienced professional and authoritative in this field is the asian development bank which started operations in 1966 modelled on the world bank as a development financier but with a regional focus as the name suggests it is japanese led although based out of manila the capital of the philippines as important as the hundreds of billions of dollars that have been disbursed to finance various development projects in scores of countries over the years has been the trove of economic data in the form of periodic forecasts reviews and evaluations that they have generated on the countries they operate in on this none of the other institutions of similar shape and purpose be it the aiib or the islamic development bank or the ebrd none has been able to match the adb or the washington consensus as the imf and wb are collectively known sometimes for obvious reasons for credibility depth or volume this year interestingly the economists in their research divisions seem to differ quite sharply on prospects for the year ahead in bangladesh out of manila an important annual adb report released in late september said bangladesh s economy will continue to expand in the 2019 20 fiscal with stronger performance by internal and external sectors adb s flagship annual economic publication the asian development outlook said that buoyant exports robust private consumption higher remittances accommodative monetary policy ongoing reforms to improve the business climate and higher infrastructure spending have helped bangladesh attain high growth on the supply side the manila based lender s report said sustained strong growth in industry and agriculture are expected to be the main drivers of growth in fiscal 2020 the bangladeshi economy is in good shape and is likely to continue to grow adb s country director for bangladesh manmohan parkash told a press conference to present the findings on the asian development outlook update adou at 8 percent growth in fiscal year 2020 adb s outlook indicates that bangladesh is likely to continue as the fastest growing economy in asia and the pacific parkash said he said the bangladeshi government should continue its support in removing infrastructure constraints promoting skills development and improving the cost of doing business all these measures will help the government achieve its long term vision at the press conference soon chan hong adb senior economist presented the summary of the economic performance and prospects of the countries in the asia pacific region and observations on the adou update s bangladesh country chapter for 2020 he said this update anticipates sustained high gdp growth for bangladesh despite some deterioration in global growth and trade conditions slightly higher inflation and a continued moderate current account deficit of the country according to the bank s adou the growth in developing asia is moderating but remains robust compared with a projection of 5 7 percent gdp growth earlier it said the revised estimate for the region is 5 4 percent for fiscal year 2019 and 5 5 percent from 5 6 percent for fiscal 2020 this is largely due to the slowing down of the global trade and weakening investment the report said in any case economic growth at 8 percent for a country of over 160 million people is nothing to scoff at in the space of a few weeks though in the space of a few days of each other the two washington based institutes each came out with their own sharply different from the adb forecasts in the imf s case its forecast growth figure was 0 6 percent lower on adb s of course half a percent or slightly above it can never set the alarm bells ringing but when it comes to the economy one of the world s 40 large economies you are actually moving millions billions the world bank differed even more sharply it forecast the bangladesh economy s growth at an almost leisurely 7 2 percent the kind of pace the country grew at back in 2016 maybe 2017 the imf projected that the gdp growth of bangladesh would fall to 7 4 percent in the current fiscal compared to the 8 1 percent growth the country already achieved you can say what you like it s in the books in fy 2019 the imf s projected gdp growth for the current fy is also much lower than the government s target of 8 2 percent which jives with the asian development bank s projection of 8 percent and slightly higher than the world bank s projection of 7 2 percent the global lender made the projection in its latest world economic outlook released in washington in mid october although the government estimated that the bangladesh economy grew by 8 2 percent in the fy19 ended june 2019 the imf in its weo 2019 projected that it grew only by 7 9 percent the factors behind imf s lower gdp projection for bangladesh could not be known as it did not release any analysis on the country s growth usually it is the norm to use the government s final figure for any end of year statistic the world bank had days earlier projected 7 2 percent gdp growth in the year 2019 20 or fy20 for bangladesh according to the imf the county s point to point inflation would reach at 5 5 per cent in fy 2020 it said that the current account deficit would be 2 1 percent of gdp in fy 2019 higher than its previous projection rate at 2 percent declared last april in the medium term the deficit would reach 2 percent of gdp it projected these numbers would seem much more closely aligned with the adb s calculations though than just their value addition in a production line dude where s my loan a recurring theme throughout 2019 was the seemingly uncontrollable npa non performing assets although really it s just become part of the common parlance these days having been on the news so much situation in the country s banking sector perhaps the oldest nuisance in civilisation someone borrows your money and then it s not that they won t pay you back but that they may even vanish into thin air some were aware of the scenario as it unfolded some months ago when npas as a proportion of total loans in the banking sector of bangladesh surpassed that in all its neighbours as it rose to 11 7 percent every other country in saarc could point to a better record in this important aspect of the economy and many others throughout the asia pacific region could do the same india s proportion was worse than bangladesh s till 2017 it is really in the last two years that bangladesh out galloped even its big neighbour the cross country comparisons really alert you to the sheer scale and what is more sheer incompetence unprofessionalism and downright corruption that afflicts the finance sector in the country the following is from adb the npl ratio for banks in india steadily increased from 2 3 in 2008 to 10 0 in 2017 while the ratio is low in the people s republic of china prc around 1 7 of total loans from 2 4 the npl ratio in sri lanka steadily declined to 2 5 in 2017 from 5 6 in 2013 the npl ratio showed a decreasing trend in thailand down to 2 3 until 2013 from 5 6 in 2008 but increased to 3 1 by 2017 in malaysia the npl ratio fell gradually from 4 8 in 2008 to 1 5 in 2017 the npl ratio in viet nam increased from 2 2 in 2008 to 3 4 in 2012 and thereafter declined and remained stable at 2 3 in 2015 2017 npls that engulfed the financial system in the republic of korea during the asian financial crisis has recovered significantly and remained stable at the range of 0 5 0 6 india s npa ratio had peaked at 11 5 percent in march 2018 and then declined to 9 3 percent in march 2019 now riding on higher recoveries and slowdown in fresh bad loans it is likely to reduce npas on banks balance sheets to nearly 8 percent by march 2020 which means this most insidious of vices can be reined in as well as the new year commences it is perhaps this path more than any other that bangladesh s banking sector the backbone of any modern economy must try and seek out to start the long road back to recovery and security mere words cannot suffice the finance minister we have arrived at in the awami league s third term a h m mustafa lotus kamal has had a very ordinary first year in office he came in with the attitude of a do er perhaps intentionally to set himself apart from his predecessors from both sides of the political divide who tended to command the respect of their peers as more cerebral individuals towards the end of 2019 we saw him get busy with getting the banks to finally comply in delivering one of his earliest promises albeit in bits and pieces form the single digit interest rate on loans a bit of a gimmicky prop for businesses will now only kick in from april 1 for all bank customers despite numerous concessions the finance minister only succeeded in convincing bank bosses to first extend the facility for industrial loans only that too with some help from the prime minister will the lotus bloom in the first five months of the current fiscal that is till the end of november net government borrowing from the banking system was tk40 163 crore which is 85 percent of the amount projected in the annual budget for the entire year this has also set alarm bells ringing although the government has been unapologetic and seemingly unruffled it insists the figure can be pulled back on the strength of later borrowing through the national savings certificates that can prop up its revenue nevertheless the issue of what economists call crowding out is undeniably starting to emerge now stifling private sector investment growth as banks are drained of liquidity by the huge amounts they must lend to the government year on year credit growth dipped to 9 87 percent in november breaking the previous month s lowest rate of 10 percent in recent history indeed the two lowest months in the entire period since the awami league government took office in 2009 according to ahsan h mansour a former imf executive for over 20 years who now acts as executive director of the policy research institute a leading think tank in the capital decreasing the bank s debt distribution means that investment is declining as a result our exports are also decreasing the situation in the banking sector is very bad the debt situation npas is going from bad to worse dr mansur believes there is enough uncertainty to sow serious doubts over whether growth does actually touch 8 percent again this year or slows significantly to something more in the region of 6 percent in this context lotus kamal will have to show the legislative wherewithal to go with any ability to bring people around on the need to deal with npas according to most experts the existing bankruptcy act 1997 a legal framework for dealing with npas should be strengthened the other option is to enact a bankruptcy and insolvency law which can be a one stop solution consolidating all existing insolvency related laws in attaining liquidation protecting the interests of small investors and making the process of doing business less cumbersome the government s foreign advisers and technical consultants have insisted it is crucial to ensure that a revised bankruptcy act sets timebound procedures for the money loan courts to expedite the resolution of cases otherwise the courts are rendered toothless can the finance minister command the authority and respect within his party and its financiers many of them board members owners and shareholders in the more than 50 private sector banks that have proliferated in bangladesh to convince them that this is a moment when the country s interests must take precedence over theirs otherwise the roof we have built may fall in on our heads

2019 was a dynamic and unpredictable year across the investing and financial services landscapes with a boatload of uncertainties still adrift in this new year and decade expect 2020 to be just as tumultuous still it s a great time to be an investor and a market participant here s how major asset classes performed in 2019 2019 asset class returns 2020 predictions now i m no investment strategist or expert economist but i am a close observer and commentator on the global economy and markets i have the privilege and great honor of being the editor of investopedia which gives me some purview and a point of view on these matters allow me to humbly share my predictions for 2020 what will the economy be like in 2020 the u s economy in 2020 will be like a bbq grill about an hour after you ve taken the steaks off still kind of hot but not blazing the 2017 tax breaks that companies enjoyed will have worn off by then and even though the u s china trade war may be on the road to resolution companies have pulled the reins hard enough in 2019 that it will be tough to jump start growth the federal reserve is more likely to raise interest rates rather than cut them but if the economy starts to slow dramatically that may change in other words fiscal stimulus in the form of lower rates doesn t seem likely the global economy on the other hand will start to pick up some steam after being in the doldrums the past few years china s growth is admittedly slowing but it is still growing at a better than 6 clip and the chinese government is doing whatever it can to keep the furnaces hot china s neighboring economies should see more growth as low interest rates and a cooling of the trade war continues keep an eye on the u k now that pm johnson has his parliamentary majority he ll be opening the vaults at 10 downing street and spending great britain s way to growth as it brexits away germany on the other hand needs to find a way to stop its slowdown and find a path to growth as europe s biggest economy when it drags the whole eu grinds with it will there be a recession not likely in 2020 all the leading economic indicators still have some juice in them despite the fact that manufacturing and industrial production have been slowing the resolution of the trade war with china will help boost corporate confidence and the u s consumer remains strong due to a healthy jobs market low inflation and low gas prices the economic expansion is getting long in the tooth but expansions don t typically die of old age outside the u s germany is teetering on the edge of recession and that could pull the eurozone down with it christine lagarde has no fear of economic stimulus so count on her to do what is necessary to prevent a hard landing in europe what will the job market be like in the u s the u s jobs market will remain strong but perhaps not as strong as the past decade the healthiest parts of the economy are in health care and services the former is a growing industry the latter is more unpredictable since services cover everything from transportation to media financial services and technology it s the largest contributor to gdp but it also represents the shortest cycle businesses when the economy weakens these are the first jobs to go will the fed raise interest rates all the signals the fed watches are right where it wants them to be inflation is tame we are nearly at full employment and the lowering of interest rates in 2019 has opened the door to a lot of refinancing which is putting money in consumers pockets the fed may raise rates if inflation ticks higher although that could cost chair powell his job i d say slight chance of a raise but more likely we stay right where we are what will the housing market be like in the u s the housing market will stay strong given how low mortgage rates are right now ask anyone who bought a home in the 1970s or 1980s about mortgage rates and you ll realize we are living in candy land right now home prices are expensive in the big cities and they are creeping higher in growing metro areas like charlotte austin and phoenix but consumers are strong debt levels are relatively low and lenders are less apprehensive about lending than they were a decade ago the real question is whether younger buyers have the desire to own homes that s not going to impact the 2020 housing market but it is the 10 trillion question for the next decade will consumer spending continue to be strong consumers will keep on spending as long as gas prices remain low interest rates remain low and companies keep hiring a slip in any one of those variables could cause consumers to tighten their belts but that doesn t look likely in the near term i mention gas prices because for most people filling up the tank and grocery shopping are the most tangible recurring forms of spending we do will the market continue its upswing u s equity markets will grow but nothing like the 25 30 we have enjoyed in 2019 we ve had the wind at our backs with three interest rate cuts the waning of the 2017 corporate tax cuts and a wave of corporate stock buybacks the likes of which we have never seen before buybacks are slowing as is corporate profit growth the gap between corporate earnings and stock prices has grown a little too wide for many investors so we need to curb our expectations for returns global markets are in a better position to outperform the u s in 2020 europe has been trapped in a downswing for the past several years but the resolution of brexit easy monetary policy and improvements in global trade should help boost lagging economies like germany and spain asian markets are also well poised if the u s china trade war is resolved and global growth accelerates in investing we should always be ready to expect the unexpected that s what makes it fun and fascinating there is always more to learn and opportunities to get smarter let s do that together again in the new year here s to a great

predicting that 168 million people a record will need humanitarian assistance in 2020 because of extreme weather large infectious disease outbreaks and intensifying protracted conflicts across more than 50 countries that s around a million more people than were in need of assistance in 2019 and the number is expected to continue to rise up to 200 million people by 2022 the u n expects that providing this assistance in 2020 could cost up to 29 billion hot spots include burkina faso where a surge in violence by religious extremists has displaced more than half a million people the philippines where a christmas eve typhoon killed more than two dozen and venezuela where an economic collapse has resulted in the exodus of nearly 5 million people in the last five years shannon scribner associate director for humanitarian policy and programs at oxfam america says that funding to respond to these crises is not keeping pace with the need and that will continue to be a challenge scribner says another concern is an increasing number of restrictions on international ngos that make it harder to enter and operate in conflict affected areas such as syria and yemen humanitarian law isn t being upheld in some of the countries where we re working says scribner and we don t see world leaders talking about human rights the way they once did one key solution she says channel more funding to small local groups that know the terrain intimately rather than big international ngos tim mcdonnell second tier diseases will go gangbusters over the last 12 months the world made steady progress against the big infectious killers hiv malaria and tuberculosis but other illnesses some of them easily preventable stole the limelight those second tier diseases include measles and dengue which did gangbusters in the tropics cholera raged inyemen polio clawed its way back from the brink of defeat in pakistan polio cases were up more than tenfold from a low of just nine in 2018 in a cruel unintended consequence of the polio eradication effort a dozen countries that had been polio free including china angola and the philippines reported cases of vaccine derived polio in 2019 venezuela reported itsfirst yellow fever case in more than a decade as that country s health care system continues its downward spiral despite efforts to rein it in a few cases of middle east respiratory syndrome are reported each month in the middle east and that will probably continue in the coming year recent high profile measles outbreaks in the u s europe the philippines and samoa should push health officials to make sure more kids are immunized this year to prevent outbreaks the world health organization says that roughly 95 of a community needs to be vaccinated against measles more thanhalf the countries in the world including the u s at 94 haven t reached that threshold according to unicef where might there be a measles outbreak in 2020 afghanistan angola bolivia and haiti all have dismally low immunization rates below 40 but there are some signs of progress this year a newdengue vaccine might finally make a dent in the roughly 100 million cases of the disease that occur most years and the world is more prepared to deal with ebola than at any time in history two vaccines and several experimental treatments are in use all developed after the 2014 west africa outbreak the current ebola outbreak in eastern democratic republic of congo appears to say more about the dismal social conditions there than about the world s ability to battle this virus if there s an ebola outbreak outside a conflict zone in 2020 it would likely be contained and crushed quickly jason beaubien aid will become even more political it seems we re returning to the bad old days of the cold war when we used aid as a glorified payoff for friends and allies says jeremy konyndyk a senior fellow at the center for global development and former u s foreign disaster assistance chief under the obama administration instead of providing aid to improve health and foster economic development konyndyk says there s a growing mentality in the u s that aid can be used as a goody bag to incentivize foreign leaders to fall in line examples include trump s freezing andreinstatement of aid to el salvador guatemala and honduras in 2019 based on their immigration policies his threats tocut off countries that don t vote with the u s at the united nations and hiswithdrawal of aid to palestinians to pressure them to reconsider his peace plan the u k has also announced plans to merge its department for international development into its foreign office a move thatmore than 100 charities say risks politicizing u k aid these shifts by the u s and u k two of the world s largest aid donors could set the tone for a lot of aid policy around the world says konyndyk joanne lu unrest over inequality will grow 2019 was marked by angry protests over inequality around the world and according to some experts the demonstrations will grow more violent in 2020 since the 1980s income inequality has been on the rise says lucas chancel co director of the world inequality lab at the paris school of economics in the u s for example chancel says the richest 1 owned about 40 of the nation s wealth in 2016 up from 20 in the 1980s and trump s 2017 tax policies have only turbocharged inequality with the richest 400 families paying a lower average tax rate in 2018 than the poorest half of american households it is unlikely that 2020 brings anything different he says meaning inequality will deepen despite the efforts of angry protesters to stop it part of the problem is that inequality has a new face according to a new report by theunited nations development programme people are no longer just angry about income they re concerned about inequalities in political representation and power higher education access to technology and the resources to survive climate change chancel says the protests in chile france lebanon hong kong and other countries demonstrate that governments still do not seem to have grasped the reality of the situation and have yet to provide adequate solutions until they do the undp report warns the social unrest will likely continue joanne lu water taps continue to run dry in june 2019 chennai india reached day zero the day on which the city s reservoirs ran almost completely out of water by the fall seasonal rains had resupplied the city at least temporarily but the looming specter of water scarcity is certain to continue in cities around the world in 2020 in india alone 21 cities are at risk of running dry in 2020 according to a government report and an august report from the world resources institute found that a group of 17 countries that together are home to one quarter of the global population including botswana india iran and mexico are using as much or more water than they can replace upmanu lall director of the columbia water center says that while droughts linked to climate change can create water scarcity in many cases day zero events are caused more by government mismanagement of water resources i haven t seen any reasonable improvement he says so i think there will continue to be places that are stressed and at least one will pop up as a day zero this year the indian subcontinent is a prime candidate he says but on the plus side climate scientists expect 2020 to be an off year for el niño and la niña the weather patterns that occur every few years and can cause flooding in some areas and droughts in others the absence of those extremes might help stave off some instances of water scarcity either way victoria beard an urban planning professor at cornell university and world resources institute fellow says water scarcity will continue to be a problem especially in cities until governments of high risk localities pay to massively overhaul their water systems people are demanding of their leaders to see investments in basic services she says there s no self provision that s going to solve this problem in the long term there are no examples where it s a free for all and it works out well you need coordinated massive public investment tim mcdonnell gender equality is not on the horizon the u n calls gender equality a necessary foundation for a peaceful and prosperous world yet no country in the world is on track to achieve gender equality as defined by the u n s sustainable development goals by 2030 2020 will mark an important milestone in the long road to gender equality it s the 25th anniversary of the beijing declaration and platform for action which is considered a landmark progressive blueprint for advancing women s rights the global community will be taking stock of progress and lack thereof at gatherings such as that of the u n commission on the status of women in march worldwide women continue to face disproportionate rates of discrimination and violence less access to economic and educational opportunities and exclusion from decision making roles at the community and governmental levels by one measure the world will not achieve gender equality for nearly a century the most current estimate by the world economic forum which publishes an annual report to track country by country progress across economic educational health and political dimensions is that achieving parity across all four dimensions will take an average of 99 5 years at the current rate while the wef report found that achieving parity is relatively close at hand for educational attainment which could be possible in as soon as 12 years progress toward closing the economic opportunities gap is actually backsliding by that metric parity is a lowly 57 8 and will take 257 years to overcome emily vaughn hopeful trends global health will get woke this year expect more people in the global health and development community to address the injustices and inequities that can be traced to the era when western countries colonized poor countries stripping them of resources and autonomy people who work in the field know that much of the money influence and decision making about how to help low income countries still comes from wealthy countries with little input from the people who receive the assistance one reason for this mindset says renzo guinto a filipino physician and a member of the lancet planetary health s editorial board is the colonial roots of tropical medicine in the colonial era european researchers studied diseases in the colonies to protect the colonizers not the people living in those places from getting sick over the past couple of years he and a growing number of global health staffers have been working to make a change they aim to give medical professionals in low income countries real leadership roles at the university level students are calling on faculty to acknowledge the field s colonial history in global health curriculum and communications managers at charitable groups are trying to portray the recipients of aid with dignity and respect in messages sent to donors and the media many of these conversations can be found on social media with the hashtags shiftthepower and decolonizeglobalhealth jennifer lentfer a communications strategist who has worked in the field for two decades says she has never seen so much excitement around decolonizing global development there are already events scheduled in 2020 to tackle the subject in the coming weeks lentfer is hosting a couple of online workshops on topics that question western motives to make a difference and help because it is our moral imperative and in january graduate students at duke university are organizing a conference called decolonizing global health 2020 there s a real question as to how to flip the leadership says lentfer and that s coming to a big head malaka gharib satellite imagery could improve global health this year expect to see more research on global health and development from a sky high point of view imagery produced by satellites is becoming more ubiquitous and inexpensive and an increasingly vital source of data on poverty disease and environmental challenges marshall burke deputy director of stanford university s center on food security and the environment is one of a growing number of researchers who are training artificial intelligence software to scan through millions of satellite images to look for clues about where these challenges exist and test solutions to them let s say you run a government agency in a low income country and want to identify the poorest 10 of villages or determine how many people live within easy reach of a medical facility or close to bodies of water that could be a source of mosquito borne diseases satellite imagery can help you answer those questions burke says in a way that s much less expensive and time consuming than traditional boots on the ground surveys cars large buildings and well tended farms can all be indications of income and population density and are easily spotted from space satellite imagery is already helping cattle herders in the sahel look for water and assisting regulators in west africa in cracking down on illegal gold mining it can help humanitarian agencies navigate in the aftermath of natural disasters in some cases it might help us peer into the future in december the world resources institute unveiled an online tool that uses satellite imagery in conjunction with other data to predict water shortages and conflicts in 2020 burke says expect to see more satellite based software tools move out of research labs and into the hands of aid agencies and policymakers and although today most of the images come from satellites owned by the u s and the european union more may soon come from satellites operated by developing countries including ethiopia s first observatory satellite launched in late december tim mcdonnell youth activists will lead the fight for a better world it s not just greta thunberg the 16 year old swedish climate activist who seized time s person of the year cover for 2019 helena gualinga a teen indigenous activist from the ecuadorian amazon took world leaders to task at the cop 25 climate summit and accused oil companies of violating our human rights university students in india are protesting a new citizenship law that excludes muslim migrants young people are in the lead said u n secretary general antónio guterres in a statement on human rights day everywhere they are marching against corruption repression and inequality and for human rights and human dignity in 2020 youth activists will continue to speak up for the world they want to see says jessica taft a youth movement researcher and professor of latin american studies at the university of california santa cruz that kind of involvement by young people isn t new taft says but what has changed she says is that today s social media platforms make their contributions more visible to the world and to each other with their phones set to retweet they can instantly amplify movements that are half a world away a common refrain from young activists is that the failures of previous generations have left them stuck in a flawed version of the world that an older generation helped make many of the issues that they re focusing on right now are ones that they re able to claim moral authority around as young people says taft that includes topics such as climate change and gun violence which young people can address from personal experience like the students at stoneman douglas high school in parkland fla who captured the world s attention after the shooting at their school matt deitsch a graduate of the school and an organizer of the march for our lives rally in washington d c told npr in an interview in 2019 if we re not standing up and organizing ourselves then we re not doing enough to save lives in america pien huang cash will be king of aid it s an idea that has been gaining popularity for more than two decades instead of giving poor people goods and services say a cow or job training why not just give them money and let them decide how best to spend it interest in cash transfers as this form of aid is often referred to is likely to get even bigger over the coming decade says david evans a senior fellow at the washington d c think tank center for global development one reason is that researchers will increasingly be able to study the long term effects of some of the earliest large scale cash transfer programs a series of government assistance schemes that began in latin america in the late 1990s already we re starting to see the first wave of long term evaluations says evans who is on leave as a lead economist at the world bank so far the evidence suggests that poor people who received this cash aid mainly used it to meet short term needs like giving their families enough food each day rather than finding ways to lift themselves out of poverty in a permanent way but these families were also able to give their children more schooling and now that the kids are aging into the workforce it will become clear whether the extra education translates into enough additional income to vault this next generation out of poverty if so says evans that will be an exciting thing to find nurith aizenman access to college will boom more and more people are going to college access to higher education has expanded rapidly across the globe over the last five years says michael green ceo of social progress imperative and he expects it to continue in 2020 green and his organization through itssocial progress index have been tracking this every year since 2014 higher education has traditionally been concentrated in wealthy countries says green but many countries are making significant leaps both in terms of enrollment and quality and it s leading to a growing global middle class some of the biggest improvers according to their data include morocco slovakia and turkey our world in data an online publication based at oxford university also expects thenumber of people around the world with higher education degrees to increase as advanced skills become more important in both developing and developed economies the international institute for applied systems analysisprojects that this number will reach 1 billion by 2030 and 3 billion by 2100 compared with 725 million in 2015 although the improvement isn t in every country green says the

marching against corruption repression and inequality and for human rights and human dignity in 2020 youth activists will continue to speak up for the world they want to see says jessica taft a youth movement researcher and professor of latin american studies at the university of california santa cruz that kind of involvement by young people isn t new taft says but what has changed she says is that today s social media platforms make their contributions more visible to the world and to each other with their phones set to retweet they can instantly amplify movements that are half a world away a common refrain from young activists is that the failures of previous generations have left them stuck in a flawed version of the world that an older generation helped make many of the issues that they re focusing on right now are ones that they re able to claim moral authority around as young people says taft that includes topics such as climate change and gun violence which young people

large scale cash transfer programs a series of government assistance schemes that began in latin america in the late 1990s already we re starting to see the first wave of long term evaluations says evans who is on leave as a lead economist at the world bank so far the evidence suggests that poor people who received this cash aid mainly used it to meet short term needs like giving their families enough food each day rather than finding ways to lift themselves out of poverty in a permanent way but these families were also able to give their children more schooling and now that the kids are

predicting that 168 million people a record will need humanitarian assistance in 2020 because of extreme weather large infectious disease outbreaks and intensifying protracted conflicts across more than 50 countries that s around a million more people than were in need of assistance in 2019 and the number is expected to continue to rise up to 200 million people by 2022 the u n expects that providing this assistance in 2020 could cost up to 29 billion hot spots include burkina faso where a surge in violence by religious extremists has displaced more than half a million people the philippines where a christmas eve typhoon killed more than two dozen and venezuela where an economic collapse has resulted in the exodus of nearly 5 million people in the last five years shannon scribner associate director for humanitarian policy and programs at oxfam america says that funding to respond to these crises is not keeping pace with the need and that will continue to be a challenge scribner says another concern is an increasing number of restrictions on international ngos that make it harder to enter and operate in conflict affected areas such as syria and yemen humanitarian law isn t being upheld in some of the countries where we re working says scribner and we don t see world leaders talking about human rights the way they once did one key solution she says channel more funding to small local groups that know the terrain intimately rather than big international ngos tim mcdonnell second tier diseases will go gangbusters over the last 12 months the world made steady progress against the big infectious killers hiv malaria and tuberculosis but other illnesses some of them easily preventable stole the limelight those second tier diseases include measles and dengue which did gangbusters in the tropics cholera raged inyemen polio clawed its way back from the brink of defeat in pakistan polio cases were up more than tenfold from a low of just nine in 2018 in a cruel unintended consequence of the polio eradication effort a dozen countries that had been polio free including china angola and the philippines reported cases of vaccine derived polio in 2019 venezuela reported itsfirst yellow fever case in more than a decade as that country s health care system continues its downward spiral despite efforts to rein it in a few cases of middle east respiratory syndrome are reported each month in the middle east and that will probably continue in the coming year recent high profile measles outbreaks in the u s europe the philippines and samoa should push health officials to make sure more kids are immunized this year to prevent outbreaks the world health organization says that roughly 95 of a community needs to be vaccinated against measles more thanhalf the countries in the world including the u s at 94 haven t reached that threshold according to unicef where might there be a measles outbreak in 2020 afghanistan angola bolivia and haiti all have dismally low immunization rates below 40 but there are some signs of progress this year a newdengue vaccine might finally make a dent in the roughly 100 million cases of the disease that occur most years and the world is more prepared to deal with ebola than at any time in history two vaccines and several experimental treatments are in use all developed after the 2014 west africa outbreak the current ebola outbreak in eastern democratic republic of congo appears to say more about the dismal social conditions there than about the world s ability to battle this virus if there s an ebola outbreak outside a conflict zone in 2020 it would likely be contained and crushed quickly jason beaubien aid will become even more political it seems we re returning to the bad old days of the cold war when we used aid as a glorified payoff for friends and allies says jeremy konyndyk a senior fellow at the center for global development and former u s foreign disaster assistance chief under the obama administration instead of providing aid to improve health and foster economic development konyndyk says there s a growing mentality in the u s that aid can be used as a goody bag to incentivize foreign leaders to fall in line examples include trump s freezing andreinstatement of aid to el salvador guatemala and honduras in 2019 based on their immigration policies his threats tocut off countries that don t vote with the u s at the united nations and hiswithdrawal of aid to palestinians to pressure them to reconsider his peace plan the u k has also announced plans to merge its department for international development into its foreign office a move thatmore than 100 charities say risks politicizing u k aid these shifts by the u s and u k two of the world s largest aid donors could set the tone for a lot of aid policy around the world says konyndyk joanne lu unrest over inequality will grow 2019 was marked by angry protests over inequality around the world and according to some experts the demonstrations will grow more violent in 2020 since the 1980s income inequality has been on the rise says lucas chancel co director of the world inequality lab at the paris school of economics in the u s for example chancel says the richest 1 owned about 40 of the nation s wealth in 2016 up from 20 in the 1980s and trump s 2017 tax policies have only turbocharged inequality with the richest 400 families paying a lower average tax rate in 2018 than the poorest half of american households it is unlikely that 2020 brings anything different he says meaning inequality will deepen despite the efforts of angry protesters to stop it part of the problem is that inequality has a new face according to a new report by theunited nations development programme people are no longer just angry about income they re concerned about inequalities in political representation and power higher education access to technology and the resources to survive climate change chancel says the protests in chile france lebanon hong kong and other countries demonstrate that governments still do not seem to have grasped the reality of the situation and have yet to provide adequate solutions until they do the undp report warns the social unrest will likely continue joanne lu water taps continue to run dry in june 2019 chennai india reached day zero the day on which the city s reservoirs ran almost completely out of water by the fall seasonal rains had resupplied the city at least temporarily but the looming specter of water scarcity is certain to continue in cities around the world in 2020 in india alone 21 cities are at risk of running dry in 2020 according to a government report and an august report from the world resources institute found that a group of 17 countries that together are home to one quarter of the global population including botswana india iran and mexico are using as much or more water than they can replace upmanu lall director of the columbia water center says that while droughts linked to climate change can create water scarcity in many cases day zero events are caused more by government mismanagement of water resources i haven t seen any reasonable improvement he says so i think there will continue to be places that are stressed and at least one will pop up as a day zero this year the indian subcontinent is a prime candidate he says but on the plus side climate scientists expect 2020 to be an off year for el niño and la niña the weather patterns that occur every few years and can cause flooding in some areas and droughts in others the absence of those extremes might help stave off some instances of water scarcity either way victoria beard an urban planning professor at cornell university and world resources institute fellow says water scarcity will continue to be a problem especially in cities until governments of high risk localities pay to massively overhaul their water systems people are demanding of their leaders to see investments in basic services she says there s no self provision that s going to solve this problem in the long term there are no examples where it s a free for all and it works out well you need coordinated massive public investment tim mcdonnell gender equality is not on the horizon the u n calls gender equality a necessary foundation for a peaceful and prosperous world yet no country in the world is on track to achieve gender equality as defined by the u n s sustainable development goals by 2030 2020 will mark an important milestone in the long road to gender equality it s the 25th anniversary of the beijing declaration and platform for action which is considered a landmark progressive blueprint for advancing women s rights the global community will be taking stock of progress and lack thereof at gatherings such as that of the u n commission on the status of women in march worldwide women continue to face disproportionate rates of discrimination and violence less access to economic and educational opportunities and exclusion from decision making roles at the community and governmental levels by one measure the world will not achieve gender equality for nearly a century the most current estimate by the world economic forum which publishes an annual report to track country by country progress across economic educational health and political dimensions is that achieving parity across all four dimensions will take an average of 99 5 years at the current rate while the wef report found that achieving parity is relatively close at hand for educational attainment which could be possible in as soon as 12 years progress toward closing the economic opportunities gap is actually backsliding by that metric parity is a lowly 57 8 and will take 257 years to overcome emily vaughn hopeful trends global health will get woke this year expect more people in the global health and development community to address the injustices and inequities that can be traced to the era when western countries colonized poor countries stripping them of resources and autonomy people who work in the field know that much of the money influence and decision making about how to help low income countries still comes from wealthy countries with little input from the people who receive the assistance one reason for this mindset says renzo guinto a filipino physician and a member of the lancet planetary health s editorial board is the colonial roots of tropical medicine in the colonial era european researchers studied diseases in the colonies to protect the colonizers not the people living in those places from getting sick over the past couple of years he and a growing number of global health staffers have been working to make a change they aim to give medical professionals in low income countries real leadership roles at the university level students are calling on faculty to acknowledge the field s colonial history in global health curriculum and

social media with the hashtags shiftthepower and decolonizeglobalhealth jennifer lentfer a communications strategist who has worked in the field for two decades says she has never seen so much excitement around decolonizing global development there are already events scheduled in 2020 to tackle the subject in the coming weeks lentfer is hosting a couple of online workshops on topics that

more research on global health and development from a sky high point of view imagery produced by satellites is becoming more ubiquitous and inexpensive and an increasingly vital source of data on poverty disease and environmental challenges marshall burke deputy director of stanford university s center on food security and the environment is one of a growing number of researchers who are training artificial intelligence software to scan through millions of satellite images to look for clues about where these challenges exist and test solutions to them let s say you run a government agency in a low income country and want to identify the poorest 10 of villages or determine how many people live within easy reach of a medical facility or close to bodies of water that could be a source of mosquito borne diseases satellite imagery can help you answer those questions burke says in a way that s much less expensive and time consuming than traditional boots on the ground surveys cars large buildings and well tended farms can all be indications of income and population density and are easily spotted from space satellite imagery is already helping cattle herders in the sahel

satellites owned by the u s and the european union more may soon come from satellites operated by developing countries including ethiopia s first observatory satellite launched in late december tim

movement researcher and professor of latin american studies at the university of california santa cruz that kind of involvement by young people isn t new taft says but what has changed she says is that today s social media platforms make their contributions more visible to the world and to each other with their phones set to retweet they can instantly amplify movements that are half a world away a common refrain from young activists is that the failures of previous generations have left them stuck in a flawed version of the world that an older generation helped make many of the issues that they re focusing on right now are ones that they re able to claim moral authority around as young people says taft that includes topics such as climate change and gun violence which young people

why not just give them money and let them decide how best to spend it interest in cash transfers as this form of aid is often referred to is likely to get even bigger over the coming decade says david

large scale cash transfer programs a series of government assistance schemes that began in latin america in the late 1990s already we re starting to see the first wave of long term evaluations says evans who is on leave as a lead economist at the world bank so far the evidence suggests that poor people who received this cash aid mainly used it to meet short term needs like giving their families enough food each day rather than finding ways to lift themselves out of poverty in a permanent way but these families were also able to give their children more schooling and now that the kids are aging into the workforce it will become clear whether the extra education translates into enough additional income to vault this next generation out of poverty if so says evans that will be an

predicting that 168 million people a record will need humanitarian assistance in 2020 because of extreme weather large infectious disease outbreaks and intensifying protracted conflicts across more than 50 countries that s around a million more people than were in need of assistance in 2019 and the number is expected to continue to rise up to 200 million people by 2022 the u n expects that providing this assistance in 2020 could cost up to 29 billion hot spots include burkina faso where a surge in violence by religious extremists has displaced more than half a million people the philippines where a christmas eve typhoon killed more than two dozen and venezuela where an economic collapse has resulted in the exodus of nearly 5 million people in the last five years shannon scribner associate director for humanitarian policy and programs at oxfam america says that funding to respond to these crises is not keeping pace with the need and that will continue to be a challenge scribner says another concern is an increasing number of restrictions on international ngos that make it harder to enter and operate in conflict affected areas such as syria and yemen humanitarian law isn t being upheld in some of the countries where we re working says scribner and we don t see world leaders talking about human rights the way they once did one key solution she says channel more funding to small local groups that know the terrain intimately rather than big international ngos tim mcdonnell second tier diseases will go gangbusters over the last 12 months the world made steady progress against the big infectious killers hiv malaria and tuberculosis but other illnesses some of them easily preventable stole the limelight those second tier diseases include measles and dengue which did gangbusters in the tropics cholera raged inyemen polio clawed its way back from the brink of defeat in pakistan polio cases were up more than tenfold from a low of just nine in 2018 in a cruel unintended consequence of the polio eradication effort a dozen countries that had been polio free including china angola and the philippines reported cases of vaccine derived polio in 2019 venezuela reported itsfirst yellow fever case in more than a decade as that country s health care system continues its downward spiral despite efforts to rein it in a few cases of middle east respiratory syndrome are reported each month in the middle east and that will probably continue in the coming year recent high profile measles outbreaks in the u s europe the philippines and samoa should push health officials to make sure more kids are immunized this year to prevent outbreaks the world health organization says that roughly 95 of a community needs to be vaccinated against measles more thanhalf the countries in the world including the u s at 94 haven t reached that threshold according to unicef where might there be a measles outbreak in 2020 afghanistan angola bolivia and haiti all have dismally low immunization rates below 40 but there are some signs of progress this year a newdengue vaccine might finally make a dent in the roughly 100 million cases of the disease that occur most years and the world is more prepared to deal with ebola than at any time in history two vaccines and several experimental treatments are in use all developed after the 2014 west africa outbreak the current ebola outbreak in eastern democratic republic of congo appears to say more about the dismal social conditions there than about the world s ability to battle this virus if there s an ebola outbreak outside a conflict zone in 2020 it would likely be contained and crushed quickly jason beaubien aid will become even more political it seems we re returning to the bad old days of the cold war when we used aid as a glorified payoff for friends and allies says jeremy konyndyk a senior fellow at the center for global development and former u s foreign disaster assistance chief under the obama administration instead of providing aid to improve health and foster economic development konyndyk says there s a growing mentality in the u s that aid can be used as a goody bag to incentivize foreign leaders to fall in line examples include trump s freezing andreinstatement of aid to el salvador guatemala and honduras in 2019 based on their immigration policies his threats tocut off countries that don t vote with the u s at the united nations and hiswithdrawal of aid to palestinians to pressure them to reconsider his peace plan the u k has also announced plans to merge its department for international development into its foreign office a move thatmore than 100 charities say risks politicizing u k aid these shifts by the u s and u k two of the world s largest aid donors could set the tone for a lot of aid policy around the world says konyndyk joanne lu unrest over inequality will grow 2019 was marked by angry protests over inequality around the world and according to some experts the demonstrations will grow more violent in 2020 since the 1980s income inequality has been on the rise says lucas chancel co director of the world inequality lab at the paris school of economics in the u s for example chancel says the richest 1 owned about 40 of the nation s wealth in 2016 up from 20 in the 1980s and trump s 2017 tax policies have only turbocharged inequality with the richest 400 families paying a lower average tax rate in 2018 than the poorest half of american households it is unlikely that 2020 brings anything different he says meaning inequality will deepen despite the efforts of angry protesters to stop it part of the problem is that inequality has a new face according to a new report by theunited nations development programme people are no longer just angry about income they re concerned about inequalities in political representation and power higher education access to technology and the resources to survive climate change chancel says the protests in chile france lebanon hong kong and other countries demonstrate that governments still do not seem to have grasped the reality of the situation and have yet to provide adequate solutions until they do the undp report warns the social unrest will likely continue joanne lu water taps continue to run dry in june 2019 chennai india reached day zero the day on which the city s reservoirs ran almost completely out of water by the fall seasonal rains had resupplied the city at least temporarily but the looming specter of water scarcity is certain to continue in cities around the world in 2020 in india alone 21 cities are at risk of running dry in 2020 according to a government report and an august report from the world resources institute found that a group of 17 countries that together are home to one quarter of the global population including botswana india iran and mexico are using as much or more water than they can replace upmanu lall director of the columbia water center says that while droughts linked to climate change can create water scarcity in many cases day zero events are caused more by government mismanagement of water resources i haven t seen any reasonable improvement he says so i think there will continue to be places that are stressed and at least one will pop up as a day zero this year the indian subcontinent is a prime candidate he says but on the plus side climate scientists expect 2020 to be an off year for el niño and la niña the weather patterns that occur every few years and can cause flooding in some areas and droughts in others the absence of those extremes might help stave off some instances of water scarcity either way victoria beard an urban planning professor at cornell university and world resources institute fellow says water scarcity will continue to be a problem especially in cities until governments of high risk localities pay to massively overhaul their water systems people are demanding of their leaders to see investments in basic services she says there s no self provision that s going to solve this problem in the long term there are no examples where it s a free for all and it works out well you need coordinated massive public investment tim mcdonnell gender equality is not on the horizon the u n calls gender equality a necessary foundation for a peaceful and prosperous world yet no country in the world is on track to achieve gender equality as defined by the u n s sustainable development goals by 2030 2020 will mark an important milestone in the long road to gender equality it s the 25th anniversary of the beijing declaration and platform for action which is considered a landmark progressive blueprint for advancing women s rights the global community will be taking stock of progress and lack thereof at gatherings such as that of the u n commission on the status of women in march worldwide women continue to face disproportionate rates of discrimination and violence less access to economic and educational opportunities and exclusion from decision making roles at the community and governmental levels by one measure the world will not achieve gender equality for nearly a century the most current estimate by the world economic forum which publishes an annual report to track country by country progress across economic educational health and political dimensions is that achieving parity across all four dimensions will take an average of 99 5 years at the current rate while the wef report found that achieving parity is relatively close at hand for educational attainment which could be possible in as soon as 12 years progress toward closing the economic opportunities gap is actually backsliding by that metric parity is a lowly 57 8 and will take 257 years to overcome emily vaughn hopeful trends global health will get woke this year expect more people in the global health and development community to address the injustices and inequities that can be traced to the era when western countries colonized poor countries stripping them of resources and autonomy people who work in the field know that much of the money influence and decision making about how to help low income countries still comes from wealthy countries with little input from the people who receive the assistance one reason for this mindset says renzo guinto a filipino physician and a member of the lancet planetary health s editorial board is the colonial roots of tropical medicine in the colonial era european researchers studied diseases in the colonies to protect the colonizers not the people living in those places from getting sick over the past couple of years he and a growing number of global health staffers have been working to make a change they aim to give medical professionals in low income countries real leadership roles at the university level students are calling on faculty to acknowledge the field s colonial history in global health curriculum and communications managers at charitable groups are trying to portray the recipients of aid with dignity and respect in messages sent to donors and the media many of these conversations can be found on social media with the hashtags shiftthepower and decolonizeglobalhealth jennifer lentfer a communications strategist who has worked in the field for two decades says she has never seen so much excitement around decolonizing global development there are already events scheduled in 2020 to tackle the subject in the coming weeks lentfer is hosting a couple of online workshops on topics that question western motives to make a difference and help because it is our moral imperative and in january graduate students at duke university are organizing a conference called decolonizing global health 2020 there s a real question as to how to flip the leadership says lentfer and that s coming to a big head malaka gharib satellite imagery could improve global health this year expect to see more research on global health and development from a sky high point of view imagery produced by satellites is becoming more ubiquitous and inexpensive and an increasingly vital source of data on poverty disease and environmental challenges marshall burke deputy director of stanford university s center on food security and the environment is one of a growing number of researchers who are training artificial intelligence software to scan through millions of satellite images to look for clues about where these challenges exist and test solutions to them let s say you run a government agency in a low income country and want to identify the poorest 10 of villages or determine how many people live within easy reach of a medical facility or close to bodies of water that could be a source of mosquito borne diseases satellite imagery can help you answer those questions burke says in a way that s much less expensive and time consuming than traditional boots on the ground surveys cars large buildings and well tended farms can all be indications of income and population density and are easily spotted from space satellite imagery is already helping cattle herders in the sahel look for water and assisting regulators in west africa in cracking down on illegal gold mining it can help humanitarian agencies navigate in the aftermath of natural disasters in some cases it might help us peer into the future in december the world resources institute unveiled an online tool that uses satellite imagery in conjunction with other data to predict water shortages and conflicts in

is that achieving parity across all four dimensions will take an average of 99 5 years at the current rate while the wef report found that achieving parity is relatively close at hand for educational attainment which could be possible in as soon as 12 years progress toward closing the economic opportunities gap is actually backsliding by that metric parity is a lowly 57 8 and will take 257 years to overcome emily vaughn hopeful trends global health will get woke this year expect more people in the global health and development community to address the injustices and inequities that can be traced to the era when western countries colonized poor countries stripping them of resources and autonomy people who work in the field know that much of the money influence and decision making about how to help low income countries still comes from wealthy countries with little input from the people who receive the assistance one reason for this mindset says renzo guinto a filipino physician and a member of the lancet planetary health s editorial board is the colonial roots of tropical medicine in the colonial era european researchers studied diseases in the colonies to protect the colonizers not the people living in those places from getting sick over the past couple of years he and a growing number of global health staffers have been working to make a change they aim to give medical professionals in low income countries real leadership roles at the university level students are calling on faculty to acknowledge the field s colonial history in global health curriculum and communications managers at charitable groups are trying to portray the recipients of aid with dignity and respect in messages sent to donors and the media many of these conversations can be found on social media with the hashtags shiftthepower and decolonizeglobalhealth jennifer lentfer a communications strategist who has worked in the field for two decades says she has never seen so much excitement around decolonizing global development there are already events scheduled in 2020 to tackle the subject in the coming weeks lentfer is hosting a couple of online workshops on topics that question western motives to make a difference and help because it is our moral imperative and in january graduate students at duke university are organizing a conference called decolonizing global health 2020 there s a real question as to how to flip the leadership says lentfer and that s coming to a big head malaka gharib satellite imagery could improve global health this year expect to see more research on global health and development from a sky high point of view imagery produced by satellites is becoming more ubiquitous and inexpensive and an increasingly vital source of data on poverty disease and environmental challenges marshall burke deputy director of stanford university s center on food security and the environment is one of a growing number of researchers who are training artificial intelligence software to scan through millions of satellite images to look for clues about where these challenges exist and test solutions to them let s say you run a government agency in a low income country and want to identify the poorest 10 of villages or determine how many people live within easy reach of a medical facility or close to bodies of water that could be a source of mosquito borne diseases satellite imagery can help you answer those questions burke says in a way that s much less expensive and time consuming than traditional boots on the ground surveys cars large buildings and well tended farms can all be indications of income and population density and are easily spotted from space satellite imagery is already helping cattle herders in the sahel look for water and assisting regulators in west africa in cracking down on illegal gold mining it can help humanitarian agencies navigate in the aftermath of natural disasters in some cases it might help us peer into the future in december the world resources institute unveiled an online tool that uses satellite imagery in conjunction with other data to predict water shortages and conflicts in 2020 burke says expect to see more satellite based software tools move out of research labs and into the hands of aid agencies and policymakers and although today most of the images come from satellites owned by the u s and the european union more may soon come from satellites operated by developing countries including ethiopia s first observatory satellite launched in late december tim

india are protesting a new citizenship law that excludes muslim migrants young people are in the lead said u n secretary general antónio guterres in a statement on human rights day everywhere they are marching against corruption repression and inequality and for human rights and human dignity in 2020 youth activists will continue to speak up for the world they want to see says jessica taft a youth movement researcher and professor of latin american studies at the university of california santa cruz that kind of involvement by young people isn t new taft says but what has changed she says is that today s social media platforms make their contributions more visible to the world and to each other with their phones set to retweet they can instantly amplify movements that are half a world away a common refrain from young activists is that the failures of previous generations have left them stuck in a flawed version of the world that an older generation helped make many of the issues that they re focusing on right now are ones that they re able to claim moral authority around as young people says taft that includes topics such as climate change and gun violence which young people can address from personal experience like the students at stoneman douglas high school in parkland fla who captured the world s attention after the shooting at their school matt deitsch a graduate of the school and an organizer of the march for our lives rally in washington d c told npr in an interview in 2019 if we re not standing up and organizing ourselves then we re not doing enough to save lives in america pien huang cash will be king of aid it s an idea that has been gaining popularity for more than two decades instead of giving poor people goods and services say a cow or job training why not just give them money and let them decide how best to spend it interest in cash transfers as this form of aid is often referred to is likely to get even bigger over the coming decade says david evans a senior fellow at the washington d c think tank center for global development one reason is that researchers will increasingly be able to study the long term effects of some of the earliest large scale cash transfer programs a series of government assistance schemes that began in latin america in the late 1990s already we re starting to see the first wave of long term evaluations says evans who is on leave as a lead economist at the world bank so far the evidence suggests that poor people who received this cash aid mainly used it to meet short term needs like giving their families enough food each day rather than finding ways to lift themselves out of poverty in a permanent way but these families were also able to give their children more schooling and now that the kids are aging into the workforce it will become clear whether the extra education translates into enough additional income to vault this next generation out of poverty if so says evans that will be an exciting thing to find nurith aizenman access to college will boom more and more people are going to college access to higher education has expanded rapidly across the globe over the last five years

we don t have a crystal ball but as journalists covering global health and development we have a pretty good nose for emerging trends with some help from our favorite expert sources some likely trends

predicting that 168 million people a record will need humanitarian assistance in 2020 because of extreme weather large infectious disease outbreaks and intensifying protracted conflicts across more than 50 countries that s around a million more people than were in need of assistance in 2019 and the number is expected to continue to rise up to 200 million people by 2022 the u n expects that providing this assistance in 2020 could cost up to 29 billion hot spots include burkina faso where a surge in violence by religious extremists has displaced more than half a million people the philippines where a christmas eve typhoon killed more than two dozen and venezuela where an economic collapse has resulted in the exodus of nearly 5 million people in the last five years shannon scribner associate director for humanitarian policy and programs at oxfam america says that funding to respond to these crises is not keeping pace with the need and that will continue to be a challenge scribner says another concern is an increasing number of restrictions on international ngos that make it harder to enter and operate in conflict affected areas such as syria and yemen humanitarian law isn t being upheld in some of the countries where we re working says scribner and we don t see world leaders talking about human rights the way they once did one key solution she says channel more funding to small local groups that know the terrain intimately rather than big international ngos tim mcdonnell second tier diseases will go gangbusters over the last 12 months the world made steady progress against the big infectious killers hiv malaria and tuberculosis but other illnesses some of them easily preventable stole the limelight those second tier diseases include measles and dengue which did gangbusters in the tropics cholera raged inyemen polio clawed its way back from the brink of defeat in pakistan polio cases were up more than tenfold from a low of just nine in 2018 in a cruel unintended consequence of the polio eradication effort a dozen countries that had been polio free including china angola and the philippines reported cases of vaccine derived polio in 2019 venezuela reported itsfirst yellow fever case in more than a decade as that country s health care system continues its downward spiral despite efforts to rein it in a few cases of middle east respiratory syndrome are reported each month in the middle east and that will probably continue in the coming year recent high profile measles outbreaks in the u s europe the philippines and samoa should push health officials to make sure more kids are immunized this year to prevent outbreaks the world health organization says that roughly 95 of a community needs to be vaccinated against measles more thanhalf the countries in the world including the u s at 94 haven t reached that threshold according to unicef where might there be a measles outbreak in 2020 afghanistan angola bolivia and haiti all have dismally low immunization rates below 40 but there are some signs of progress this year a newdengue vaccine might finally make a dent in the roughly 100 million cases of the disease that occur most years and the world is more prepared to deal with ebola than at any time in history two vaccines and several experimental treatments are in use all developed after the 2014 west africa outbreak the current ebola outbreak in eastern democratic republic of congo appears to say more about the dismal social conditions there than about the world s ability to battle this virus if there s an ebola outbreak outside a conflict zone in 2020 it would likely be contained and crushed quickly jason beaubien aid will become even more political it seems we re returning to the bad old days of the cold war when we used aid as a glorified payoff for friends and allies says jeremy konyndyk a senior fellow at the center for global development and former u s foreign disaster assistance chief under the obama administration instead of providing aid to improve health and foster economic development konyndyk says there s a growing mentality in the u s that aid can be used as a goody bag to incentivize foreign leaders to fall in line examples include trump s freezing andreinstatement of aid to el salvador guatemala and honduras in 2019 based on their immigration policies his threats tocut off countries that don t vote with the u s at the united nations and hiswithdrawal of aid to palestinians to pressure them to reconsider his peace plan the u k has also announced plans to merge its department for international development into its foreign office a move thatmore than 100 charities say risks politicizing u k aid these shifts by the u s and u k two of the world s largest aid donors could set the tone for a lot of aid policy around the world says konyndyk joanne lu unrest over inequality will grow 2019 was marked by angry protests over inequality around the world and according to some experts the demonstrations will grow more violent in 2020 since the 1980s income inequality has been on the rise says lucas chancel co director of the world inequality lab at the paris school of economics in the u s for example chancel says the richest 1 owned about 40 of the nation s wealth in 2016 up from 20 in the 1980s and trump s 2017 tax policies have only turbocharged inequality with the richest 400 families paying a lower average tax rate in 2018 than the poorest half of american households it is unlikely that 2020 brings anything different he says meaning inequality will deepen despite the efforts of angry protesters to stop it part of the problem is that inequality has a new face according to a new report by theunited nations development programme people are no longer just angry about income they re concerned about inequalities in political representation and power higher education access to technology and the resources to survive climate change chancel says the protests in chile france lebanon hong kong and other countries demonstrate that governments still do not seem to have grasped the reality of the situation and have yet to provide adequate solutions until they do the undp report warns the social unrest will likely continue joanne lu water taps continue to run dry in june 2019 chennai india reached day zero the day on which the city s reservoirs ran almost completely out of water by the fall seasonal rains had resupplied the city at least temporarily but the looming specter of water scarcity is certain to continue in cities around the world in 2020 in india alone 21 cities are at risk of running dry in 2020 according to a government report and an august report from the world resources institute found that a group of 17 countries that together are home to one quarter of the global population including botswana india iran and mexico are using as much or more water than they can replace upmanu lall director of the columbia water center says that while droughts linked to climate change can create water scarcity in many cases day zero events are caused more by government mismanagement of water resources i haven t seen any reasonable improvement he says so i think there will continue to be places that are stressed and at least one will pop up as a day zero this year the indian subcontinent is a prime candidate he says but on the plus side climate scientists expect 2020 to be an off year for el niño and la niña the weather patterns that occur every few years and can cause flooding in some areas and droughts in others the absence of those extremes might help stave off some instances of water scarcity either way victoria beard an urban planning professor at cornell university and world resources institute fellow says water scarcity will continue to be a problem especially in cities until governments of high risk localities pay to massively overhaul their water systems people are demanding of their leaders to see investments in basic services she says there s no self provision that s going to solve this problem in the long term there are no examples where it s a free for all and it works out well you need coordinated massive public investment tim mcdonnell gender equality is not on the horizon the u n calls gender equality a necessary foundation for a peaceful and prosperous world yet no country in the world is on track to achieve gender equality as defined by the u n s sustainable development goals by 2030 2020 will mark an important milestone in the long road to gender equality it s the 25th anniversary of the beijing declaration and platform for action which is considered a landmark progressive blueprint for advancing women s rights the global community will be taking stock of progress and lack thereof at gatherings such as that of the u n commission on the status of women in march worldwide women continue to face disproportionate rates of discrimination and violence less access to economic and educational opportunities and exclusion from decision making roles at the community and governmental levels by one measure the world will not achieve gender equality for

their immigration policies his threats to cut off countries that don t vote with the u s at the united nations and his withdrawal of aid to palestinians to pressure them to reconsider his peace plan the u k has also announced plans to merge its department for international development into the foreign office a move that more than 100 charities say risks politicizing u k aid these shifts by the u s and u k two of the largest aid donors in the world could set the tone for a lot of aid policy around the world says konyndyk joanne lu unrest over inequality will grow 2019 was marked by angry protests over inequality around the world and according to some experts the demonstrations will grow more violent in 2020 since the 1980s income inequality has been on the rise says lucas chancel co director of the world inequality lab at the paris school of economics in the u s for example chancel says the richest 1 percent owned about 40 percent of the nation s wealth in 2016 up from 20 percent in the 1980s and trump s 2017 tax policies have only turbocharged inequality with the richest 400 families paying a lower average tax rate in 2018 than the poorest half of american households it is unlikely that 2020 brings anything different he says meaning inequality will deepen despite the efforts of angry protesters to stop it part of the problem is that inequality has a new face according to a new report by the united nations development program undp people are no longer just angry about income they re concerned about inequalities in political representation and power higher education access to technology and the resources to survive climate change chancel says the protests in chile france lebanon hong kong and other countries demonstrate that governments still do not seem to have grasped the reality of the situation and have yet to provide adequate solutions until they do the undp report warns the social unrest will likely continue joanne lu water taps continue to run dry in june 2019 chennai india reached day zero the day on which the city s reservoirs ran almost completely out of water by the fall seasonal rains had resupplied the city at least temporarily but the looming specter of water scarcity is certain to continue in cities around the world in 2020 in india alone 21 cities are at risk of running dry in 2020 according to a government report and an august report from world resources institute found that a group of 17 countries that together are home to one quarter of the global population including botswana india iran and mexico are using as much or more water than they can replace upmanu lall director of the columbia university water center says that while droughts linked to climate change can create water scarcity in many cases day zero events are caused more by government mismanagement of water resources i haven t seen any reasonable improvement he says so i think there will continue to be places that are stressed and at least one will pop up as a day zero this year the indian subcontinent is a prime candidate he says but on the plus side climate scientists expect 2020 to be an off year for el niño and la niña the weather patterns that occur every few years and can cause flooding in some areas and droughts in others the absence of those extremes might help stave off some instances of water scarcity either way victoria beard an urban planning researcher at cornell says water scarcity will continue to be a problem especially in cities until governments of high risk localities pay to massively overhaul their water systems people are demanding of their leaders to see investments in basic services she says there s no self provision that s going to solve this problem in the long term there are no examples where it s a free for all and it works out well you need coordinated massive public investment tim mcdonnell gender equality is not on the horizon the u n calls gender equality a necessary foundation for a peaceful and prosperous world yet no country in the world is on track to achieve gender equality as defined by the un s sustainable development goals by 2030 2020 will mark an important milestone in the long road to gender equality the 25th anniversary of the beijing declaration and platform for action which is considered a landmark progressive blueprint for advancing women s rights the global community will be taking stock of progress and lack thereof at gatherings like the un commission on the status of women in march worldwide women continue to face disproportionate rates of discrimination and violence less access to economic and educational opportunities and exclusion from decision making roles at a community and governmental level by one measure the world will not achieve gender equality for nearly a century the most current estimate by the world economic forum which publishes an annual report to track country by country progress across economic educational health and political dimensions is that achieving parity across all four dimensions will take an average of 99 5 years at the current rate while the wef report found that achieving parity is relatively close at hand for educational attainment which could be possible in as soon as 12 years progress toward closing the economic opportunities gap is actually backsliding by that metric parity is a lowly 57 8 percent and will take 257 years to overcome emily vaughn hopeful trends global health will get woke this year expect more people in the global health and development community to address the injustices and inequities that can be traced to the era when western countries colonized poor countries stripping them of resources and autonomy people who work in the field know that much of the money influence and decision making about how to help low income countries still comes from wealthy countries with little input from the people who receive the assistance one reason for this mindset says renzo guinto a philippine physician and a member of the lancet planetary health s editorial board is the colonial roots of tropical medicine in the colonial era european researchers studied diseases in the colonies to protect the colonizers not the people living in those places from getting sick over the past couple of years he and a growing number of global health staffers have been working to make a change they aim to give medical professionals in low income countries real leadership roles at the university level students are calling on faculty to acknowledge the field s colonial history in global health curriculum

excitement around decolonizing global development there are already events scheduled in 2020 to tackle the subject in the coming weeks lentfer is hosting a couple of online workshops on topics that question western motives to make a difference and help because it is our moral imperative and in january graduate students at duke university are organizing a conference called decolonizing global

more research on global health and development from a sky high point of view imagery produced by satellites is becoming more ubiquitous and inexpensive and an increasingly vital source of data on poverty disease and environmental challenges marshall burke deputy director of stanford university s center on food security and the environment is one of a growing number of researchers who are training artificial intelligence software to scan through millions of satellite images to look for clues about where these challenges exist and test solutions to them let s say you run a government agency in a low income country and want to identify the poorest 10 percent of villages or determine how many people live within easy reach of a medical facility or close to bodies of water that could be a source of mosquito borne diseases satellite imagery can help you answer those questions burke says in a way that s much less expensive and time consuming than traditional boots on the ground surveys cars large buildings and well tended farms can all be indications of income and population density and are easily spotted from space satellite imagery is already helping cattle herders in the sahel look for water and regulators in west africa crack down on illegal gold mining it can help humanitarian agencies navigate in the aftermath of natural disasters in some cases it might help us peer into the future in december world resources institute unveiled an online tool that uses satellite imagery in conjunction with other data to predict water shortages and conflicts in 2020 burke says expect to see more satellite based software tools move out of research labs and into the hands of aid agencies and policymakers and although today most of the images come from satellites owned by the u s and european union more may soon come from satellites operated by developing countries including ethiopia s first observatory satellite launched in late december tim mcdonnell youth activists

activists is that the failures of previous generations have left them stuck in a flawed version of the world an older generation helped make many of the issues that they re focusing on right now are ones that they re able to claim moral authority around as young people says taft that includes topics like climate change and gun violence which young people can address from personal experience like

let them decide how best to spend it interest in cash transfers as this form of aid is often referred to is likely to get even bigger over the coming decade says david evans a senior fellow at the washington d c think tank center for global development one reason is that researchers will increasingly be able to study the long term effects of some of the earliest large scale cash transfer programs a series of government assistance schemes that began in latin america in the late 1990s already we re starting to see the first wave of long term evaluations says evans who is on leave as a lead economist at the world bank so far the evidence suggests that poor people who received this cash aid mainly used it to meet short term needs like giving their families enough food each day rather than finding ways to lift themselves out of poverty in a permanent way but these families were also able to give their children more schooling and now that the kids are aging into the workforce it will become clear whether the extra education translates into enough additional income to vault this next generation out of poverty if so says evans that will be an exciting thing to find nurith

scribner associate director for humanitarian policy and programs at oxfam america says that funding to respond to these crises is not keeping pace with the need and that will continue to be a

donors could set the tone for a lot of aid policy around the world says konyndyk joanne lu unrest over inequality will grow 2019 was marked by angry protests over inequality around the world and according to some experts the demonstrations will grow more violent in 2020 since the 1980s income inequality has been on the rise says lucas chancel co director of the world inequality lab at the paris school of economics in the u s for example chancel says the richest 1 owned about 40 of the nation s wealth in 2016 up from 20 in the 1980s and trump s 2017 tax policies have only turbocharged inequality with the richest 400 families paying a lower average tax rate in 2018 than the poorest half of american households it is unlikely that 2020 brings anything different he says meaning inequality will deepen despite the efforts of angry protesters to stop it part of the problem is that inequality has a new face according to a new report by theunited nations development programme people are no longer just angry about income they re concerned about inequalities in political representation and power higher education access to technology and the resources to survive climate change chancel says the protests in chile france lebanon hong kong and other countries demonstrate that governments still do not seem to have grasped the reality of the situation and have yet to provide adequate solutions until they do the undp report warns the social unrest will likely continue joanne lu water taps continue to run dry in june 2019 chennai india reached day zero the day on which the city s reservoirs ran almost completely out of water by the fall seasonal rains had resupplied the city at least temporarily but the looming specter of water scarcity is certain to continue in cities around the world in 2020 in india alone 21 cities are at risk of running dry in 2020 according to a government report and an august report from the world resources institute found that a group of 17 countries that together are home to one quarter of the global population including botswana india iran and mexico are using as much or more water than they can replace upmanu lall director of the columbia water center says that while droughts linked to climate change can create water scarcity in many cases day zero events are caused more by government mismanagement of water resources i haven t seen any reasonable improvement he says so i think there will continue to be places that are stressed and at least one will pop up as a day zero this year the indian subcontinent is a prime candidate he says but on the plus side climate scientists expect 2020 to be an off year for el niño and la niña the weather patterns that occur every few years and can cause flooding in some areas and droughts in others the absence of those extremes might help stave off some instances of water scarcity either way victoria beard an urban planning professor at cornell university and world resources institute fellow says water scarcity will continue to be a problem especially in cities until governments of high risk localities pay to massively overhaul their water systems people are demanding of their leaders to see investments in basic services she says there s no self provision that s going to solve this problem in the long term there are no examples where it s a free for all and it works out well you need coordinated massive public investment tim mcdonnell gender equality is not on the horizon the u n calls gender equality a necessary foundation for a peaceful and prosperous world yet no country in the world is on track to achieve gender equality as defined by the u n s sustainable development goals by 2030 2020 will mark an important milestone in the long road to gender equality it s the 25th anniversary of the beijing declaration and platform for action which is considered a landmark progressive blueprint for advancing women s rights the global community will be taking stock of progress and lack thereof at gatherings such as that of the u n commission on the status of women in march worldwide women continue to face disproportionate rates of discrimination and violence less access to economic and educational opportunities and exclusion from decision making roles at the community and governmental levels by one measure the world will not achieve gender equality for nearly a century the most current estimate by the world economic forum which publishes an annual report to track country by country progress across economic educational health and political dimensions is that achieving parity across all four dimensions will take an average of 99 5 years at the current rate while the wef report found that achieving parity is relatively close at hand for educational attainment which could be possible in as soon as 12 years progress toward closing the economic opportunities gap is actually backsliding by that metric parity is a lowly 57 8 and will take 257 years to overcome emily vaughn hopeful trends global health will get woke this year expect more people in the global health and development community to address the injustices and inequities that can be traced to the era when western countries colonized poor countries stripping them of resources and autonomy people who work in the field know that much of the money influence and decision making about how to help low income countries still comes from wealthy countries with little input from the people who receive the assistance one reason for this mindset says renzo guinto a filipino physician and a member of the lancet planetary health s editorial board is the colonial roots of tropical medicine in the colonial era european researchers studied diseases in the colonies to protect the colonizers not the people living in those places from getting sick over the past couple of years he and a growing number of global health staffers have been working to make a change they aim to give medical professionals in low income countries real leadership roles at the university level students are calling on faculty to acknowledge the field s colonial history in global health curriculum and communications managers at charitable groups are trying to portray the recipients of aid with dignity and respect in messages sent to donors and the media many of these conversations can be found on social media with the hashtags shiftthepower and decolonizeglobalhealth jennifer lentfer a communications strategist who has worked in the field for two decades says she has never seen so much excitement around decolonizing global development there are already events scheduled in 2020 to tackle the subject in the coming weeks lentfer is hosting a couple of online workshops on topics that question western motives to make a difference and help because it is our moral imperative and in january graduate students at duke university are organizing a conference called decolonizing global health 2020 there s a real question as to how to flip the leadership says lentfer and that s coming to a big head malaka gharib satellite imagery could improve global health this year expect to see more research on global health and development from a sky high point of view imagery produced by satellites is becoming more ubiquitous and inexpensive and an increasingly vital source of data on poverty disease and environmental challenges marshall burke deputy director of stanford university s center on food security and the environment is one of a growing number of researchers who are training artificial intelligence software to scan through millions of satellite images to look for clues about where these challenges exist and test solutions to them let s say you run a government agency in a low income country and want to identify the poorest 10 of villages or determine how many people live within easy reach of a medical facility or close to bodies of water that could be a source of mosquito borne diseases satellite imagery can help you answer those questions burke says in a way that s much less expensive and time consuming than traditional boots on the ground surveys cars large buildings and well tended farms can all be indications of income and population density and are easily spotted from space satellite imagery is already helping cattle herders in the sahel look for water and assisting regulators in west africa in cracking down on illegal gold mining it can help humanitarian agencies navigate in the aftermath of natural disasters in some cases it might help us peer into the future in december the world resources institute unveiled an online tool that uses satellite imagery in conjunction with other data to predict water shortages and conflicts in 2020 burke says expect to see more satellite based software tools move out of research labs and into the hands of aid agencies and policymakers and although today most of the images come from satellites owned by the u s and the european union more may soon come from satellites operated by developing countries including ethiopia s first observatory satellite launched in late december tim

marching against corruption repression and inequality and for human rights and human dignity in 2020 youth activists will continue to speak up for the world they want to see says jessica taft a youth movement researcher and professor of latin american studies at the university of california santa cruz that kind of involvement by young people isn t new taft says but what has changed she says is that today s social media platforms make their contributions more visible to the world and to each other with their phones set to retweet they can instantly amplify movements that are half a world away a common refrain from young activists is that the failures of previous generations have left them stuck in a flawed version of the world that an older generation helped make many of the issues that they re focusing on right now are ones that they re able to claim moral authority around as young people says taft that includes topics such as climate change and gun violence which young people can address from personal experience like the students at stoneman douglas high school in parkland fla who captured the world s attention after the shooting at their school matt deitsch a graduate of

why not just give them money and let them decide how best to spend it interest in cash transfers as this form of aid is often referred to is likely to get even bigger over the coming decade says david evans a senior fellow at the washington d c think tank center for global development one reason is that researchers will increasingly be able to study the long term effects of some of the earliest large scale cash transfer programs a series of government assistance schemes that began in latin america in the late 1990s already we re starting to see the first wave of long term evaluations says evans who is on leave as a lead economist at the world bank so far the evidence suggests that poor people who received this cash aid mainly used it to meet short term needs like giving their families enough food each day rather than finding ways to lift themselves out of poverty in a permanent way but these families were also able to give their children more schooling and now that the kids are aging into the workforce it will become clear whether the extra education translates into enough additional income to vault this next generation out of poverty if so says evans that will be an

scribner associate director for humanitarian policy and programs at oxfam america says that funding to respond to these crises is not keeping pace with the need and that will continue to be a

according to some experts the demonstrations will grow more violent in 2020 since the 1980s income inequality has been on the rise says lucas chancel co director of the world inequality lab at the paris school of economics in the u s for example chancel says the richest 1 owned about 40 of the nation s wealth in 2016 up from 20 in the 1980s and trump s 2017 tax policies have only turbocharged inequality with the richest 400 families paying a lower average tax rate in 2018 than the poorest half of american households it is unlikely that 2020 brings anything different he says meaning

more research on global health and development from a sky high point of view imagery produced by satellites is becoming more ubiquitous and inexpensive and an increasingly vital source of data on poverty disease and environmental challenges marshall burke deputy director of stanford university s center on food security and the environment is one of a growing number of researchers who are training artificial intelligence software to scan through millions of satellite images to look for clues about where these challenges exist and test solutions to them let s say you run a government agency in a low income country and want to identify the poorest 10 of villages or determine how many people live within easy reach of a medical facility or close to bodies of water that could be a source of mosquito borne diseases satellite imagery can help you answer those questions burke says in a way that s much less expensive and time consuming than traditional boots on the ground surveys cars large buildings and well tended farms can all be indications of income and population density and are easily spotted from space satellite imagery is already helping cattle herders in the sahel look for water and assisting regulators in west africa in cracking down on illegal gold mining it can help humanitarian agencies navigate in the aftermath of natural disasters in some cases it might help us peer into the future in december the world resources institute unveiled an online tool that uses satellite imagery in conjunction with other data to predict water shortages and conflicts in 2020 burke says expect to see more satellite based software tools move out of research labs and into the hands of aid agencies and policymakers and although today most of the images come from satellites owned by the u s and the european union more may soon come from satellites operated by developing countries including ethiopia s first observatory satellite launched in late december tim

movement researcher and professor of latin american studies at the university of california santa cruz that kind of involvement by young people isn t new taft says but what has changed she says is that today s social media platforms make their contributions more visible to the world and to each other with their phones set to retweet they can instantly amplify movements that are half a world away a common refrain from young activists is that the failures of previous generations have left them stuck in a flawed version of the world that an older generation helped make many of the issues that they re focusing on right now are ones that they re able to claim moral authority around as young people says taft that includes topics such as climate change and gun violence which young people

why not just give them money and let them decide how best to spend it interest in cash transfers as this form of aid is often referred to is likely to get even bigger over the coming decade says david evans a senior fellow at the washington d c think tank center for global development one reason is that researchers will increasingly be able to study the long term effects of some of the earliest large scale cash transfer programs a series of government assistance schemes that began in latin america in the late 1990s already we re starting to see the first wave of long term evaluations says evans who is on leave as a lead economist at the world bank so far the evidence suggests that poor people who received this cash aid mainly used it to meet short term needs like giving their families enough food each day rather than finding ways to lift themselves out of poverty in a permanent way but these families were also able to give their children more schooling and now that the kids are aging into the workforce it will become clear whether the extra education translates into enough additional income to vault this next generation out of poverty if so says evans that will be an

we don t have a crystal ball but as journalists covering global health and development we have a pretty good nose for emerging trends with some help from our favorite expert sources here are 11 trend lines we ll be watching in 2020 first we ll give you the bad news then the hopeful predictions some likely trends give cause for optimism signs of progress in solving the world s problems other trends are pessimistic threats and challenges that are expected to worsen in the year ahead humanitarian law isn t being upheld in some of the countries where we re working says scribner and we don t see world leaders talking about human rights the way they once did scribner says another concern is an increasing number of restrictions on international ngos that make it harder to enter and operate in conflict affected areas like syria and yemen shannon scribner associate director for humanitarian policy and programs at oxfam america says that funding to respond to these crises is not keeping pace with the need and that will continue to be a challenge hot spots include burkina faso where a surge in violence by religious extremists has displaced more than half a million people the philippines where a christmas eve typhoon killed more than two dozen and venezuela where an ongoing economic collapse has resulted in the exodus of nearly five million people in the last five years the united nations is predicting that 168 million people a record will need humanitarian assistance in 2020 due to extreme weather large infectious disease outbreaks and intensifying protracted conflicts across more than 50 countries that s around a million more people than were in need of assistance in 2019 and the number is expected to continue to rise up to 200 million people by 2022 the u n expects that providing this assistance in 2020 could cost up to 29 billion recent high profile measles outbreaks in the u s europe the philippines and samoa should push health officials to make sure more kids are immunized this year to prevent outbreaks the world health organization says that roughly 95 of a community needs to be vaccinated against measles more than half the countries in the world including the united states at 94 haven t reached that threshold according to unicef where might there be a measles outbreak in 2020 afghanistan angola bolivia and haiti all have dismally low immunization rates below 40 those second tier diseases include measles and dengue which did gangbusters in the tropics cholera raged in yemen polio clawed its way back from the brink of defeat in pakistan polio cases were up more than tenfold from a low of just 9 in 2018 in a cruel unintended consequence of the polio eradication effort a dozen countries that had been polio free including china angola and the philippines reported cases of vaccine derived polio this year venezuela reported its first yellow fever case in more than a decade as that country s health care system continues its downward spiral downward despite efforts to rein it in a few cases of middle east respiratory syndrome are reported each month in the middle east and that will probably continue in the coming year over the last 12 months the world made steady progress against the big infectious killers hiv malaria and tuberculosis but other illnesses some of them easily preventable stole the limelight one key solution she says

seems we re returning to the bad old days of the cold war when we used aid as a glorified payoff for friends and allies says jeremy konyndyk a senior fellow at the center for global development and former u s foreign disaster assistance chief under the obama administration but there are some signs of progress next year a new dengue vaccine might finally make a dent in the roughly 100 million cases of the disease that occur most years and the world is more prepared to deal with ebola than at any time in history there are two vaccines and several experimental treatments in use all developed after the 2014 west africa outbreak the current ebola outbreak in eastern democratic republic of congo appears to say more about the dismal social conditions there than about the world s ability to battle this virus if there s an ebola outbreak outside of a conflict zone in 2020 it would likely be contained and crushed quickly jason beaubien part of the problem is that inequality has a new face

america pien huang cash will be king of aid it s an idea that has been gaining popularity for more than two decades instead of giving poor people goods and services say a cow or job training why not just give them money and let them decide how best to spend it interest in cash transfers as this form of aid is often referred to is likely to get even bigger over the coming decade says david evans a senior fellow at the washington d c think tank center for global development one reason is that researchers will increasingly be able to study the long term effects of some of the earliest large scale cash transfer programs a series of government assistance schemes that began in latin america in the late 1990s already we re starting to see the first wave of long term evaluations says evans who is on leave as a lead economist at the world bank so far the evidence suggests that poor people who received this cash aid mainly used it to meet short term needs like giving their families enough food each day rather than finding ways to lift themselves out of poverty in a permanent way but these families were also able to give their children more schooling and now that the kids are aging into the workforce it will become clear whether the extra education translates into enough additional income to vault this next generation out of poverty if so says evans that will be an exciting thing to find

around the world with higher education degrees to increase as advanced skills become more important in both developing and developed economies the international institute for applied systems analysis

predicting that 168 million people a record will need humanitarian assistance in 2020 because of extreme weather large infectious disease outbreaks and intensifying protracted conflicts across more than 50 countries that s around a million more people than were in need of assistance in 2019 and the number is expected to continue to rise up to 200 million people by 2022 the u n expects that providing this assistance in 2020 could cost up to 29 billion hot spots include burkina faso where a surge in violence by religious extremists has displaced more than half a million people the philippines where a christmas eve typhoon killed more than two dozen and venezuela where an economic collapse has resulted in the exodus of nearly 5 million people in the last five years shannon scribner associate director for humanitarian policy and programs at oxfam america says that funding to respond to these crises is not keeping pace with the need and that will continue to be a challenge scribner says another concern is an increasing number of restrictions on international ngos that make it harder to enter and operate in conflict affected areas such as syria and yemen humanitarian law isn t being upheld in some of the countries where we re working says scribner and we don t see world leaders talking about human rights the way they once did one key solution she says channel more funding to small local groups that know the terrain intimately rather than big international ngos tim mcdonnell second tier diseases will go gangbusters over the last 12 months the world made steady progress against the big infectious killers hiv malaria and tuberculosis but other illnesses some of them easily preventable stole the limelight those second tier diseases include measles and dengue which did gangbusters in the tropics cholera raged inyemen polio clawed its way back from the brink of defeat in pakistan polio cases were up more than tenfold from a low of just nine in 2018 in a cruel unintended consequence of the polio eradication effort a dozen countries that had been polio free including china angola and the philippines reported cases of vaccine derived polio in 2019 venezuela reported itsfirst yellow fever case in more than a decade as that country s health care system continues its downward spiral despite efforts to rein it in a few cases of middle east respiratory syndrome are reported each month in the middle east and that will probably continue in the coming year recent high profile measles outbreaks in the u s europe the philippines and samoa should push health officials to make sure more kids are immunized this year to prevent outbreaks the world health organization says that roughly 95 of a community needs to be vaccinated against measles more thanhalf the countries in the world including the u s at 94 haven t reached that threshold according to unicef where might there be a measles outbreak in 2020 afghanistan angola bolivia and haiti all have dismally low immunization rates below 40 but there are some signs of progress this year a newdengue vaccine might finally make a dent in the roughly 100 million cases of the disease that occur most years and the world is more prepared to deal with ebola than at any time in history two vaccines and several experimental treatments are in use all developed after the 2014 west africa outbreak the current ebola outbreak in eastern democratic republic of congo appears to say more about the dismal social conditions there than about the world s ability to battle this virus if there s an ebola outbreak outside a conflict zone in 2020 it would likely be contained and crushed quickly jason beaubien aid will become even more political it seems we re returning to the bad old days of the cold war when we used aid as a glorified payoff for friends and allies says jeremy konyndyk a senior fellow at the center for global development and former u s foreign disaster assistance chief under the obama administration instead of providing aid to improve health and foster economic development konyndyk says there s a growing mentality in the u s that aid can be used as a goody bag to incentivize foreign leaders to fall in line examples include trump s freezing andreinstatement of aid to el salvador guatemala and honduras in 2019 based on their immigration policies his threats tocut off countries that don t vote with the u s at the united nations and hiswithdrawal of aid to palestinians to pressure them to reconsider his peace plan the u k has also announced plans to merge its department for international development into its foreign office a move thatmore than 100 charities say risks politicizing u k aid these shifts by the u s and u k two of the world s largest aid donors could set the tone for a lot of aid policy around the world says konyndyk joanne lu unrest over inequality will grow 2019 was marked by angry protests over inequality around the world and according to some experts the demonstrations will grow more violent in 2020 since the 1980s income inequality has been on the rise says lucas chancel co director of the world inequality lab at the paris school of economics in the u s for example chancel says the richest 1 owned about 40 of the nation s wealth in 2016 up from 20 in the 1980s and trump s 2017 tax policies have only turbocharged inequality with the richest 400 families paying a lower average tax rate in 2018 than the poorest half of american households it is unlikely that 2020 brings anything different he says meaning inequality will deepen despite the efforts of angry protesters to stop it part of the problem is that inequality has a new face according to a new report by theunited nations development programme people are no longer just angry about income they re concerned about inequalities in political representation and power higher education access to technology and the resources to survive climate change chancel says the protests in chile france lebanon hong kong and other countries demonstrate that governments still do not seem to have grasped the reality of the situation and have yet to provide adequate solutions until they do the undp report warns the social unrest will likely continue joanne lu water taps continue to run dry in june 2019 chennai india reached day zero the day on

evans who is on leave as a lead economist at the world bank so far the evidence suggests that poor people who received this cash aid mainly used it to meet short term needs like giving their families enough food each day rather than finding ways to lift themselves out of poverty in a permanent way but these families were also able to give their children more schooling and now that the kids are

predicting that 168 million people a record will need humanitarian assistance in 2020 because of extreme weather large infectious disease outbreaks and intensifying protracted conflicts across more than 50 countries that s around a million more people than were in need of assistance in 2019 and the number is expected to continue to rise up to 200 million people by 2022 the u n expects that providing this assistance in 2020 could cost up to 29 billion hot spots include burkina faso where a surge in violence by religious extremists has displaced more than half a million people the philippines where a christmas eve typhoon killed more than two dozen and venezuela where an economic collapse has resulted in the exodus of nearly 5 million people in the last five years shannon scribner associate director for humanitarian policy and programs at oxfam america says that funding to respond to these crises is not keeping pace with the need and that will continue to be a challenge scribner says another concern is an increasing number of restrictions on international ngos that make it harder to enter and operate in conflict affected areas such as syria and yemen humanitarian law isn t being upheld in some of the countries where we re working says scribner and we don t see world leaders talking about human rights the way they once did one key solution she says channel more funding to small local groups that know the terrain intimately rather than big international ngos tim mcdonnell second tier diseases will go gangbusters over the last 12 months the world made steady progress against the big infectious killers hiv malaria and tuberculosis but other illnesses some of them easily preventable stole the limelight those second tier diseases include measles and dengue which did gangbusters in the tropics cholera raged inyemen polio clawed its way back from the brink of defeat in pakistan polio cases were up more than tenfold from a low of just nine in 2018 in a cruel unintended consequence of the polio eradication effort a dozen countries that had been polio free including china angola and the philippines reported cases of vaccine derived polio in 2019 venezuela reported itsfirst yellow fever case in more than a decade as that country s health care system continues its downward spiral despite efforts to rein it in a few cases of middle east respiratory syndrome are reported each month in the middle east and that will probably continue in the coming year recent high profile measles outbreaks in the u s europe the philippines and samoa should push health officials to make sure more kids are immunized this year to prevent outbreaks the world health organization says that roughly 95 of a community needs to be vaccinated against measles more thanhalf the countries in the world including the u s at 94 haven t reached that threshold according to unicef where might there be a measles outbreak in 2020 afghanistan angola bolivia and haiti all have dismally low immunization rates below 40 but there are some signs of progress this year a newdengue vaccine might finally make a dent in the roughly 100 million cases of the disease that occur most years and the world is more prepared to deal with ebola than at any time in history two vaccines and several experimental treatments are in use all developed after the 2014 west africa outbreak the current ebola outbreak in eastern democratic republic of congo appears to say more about the dismal social conditions there than about the world s ability to battle this virus if there s an ebola outbreak outside a conflict zone in 2020 it would likely be contained and crushed quickly jason beaubien aid will become even more political it seems we re returning to the bad old days of the cold war when we used aid as a glorified payoff for friends and allies says jeremy konyndyk a senior fellow at the center for global development and former u s foreign disaster assistance chief under the obama administration instead of providing aid to improve health and foster economic development konyndyk says there s a growing mentality in the u s that aid can be used as a goody bag to incentivize foreign leaders to fall in line examples include trump s freezing andreinstatement of aid to el salvador guatemala and honduras in 2019 based on their immigration policies his threats tocut off countries that don t vote with the u s at the united nations and hiswithdrawal of aid to palestinians to pressure them to reconsider his peace plan the u k has also announced plans to merge its department for international development into its foreign office a move thatmore than 100 charities say risks politicizing u k aid these shifts by the u s and u k two of the world s largest aid donors could set the tone for a lot of aid policy around the world says konyndyk joanne lu unrest over inequality will grow 2019 was marked by angry protests over inequality around the world and according to some experts the demonstrations will grow more violent in 2020 since the 1980s income inequality has been on the rise says lucas chancel co director of the world inequality lab at the paris school of economics in the u s for example chancel says the richest 1 owned about 40 of the nation s wealth in 2016 up from 20 in the 1980s and trump s 2017 tax policies have only turbocharged inequality with the richest 400 families paying a lower average tax rate in 2018 than the poorest half of american households it is unlikely that 2020 brings anything different he says meaning inequality will deepen despite the efforts of angry protesters to stop it part of the problem is that inequality has a new face according to a new report by theunited nations development programme people are no longer just angry about income they re concerned about inequalities in political representation and power higher education access to technology and the resources to survive climate change chancel says the protests in chile france lebanon hong kong and other countries demonstrate that governments still do not seem to have grasped the reality of the situation and have yet to provide adequate solutions until they do the undp report warns the social unrest will likely continue joanne lu water taps continue to run dry in june 2019 chennai india reached day zero the day on which the city s reservoirs ran almost completely out of water by the fall seasonal rains had resupplied the city at least temporarily but the looming specter of water scarcity is certain to continue in cities around the world in 2020 in india alone 21 cities are at risk of running dry in 2020 according to a government report and an august report from the world resources institute found that a group of 17 countries that together are home to one quarter of the global population including botswana india iran and mexico are using as much or more water than they can replace upmanu lall director of the columbia water center says that while droughts linked to climate change can create water scarcity in many cases day zero events are caused more by government mismanagement of water resources i haven t seen any reasonable improvement he says so i think there will continue to be places that are stressed and at least one will pop up as a day zero this year the indian subcontinent is a prime candidate he says but on the plus side climate scientists expect 2020 to be an off year for el niño and la niña the weather patterns that occur every few years and can cause flooding in some areas and droughts in others the absence of those extremes might help stave off some instances of water scarcity either way victoria beard an urban planning professor at cornell university and world resources institute fellow says water scarcity will continue to be a problem especially in cities until governments of high risk localities pay to massively overhaul their water systems people are demanding of their leaders to see investments in basic services she says there s no self provision that s going to solve this problem in the long term there are no examples where it s a free for all and it works out well you need coordinated massive public investment tim mcdonnell gender equality is not on the horizon the u n calls gender equality a necessary foundation for a peaceful and prosperous world yet no country in the world is on track to achieve gender equality as defined by the u n s sustainable development goals by 2030 2020 will mark an important milestone in the long road to gender equality it s the 25th anniversary of the beijing declaration and platform for action which is considered a landmark progressive blueprint for advancing women s rights the global community will be taking stock of progress and lack thereof at gatherings such as that of the u n commission on the status of women in march worldwide women continue to face disproportionate rates of discrimination and violence less access to economic and educational opportunities and exclusion from decision making roles at the community and governmental levels by one measure the world will not achieve gender equality for nearly a century the most current estimate by the world economic forum which publishes an annual report to track country by country progress across economic educational health and political dimensions is that achieving parity across all four dimensions will take an average of 99 5 years at the current rate while the wef report found that achieving parity is relatively close at hand for educational attainment which could be possible in as soon as 12 years progress toward closing the economic opportunities gap is actually backsliding by that metric parity is a lowly 57 8 and will take 257 years to overcome emily vaughn hopeful trends global health will get woke this year expect more people in the global health and development community to address the injustices and inequities that can be traced to the era when western countries colonized poor countries stripping them of resources and autonomy people who work in the field know that much of the money influence and decision making about how to help low income countries still comes from wealthy countries with little input from the people who receive the assistance one reason for this mindset says renzo guinto a filipino physician and a member of the lancet planetary health s editorial board is the colonial roots of tropical medicine in the colonial era european researchers studied diseases in the colonies to protect the colonizers not the people living in those places from getting sick over the past couple of years he and a growing number of global health staffers have been working to make a change they aim to give medical professionals in low income countries real leadership roles at the university level students are calling on faculty to acknowledge the field s colonial history in global health curriculum and communications managers at charitable groups are trying to portray the recipients of aid with dignity and respect in messages sent to donors and the media many of these conversations can be found on social media with the hashtags shiftthepower and decolonizeglobalhealth jennifer lentfer a communications strategist who has worked in the field for two decades says she has never seen so much excitement around decolonizing global development there are already events scheduled in 2020 to tackle the subject in the coming weeks lentfer is hosting a couple of online workshops on topics that question western motives to make a difference and help because it is our moral imperative and in january graduate students at duke university are organizing a conference called decolonizing global

more research on global health and development from a sky high point of view imagery produced by satellites is becoming more ubiquitous and inexpensive and an increasingly vital source of data on poverty disease and environmental challenges marshall burke deputy director of stanford university s center on food security and the environment is one of a growing number of researchers who are training artificial intelligence software to scan through millions of satellite images to look for clues about where these challenges exist and test solutions to them let s say you run a government agency in a low income country and want to identify the poorest 10 of villages or determine how many people live within easy reach of a medical facility or close to bodies of water that could be a source of mosquito borne diseases satellite imagery can help you answer those questions burke says in a way that s much less expensive and time consuming than traditional boots on the ground surveys cars large buildings and well tended farms can all be indications of income and population density and are easily spotted from space satellite imagery is already helping cattle herders in the sahel look for water and assisting regulators in west africa in cracking down on illegal gold mining it can help humanitarian agencies navigate in the aftermath of natural disasters in some cases it might help us peer into the future in december the world resources institute unveiled an online tool that uses satellite imagery in conjunction with other data to predict water shortages and conflicts in 2020 burke says expect to see more satellite based software tools move out of research labs and into the hands of aid agencies and policymakers and although today most of the images come from satellites owned by the u s and the european union more may soon come from satellites operated by developing countries including ethiopia s first observatory satellite launched in late december tim

predicting that 168 million people a record will need humanitarian assistance in 2020 because of extreme weather large infectious disease outbreaks and intensifying protracted conflicts across more than 50 countries that s around a million more people than were in need of assistance in 2019 and the number is expected to continue to rise up to 200 million people by 2022 the u n expects that providing this assistance in 2020 could cost up to 29 billion hot spots include burkina faso where a surge in violence by religious extremists has displaced more than half a million people the philippines where a christmas eve typhoon killed more than two dozen and venezuela where an economic collapse has resulted in the exodus of nearly 5 million people in the last five years shannon scribner associate director for humanitarian policy and programs at oxfam america says that funding to respond to these crises is not keeping pace with the need and that will continue to be a challenge scribner says another concern is an increasing number of restrictions on international ngos that make it harder to enter and operate in conflict affected areas such as syria and yemen humanitarian law isn t being upheld in some of the countries where we re working says scribner and we don t see world leaders talking about human rights the way they once did one key solution she says channel more funding to small local groups that know the terrain intimately rather than big international ngos tim mcdonnell second tier diseases will go gangbusters over the last 12 months the world made steady progress against the big infectious killers hiv malaria and tuberculosis but other illnesses some of them easily preventable stole the limelight those second tier diseases include measles and dengue which did gangbusters in the tropics cholera raged in yemen polio clawed its way back from the brink of defeat in pakistan polio cases were up more than tenfold from a low of just nine in 2018 in a cruel unintended consequence of the polio eradication effort a dozen countries that had been polio free including china angola and the philippines reported cases of vaccine derived polio in 2019 venezuela reported its first yellow fever case in more than a decade as that country s health care system continues its downward spiral despite efforts to rein it in a few cases of middle east respiratory syndrome are reported each month in the middle east and that will probably continue in the coming year recent high profile measles outbreaks in the u s europe the philippines and samoa should push health officials to make sure more kids are immunized this year to prevent outbreaks the world health organization says that roughly 95 of a community needs to be vaccinated against measles more than half the countries in the world including the u s at 94 haven t reached that threshold according to unicef where might there be a measles outbreak in 2020 afghanistan angola bolivia and haiti all have dismally low immunization rates below 40 but there are some signs of progress this year a new dengue vaccine might finally make a dent in the roughly 100 million cases of the disease that occur most years and the world is more prepared to deal with ebola than at any time in history two vaccines and several experimental treatments are in use all developed after the 2014 west africa outbreak the current ebola outbreak in eastern democratic republic of congo appears to say more about the dismal social conditions there than about the world s ability to battle this virus if there s an ebola outbreak outside a conflict zone in 2020 it would likely be contained and crushed quickly jason beaubien aid will become even more political it seems we re returning to the bad old days of the cold war when we used aid as a glorified payoff for friends and allies says jeremy konyndyk a senior fellow at the center for global development and former u s foreign disaster assistance chief under the obama administration instead of providing aid to improve health and foster economic development konyndyk says there s a growing mentality in the u s that aid can be used as a goody bag to incentivize foreign leaders to fall in line examples include trump s freezing and reinstatement of aid to el salvador guatemala and honduras in 2019 based on their immigration policies his threats to cut off countries that don t vote with the u s at the united nations and his withdrawal of aid to palestinians to pressure them to reconsider his peace plan the u k has also announced plans to merge its department for international development into its foreign office a move that more than 100 charities say risks politicizing u k aid these shifts by the u s and u k two of the world s largest aid donors could set the tone for a lot of aid policy around the world says konyndyk joanne lu unrest over inequality will grow 2019 was marked by angry protests over inequality around the world and according to some experts the demonstrations will grow more violent in 2020 since the 1980s income inequality has been on the rise says lucas chancel co director of the world inequality lab at the paris school of economics in the u s for example chancel says the richest 1 owned about 40 of the nation s wealth in 2016 up from 20 in the 1980s and trump s 2017 tax policies have only turbocharged inequality with the richest 400 families paying a lower average tax rate in 2018 than the poorest half of american households it is unlikely that 2020 brings anything different he says meaning inequality will deepen despite the efforts of angry protesters to stop it part of the problem is that inequality has a new face according to a new report by the united nations development programme people are no longer just angry about income they re concerned about inequalities in political representation and power higher education access to technology and the resources to survive climate change chancel says the protests in chile france lebanon hong kong and other countries demonstrate that governments still do not seem to have grasped the reality of the situation and have yet to

which the city s reservoirs ran almost completely out of water by the fall seasonal rains had resupplied the city at least temporarily but the looming specter of water scarcity is certain to continue in cities around the world in 2020 in india alone 21 cities are at risk of running dry in 2020 according to a government report and an august report from the world resources institute found that a group of 17 countries that together are home to one quarter of the global population including botswana india iran and mexico are using as much or more water than they can replace upmanu lall director of the columbia water center says that while droughts linked to climate change can create water scarcity in many cases day zero events are caused more by government mismanagement of water resources i haven t seen any reasonable improvement he says so i think there will continue to be places that are stressed and at least one will pop up as a day zero this year the indian subcontinent is a prime candidate he says but on the plus side climate scientists expect 2020 to be an off year for el niño and la niña the weather patterns that occur every few years and can cause flooding in some areas and droughts in others the absence of those extremes might help stave off some instances of water scarcity either way victoria beard an urban planning professor at cornell university and world resources institute fellow says water scarcity will continue to be a problem especially in cities until governments of high risk localities pay to massively overhaul their water systems people are demanding of their leaders to see investments in basic services she says there s no self provision that s going to solve this problem in the long term there are no examples where it s a free for all and it works out well you need coordinated massive public investment tim mcdonnell gender equality is not on the horizon the u n calls gender equality a necessary foundation for a peaceful and prosperous world yet no country in the world is on track to achieve gender equality as defined by the u n s sustainable development goals by 2030 2020 will mark an important milestone in the long road to gender equality it s the 25th anniversary of the beijing declaration and platform for action which is considered a landmark progressive blueprint for advancing women s rights the global community will be taking stock of progress and lack thereof at gatherings such as that of the u n commission on the status of women in march worldwide women continue to face disproportionate rates of discrimination and violence less access to economic and educational opportunities and exclusion from decision making roles at the community and governmental levels by one measure the world will not achieve gender equality for nearly a century the most current estimate by the world economic forum which publishes an annual report to track country by country progress across economic educational health and political dimensions is that achieving parity across all four dimensions will take an average of 99 5 years at the current rate while the wef report found that achieving parity is relatively close at hand for educational attainment which could be possible in as soon as 12 years progress toward closing the economic opportunities gap is actually backsliding by that metric parity is a lowly 57 8 and will take 257 years to overcome emily vaughn hopeful trends global health will get woke this year expect more people in the global health and development community to address the injustices and inequities that can be traced to the era when western countries colonized poor countries stripping them of resources and autonomy people who work in the field know that much of the money influence and decision making about how to help low income countries still comes from wealthy countries with little input from the people who receive the assistance one reason for this mindset says renzo guinto a filipino physician and a member of the lancet planetary health s editorial board is the colonial roots of tropical medicine in the colonial era european researchers studied diseases in the colonies to protect the colonizers not the people living in those places from getting sick over the past couple of years he and a growing number of global health staffers have been working to make a change they aim to give medical professionals in low income countries real leadership roles at the university level students are calling on faculty to acknowledge the field s colonial history in global health curriculum and communications managers at charitable groups are trying to portray the recipients of aid with dignity and respect in messages sent to donors and the media many of these conversations can be found on social media with the hashtags shiftthepower and decolonizeglobalhealth jennifer lentfer a communications strategist who has worked in the field for two decades says she has never seen so much excitement around decolonizing global development there are already events scheduled in 2020 to tackle the subject in the coming weeks lentfer is hosting a couple of online workshops on topics that question western motives to make a difference and help because it is our moral imperative and in january graduate students at duke university are organizing a conference called decolonizing global

more research on global health and development from a sky high point of view imagery produced by satellites is becoming more ubiquitous and inexpensive and an increasingly vital source of data on poverty disease and environmental challenges marshall burke deputy director of stanford university s center on food security and the environment is one of a growing number of researchers who are training artificial intelligence software to scan through millions of satellite images to look for clues about where these challenges exist and test solutions to them let s say you run a government agency in a low income country and want to identify the poorest 10 of villages or determine how many people live within easy reach of a medical facility or close to bodies of water that could be a source of mosquito borne diseases satellite imagery can help you answer those questions burke says in a way that s much less expensive and time consuming than traditional boots on the ground surveys cars large buildings and well tended farms can all be indications of income and population density and are easily spotted from space satellite imagery is already helping cattle herders in the sahel look for water and assisting regulators in west africa in cracking down on illegal gold mining it can help humanitarian agencies navigate in the aftermath of natural disasters in some cases it might help us peer into the future in december the world resources institute unveiled an online tool that uses satellite imagery in conjunction with other data to predict water shortages and conflicts in 2020 burke says expect to see more satellite based software tools move out of research labs and into the hands of aid agencies and policymakers and although today most of the images come from satellites owned by the u s and the european union more may soon come from satellites operated by developing countries including ethiopia s first observatory satellite launched in late december tim

evans who is on leave as a lead economist at the world bank so far the evidence suggests that poor people who received this cash aid mainly used it to meet short term needs like giving their families enough food each day rather than finding ways to lift themselves out of poverty in a permanent way but these families were also able to give their children more schooling and now that the kids are

predicting that 168 million people a record will need humanitarian assistance in 2020 because of extreme weather large infectious disease outbreaks and intensifying protracted conflicts across more than 50 countries that s around a million more people than were in need of assistance in 2019 and the number is expected to continue to rise up to 200 million people by 2022 the u n expects that providing this assistance in 2020 could cost up to 29 billion hot spots include burkina faso where a surge in violence by religious extremists has displaced more than half a million people the philippines where a christmas eve typhoon killed more than two dozen and venezuela where an economic collapse has resulted in the exodus of nearly 5 million people in the last five years shannon scribner associate director for humanitarian policy and programs at oxfam america says that funding to respond to these crises is not keeping pace with the need and that will continue to be a challenge scribner says another concern is an increasing number of restrictions on international ngos that make it harder to enter and operate in conflict affected areas such as syria and yemen humanitarian law isn t being upheld in some of the countries where we re working says scribner and we don t see world leaders talking about human rights the way they once did one key solution she says channel more funding to small local groups that know the terrain intimately rather than big international ngos tim mcdonnell second tier diseases will go gangbusters over the last 12 months the world made steady progress against the big infectious killers hiv malaria and tuberculosis but other illnesses some of them easily preventable stole the limelight those second tier diseases include measles and dengue which did gangbusters in the tropics cholera raged inyemen polio clawed its way back from the brink of defeat in pakistan polio cases were up more than tenfold from a low of just nine in 2018 in a cruel unintended consequence of the polio eradication effort a dozen countries that had been polio free including china angola and the philippines reported cases of vaccine derived polio in 2019 venezuela reported itsfirst yellow fever case in more than a decade as that country s health care system continues its downward spiral despite efforts to rein it in a few cases of middle east respiratory syndrome are reported each month in the middle east and that will probably continue in the coming year recent high profile measles outbreaks in the u s europe the philippines and samoa should push health officials to make sure more kids are immunized this year to prevent outbreaks the world health organization says that roughly 95 of a community needs to be vaccinated against measles more thanhalf the countries in the world including the u s at 94 haven t reached that threshold according to unicef where might there be a measles outbreak in 2020 afghanistan angola bolivia and haiti all have dismally low immunization rates below 40 but there are some signs of progress this year a newdengue vaccine might finally make a dent in the roughly 100 million cases of the disease that occur most years and the world is more prepared to deal with ebola than at any time in history two vaccines and several experimental treatments are in use all developed after the 2014 west africa outbreak the current ebola outbreak in eastern democratic republic of congo appears to say more about the dismal social conditions there than about the world s ability to battle this virus if there s an ebola outbreak outside a conflict zone in 2020 it would likely be contained and crushed quickly jason beaubien aid will become even more political it seems we re returning to the bad old days of the cold war when we used aid as a glorified payoff for friends and allies says jeremy konyndyk a senior fellow at the center for global development and former u s foreign disaster assistance chief under the obama administration instead of providing aid to improve health and foster economic development konyndyk says there s a growing mentality in the u s that aid can be used as a goody bag to incentivize foreign leaders to fall in line examples include trump s freezing andreinstatement of aid to el salvador guatemala and honduras in 2019 based on their immigration policies his threats tocut off countries that don t vote with the u s at the united nations and hiswithdrawal of aid to palestinians to pressure them to reconsider his peace plan the u k has also announced plans to merge its department for international development into its foreign office a move thatmore than 100 charities say risks politicizing u k aid these shifts by the u s and u k two of the world s largest aid donors could set the tone for a lot of aid policy around the world says konyndyk joanne lu unrest over inequality will grow 2019 was marked by angry protests over inequality around the world and according to some experts the demonstrations will grow more violent in 2020 since the 1980s income inequality has been on the rise says lucas chancel co director of the world inequality lab at the paris school of economics in the u s for example chancel says the richest 1 owned about 40 of the nation s wealth in 2016 up from 20 in the 1980s and trump s 2017 tax policies have only turbocharged inequality with the richest 400 families paying a lower average tax rate in 2018 than the poorest half of american households it is unlikely that 2020 brings anything different he says meaning inequality will deepen despite the efforts of angry protesters to stop it part of the problem is that inequality has a new face according to a new report by theunited nations development programme people are no longer just angry about income they re concerned about inequalities in political representation and power higher education access to technology and the resources to survive climate change chancel says the protests in chile france lebanon hong kong and other countries demonstrate that governments still do not seem to have grasped the reality of the situation and have yet to provide adequate solutions until they do the undp report warns the social unrest will likely continue joanne lu water taps continue to run dry in june 2019 chennai india reached day zero the day on which the city s reservoirs ran almost completely out of water by the fall seasonal rains had resupplied the city at least temporarily but the looming specter of water scarcity is certain to continue in cities around the world in 2020 in india alone 21 cities are at risk of running dry in 2020 according to a government report and an august report from the world resources institute found that a group of 17 countries that together are home to one quarter of the global population including botswana india iran and mexico are using as much or more water than they can replace upmanu lall director of the columbia water center says that while droughts linked to climate change can create water scarcity in many cases day zero events are caused more by government mismanagement of water resources i haven t seen any reasonable improvement he says so i think there will continue to be places that are stressed and at least one will pop up as a day zero this year the indian subcontinent is a prime candidate he says but on the plus side climate scientists expect 2020 to be an off year for el niño and la niña the weather patterns that occur every few years and can cause flooding in some areas and droughts in others the absence of those extremes might help stave off some instances of water scarcity either way victoria beard an urban planning professor at cornell university and world resources institute fellow says water scarcity will continue to be a problem especially in cities until governments of high risk localities pay to massively overhaul their water systems people are demanding of their leaders to see investments in basic services she says there s no self provision that s going to solve this problem in the long term there are no examples where it s a free for all and it works out well you need coordinated massive public investment tim mcdonnell gender equality is not on the horizon the u n calls gender equality a necessary foundation for a peaceful and prosperous world yet no country in the world is on track to achieve gender equality as defined by the u n s sustainable development goals by 2030 2020 will mark an important milestone in the long road to gender equality it s the 25th anniversary of the beijing declaration and platform for action which is considered a landmark progressive blueprint for advancing women s rights the global community will be taking stock of progress and lack thereof at gatherings such as that of the u n commission on the status of women in march worldwide women continue to face disproportionate rates of discrimination and violence less access to economic and educational opportunities and exclusion from decision making roles at the community and governmental levels by one measure the world will not achieve gender equality for nearly a century the most current estimate by the world economic forum which publishes an annual report to track country by country progress across economic educational health and political dimensions is that achieving parity across all four dimensions will take an average of 99 5 years at the current rate while the wef report found that achieving parity is relatively close at hand for educational attainment which could be possible in as soon as 12 years progress toward closing the economic opportunities gap is actually backsliding by that metric parity is a lowly 57 8 and will take 257 years to overcome emily vaughn hopeful trends global health will get woke this year expect more people in the global health and development community to address the injustices and inequities that can be traced to the era when western countries colonized poor countries stripping them of resources and autonomy people who work in the field know that much of the money influence and decision making about how to help low income countries still comes from wealthy countries with little input from the people who receive the assistance one reason for this mindset says renzo guinto a filipino physician and a member of the lancet planetary health s editorial board is the colonial roots of tropical medicine in the colonial era european researchers studied diseases in the colonies to protect the colonizers not the people living in those places from getting sick over the past couple of years he and a growing number of global health staffers have been working to make a change they aim to give medical professionals in low income countries real leadership roles at the university level students are calling on faculty to acknowledge the field s colonial history in global health curriculum and communications managers at charitable groups are trying to portray the recipients of aid with dignity and respect in messages sent to donors and the media many of these conversations can be found on social media with the hashtags shiftthepower and decolonizeglobalhealth jennifer lentfer a communications strategist who has worked in the field for two decades says she has never seen so much excitement around decolonizing global development there are already events scheduled in 2020 to tackle the subject in the coming weeks lentfer is hosting a couple of online workshops on topics that question western motives to make a difference and help because it is our moral imperative and in january graduate students at duke university are organizing a conference called decolonizing global

more research on global health and development from a sky high point of view imagery produced by satellites is becoming more ubiquitous and inexpensive and an increasingly vital source of data on poverty disease and environmental challenges marshall burke deputy director of stanford university s center on food security and the environment is one of a growing number of researchers who are training artificial intelligence software to scan through millions of satellite images to look for clues about where these challenges exist and test solutions to them let s say you run a government agency in a low income country and want to identify the poorest 10 of villages or determine how many people live within easy reach of a medical facility or close to bodies of water that could be a source of mosquito borne diseases satellite imagery can help you answer those questions burke says in a way that s much less expensive and time consuming than traditional boots on the ground surveys cars large buildings and well tended farms can all be indications of income and population density and are easily spotted from space satellite imagery is already helping cattle herders in the sahel look for water and assisting regulators in west africa in cracking down on illegal gold mining it can help humanitarian agencies navigate in the aftermath of natural disasters in some cases it might help us peer into the future in december the world resources institute unveiled an online tool that uses satellite imagery in conjunction with other data to predict water shortages and conflicts in 2020 burke says expect to see more satellite based software tools move out of research labs and into the hands of aid agencies and policymakers and although today most of the images come from satellites owned by the u s and the european union more may soon come from satellites operated by developing countries including ethiopia s first observatory satellite launched in late december tim

predicting that 168 million people a record will need humanitarian assistance in 2020 because of extreme weather large infectious disease outbreaks and intensifying protracted conflicts across more than 50 countries that s around a million more people than were in need of assistance in 2019 and the number is expected to continue to rise up to 200 million people by 2022 the u n expects that providing this assistance in 2020 could cost up to 29 billion hot spots include burkina faso where a surge in violence by religious extremists has displaced more than half a million people the philippines where a christmas eve typhoon killed more than two dozen and venezuela where an economic collapse has resulted in the exodus of nearly 5 million people in the last five years shannon scribner associate director for humanitarian policy and programs at oxfam america says that funding to respond to these crises is not keeping pace with the need and that will continue to be a challenge scribner says another concern is an increasing number of restrictions on international ngos that make it harder to enter and operate in conflict affected areas such as syria and yemen humanitarian law isn t being upheld in some of the countries where we re working says scribner and we don t see world leaders talking about human rights the way they once did one key solution she says channel more funding to small local groups that know the terrain intimately rather than big international ngos tim mcdonnell second tier diseases will go gangbusters over the last 12 months the world made steady progress against the big infectious killers hiv malaria and tuberculosis but other illnesses some of them easily preventable stole the limelight those second tier diseases include measles and dengue which did gangbusters in the tropics cholera raged inyemen polio clawed its way back from the brink of defeat in pakistan polio cases were up more than tenfold from a low of just nine in 2018 in a cruel unintended consequence of the polio eradication effort a dozen countries that had been polio free including china angola and the philippines reported cases of vaccine derived polio in 2019 venezuela reported itsfirst yellow fever case in more than a decade as that country s health care system continues its downward spiral despite efforts to rein it in a few cases of middle east respiratory syndrome are reported each month in the middle east and that will probably continue in the coming year recent high profile measles outbreaks in the u s europe the philippines and samoa should push health officials to make sure more kids are immunized this year to prevent outbreaks the world health organization says that roughly 95 of a community needs to be vaccinated against measles more thanhalf the countries in the world including the u s at 94 haven t reached that threshold according to unicef where might there be a measles outbreak in 2020 afghanistan angola bolivia and haiti all have dismally low immunization rates below 40 but there are some signs of progress this year a newdengue vaccine might finally make a dent in the roughly 100 million cases of the disease that occur most years and the world is more prepared to deal with ebola than at any time in history two vaccines and several experimental treatments are in use all developed after the 2014 west africa outbreak the current ebola outbreak in eastern democratic republic of congo appears to say more about the dismal social conditions there than about the world s ability to battle this virus if there s an ebola outbreak outside a conflict zone in 2020 it would likely be contained and crushed quickly jason beaubien aid will become even more political it seems we re returning to the bad old days of the cold war when we used aid as a glorified payoff for friends and allies says jeremy konyndyk a senior fellow at the center for global development and former u s foreign disaster assistance chief under the obama administration instead of providing aid to improve health and foster economic development konyndyk says there s a growing mentality in the u s that aid can be used as a goody bag to incentivize foreign leaders to fall in line examples include trump s freezing andreinstatement of aid to el salvador guatemala and honduras in 2019 based on their immigration policies his threats tocut off countries that don t vote with the u s at the united nations and hiswithdrawal of aid to palestinians to pressure them to reconsider his peace plan the u k has also announced plans to merge its department for international development into its foreign office a move thatmore than 100 charities say risks politicizing u k aid these shifts by the u s and u k two of the world s largest aid donors could set the tone for a lot of aid policy around the world says konyndyk joanne lu unrest over inequality will grow 2019 was marked by angry protests over inequality around the world and according to some experts the demonstrations will grow more violent in 2020 since the 1980s income inequality has been on the rise says lucas chancel co director of the world inequality lab at the paris school of economics in the u s for example chancel says the richest 1 owned about 40 of the nation s wealth in 2016 up from 20 in the 1980s and trump s 2017 tax policies have only turbocharged inequality with the richest 400 families paying a lower average tax rate in 2018 than the poorest half of american households it is unlikely that 2020 brings anything different he says meaning inequality will deepen despite the efforts of angry protesters to stop it part of the problem is that inequality has a new face according to a new report by theunited nations development programme people are no longer just angry about income they re concerned about inequalities in political representation and power higher education access to technology and the resources to survive climate change chancel says the protests in chile france lebanon hong kong and other countries demonstrate that governments still do not seem to have grasped the reality of the situation and have yet to provide adequate solutions until they do the undp report warns the social unrest will likely continue joanne lu water taps continue to run dry in june 2019 chennai india reached day zero the day on which the city s reservoirs ran almost completely out of water by the fall seasonal rains had resupplied the city at least temporarily but the looming specter of water scarcity is certain to continue in cities around the world in 2020 in india alone 21 cities are at risk of running dry in 2020 according to a government report and an august report from the world resources institute found that a group of 17 countries that together are home to one quarter of the global population including botswana india iran and mexico are using as much or more water than they can replace upmanu lall director of the columbia water center says that while droughts linked to climate change can create water scarcity in many cases day zero events are caused more by government mismanagement of water resources i haven t seen any reasonable improvement he says so i think there will continue to be places that are stressed and at least one will pop up as a day zero this year the indian subcontinent is a prime candidate he says but on the plus side climate scientists expect 2020 to be an off year for el niño and la niña the weather patterns that occur every few years and can cause flooding in some areas and droughts in others the absence of those extremes might help stave off some instances of water scarcity either way victoria beard an urban planning professor at cornell university and world resources institute fellow says water scarcity will continue to be a problem especially in cities until governments of high risk localities pay to massively overhaul their water systems people are demanding of their leaders to see investments in basic services she says there s no self provision that s going to solve this problem in the long term there are no examples where it s a free for all and it works out well you need coordinated massive public investment tim mcdonnell gender equality is not on the horizon the u n calls gender equality a necessary foundation for a peaceful and prosperous world yet no country in the world is on track to achieve gender equality as defined by the u n s sustainable development goals by 2030 2020 will mark an important milestone in the long road to gender equality it s the 25th anniversary of the beijing declaration and platform for action which is considered a landmark progressive blueprint for advancing women s rights the global community will be taking stock of progress and lack thereof at gatherings such as that of the u n commission on the status of women in march worldwide women continue to face disproportionate rates of discrimination and violence less access to economic and educational opportunities and exclusion from decision making roles at the community and governmental levels by one measure the world will not achieve gender equality for nearly a century the most current estimate by the world economic forum which publishes an annual report to track country by country progress across economic educational health and political dimensions is that achieving parity across all four dimensions will take an average of 99 5 years at the current rate while the wef report found that achieving parity is relatively close at hand for educational attainment which could be possible in as soon as 12 years progress toward closing the economic opportunities gap is actually backsliding by that metric parity is a lowly 57 8 and will take 257 years to overcome emily vaughn hopeful trends global health will get woke this year expect more people in the global health and development community to address the injustices and inequities that can be traced to the era when western countries colonized poor countries stripping them of resources and autonomy people who work in the field know that much of the money influence and decision making about how to help low income countries still comes from wealthy countries with little input from the people who receive the assistance one reason for this mindset says renzo guinto a filipino physician and a member of the lancet planetary health s editorial board is the colonial roots of tropical medicine in the colonial era european researchers studied diseases in the colonies to protect the colonizers not the people living in those places from getting sick over the past couple of years he and a growing number of global health staffers have been working to make a change they aim to give medical professionals in low income countries real leadership roles at the university level students are calling on faculty to acknowledge the field s colonial history in global health curriculum and communications managers at charitable groups are trying to portray the recipients of aid with dignity and respect in messages sent to donors and the media many of these conversations can be found on social media with the hashtags shiftthepower and decolonizeglobalhealth jennifer lentfer a communications strategist who has worked in the field for two decades says she has never seen so much excitement around decolonizing global development there are already events scheduled in 2020 to tackle the subject in the coming weeks lentfer is hosting a couple of online workshops on topics that question western motives to make a difference and help because it is our moral imperative and in january graduate students at duke university are organizing a conference called decolonizing global

more research on global health and development from a sky high point of view imagery produced by satellites is becoming more ubiquitous and inexpensive and an increasingly vital source of data on poverty disease and environmental challenges marshall burke deputy director of stanford university s center on food security and the environment is one of a growing number of researchers who are training artificial intelligence software to scan through millions of satellite images to look for clues about where these challenges exist and test solutions to them let s say you run a government agency in a low income country and want to identify the poorest 10 of villages or determine how many people live within easy reach of a medical facility or close to bodies of water that could be a source of mosquito borne diseases satellite imagery can help you answer those questions burke says in a way that s much less expensive and time consuming than traditional boots on the ground surveys cars large buildings and well tended farms can all be indications of income and population density and are easily spotted from space satellite imagery is already helping cattle herders in the sahel look for water and assisting regulators in west africa in cracking down on illegal gold mining it can help humanitarian agencies navigate in the aftermath of natural disasters in some cases it might help us peer into the future in december the world resources institute unveiled an online tool that uses satellite imagery in conjunction with other data to predict water shortages and conflicts in 2020 burke says expect to see more satellite based software tools move out of research labs and into the hands of aid agencies and policymakers and although today most of the images come from satellites owned by the u s and the european union more may soon come from satellites operated by developing countries including ethiopia s first observatory satellite launched in late december tim

can address from personal experience like the students at stoneman douglas high school in parkland fla who captured the world s attention after the shooting at their school matt deitsch a graduate of the school and an organizer of the march for our lives rally in washington d c told npr in an interview in 2019 if we re not standing up and organizing ourselves then we re not doing enough to save lives in america pien huang cash will be king of aid it s an idea that has been gaining popularity for more than two decades instead of giving poor people goods and services say a cow or job training why not just give them money and let them decide how best to spend it interest in cash transfers as this form of aid is often referred to is likely to get even bigger over the coming decade says david evans a senior fellow at the washington d c think tank center for global development one reason is that researchers will increasingly be able to study the long term effects of some of the earliest large scale cash transfer programs a series of government assistance schemes that began in latin america in the late 1990s already we re starting to see the first wave of long term evaluations says evans who is on leave as a lead economist at the world bank so far the evidence suggests that poor people who received this cash aid mainly used it to meet short term needs like giving their families enough food each day rather than finding ways to lift themselves out of poverty in a permanent way but these families were also able to give their children more schooling and now that the kids are aging into the workforce it will become clear whether the extra education translates into enough additional income to vault this next generation out of poverty if so says evans that will be an exciting thing to find nurith aizenman access to college will boom more and more people are going to college access to higher education has expanded rapidly across the globe over the last five years says michael green ceo of social progress imperative and he expects it to continue in 2020 green and his organization through itssocial progress index have been tracking this every year since 2014 higher education has traditionally been concentrated in wealthy countries says green but many countries are making significant leaps both in terms of enrollment and quality and it s leading to a growing global middle class some of the biggest improvers according to their data include morocco slovakia and turkey our world in data an online publication based at oxford university also expects

by 21st century wire new years day special looking forward into the new year here are but a few breaking trends to look out for as well as some salient predictions for the coming year in last year s trends and predictions for 2019 we identified some prominent watershed moments in politics international relations and technology but as is continually the case these days the pace of change keeps speeding up offering even more twists and turns than seen in previous years looking back 2019 was truly a shake bake year where everything was up for grabs and where we successfully predicted both robert mueller s failure and the democrat s impeachment of donald trump along with a few other near miss predictions for this coming year we ll see some entirely new realities come into focus as 2020 takes us out of the frying pan so here it is the good the bad and the ugly for 2020 impeachment dies on the vine before christmas house speaker nancy pelosi basically kicked the can into the new year afraid to send the democrat s articles of impeachment to the us senate as is standard procedure one has to assume this is because she knew that the democrat s case was so incredibly weak that it would die as soon as it hit the senate review panel as it turns out this has been one the worst own goals in us political history but those who have actually been following these developments with a sober eye are not at all surprised by what they are seeing of course this will only help trump in his re election campaign 2020 election circus trump redux all indications are that trump will be the presumptive favorite to win re election in 2020 the reasons are as follows the democratic field was bloated from the start with some 25 candidates vying for a spot on the podium this has left many swing voters confused and uninspired for the most part although there are significant pockets of excitement for runners like bernie sanders and elizabeth warren and somehow for joe biden but the question is will any of these democrat candidates do better than hillary did in 2016 right now the answer appears to be no while trump s support base seems to be steadily growing add to this the recent bounce in the polls received by trump as a result of the democrat s disastrous impeachment effort and trump seems to be the frontrunner ahead of the democratic primaries in 2020 regardless this will still be a close election and the democrats are still likely to carry the popular vote nationally while trump will take the electoral college again by solidifying some additional gains in heartland and rust belt states as well as in key swing states like virginia if indeed trump wins re election expect accusations of russian interference and also expect angry antifa mobs to set some american cities on fire literally half of america still hasn t learned its lessons from 2016 democratic civil war one of the tragic consequences of four years of scapegoating russia for hillary s 2016 electoral train wreck is that there has been virtually no work on policy and creating a unified platform for the democratic party add to this the bloated and discombobulated democratic field and the reality of more progressive young bloods coming in like alexandria ocasio cortez fighting for key ranking positions and challenging political dinosaurs like joe biden nancy pelosi chuck schumer and you have a real power struggle for the soul of the party every week we see young leftists accusing old centerist democrats of being in the pocket of wall street and not being pure enough or progressive enough for impatient millennials who want change now of course they may be right but that still won t bring the party any closer to victory in 2020 this is not unlike the tea party split experienced by republicans after their disastrous 2008 election as a result wide fractures are already occurring in the american political left and within the party itself under the surface you already have bad blood between the bernie sanders base and the democratic national committee dnc for intentionally railroading bernie s presidential run in 2016 in favor the eventual loser clinton all of this tension will culminate at the democratic convention in july where it is likely that there will be no clear majority winner going in which means a second vote may go to the convention floor which will likely trigger the dreaded super delegates the very same party apparatchiks and establishment loyalists who screwed sanders in 2016 and here they are again doing the exact same thing in 2020 this may result in the dnc offering up a nominee which did not earn a mandate during the primary process which is sure to ignite a bona fide civil war within the party underneath all this though is the fact that there s very little left on the left due to the fact that like britain s labour party under blair democrats have been pulled so far to the political right thanks to arch neoliberalists bill clinton and barack obama from a policy point of view centrist democrats are almost indistinguishable from mainline republicans no wonder more voters are feeling uninspired this in fighting and apathy may result in lower voter turnouts for democrats as they face having their own mitt romney moment in 2020 politics is the new hollywood this concept was coined by sunday wire host patrick henningsen back in 2017 and continues to sums up the truly perilous trajectory of pop culture in the west of course donald trump a former reality tv star embodies the trend of politics is the new hollywood and really made this a reality by hogging the width and breadth of mass media coverage mostly by just tweeting this in turn requires the media to respond and react to his every move and machination no matter how frivolous or vapid it might be the attention he s getting is as much from his detractors as it is from his support base nonetheless this sort of obsessive attention is normally reserved for celebrities and royals other democrat politicians will also get this publicity bounce in 2020 in the ukraine new president volodymyr zelenski was a tv actor who played a regular guy who became president life imitates art no this is completely predictable as social media feeds are now dominated with a z list political celebrities and that s all we time poor folks really have time to follow closely these days sadly this means that there are simply no eye balls left to gawk at hollywood s glitterati because of social media s 24 7 political news cycle a listers can no longer compete for hearts and minds with round the clock characters trump bernie and creepy joe no one cares who tom cruise is dating or what beach kim kardashian is topless on anymore unless there s a political angle otherwise celebrities will continue to sink into the detritus of the collective pop consciousness so get used to it politics is the new hollywood in 2020 it s definitely a thing mass de platforming and censorship 2019 was a banner year for the nameless faceless silicon valley censorship committees a self appointed star chamber busy programming their algorithms to exclude any speech online which these corporations believe falls outside of their narrow acceptable band of public discourse all of this was initially launched in late 2016 under the guise of fighting fake news which then morphed into countering disinformation which now encompasses ever vague missions like countering russian influence and cleansing the virtual world of extremist content in reality all of this has been undertaken for partisan reasons silicon valley firms are overwhelmingly democrat and liberal in their political orientation this orgy of corporate censorship is also being underwritten by new government censorship directives led by the uk and eu all predicated on the excuse of fighting hate speech and guarding vulnerable and helpless users from disinformation not emanating from reputable and trusted sources namely mainstream media and government itself because why would they ever lie or spin anything right expect these kafkaesque cultural committees to step up their efforts in 2020 in the hopes that they can affect the outcome of the us presidential election somehow in favor of the democratic candidate but beyond this these same platforms have been aggressive erasing accounts and content which opposes war and the national security state despite repeated denials by executives their dark agenda is becoming more obvious by the day global uprisings on the rise 2019 saw a record number of simultaneous mass protests happening all over the globe and still going france s yellow vests aka gilet jaunes led the way followed by mass movements across south america middle east and asia all over the world crowds are forming in their millions with protesters occupying squares blocking highways and taking over parliament buildings while demanding an end to neoliberal austerity policies scarce jobs and spiraling inflation expect these uprisings to grow and multiply as people begin to challenge the 20th century orthodoxy of the hereditary oligarchy and us dollar led debt based financial market rigging this will pose serious challenges to us client states worldwide already struggling to hold together their economies and political mandates while over spending on us military products while the ranks of their poor and unemployed grow by the day ultimately what s at stake is any respect for government and authority it s that fundamental the vindication of julian assange more than any other story in 2019 the apprehension and unlawful incarceration of award winning journalist and wikileaks founder julian assange left a black mark on the supposed leaders of free world namely the united states and britain but 2020 will most certainly be the year when assange is vindicated at least in the court of public opinion in the waning months of 2019 the tide of public opinion continued to shift in julian s favor with each passing week more high profile individuals mainstream journalists and civil liberties advocates are coming out to defend assange and demand his release the only group which has been reticent to speak for him has been politicians with the exception of a few like hawaii congresswoman tulsi gabbard a 2020 democratic presidential hopeful but the real concern is whether he will survive the brutal treatment being dished out by the british state now in breach of its own laws and precedents all in order to hand over to what many agree is an authoritarian us government bent on revenge for the international embarrassment caused by wikileaks important exposures until then his life will continue to hang in the balance freeassange china dubbed axis of evil move over kim and putin there s a new boogeyman in the making the us is fast losing its ability to manufacture enemies and existential threats it needs to justify its now 1 trillion annual military budget but there s an answer to their problems china they are the new red menace and will gradually take the place of russia as the new geopolitical threat to the american dream more and more we see us media pundits waxing on about the evils of communist china and how the chinese are infiltrating the us higher education system and undermining our democracy the recent demonization of the chinese authorities in hong kong and the lionization of us backed violent street thugs being marketed by washington think tanks as peaceful democratic reformers should raise alarm bells to anyone concerned about an expansion of the new cold war into the pacific front the us would also like to disrupt china s planned economic revolution the belt road project and plan using the uyghur muslim ethnic minority issue as a human rights flash point and pretext for isolating china s internationally this latest phase of american fetish and chauvinism may last for years but economically speaking china still holds all the cards and the gold literally let s just hope this confrontation doesn t lead to a serious shooting war but it will certainly be used as fuel for the global arms race iraq is back just as the new year rang in trump got the bright idea to bomb an iraqi military base killing a number of iraqi people s mobilization unit pmu soldiers the same soldiers who had fought on the ground died and defeated isis in 2017 supposedly this us airstrike was in response to a rocket barrage the previous friday which killed a u s defense contractor in a military compound near kirkuk in northern iraq as usual before the us could investigate what actually happened it acted on highly likely intelligence most probably from israel which assured trump that iran did it so the us justified their attack by claiming the iraqi personnel killed were really iranian militia a false talking point which has become accepted as fact across the us political and media landscape in response pmu fighters and their supporters stormed the us embassy in baghdad located inside the infamous us controlled green zone a threat not faced by the us since they effectively took over the country in 2003 because of washington s insistence to frame every incident in the region as the work of the iranian regime it s clear drive to war is being spurred on by us allies israel and saudi arabia both of whom would view iran as an existential threat to their own regional political hegemony besides the main goal here is to keep iraq divided and fragmented so that it can never get back on its feet economically and politically and can never be close allies with its neighbors syria and iran for washington and tel aviv the road to tehran has always been through baghdad only it won t work for washington this time iraqis are quickly realizing that it is the us and not iran who has ruined their country with only generations of pain and suffering to look forward to unfortunately their country looks once again to become the pitch for another ugly geopolitical grudge match between the west and iran liberation of idlib and reclamation in syria after nine long years and many hundreds of thousands dead and millions of refugees and internally displaced persons the syrian war appears to be heading for a final climax in 2020 the last remaining western and gulf backed terrorist stronghold is syria s northern province of idlib late 2019 saw the syrian army make great strides with their russian allies retaking key town and districts from western and turkish backed al qaeda militants as well as in fighting between terrorist factions all of this means we will likely see the end of al qaeda s de facto second islamic state in idlib and with that the death of the west s popular myth the democratic revolution which never was in syria when this happens all eyes will then shift over the northern east section of the country where the us is illegally occupying syria s oil fields and smuggling the oil out of the country to fund its clandestine operations right before the new year syrian army officers were seen on video confronting us soldiers at a desert crossing telling them you are occupiers and you will leave our country harbinger of things to come libya s protracted civil war libya is back in the center stage geopolitically as multiple world powers throw their hat into the ring to try to gain control of the failed state created by nato s errand operation in 2011 to depose then president gaddafi before the new year turkey s president erdogan began ferrying jihadi free syrian army brigades across the mediterranean to help the un backed government of accord in tripoli in the country s new civil war on the other side are the us saudi arabia the uae egypt and even russia all backing long time us asset khalifa haftar whose fighters are trying to capture libya s capital city of tripoli a real mess in the making if syria is anything to go by the presence of so many foreign stakeholders along with jihadi fighters being shipped in as cannon fodder means there s a high likelihood that the instability the country is now facing will drag on for many years to come this round is only beginning which means lots of foreign press junkets for war friendly media outlets like cnn but bad news for the people of libya global arms race with the us opting out of the inf treaty with russia while still hyping the phantom russian threat in order to advance nato further eastward and with us threatening china in every possible way while actively egging on saudi arabia to keep the defense contractor cash cow going in yemen the scene is set for a fresh bounce in the global arms race led by the us and with russia and china trailing behind in terms of spending maybe but not necessarily in terms of quality and effectiveness add this to trump s recent announcement in 2019 of his new space force and you have all the ingredients for record level blank cheque spending on weapons and war tech it s the 1980 s on steroids advances in artificial intelligence will also add to this price tag as the west begins future proofing all of its main product lines in defense and global surveillance if it sounds scary it s because it is brexit without the exit uk is scheduled to leave the eu on january 31 202o there are still some potential hurdles in the way however the first of which is brussels will the eu allow britain to exit belgian mep guy verhofstadt has claimed that britain still needs consent from the eu in order to complete the final stage of brexit however many brexit critics believe that even if the uk leaves it will still be opting into most of the eu conventions and regulations and even the new eu army aka eu defense union so will it be a hard brexit aka a no deal brexit as nigel farage and others have been advocating for or will it simply be brino brexit without the exit with boris johnson s increasingly shaky trade deal with the eu still experiencing problems it looks very much like the latter this means that what britain will actually get in the end will be exactly what former pm david cameron proposed in his white paper entitled the best of both worlds released on the very same day the brexit referendum was announced in february of 2016 after nearly four years and practically a civil war britain ends up back at square one in effect rule britannia boris and the economy plummet after boris johnson and the tories recover from the hangover of their historic landslide elections win reality will hit them soon enough now that the brexit distraction is all but wrapped up conservatives will have to confront the reality of tens of millions of uk citizens who are still struggling to make ends meet and who have little hope for a prosperous future seeing that the tories are still as committed an ever to their unpopular austerity policies add to this the fact that there s been little to no growth in business investment in the uk the economy risks dipping back into recession amid the post brexit financial uncertainties to come that penny is now dropping and uk plebs will not accept the old brexit punch n judy show for much longer at that point public approval for boris and the tories will hit record lows and with the tories responding to any public dissent or manifestations with an ever heavy hand of the authoritarian state a recipe for discontent eu economic crisis one thing many experts can agree on is that brussels has been running an economic ponzi scheme for years now ten years after the 2008 global financial meltdown it seems that the bankers are still up to their old tricks increasing the odds that the next black swan economic crisis event will happen in the euro zone as politico remarked the price to pay for those bailouts reform packages rescue funds and european central bank bond buying schemes has been political fragmentation at first but by now this is morphing into outright polarization and this is happening in both core and periphery countries as we saw in elections in france germany austria and italy political fragmentation will not help economic disparity between the rich north and poor south of europe add to this the reality of brexit and the eu losing a significant chuck of its gdp from the uk and you have a trend line forming which only needs a trigger to set off a financial inferno of course if the eu economy does hit the wall then it might give boris johnson and the tories a slight reprieve making them look like genius savants as they take advantage of cheap wares on the continent and sell to america via a new trump trade deal the trigger could be italy or it could be reckless ecb bond purchasing schemes designed to hide the systemic damage caused by 10 years of steady quantitative easing which has left european personal savings next to nil if the global economy is going to scream again it s going to start in europe in 2020 antisemitism hysteria backlash one of the unfortunate aspects of the uk s 2019 general election was the coordinated political assassination of labour party leader jeremy corbyn falsely accusing him of being an antisemite and his party of being antisemitic meaning racist against jewish people with an attack coalition comprised of the mainstream press the tony blair wing of the labour party the tory party and of course the international israeli lobby now that the uk election is over the british left and labour voters will be looking for someone to blame and will rightly revisit the question of why there was such a coordinated national campaign of lies waged against their party leader through this defamation campaign the establishment was able to force labour to redefine the term antisemitism to encompass any normal criticism of the policies of the state of israel and its horrific treatment of the native arab palestinian population in the middle east the smear campaign worked and helped labour lose the election by killing the career of a life long anti racist campaigner like corbyn falsely accusing him of being a racist it showed that anything is possible in political warfare this political take down was later used against bernie sanders in the us although with less success because bernie himself is jewish but that still has not deterred the attacks from the right the main goal is to try and delegitimize both corbyn and sanders by making them unelectable due to their support for palestinian human rights and bds boycott divestment and sanctions against israel by doing this it also means their progressive policies and re nationalising public transport utilities securing free public healthcare and providing debt forgiveness will never see the light of day us academic norman finkelstein himself jewish believes that the fake antisemitism campaign could eventually result in a very real antisemitic backlash against the jewish lobby for their role in destroying the electoral chances of jeremy corbyn if that happens then things will get very uncomfortable indeed israel s fall from grace the sinking reputation of extremist zionist leader benjamin netanyahu along with the popularity of bds and the aforementioned backlash against the contrived antisemitism smear campaign waged against corbyn and sanders will only fuel support from the internationalist left wing who oppose an israeli apartheid regime actively engaged in an ethnic cleansing campaign to drive arabs out of arab lands another problem for the current regime in tel aviv is that if the nine year long syrian war comes to a close then the global community will once again focus on israel s crimes against humanity in gaza and the west bank and its acts of military aggression against neighbors syria lebanon and iraq add to this netanyahu s upcoming corruption trial and the international criminal court s new investigation into israeli war crimes and crimes against humanity and things are not looking good for this embattled 75 year old micro colonial settler state creation of the britain and the us 2020 will be the year that the hasbara propaganda machine which has been propping up israel s international reputation to just above tolerable will begin to collapse and again especially as the syrian conflict begins to resolve itself and the world s media lens naturally turns back in the direction of the world s largest open prison gaza and israel s own institutionally racist and violent apartheid state being used to oppress the native palestinians most sensible people will agree that a sincere solution to this issue is long overdue nationalism vs the global citizen undoubtedly 2018 and 2019 saw the strong re emergence of nationalism in parts of the world nationalism being the geopolitical and ideological antithesis of globalism and multilateralism which has dominated the latter part of the post wwii us led liberal world order certainly brexit featured heavily in this trend so despite the promises of globalism and projects like the european union the elemental pull of the post westphalian nation state appears to have survived still in tact however this comes at a time when tens of millions of millennials and genx and genz neophytes are feeling ever more connected due to social media real time translation apps and shared digital cultural experiences mostly dominated by anglo american content through platforms like netflix whereby many young people consider themselves and identify as global citizens first and by their nationality second along with their global citizenry also comes advocacy for no borders and deference to global government concepts while this view may be driven by a new idealism which may be naive and leaning heavily on utopian visions it is nonetheless very real in the minds of those who identify as global citizens this demographic is increasingly influential and will be one of the key economic forces in the new digitally driven fourth industrial revolution ultimately this clashes with the rise of nationalism itself a result of globalist policies of the last half century in 2020 will these two world views begin to collide with ever more veracity creating a new political schism expect increased polarization along this new 21st century sectarian divide the new occupy movement it s been nine years since the occupy movement swept across north america and europe we are starting to hear rumblings that it may be returning with a vengeance one of the catalysts for this renewed push into public spaces has been the 2019 climate strike youth movement led by greta the mercurial swede but this might only be a celebrity driven cause de celebre held together by middle class students residing in north america and western europe meanwhile the adult s climate camp is now being driven by the ever more radical extinction rebellion xr a global environmental movement with a stated aim of using nonviolent civil disobedience to compel governments to de carbonize their economies in order to save humanity from certain extinction a radical idea underpinned by man made global warming theory this eco axis will no doubt form the vanguard of any occupy 2 0 moreover the reaction to brexit and the tory s landslide victory in december s uk general election will have caused many on the political left to feel as if they have no say in the current democracy set up in the west this similar effect happened after the 2016 us election where millennials could not simply accept that their party or candidate lost and prepare for the next election but rather demand our voices be heard now rather than in four or five years time this party is a result of the instant gratification culture we ve seen rising in the west as well a hangover from the obama hope and change political ecstasy trip either way it s clear that millennials and genxers now require some sort of immediate feedback mechanism which delivers them real time results because for them representative democracy is no longer adequate to fulfill their needs and desires as social stakeholders one solution being promoted is the idea of people s assemblies and the direct democracy method of sortition but like all political enterprises this too risks being co opted gamed and taken over by big money interests most likely from wall street funded and billionaire run foundations and third sector ngos in the end these movements end up becoming pressure release valves for the establishment and have very limited scope for affecting the change which activists so desperately wanted in the first place eco terrorism as the narrative surrounding climate change becomes even more radicalized and activists adopt the theory that humanity is somehow in the process of a sixth mass extinction all because of man made carbon emissions it stands to reason that faithful adherents of this end times narrative not unlike the end times eschatological narratives of the major religions will adopt more radical methods to pressure the halls of power and force political concessions to save the climate as with animal rights extremism methods eco terrorism has historical form and with more radical narratives like those promoted by organizations like extinction rebellion this has led many of its young followers to believe we have no future what would previously be regarded as acts of civil disobedience may no longer suffice in the current nihilistic atmosphere if there was ever a ripe moment for the specter of eco terrorism to rear its ugly head then it may be in 2020 the fall of climatism as the narratives become more militant and the hype surrounding swedish teenager and climate strike leader greta thunberg loses steam a growing global community of climate skeptics will likely receive more airtime many more beginning to question the perceived certainly of man made global warming theory aka climate change in recent years many climate demonstrations have taken on an increasingly weird cult like atmosphere image left which may resonate with some urbanistas and hipsters but could also be damaging its broad based appeal the reality is no matter how extreme the predictions of doom or the excoriations by greta the global economy will never de carbonize by 2025 or 2030 or even 2050 for the simple reasons that renewables can never provide the base load required to power the world s growing cities and overall energy needs the math just doesn t add up there is also a significant backlash now to the proposed green new deal which will require trillions in taxpayer funds and money robbed from pension funds in order to finance as yet undiscovered green tech solutions which many believe is really just a new green dotcom bubble combine this with indications that the earth is now heading into a solar minimum phase which will see more record cold weather across the northern hemisphere and you have all the ingredients for serious challenges to climatism as the dominant eco ideology of this epoch this transition will not happen over night but it s inevitable as the backlash against a strictly imposed environment narrative where dissent or questions are strictly forbidden is simply unsustainable politically and as some experts now believe it is also fundamentally undemocratic this will no doubt be the source of more heated battles no pun intended across society in 2020 5g implementation begins interestingly none of the xr and eco activists appear to care about the impending 5g roll out this completely untested and unregulated cellular technology is being aggressively pushed now by governments and corporations in the west despite legitimate concerns for public health as well as environment and ecological concerns too clearly 5g is seen as the gateway to realizing the technocrats dream of the internet of things and also a total end to end mass surveillance state it s already known that china s new police state is using 5g as its digital backbone despite all of this the media blackout on this issue remains and so it is likely that the process of full implementation will begin in 2020 what could possibly go wrong there it is 2020 out of the frying pan but will it be into the fire how accurate were we take a look back at previous

predicting that 168 million people a record will need humanitarian assistance in 2020 because of extreme weather large infectious disease outbreaks and intensifying protracted conflicts across more than 50 countries that s around a million more people than were in need of assistance in 2019 and the number is expected to continue to rise up to 200 million people by 2022 the u n expects that providing this assistance in 2020 could cost up to 29 billion hot spots include burkina faso where a surge in violence by religious extremists has displaced more than half a million people the philippines where a christmas eve typhoon killed more than two dozen and venezuela where an economic collapse has resulted in the exodus of nearly 5 million people in the last five years shannon scribner associate director for humanitarian policy and programs at oxfam america says that funding to respond to these crises is not keeping pace with the need and that will continue to be a challenge scribner says another concern is an increasing number of restrictions on international ngos that make it harder to enter and operate in conflict affected areas such as syria and yemen humanitarian law isn t being upheld in some of the countries where we re working says scribner and we don t see world leaders talking about human rights the way they once did one key solution she says channel more funding to small local groups that know the terrain intimately rather than big international ngos tim mcdonnell second tier diseases will go gangbusters over the last 12 months the world made steady progress against the big infectious killers hiv malaria and tuberculosis but other illnesses some of them easily preventable stole the limelight those second tier diseases include measles and dengue which did gangbusters in the tropics cholera raged inyemen polio clawed its way back from the brink of defeat in pakistan polio cases were up more than tenfold from a low of just nine in 2018 in a cruel unintended consequence of the polio eradication effort a dozen countries that had been polio free including china angola and the philippines reported cases of vaccine derived polio in 2019 venezuela reported itsfirst yellow fever case in more than a decade as that country s health care system continues its downward spiral despite efforts to rein it in a few cases of middle east respiratory syndrome are reported each month in the middle east and that will probably continue in the coming year recent high profile measles outbreaks in the u s europe the philippines and samoa should push health officials to make sure more kids are immunized this year to prevent outbreaks the world health organization says that roughly 95 of a community needs to be vaccinated against measles more thanhalf the countries in the world including the u s at 94 haven t reached that threshold according to unicef where might there be a measles outbreak in 2020 afghanistan angola bolivia and haiti all have dismally low immunization rates below 40 but there are some signs of progress this year a newdengue vaccine might finally make a dent in the roughly 100 million cases of the disease that occur most years and the world is more prepared to deal with ebola than at any time in history two vaccines and several experimental treatments are in use all developed after the 2014 west africa outbreak the current ebola outbreak in eastern democratic republic of congo appears to say more about the dismal social conditions there than about the world s ability to battle this virus if there s an ebola outbreak outside a conflict zone in 2020 it would likely be contained and crushed quickly jason beaubien aid will become even more political it seems we re returning to the bad old days of the cold war when we used aid as a glorified payoff for friends and allies says jeremy konyndyk a senior fellow at the center for global development and former u s foreign disaster assistance chief under the obama administration instead of providing aid to improve health and foster economic development konyndyk says there s a growing mentality in the u s that aid can be used as a goody bag to incentivize foreign leaders to fall in line examples include trump s freezing andreinstatement of aid to el salvador guatemala and honduras in 2019 based on their immigration policies his threats tocut off countries that don t vote with the u s at the united nations and hiswithdrawal of aid to palestinians to pressure them to reconsider his peace plan the u k has also announced plans to merge its department for international development into its foreign office a move thatmore than 100 charities say risks politicizing u k aid these shifts by the u s and u k two of the world s largest aid donors could set the tone for a lot of aid policy around the world says konyndyk joanne lu unrest over inequality will grow 2019 was marked by angry protests over inequality around the world and according to some experts the demonstrations will grow more violent in 2020 since the 1980s income inequality has been on the rise says lucas chancel co director of the world inequality lab at the paris school of economics in the u s for example chancel says the richest 1 owned about 40 of the nation s wealth in 2016 up from 20 in the 1980s and trump s 2017 tax policies have only turbocharged inequality with the richest 400 families paying a lower average tax rate in 2018 than the poorest half of american households it is unlikely that 2020 brings anything different he says meaning inequality will deepen despite the efforts of angry protesters to stop it part of the problem is that inequality has a new face according to a new report by theunited nations development programme people are no longer just angry about income they re concerned about inequalities in political representation and power higher education access to technology and the resources to survive climate change chancel says the protests in chile france lebanon hong kong and other countries demonstrate that governments still do not seem to have grasped the reality of the situation and have yet to provide adequate solutions until they do the undp report warns the social unrest will likely continue joanne lu water taps continue to run dry in june 2019 chennai india reached day zero the day on which the city s reservoirs ran almost completely out of water by the fall seasonal rains had resupplied the city at least temporarily but the looming specter of water scarcity is certain to continue in cities around the world in 2020 in india alone 21 cities are at risk of running dry in 2020 according to a government report and an august report from the world resources institute found that a group of 17 countries that together are home to one quarter of the global population including botswana india iran and mexico are using as much or more water than they can replace upmanu lall director of the columbia water center says that while droughts linked to climate change can create water scarcity in many cases day zero events are caused more by government mismanagement of water resources i haven t seen any reasonable improvement he says so i think there will continue to be places that are stressed and at least one will pop up as a day zero this year the indian subcontinent is a prime candidate he says but on the plus side climate scientists expect 2020 to be an off year for el niño and la niña the weather patterns that occur every few years and can cause flooding in some areas and droughts in others the absence of those extremes might help stave off some instances of water scarcity either way victoria beard an urban planning professor at cornell university and world resources institute fellow says water scarcity will continue to be a problem especially in cities until governments of high risk localities pay to massively overhaul their water systems people are demanding of their leaders to see investments in basic services she says there s no self provision that s going to solve this problem in the long term there are no examples where it s a free for all and it works out well you need coordinated massive public investment tim mcdonnell gender equality is not on the horizon the u n calls gender equality a necessary foundation for a peaceful and prosperous world yet no country in the world is on track to achieve gender equality as defined by the u n s sustainable development goals by 2030 2020 will mark an important milestone in the long road to gender equality it s the 25th anniversary of the beijing declaration and platform for action which is considered a landmark progressive blueprint for advancing women s rights the global community will be taking stock of progress and lack thereof at gatherings such as that of the u n commission on the status of women in march worldwide women continue to face disproportionate rates of discrimination and violence less access to economic and educational opportunities and exclusion from decision making roles at the community and governmental levels by one measure the world will not achieve gender equality for nearly a century the most current estimate by the world economic forum which publishes an annual report to track country by country progress across economic educational health and political dimensions is that achieving parity across all four dimensions will take an average of 99 5 years at the current rate while the wef report found that achieving parity is relatively close at hand for educational attainment which could be possible in as soon as 12 years progress toward closing the economic opportunities gap is actually backsliding by that metric parity is a lowly 57 8 and will take 257 years to overcome emily vaughn hopeful trends global health will get woke this year expect more people in the global health and development community to address the injustices and inequities that can be traced to the era when western countries colonized poor countries stripping them of resources and autonomy people who work in the field know that much of the money influence and decision making about how to help low income countries still comes from wealthy countries with little input from the people who receive the assistance one reason for this mindset says renzo guinto a filipino physician and a member of the lancet planetary health s editorial board is the colonial roots of tropical medicine in the colonial era european researchers studied diseases in the colonies to protect the colonizers not the people living in those places from getting sick over the past couple of years he and a growing number of global health staffers have been working to make a change they aim to give medical professionals in low income countries real leadership roles at the university level students are calling on faculty to acknowledge the field s colonial history in global health curriculum and

social media with the hashtags shiftthepower and decolonizeglobalhealth jennifer lentfer a communications strategist who has worked in the field for two decades says she has never seen so much excitement around decolonizing global development there are already events scheduled in 2020 to tackle the subject in the coming weeks lentfer is hosting a couple of online workshops on topics that question western motives to make a difference and help because it is our moral imperative and in january graduate students at duke university are organizing a conference called decolonizing global

more research on global health and development from a sky high point of view imagery produced by satellites is becoming more ubiquitous and inexpensive and an increasingly vital source of data on poverty disease and environmental challenges marshall burke deputy director of stanford university s center on food security and the environment is one of a growing number of researchers who are training artificial intelligence software to scan through millions of satellite images to look for clues about where these challenges exist and test solutions to them let s say you run a government agency in a low income country and want to identify the poorest 10 of villages or determine how many people live within easy reach of a medical facility or close to bodies of water that could be a source of mosquito borne diseases satellite imagery can help you answer those questions burke says in a way that s much less expensive and time consuming than traditional boots on the ground surveys cars large buildings and well tended farms can all be indications of income and population density and are easily spotted from space satellite imagery is already helping cattle herders in the sahel look for water and assisting regulators in west africa in cracking down on illegal gold mining it can help humanitarian agencies navigate in the aftermath of natural disasters in some cases it might help us peer into the future in december the world resources institute unveiled an online tool that uses satellite imagery in conjunction with other data to predict water shortages and conflicts in 2020 burke says expect to see more satellite based software tools move out of research labs and into the hands of aid agencies and policymakers and although today most of the images come from satellites owned by the u s and the european union more may soon come from satellites operated by developing countries including ethiopia s first observatory satellite launched in late december tim

marching against corruption repression and inequality and for human rights and human dignity in 2020 youth activists will continue to speak up for the world they want to see says jessica taft a youth movement researcher and professor of latin american studies at the university of california santa cruz that kind of involvement by young people isn t new taft says but what has changed she says is that today s social media platforms make their contributions more visible to the world and to each other with their phones set to retweet they can instantly amplify movements that are half a world away a common refrain from young activists is that the failures of previous generations have left them stuck in a flawed version of the world that an older generation helped make many of the issues that they re focusing on right now are ones that they re able to claim moral authority around as young people says taft that includes topics such as climate change and gun violence which young people can address from personal experience like the students at stoneman douglas high school in parkland fla who captured the world s attention after the shooting at their school matt deitsch a graduate of

why not just give them money and let them decide how best to spend it interest in cash transfers as this form of aid is often referred to is likely to get even bigger over the coming decade says david evans a senior fellow at the washington d c think tank center for global development one reason is that researchers will increasingly be able to study the long term effects of some of the earliest large scale cash transfer programs a series of government assistance schemes that began in latin america in the late 1990s already we re starting to see the first wave of long term evaluations says evans who is on leave as a lead economist at the world bank so far the evidence suggests that poor people who received this cash aid mainly used it to meet short term needs like giving their families enough food each day rather than finding ways to lift themselves out of poverty in a permanent way but these families were also able to give their children more schooling and now that the kids are aging into the workforce it will become clear whether the extra education translates into enough additional income to vault this next generation out of poverty if so says evans that will be an

that occur most years and the world is more prepared to deal with ebola than at any time in history two vaccines and several experimental treatments are in use all developed after the 2014 west africa outbreak the current ebola outbreak in eastern democratic republic of congo appears to say more about the dismal social conditions there than about the world s ability to battle this virus if there s an ebola outbreak outside a conflict zone in 2020 it would likely be contained and crushed quickly jason beaubien aid will become even more political it seems we re returning to the bad old days of the cold war when we used aid as a glorified payoff for friends and allies says jeremy konyndyk a senior fellow at the center for global development and former u s foreign disaster assistance chief under the obama administration instead of providing aid to improve health and foster economic development konyndyk says there s a growing mentality in the u s that aid can be used as a goody bag to incentivize foreign leaders to fall in line examples include trump s freezing andreinstatement of aid to el salvador guatemala and honduras in 2019 based on their immigration policies his threats tocut off countries that don t vote with the u s at the united nations and hiswithdrawal of aid to palestinians to pressure them to reconsider his peace plan the u k has also announced plans to merge its department for international development into its foreign office a move thatmore than 100 charities say risks politicizing u k aid these shifts by the u s and u k two of the world s largest aid donors could set the tone for a lot of aid policy around the world says konyndyk joanne lu unrest over inequality will grow 2019 was marked by angry protests over inequality around the world and according to some experts the demonstrations will grow more violent in 2020 since the 1980s income inequality has been on the rise says lucas chancel co director of the world inequality lab at the paris school of economics in the u s for example chancel says the richest 1 owned about 40 of the nation s wealth in 2016 up from 20 in the 1980s and trump s 2017 tax policies have only turbocharged inequality with the richest 400 families paying a lower average tax rate in 2018 than the poorest half of american households it is unlikely that 2020 brings anything different he says meaning inequality will deepen despite the efforts of angry protesters to stop it part of the problem is that inequality has a new face according to a new report by theunited nations development programme people are no longer just angry about income they re concerned about inequalities in political representation and power higher education access to technology and the resources to survive climate change chancel says the protests in chile france lebanon hong kong and other countries demonstrate that governments still do not seem to have grasped the reality of the situation and have yet to provide adequate solutions until they do the undp report warns the social unrest will likely continue joanne lu water taps continue to run dry in june 2019 chennai india reached day zero the day on which the city s reservoirs ran almost completely out of water by the fall seasonal rains had resupplied the city at least temporarily but the looming specter of water scarcity is certain to continue in cities around the world in 2020 in india alone 21 cities are at risk of running dry in 2020 according to a government report and an august report from the world resources institute found that a group of 17 countries that together are home to one quarter of the global population including botswana india iran and mexico are using as much or more water than they can replace upmanu lall director of the columbia water center says that while droughts linked to climate change can create water scarcity in many cases day zero events are caused more by government mismanagement of water resources i haven t seen any reasonable improvement he says so i think there will continue to be places that are stressed and at least one will pop up as a day zero this year the indian subcontinent is a prime candidate he says but on the plus side climate scientists expect 2020 to be an off year for el niño and la niña the weather patterns that occur every few years and can cause flooding in some areas and droughts in others the absence of those extremes might help stave off some instances of water scarcity either way victoria beard an urban planning professor at cornell university and world resources institute fellow says water scarcity will continue to be a problem especially in cities until governments of high risk localities pay to massively overhaul their water systems people are demanding of their leaders to see investments in basic services she says there s no self provision that s going to solve this problem in the long term there are no examples where it s a free for all and it works out well you need coordinated massive public investment tim mcdonnell gender equality is not on the horizon the u n calls gender equality a necessary foundation for a peaceful and prosperous world yet no country in the world is on track to achieve gender equality as defined by the u n s sustainable development goals by 2030 2020 will mark an important milestone in the long road to gender equality it s the 25th anniversary of the beijing declaration and platform for action which is considered a landmark progressive blueprint for advancing women s rights the global community will be taking stock of progress and lack thereof at gatherings such as that of the u n commission on the status of women in march worldwide women continue to face disproportionate rates of discrimination and violence less access to economic and educational opportunities and exclusion from decision making roles at the community and governmental levels by one measure the world will not achieve gender equality for nearly a century the most current estimate by the world economic forum which publishes an annual report to track country by country progress across economic educational health and political dimensions is that achieving parity across all four dimensions will take an average of 99 5 years at the current rate while the wef report found that achieving parity is relatively close at hand for educational attainment which could be possible in as soon as 12 years progress toward closing the economic opportunities gap is actually backsliding by that metric parity is a lowly 57 8 and will take 257 years to overcome emily vaughn hopeful trends global health will get woke this year expect more people in the global health and development community to address the injustices and inequities that can be traced to the era when western countries colonized poor countries stripping them of resources and autonomy people who work in the field know that much of the money influence and decision making about how to help low income countries still comes from wealthy countries with little input from the people who receive the assistance one reason for this mindset says renzo guinto a filipino physician and a member of the lancet planetary health s editorial board is the colonial roots of tropical medicine in the colonial era european researchers studied diseases in the colonies to protect the colonizers not the people living in those places from getting sick over the past couple of years he and a growing number of global health staffers have been working to make a change they aim to give medical professionals in low income countries real leadership roles at the university level students are calling on faculty to acknowledge the field s colonial history in global health curriculum and

social media with the hashtags shiftthepower and decolonizeglobalhealth jennifer lentfer a communications strategist who has worked in the field for two decades says she has never seen so much excitement around decolonizing global development there are already events scheduled in 2020 to tackle the subject in the coming weeks lentfer is hosting a couple of online workshops on topics that question western motives to make a difference and help because it is our moral imperative and in january graduate students at duke university are organizing a conference called decolonizing global

more research on global health and development from a sky high point of view imagery produced by satellites is becoming more ubiquitous and inexpensive and an increasingly vital source of data on poverty disease and environmental challenges marshall burke deputy director of stanford university s center on food security and the environment is one of a growing number of researchers who are training artificial intelligence software to scan through millions of satellite images to look for clues about where these challenges exist and test solutions to them let s say you run a government agency in a low income country and want to identify the poorest 10 of villages or determine how many people live within easy reach of a medical facility or close to bodies of water that could be a source of mosquito borne diseases satellite imagery can help you answer those questions burke says in a way that s much less expensive and time consuming than traditional boots on the ground surveys cars large buildings and well tended farms can all be indications of income and population density and are easily spotted from space satellite imagery is already helping cattle herders in the sahel look for water and assisting regulators in west africa in cracking down on illegal gold mining it can help humanitarian agencies navigate in the aftermath of natural disasters in some cases it might help us peer into the future in december the world resources institute unveiled an online tool that uses satellite imagery in conjunction with other data to predict water shortages and conflicts in 2020 burke says expect to see more satellite based software tools move out of research labs and into the hands of aid agencies and policymakers and although today most of the images come from satellites owned by the u s and the european union more may soon come from satellites operated by developing countries including ethiopia s first observatory satellite launched in late december tim

marching against corruption repression and inequality and for human rights and human dignity in 2020 youth activists will continue to speak up for the world they want to see says jessica taft a youth movement researcher and professor of latin american studies at the university of california santa cruz that kind of involvement by young people isn t new taft says but what has changed she says is that today s social media platforms make their contributions more visible to the world and to each other with their phones set to retweet they can instantly amplify movements that are half a world away a common refrain from young activists is that the failures of previous generations have left them stuck in a flawed version of the world that an older generation helped make many of the issues that they re focusing on right now are ones that they re able to claim moral authority around as young people says taft that includes topics such as climate change and gun violence which young people can address from personal experience like the students at stoneman douglas high school in parkland fla who captured the world s attention after the shooting at their school matt deitsch a graduate of

why not just give them money and let them decide how best to spend it interest in cash transfers as this form of aid is often referred to is likely to get even bigger over the coming decade says david evans a senior fellow at the washington d c think tank center for global development one reason is that researchers will increasingly be able to study the long term effects of some of the earliest large scale cash transfer programs a series of government assistance schemes that began in latin america in the late 1990s already we re starting to see the first wave of long term evaluations says evans who is on leave as a lead economist at the world bank so far the evidence suggests that poor people who received this cash aid mainly used it to meet short term needs like giving their families enough food each day rather than finding ways to lift themselves out of poverty in a permanent way but these families were also able to give their children more schooling and now that the kids are aging into the workforce it will become clear whether the extra education translates into enough additional income to vault this next generation out of poverty if so says evans that will be an

that occur most years and the world is more prepared to deal with ebola than at any time in history two vaccines and several experimental treatments are in use all developed after the 2014 west africa outbreak the current ebola outbreak in eastern democratic republic of congo appears to say more about the dismal social conditions there than about the world s ability to battle this virus if there s an ebola outbreak outside a conflict zone in 2020 it would likely be contained and crushed quickly jason beaubien aid will become even more political it seems we re returning to the bad old days of the cold war when we used aid as a glorified payoff for friends and allies says jeremy konyndyk a senior fellow at the center for global development and former u s foreign disaster assistance chief under the obama administration instead of providing aid to improve health and foster economic development konyndyk says there s a growing mentality in the u s that aid can be used as a goody bag to incentivize foreign leaders to fall in line examples include trump s freezing andreinstatement of aid to el salvador guatemala and honduras in 2019 based on their immigration policies his threats tocut off countries that don t vote with the u s at the united nations and hiswithdrawal of aid to palestinians to pressure them to reconsider his peace plan the u k has also announced plans to merge its department for international development into its foreign office a move thatmore than 100 charities say risks politicizing u k aid these shifts by the u s and u k two of the world s largest aid donors could set the tone for a lot of aid policy around the world says konyndyk joanne lu unrest over inequality will grow 2019 was marked by angry protests over inequality around the world and according to some experts the demonstrations will grow more violent in 2020 since the 1980s income inequality has been on the rise says lucas chancel co director of the world inequality lab at the paris school of economics in the u s for example chancel says the richest 1 owned about 40 of the nation s wealth in 2016 up from 20 in the 1980s and trump s 2017 tax policies have only turbocharged inequality with the richest 400 families paying a lower average tax rate in 2018 than the poorest half of american households it is unlikely that 2020 brings anything different he says meaning inequality will deepen despite the efforts of angry protesters to stop it part of the problem is that inequality has a new face according to a new report by theunited nations development programme people are no longer just angry about income they re concerned about inequalities in political representation and power higher education access to technology and the resources to survive climate change chancel says the protests in chile france lebanon hong kong and other countries demonstrate that governments still do not seem to have grasped the reality of the situation and have yet to provide adequate solutions until they do the undp report warns the social unrest will likely continue joanne lu water taps continue to run dry in june 2019 chennai india reached day zero the day on which the city s reservoirs ran almost completely out of water by the fall seasonal rains had resupplied the city at least temporarily but the looming specter of water scarcity is certain to continue in cities around the world in 2020 in india alone 21 cities are at risk of running dry in 2020 according to a government report and an august report from the world resources institute found that a group of 17 countries that together are home to one quarter of the global population including botswana india iran and mexico are using as much or more water than they can replace upmanu lall director of the columbia water center says that while droughts linked to climate change can create water scarcity in many cases day zero events are caused more by government mismanagement of water resources i haven t seen any reasonable improvement he says so i think there will continue to be places that are stressed and at least one will pop up as a day zero this year the indian subcontinent is a prime candidate he says but on the plus side climate scientists expect 2020 to be an off year for el niño and la niña the weather patterns that occur every few years and can cause flooding in some areas and droughts in others the absence of those extremes might help stave off some instances of water scarcity either way victoria beard an urban planning professor at cornell university and world resources institute fellow says water scarcity will continue to be a problem especially in cities until governments of high risk localities pay to massively overhaul their water systems people are demanding of their leaders to see investments in basic services she says there s no self provision that s going to solve this problem in the long term there are no examples where it s a free for all and it works out well you need coordinated massive public investment tim mcdonnell gender equality is not on the horizon the u n calls gender equality a necessary foundation for a peaceful and prosperous world yet no country in the world is on track to achieve gender equality as defined by the u n s sustainable development goals by 2030 2020 will mark an important milestone in the long road to gender equality it s the 25th anniversary of the beijing declaration and platform for action which is considered a landmark progressive blueprint for advancing women s rights the global community will be taking stock of progress and lack thereof at gatherings such as that of the u n commission on the status of women in march worldwide women continue to face disproportionate rates of discrimination and violence less access to economic and educational opportunities and exclusion from decision making roles at the community and governmental levels by one measure the world will not achieve gender equality for nearly a century the most current estimate by the world economic forum which publishes an annual report to track country by country progress across economic educational health and political dimensions is that achieving parity across all four dimensions will take an average of 99 5 years at the current rate while the wef report found that achieving parity is relatively close at hand for educational attainment which could be possible in as soon as 12 years progress toward closing the economic opportunities gap is actually backsliding by that metric parity is a lowly 57 8 and will take 257 years to overcome emily vaughn hopeful trends global health will get woke this year expect more people in the global health and development community to address the injustices and inequities that can be traced to the era when western countries colonized poor countries stripping them of resources and autonomy people who work in the field know that much of the money influence and decision making about how to help low income countries still comes from wealthy countries with little input from the people who receive the assistance one reason for this mindset says renzo guinto a filipino physician and a member of the lancet planetary health s editorial board is the colonial roots of tropical medicine in the colonial era european researchers studied diseases in the colonies to protect the colonizers not the people living in those places from getting sick over the past couple of years he and a growing number of global health staffers have been working to make a change they aim to give medical professionals in low income countries real leadership roles at the university level students are calling on faculty to acknowledge the field s colonial history in global health curriculum and communications managers at charitable groups are trying to portray the recipients of aid with dignity and respect in messages sent to donors and the media many of these conversations can be found on social media with the hashtags shiftthepower and decolonizeglobalhealth jennifer lentfer a communications strategist who has worked in the field for two decades says she has never seen so much excitement around decolonizing global development there are already events scheduled in 2020 to tackle the subject in the coming weeks lentfer is hosting a couple of online workshops on topics that question western motives to make a difference and help because it is our moral imperative and in january graduate students at duke university are organizing a conference called decolonizing global health 2020 there s a real question as to how to flip the leadership says lentfer and that s coming to a big head malaka gharib satellite imagery could improve global health this year expect to see more research on global health and development from a sky high point of view imagery produced by satellites is becoming more ubiquitous and inexpensive and an increasingly vital source of data on poverty disease and environmental challenges marshall burke deputy director of stanford university s center on food security and the environment is one of a growing number of researchers who are training artificial intelligence software to scan through millions of satellite images to look for clues about where these challenges exist and test solutions to them let s say you run a government agency in a low income country and want to identify the poorest 10 of villages or determine how many people live within easy reach of a medical facility or close to bodies of water that could be a source of mosquito borne diseases satellite imagery can help you answer those questions burke says in a way that s much less expensive and time consuming than traditional boots on the ground surveys cars large buildings and well tended farms can all be indications of income and population density and are easily spotted from space satellite imagery is already helping cattle herders in the sahel look for water and assisting regulators in west africa in cracking down on illegal gold mining it can help humanitarian agencies navigate in the aftermath of natural disasters in some cases it might help us peer into the future in december the world resources institute unveiled an online tool that uses satellite imagery in conjunction with other data to predict water shortages and conflicts in 2020 burke says expect to see more satellite based software tools move out of research labs and into the hands of aid agencies and policymakers and although today most of the images come from satellites owned by the u s and the european union more may soon come from satellites operated by developing countries including ethiopia s first observatory satellite launched in late december tim mcdonnell youth activists will lead the fight for a better world it s not just greta thunberg the 16 year old swedish climate activist who seized time s person of the year cover for 2019 helena gualinga a teen indigenous activist from the ecuadorian amazon took world leaders to task at the cop 25 climate summit and accused oil companies of violating our human rights university students in india are protesting a new citizenship law that excludes muslim migrants young people are in the lead said u n secretary general antónio guterres in a statement on human rights day everywhere they are marching against corruption repression and inequality and for human rights and human dignity in 2020 youth activists will continue to speak up for the world they want to see says jessica taft a youth movement researcher and professor of latin american studies at the university of california santa cruz that kind of involvement by young people isn t new taft says but what has changed she says is that today s social media platforms make their contributions more visible to the world and to each other with their phones set to retweet they can instantly amplify movements that are half a world away a common refrain from young activists is that the failures of previous generations have left them stuck in a flawed version of the world that an older generation helped make many of the issues that they re focusing on right now are ones that they re able to claim moral authority around as young people says taft that includes topics such as climate change and gun violence which young people can address from personal experience like the students at stoneman douglas high school in parkland fla who captured the world s attention after the shooting at their school matt deitsch a graduate of the school and an organizer of the march for our lives rally in washington d c told npr in an interview in 2019 if we re not standing up and organizing ourselves then we re not doing enough to save lives in america pien huang cash will be king of aid it s an idea that has been gaining popularity for more than two decades instead of giving poor people goods and services say a cow or job training why not just give them money and let them decide how best to spend it interest in cash transfers as this form of aid is often referred to is likely to get even bigger over the coming decade says david evans a senior fellow at the washington d c think tank center for global development one reason is that researchers will increasingly be able to study the long term effects of some of the earliest large scale cash transfer programs a series of government assistance schemes that began in latin america in the late 1990s already we re starting to see the first wave of long term evaluations says evans who is on leave as a lead economist at the world bank so far the evidence suggests that poor people who received this cash aid mainly used it to meet short term needs like giving their families enough food each day rather than finding ways to lift themselves out of poverty in a permanent way but these families were also able to give their children more schooling and now that the kids are aging into the workforce it will become clear whether the extra education translates into enough additional income to vault this next generation out of poverty if so says evans that will be an exciting thing to find nurith aizenman access to college will boom more and more people are going to college access to higher education has expanded rapidly across the globe over the last five years says michael green ceo of social progress imperative and he expects it to continue in 2020 green and his organization through itssocial progress index have been tracking this every year since 2014 higher education has traditionally been concentrated in wealthy countries says green but many countries are making significant leaps both in terms of enrollment and quality and it s leading to a growing global middle class some of the biggest improvers according to their data include morocco slovakia and turkey our world in data an online publication based at oxford university also expects thenumber of people around the world with higher education degrees to increase as advanced skills become more important in both developing and developed economies the international institute for applied systems analysisprojects that this number will reach 1 billion by 2030 and 3 billion by 2100 compared with 725 million in 2015 although the improvement isn t in every country green says the

spread the love by tom konrad ph d cfa if it s tough to follow a winner 2020 is going to be an especially tough year for my ten clean energy stocks model portfolio i ve been publishing lists of ten clean energy stocks that i think will do well in the year to come since 2008 with a 46 percent total return the 2019 list has had its best year since 2009 when it managed a 57 percent return by catching the rebound off the 2008 crash this year s returns were also achieved in the context of full to over valuation of most of the clean energy income stocks i now specialize in going international with this as background my main goal with the 2020 list is to find stocks which will be resilient in the event of a us bear market early 2019 saw bear market fears surface when the us yield curve inverted only to fade again when the inversion vanished the yield curve has inverted before every recession over the last 50 years and there has only been one yield curve inversion which did not proceed a recession in that time will we get another recession in the two years following march 2019 it is clearly too early to say investor complacency is not a predictor of a recession but it is an ingredient of bull market peaks i am not at all complacent about the prospects of the us stock market european and emerging markets have not enjoyed the same bull run the us did in 2019 so they still have some relatively good values left if you do not have much experience in trading foreign stocks i ve published some thoughts here the short version is decide how much you want to pay for the stock and use a good til cancelled limit order the article also has some notes in what the multiple ticker symbols mean for the purposes of tracking performance i will be using the stock price in the company s home market translated into dollars at current exchange rates the list returning stocks from 2019 unsurprisingly the stocks i m keeping from last year s list are those that that have not seen the biggest run up covanta holding corp cva and valeo sa fr pa vleef vleey have both been making progress implementing their business plans but have not been fully rewarded by the market the way i would expect given the massive run up in other stocks the thesis for retaining green plains partners gpp remains the same as the one for including it last year the ethanol mlp enjoys revenue guarantees from its parent green plains inc gpre despite the continuing pain the ethanol market caused in large part by the trump administration s trade war and giveaways to friends in the petroleum refining industry these guarantees should allow gpp to maintain its healthy 1 90 annual dividend if trump loses in november i expect that the stock price to produce further gains as the market anticipates a return to business as usual and an end to the trump epa s give aways to refiners new stocks for 2020 nfi group inc nfi to nfyef formerly new flyer industries is a leading manufacturer of transit buses and motor coaches new flyer was a great 10 clean energy stocks success story it appeared on the 2012 list at 5 65 gaining 54 that year it returned in 2014 for a 22 total return and in 2015 with an 80 return i dropped it from the 2016 list because it was starting to look overvalued the stock did not peak until the start of 2018 but for the last two years it has since been struggling when the stock was last in the list it was simply the leading manufacturer of heavy duty transit buses in north america now it is a leading global manufacturer of both transit buses and motor coaches its current problems do not seem permanent in nature some arose from the recent acquisition of alexander dennis and a build up of work in progress as nfi experienced some hiccups internalizing much of its parts manufacturing despite many people s unpleasant experiences with diesel buses bus transit is an inherently clean and low emission form of transport because it is an effective way to take numerous cars off the road but buses are rapidly getting greener as they have some of the best economics for electrification electric transit bus manufacturers like proterra argue that an electric bus is best designed from the ground up as electric in order to take advantage of the flexible layout possibilities that electric propulsion enables in contrast nfi takes a propulsion agnostic approach and uses third party drivetrains including diesel hybrids natural gas battery electric and fuel cell electric to meet its customers needs i see value in both approaches i think many of the large transit agencies that are considering heavy duty electric transit buses from both proterra and nfi will find comfort in the new technology when it is backed by a large traditional supplier with a large parts and service arm that they have been dealing with for years while others will prefer a bus designed from the ground up to be electric from a competitive standpoint i expect both strategies to flourish at the expense of smaller competitors without the resources to deliver credible electrified and hybrid options proterra however is not a public company nfi is and it currently trades at an attractive price with a healthy dividend like new flyer mix telematics mixt is also a blast from the past the company provides vehicle management systems and telematics systems to fleet owners their systems improve safety reduce fuel use and theft and help with regulatory compliance the company s software as a service saas platform enables it to leverage its technology platform for relatively rapid growth and high margins mix is a global company based in south africa with operations on six continents this global presence gives it an edge over its competitors in serving large multinational clients especially in transportation and resource industries mix first entered the list in 2014 at 12 17 i was too optimistic about its valuation at the time and it was the biggest loser of the year falling 45 there were nothing wrong with the company s fundamentals however and i kept it in the list in 2015 when it fell another 32 in 2016 i doubled down and it gained 51 followed by a 110 gain in 2017 closing the year 12 76 plus a few dividends i dropped it from the list in 2018 because i felt the valuation was reasonable but not as attractive as many other opportunities that year i sold most of my holdings in the mid teens which i mentioned here as the stock rose further in 2018 mixt eventually made it as high as 20 before falling back to near where it was at the end of 2017 two years later overall that would not have been that great a run except that when stocks i like fall i tend to buy more today mixt stands near where it was in late 2019 with the difference being that it has been growing its subscriber base at a little more than ten percent annually subscription revenue has been growing even faster as mix adds more products and features to its offerings there is plenty of room for this growth to continue as well only 19 commercial vehicles have a telematics solution brazilian utility companhia energetica de minas gerais a k a cemig cig is a relatively conservative pick in a very volatile stock market it is the third largest electricity generation utility and has the largest transmission and distribution utility in brazil in terms of sustainability the company s generation assets are almost all hydroelectric with a few relatively new wind farms and one fossil plant it also has a gas distribution utility in its home province of minas gerais from the perspective of risk the biggest risk of investing in cemig is investing in brazil itself the current bolsonaro administration is business friendly cemig shares saw a sharp spike in late 2018 when the current president was elected bolsonaro is not environmentally friendly however and i generally avoid holding stocks which put my financial interests at odds with my ideals in this case i am hoping that bolsonaro loses the next election in 2022 so i would not plan to hold cemig more than a couple years red eléctrica corporación s a ree mc rdeif rdeiy is the electric transmission utility for spain it also owns some transmission assets in portugal and latin america as well as some telecom assets long distance transmission and the integration of electric grids over large areas is an essential part of all plans to transition to high percentages of renewable electricity red electrica sees sustainability and renewables integration as key parts of its mission and has been making large investments in interconnections with france and spain s outlying islands as a regulated utility the company is included in the portfolio as a relatively low risk pick that pays a healthy dividend veolia environnement s a vie pa veoef veoey is a france based global company operating in the water waste and energy management although i generally prefer to invest in more focused companies an investment in veolia gives access to a number of interesting clean energy technologies which are not available as pure plays one of the most interesting to me is the production of biogas and other useful products from sewage building energy management also has great potential to cost effectively reduce waste energy use and greenhouse gas emissions the problem is that most companies do not have the in house expertise to achieve its full potential veolia has the scale and expertise to solve this problem at practically any scale they can also bring their expertise to bear to reduce energy use by understanding and influencing the behavior of building occupants through communication and education hedging and pseudo cash in line with my goal of protecting the model portfolio against a possible market downturn i settled on using puts on spdr s p oil gas exploration production etf xop as a hedge in particular my model 20 000 portfolio will include one xop january 2022 20 put contract that put gives us the right to sell 100 shares of xop for 20 each at any time before january 21 2022 as of the close of trading on december 31st these puts were trading for 253 a single contract gives control of 2 000 worth of xop which should make this holding about as volatile as the other positions in the portfolio while i plan to use the january 2022 20 put for tracking purposes really any put with a strike price between 20 and 25 expiring in january of 2021 or 2022 will do the trick puts that have higher strike prices will cost more but have a higher chance of paying off which puts that expire in 2021 will cost less but not act as a hedge for as long shorting xop and selling xop calls are also valid hedging options but keep in mind that both these strategies can potentially produce unlimited losses far greater than the size of the initial investment i generally avoid these strategies for this reason but the losses can be manageable if the hedge is a very small portion of your portfolio i currently have sold naked calls on nextera energy partners nep as a hedge against my many large yieldco holdings i am currently losing money on this hedge because all yieldcos have been going up for the past few months but my gains on other yieldcos far outweigh the losses on nep calls because the hedge is tiny compared to the other yieldco holdings the oil and gas e p sector has had several bad years and i was a little hesitant to choose an effective short position in a sector which has had such a bad run however stocks in declining industries don t necessarily have a bottom a quick look at the long term chart for the vaneck vectors coal etf kol will show you that i would have considered kol for this hedge if not for the fact that kol only has options contracts going out 6 months and so using kol should have required options trading in the middle of the year the reasons i think xop might continue to go down are stranded asset risk political risk divestment risk legal liability from past deception about climate change stranded asset risk is the risk that past investments to develop fossil fuel reserves will never see a payoff the world simply cannot burn all the oil and gas that companies count among their proven reserves and avoid catastrophic global warming i m not confident that we will avoid that but i do know that the more fossil fuels we use the more catastrophic the outcome will be since climate change fueled natural disasters are becoming a commonplace occurrence i see governments and individuals around the world starting to take swifter action to deal with the problem this takes the form of political risk when governments decide to regulate emissions increase fuel economy standards regulate oil drilling and remove existing subsidies but it can also arise when individuals worried about climate change take steps like driving less by taking actions like combining trips using mass transit and walking and biking more and ridesharing as well as by shifting to electric vehicles divestment risk is simply the risk that as more individuals and institutions adopt policies of not investing in fossil fuel companies the stock prices will fall simply because of a lack of buyers as i wrote in september 2014 in divesting the last one out loses anyone who read that article back then could have sold xop for over 70 a share as opposed to 23 today but there are still more people who can sell legal liability arises from big oil companies long term deception about climate change right now there are a large number of state lawsuits alleging that big oil companies knew about the risks of climate change but deceived the public and investors about the risks none of these lawsuits has a giant chance of succeeding but it only takes one if a single such lawsuit succeeds it will open the floodgates to every state and municipality which has seen some negative effect of climate change to file additional lawsuits i don t know when or even if it will happen but big oil could be on the verge of its big tobacco moment the reason i chose to use puts is because shorting is always risky even with all the risks above there could still be a short term oil price spike in 2020 which sends all oil stocks gushing upward buy buying a single put we are limiting the risk to the option premium yieldco pattern energy group pegi is currently in the process of being bought out by the canada pension plan investment board for 26 75 per share the transaction is expected to close before june 30 2020 and the company will continue to pay its quarterly dividend of 0 422 per share until it closes i m including pattern in this list mainly because i think of it as a good place to park cash for 4 6 months as insurance against a market downturn compared to a bank cd there is a small risk that the transaction will not go through in which case the stock might fall 10 or so in the short term the upside is that readers who buy at or below the 26 75 will collect a 0 422 1 57 dividend for holding the stock for 4 6 months approximately double the return available from comparable cds there is further upside from the chance that the buyout is delayed until after june 30 and holders collect a second 0 422 dividend this is also unlikely but considerably more probable than the merger falling through i suggest readers who do not still own pattern from 2019 and previous years buy pegi using limit orders at the buyout price 26 75 or better if the price rises and your trade does not execute just keep the money in cash i will have a new stock pick to replace pegi after the deal is complete for the purposes of tracking the portfolio i will be considering the 2000 which i would have allocated to pegi to be held as cash unless or until the stock trades at 26 75 or below in 2020 excess cash from the 2000 position allocated to xop will also be allocated to pegi if it trades at or below 26 75 in 2020 all of this money will be allocated to one or two new or existing positions chosen after the pegi sale completes bonus pick polaris infrastructure inc pif to rampf is a tiny geothermal and run of river hydropower yieldco build around the assets of ram power long time readers may recall ram power as a bonus speculative pick from the 2014 list like most speculations that particular gamble did not pay off and the company went into bankruptcy after repeated drilling failed to stabilize electricity production at its main geothermal asset san jacinto tizate in nicaragua even after extensive additional drilling unable to meet its debt obligations with the lower than expected electricity revenues the bondholders ended up owning the company and they re listed it without its former heavy debt burden and a healthy dividend in 2015 in early december i had hoped to include polaris in the list but the stock price ran up over 10 in the last two weeks of the year while its yield is very attractive compared to other yieldcos its small size and continued need for additional drilling at san jacinto tizate to offset natural production declines make me cautious about buying this company at anything but rock bottom prices nevertheless it is one to watch and if the price falls back in 2020 it s a leading candidate to replace pegi when the buyout is complete portfolio for the first time this year i plan to track the model portfolio based on an initial 20 000 investment using actual share numbers and cash in the past i have assumed that dividends would be re invested in each position this year i will track them as cash and only re invest if i see an attractive opportunity i will track foreign stocks using their stock prices in their home markets with values translated into us dollars at current exchange rates using the five letter foreign stock ticker readers should note that stock price quotes for these tickers are often stale and so they will likely vary slightly from my calculated prices readers who are using adrs rather than foreign stocks in their own portfolios should use 2 shares of vleey and rdeiy in place of one share of vleef or rdeif because of the adr multipliers in contrast shares of veoey and veoef have equal value see my recent article on trading foreign stocks and options for more details i will track the price of the xop put option using the midpoint of the bid and the ask at market close rather than the most trade which could be hours or even days old and so may not reflect recent price movements in the underlying etf xop as i have for the last few years i will continue to use global

rates conclusion looking forward to 2020 the only thing i am sure of is that i have no idea what is going to happen to the stock market i have been preparing for a large market correction for more than half of 2019 and the us stock market has continued to advance unstoppably valuations seem extremely stretched the political climate could not be more volatile and the federal reserve has indicated that they do not intend to keep lowering interest rates with this backdrop it should not take much to send the stock market into a tailspin on the other hand my friend jan schalkwijk cfa of jps global investments an advertiser on this website recently reminded me that most bull markets end in euphoria when there is no one left to get excited about the stock market that is hardly the situation today and i am hardly the only voice of caution among stock market pundits i also have a track record of being too early i often get out of bull markets long before they peak and start buying declining stocks long before they bottom so i m far from confident that the bear i expect will appear soon or even in 2020 but when it comes to bear markets it s better to get out too soon than too late ten clean energy stocks for 2020 is probably the most diversified and defensive model portfolio in the series since i started it in 2008 yet with my worries about the coming year i will not be surprised if the portfolio ends 2020 lower than it begins the year let s hope that does not happen but if it does the model portfolio should decline much less than its benchmarks especially the

predicting that 168 million people a record will need humanitarian assistance in 2020 because of extreme weather large infectious disease outbreaks and intensifying protracted conflicts across more than 50 countries that s around a million more people than were in need of assistance in 2019 and the number is expected to continue to rise up to 200 million people by 2022 the u n expects that providing this assistance in 2020 could cost up to 29 billion hot spots include burkina faso where a surge in violence by religious extremists has displaced more than half a million people the philippines where a christmas eve typhoon killed more than two dozen and venezuela where an economic collapse has resulted in the exodus of nearly 5 million people in the last five years shannon scribner associate director for humanitarian policy and programs at oxfam america says that funding to respond to these crises is not keeping pace with the need and that will continue to be a challenge scribner says another concern is an increasing number of restrictions on international ngos that make it harder to enter and operate in conflict affected areas such as syria and yemen humanitarian law isn t being upheld in some of the countries where we re working says scribner and we don t see world leaders talking about human rights the way they once did one key solution she says channel more funding to small local groups that know the terrain intimately rather than big international ngos tim mcdonnell second tier diseases will go gangbusters over the last 12 months the world made steady progress against the big infectious killers hiv malaria and tuberculosis but other illnesses some of them easily preventable stole the limelight those second tier diseases include measles and dengue which did gangbusters in the tropics cholera raged inyemen polio clawed its way back from the brink of defeat in pakistan polio cases were up more than tenfold from a low of just nine in 2018 in a cruel unintended consequence of the polio eradication effort a dozen countries that had been polio free including china angola and the philippines reported cases of vaccine derived polio in 2019 venezuela reported itsfirst yellow fever case in more than a decade as that country s health care system continues its downward spiral despite efforts to rein it in a few cases of middle east respiratory syndrome are reported each month in the middle east and that will probably continue in the coming year recent high profile measles outbreaks in the u s europe the philippines and samoa should push health officials to make sure more kids are immunized this year to prevent outbreaks the world health organization says that roughly 95 of a community needs to be vaccinated against measles more thanhalf the countries in the world including the u s at 94 haven t reached that threshold according to unicef where might there be a measles outbreak in 2020 afghanistan angola bolivia and haiti all have dismally low immunization rates below 40 but there are some signs of progress this year a newdengue vaccine might finally make a dent in the roughly 100 million cases of the disease that occur most years and the world is more prepared to deal with ebola than at any time in history two vaccines and several experimental treatments are in use all developed after the 2014 west africa outbreak the current ebola outbreak in eastern democratic republic of congo appears to say more about the dismal social conditions there than about the world s ability to battle this virus if there s an ebola outbreak outside a conflict zone in 2020 it would likely be contained and crushed quickly jason beaubien aid will become even more political it seems we re returning to the bad old days of the cold war when we used aid as a glorified payoff for friends and allies says jeremy konyndyk a senior fellow at the center for global development and former u s foreign disaster assistance chief under the obama administration instead of providing aid to improve health and foster economic development konyndyk says there s a growing mentality in the u s that aid can be used as a goody bag to incentivize foreign leaders to fall in line examples include trump s freezing andreinstatement of aid to el salvador guatemala and honduras in 2019 based on their immigration policies his threats tocut off countries that don t vote with the u s at the united nations and hiswithdrawal of aid to palestinians to pressure them to reconsider his peace plan the u k has also announced plans to merge its department for international development into its foreign office a move thatmore than 100 charities say risks politicizing u k aid these shifts by the u s and u k two of the world s largest aid donors could set the tone for a lot of aid policy around the world says konyndyk joanne lu unrest over inequality will grow 2019 was marked by angry protests over inequality around the world and according to some experts the demonstrations will grow more violent in 2020 since the 1980s income inequality has been on the rise says lucas chancel co director of the world inequality lab at the paris school of economics in the u s for example chancel says the richest 1 owned about 40 of the nation s wealth in 2016 up from 20 in the 1980s and trump s 2017 tax policies have only turbocharged inequality with the richest 400 families paying a lower average tax rate in 2018 than the poorest half of american households it is unlikely that 2020 brings anything different he says meaning inequality will deepen despite the efforts of angry protesters to stop it part of the problem is that inequality has a new face according to a new report by theunited nations development programme people are no longer just angry about income they re concerned about inequalities in political representation and power higher education access to technology and the resources to survive climate change chancel says the protests in chile france lebanon hong kong and other countries demonstrate that governments still do not seem to have grasped the reality of the situation and have yet to provide adequate solutions until they do the undp report warns the social unrest will likely continue joanne lu water taps continue to run dry in june 2019 chennai india reached day zero the day on which the city s reservoirs ran almost completely out of water by the fall seasonal rains had resupplied the city at least temporarily but the looming specter of water scarcity is certain to continue in cities around the world in 2020 in india alone 21 cities are at risk of running dry in 2020 according to a government report and an august report from the world resources institute found that a group of 17 countries that together are home to one quarter of the global population including botswana india iran and mexico are using as much or more water than they can replace upmanu lall director of the columbia water center says that while droughts linked to climate change can create water scarcity in many cases day zero events are caused more by government mismanagement of water resources i haven t seen any reasonable improvement he says so i think there will continue to be places that are stressed and at least one will pop up as a day zero this year the indian subcontinent is a prime candidate he says but on the plus side climate scientists expect 2020 to be an off year for el niño and la niña the weather patterns that occur every few years and can cause flooding in some areas and droughts in others the absence of those extremes might help stave off some instances of water scarcity either way victoria beard an urban planning professor at cornell university and world resources institute fellow says water scarcity will continue to be a problem especially in cities until governments of high risk localities pay to massively overhaul their water systems people are demanding of their leaders to see investments in basic services she says there s no self provision that s going to solve this problem in the long term there are no examples where it s a free for all and it works out well you need coordinated massive public investment tim mcdonnell gender equality is not on the horizon the u n calls gender equality a necessary foundation for a peaceful and prosperous world yet no country in the world is on track to achieve gender equality as defined by the u n s sustainable development goals by 2030 2020 will mark an important milestone in the long road to gender equality it s the 25th anniversary of the beijing declaration and platform for action which is considered a landmark progressive blueprint for advancing women s rights the global community will be taking stock of progress and lack thereof at gatherings such as that of the u n commission on the status of women in march worldwide women continue to face disproportionate rates of discrimination and violence less access to economic and educational opportunities and exclusion from decision making roles at the community and governmental levels by one measure the world will not achieve gender equality for nearly a century the most current estimate by the world economic forum which publishes an annual report to track country by country progress across economic educational health and political dimensions is that achieving parity across all four dimensions will take an average of 99 5 years at the current rate while the wef report found that achieving parity is relatively close at hand for educational attainment which could be possible in as soon as 12 years progress toward closing the economic opportunities gap is actually backsliding by that metric parity is a lowly 57 8 and will take 257 years to overcome emily vaughn hopeful trends global health will get woke this year expect more people in the global health and development community to address the injustices and inequities that can be traced to the era when western countries colonized poor countries stripping them of resources and autonomy people who work in the field know that much of the money influence and decision making about how to help low income countries still comes from wealthy countries with little input from the people who receive the assistance one reason for this mindset says renzo guinto a filipino physician and a member of the lancet planetary health s editorial board is the colonial roots of tropical medicine in the colonial era european researchers studied diseases in the colonies to protect the colonizers not the people living in those places from getting sick over the past couple of years he and a growing number of global health staffers have been working to make a change they aim to give medical professionals in low income countries real leadership roles at the university level students are calling on faculty to acknowledge the field s colonial history in global health curriculum and communications managers at charitable groups are trying to portray the recipients of aid with dignity and respect in messages sent to donors and the media many of these conversations can be found on social media with the hashtags shiftthepower and decolonizeglobalhealth jennifer lentfer a communications strategist who has worked in the field for two decades says she has never seen so much excitement around decolonizing global development there are already events scheduled in 2020 to tackle the subject in the coming weeks lentfer is hosting a couple of online workshops on topics that question western motives to make a difference and help because it is our moral imperative and in january graduate students at duke university are organizing a conference called decolonizing global health 2020 there s a real question as to how to flip the leadership says lentfer and that s coming to a big head malaka gharib satellite imagery could improve global health this year expect to see more research on global health and development from a sky high point of view imagery produced by satellites is becoming more ubiquitous and inexpensive and an increasingly vital source of data on poverty disease and environmental challenges marshall burke deputy director of stanford university s center on food security and the environment is one of a growing number of researchers who are training artificial intelligence software to scan through millions of satellite images to look for clues about where these challenges exist and test solutions to them let s say you run a government agency in a low income country and want to identify the poorest 10 of villages or determine how many people live within easy reach of a medical facility or close to bodies of water that could be a source of mosquito borne diseases satellite imagery can help you answer those questions burke says in a way that s much less expensive and time consuming than traditional boots on the ground surveys cars large buildings and well tended farms can all be indications of income and population density and are easily spotted from space satellite imagery is already helping cattle herders in the sahel look for water and assisting regulators in west africa in cracking down on illegal gold mining it can help humanitarian agencies navigate in the aftermath of natural disasters in some cases it might help us peer into the future in december the world resources institute unveiled an online tool that uses satellite imagery in conjunction with other data to predict water shortages and conflicts in 2020 burke says expect to see more satellite based software tools move out of research labs and into the hands of aid agencies and policymakers and although today most of the images come from satellites owned by the u s and the european union more may soon come from satellites operated by developing countries including ethiopia s first observatory satellite launched in late december tim

gualinga a teen indigenous activist from the ecuadorian amazon took world leaders to task at the cop 25 climate summit and accused oil companies of violating our human rights university students in india are protesting a new citizenship law that excludes muslim migrants young people are in the lead said u n secretary general antónio guterres in a statement on human rights day everywhere they are marching against corruption repression and inequality and for human rights and human dignity in 2020 youth activists will continue to speak up for the world they want to see says jessica taft a youth movement researcher and professor of latin american studies at the university of california santa cruz that kind of involvement by young people isn t new taft says but what has changed she says is that today s social media platforms make their contributions more visible to the world and to each other with their phones set to retweet they can instantly amplify movements that are half a world away a common refrain from young activists is that the failures of previous generations have left them stuck in a flawed version of the world that an older generation helped make many of the issues that they re focusing on right now are ones that they re able to claim moral authority around as young people says taft that includes topics such as climate change and gun violence which young people can address from personal experience like the students at stoneman douglas high school in parkland fla who captured the world s attention after the shooting at their school matt deitsch a graduate of the school and an organizer of the march for our lives rally in washington d c told npr in an interview in 2019 if we re not standing up and organizing ourselves then we re not doing enough to save lives in america pien huang cash will be king of aid it s an idea that has been gaining popularity for more than two decades instead of giving poor people goods and services say a cow or job training why not just give them money and let them decide how best to spend it interest in cash transfers as this form of aid is often referred to is likely to get even bigger over the coming decade says david evans a senior fellow at the washington d c think tank center for global development one reason is that researchers will increasingly be able to study the long term effects of some of the earliest large scale cash transfer programs a series of government assistance schemes that began in latin america in the late 1990s already we re starting to see the first wave of long term evaluations says evans who is on leave as a lead economist at the world bank so far the evidence suggests that poor people who received this cash aid mainly used it to meet short term needs like giving their families enough food each day rather than finding ways to lift themselves out of poverty in a permanent way but these families were also able to give their children more schooling and now that the kids are aging into the workforce it will become clear whether the extra education translates into enough additional income to vault this next generation out of poverty if so says evans that will be an exciting thing to find nurith aizenman access to college will boom more and more people are going to college access to higher education has expanded rapidly across the globe over the last five years

predicting that 168 million people a record will need humanitarian assistance in 2020 because of extreme weather large infectious disease outbreaks and intensifying protracted conflicts across more than 50 countries that s around a million more people than were in need of assistance in 2019 and the number is expected to continue to rise up to 200 million people by 2022 the u n expects that providing this assistance in 2020 could cost up to 29 billion hot spots include burkina faso where a surge in violence by religious extremists has displaced more than half a million people the philippines where a christmas eve typhoon killed more than two dozen and venezuela where an economic collapse has resulted in the exodus of nearly 5 million people in the last five years shannon scribner associate director for humanitarian policy and programs at oxfam america says that funding to respond to these crises is not keeping pace with the need and that will continue to be a challenge scribner says another concern is an increasing number of restrictions on international ngos that make it harder to enter and operate in conflict affected areas such as syria and yemen humanitarian law isn t being upheld in some of the countries where we re working says scribner and we don t see world leaders talking about human rights the way they once did one key solution she says channel more funding to small local groups that know the terrain intimately rather than big international ngos tim mcdonnell second tier diseases will go gangbusters over the last 12 months the world made steady progress against the big infectious killers hiv malaria and tuberculosis but other illnesses some of them easily preventable stole the limelight those second tier diseases include measles and dengue which did gangbusters in the tropics cholera raged inyemen polio clawed its way back from the brink of defeat in pakistan polio cases were up more than tenfold from a low of just nine in 2018 in a cruel unintended consequence of the polio eradication effort a dozen countries that had been polio free including china angola and the philippines reported cases of vaccine derived polio in 2019 venezuela reported itsfirst yellow fever case in more than a decade as that country s health care system continues its downward spiral despite efforts to rein it in a few cases of middle east respiratory syndrome are reported each month in the middle east and that will probably continue in the coming year recent high profile measles outbreaks in the u s europe the philippines and samoa should push health officials to make sure more kids are immunized this year to prevent outbreaks the world health organization says that roughly 95 of a community needs to be vaccinated against measles more thanhalf the countries in the world including the u s at 94 haven t reached that threshold according to unicef where might there be a measles outbreak in 2020 afghanistan angola bolivia and haiti all have dismally low immunization rates below 40 but there are some signs of progress this year a newdengue vaccine might finally make a dent in the roughly 100 million cases of the disease that occur most years and the world is more prepared to deal with ebola than at any time in history two vaccines and several experimental treatments are in use all developed after the 2014 west africa outbreak the current ebola outbreak in eastern democratic republic of congo appears to say more about the dismal social conditions there than about the world s ability to battle this virus if there s an ebola outbreak outside a conflict zone in 2020 it would likely be contained and crushed quickly jason beaubien aid will become even more political it seems we re returning to the bad old days of the cold war when we used aid as a glorified payoff for friends and allies says jeremy konyndyk a senior fellow at the center for global development and former u s foreign disaster assistance chief under the obama administration instead of providing aid to improve health and foster economic development konyndyk says there s a growing mentality in the u s that aid can be used as a goody bag to incentivize foreign leaders to fall in line examples include trump s freezing andreinstatement of aid to el salvador guatemala and honduras in 2019 based on their immigration policies his threats tocut off countries that don t vote with the u s at the united nations and hiswithdrawal of aid to palestinians to pressure them to reconsider his peace plan the u k has also announced plans to merge its department for international development into its foreign office a move thatmore than 100 charities say risks politicizing u k aid these shifts by the u s and u k two of the world s largest aid donors could set the tone for a lot of aid policy around the world says konyndyk joanne lu unrest over inequality will grow 2019 was marked by angry protests over inequality around the world and according to some experts the demonstrations will grow more violent in 2020 since the 1980s income inequality has been on the rise says lucas chancel co director of the world inequality lab at the paris school of economics in the u s for example chancel says the richest 1 owned about 40 of the nation s wealth in 2016 up from 20 in the 1980s and trump s 2017 tax policies have only turbocharged inequality with the richest 400 families paying a lower average tax rate in 2018 than the poorest half of american households it is unlikely that 2020 brings anything different he says meaning inequality will deepen despite the efforts of angry protesters to stop it part of the problem is that inequality has a new face according to a new report by theunited nations development programme people are no longer just angry about income they re concerned about inequalities in political representation and power higher education access to technology and the resources to survive climate change chancel says the protests in chile france lebanon hong kong and other countries demonstrate that governments still do not seem to have grasped the reality of the situation and have yet to provide adequate solutions until they do the undp report warns the social unrest will likely continue joanne lu water taps continue to run dry in june 2019 chennai india reached day zero the day on which the city s reservoirs ran almost completely out of water by the fall seasonal rains had resupplied the city at least temporarily but the looming specter of water scarcity is certain to continue in cities around the world in 2020 in india alone 21 cities are at risk of running dry in 2020 according to a government report and an august report from the world resources institute found that a group of 17 countries that together are home to one quarter of the global population including botswana india iran and mexico are using as much or more water than they can replace upmanu lall director of the columbia water center says that while droughts linked to climate change can create water scarcity in many cases day zero events are caused more by government mismanagement of water resources i haven t seen any reasonable improvement he says so i think there will continue to be places that are stressed and at least one will pop up as a day zero this year the indian subcontinent is a prime candidate he says but on the plus side climate scientists expect 2020 to be an off year for el niño and la niña the weather patterns that occur every few years and can cause flooding in some areas and droughts in others the absence of those extremes might help stave off some instances of water scarcity either way victoria beard an urban planning professor at cornell university and world resources institute fellow says water scarcity will continue to be a problem especially in cities until governments of high risk localities pay to massively overhaul their water systems people are demanding of their leaders to see investments in basic services she says there s no self provision that s going to solve this problem in the long term there are no examples where it s a free for all and it works out well you need coordinated massive public investment tim mcdonnell gender equality is not on the horizon the u n calls gender equality a necessary foundation for a peaceful and prosperous world yet no country in the world is on track to achieve gender equality as defined by the u n s sustainable development goals by 2030 2020 will mark an important milestone in the long road to gender equality it s the 25th anniversary of the beijing declaration and platform for action which is considered a landmark progressive blueprint for advancing women s rights the global community will be taking stock of progress and lack thereof at gatherings such as that of the u n commission on the status of women in march worldwide women continue to face disproportionate rates of discrimination and violence less access to economic and educational opportunities and exclusion from decision making roles at the community and governmental levels by one measure the world will not achieve gender equality for nearly a century the most current estimate by the world economic forum which publishes an annual report to track country by country progress across economic educational health and political dimensions is that achieving parity across all four dimensions will take an average of 99 5 years at the current rate while the wef report found that achieving parity is relatively close at hand for educational attainment which could be possible in as soon as 12 years progress toward closing the economic opportunities gap is actually backsliding by that metric parity is a lowly 57 8 and will take 257 years to overcome emily vaughn hopeful trends global health will get woke this year expect more people in the global health and development community to address the injustices and inequities that can be traced to the era when western countries colonized poor countries stripping them of resources and autonomy people who work in the field know that much of the money influence and decision making about how to help low income countries still comes from wealthy countries with little input from the people who receive the assistance one reason for this mindset says renzo guinto a filipino physician and a member of the lancet planetary health s editorial board is the colonial roots of tropical medicine in the colonial era european researchers studied diseases in the colonies to protect the colonizers not the people living in those places from getting sick over the past couple of years he and a growing number of global health staffers have been working to make a change they aim to give medical professionals in low income countries real leadership roles at the university level students are calling on faculty to acknowledge the field s colonial history in global health curriculum and communications managers at charitable groups are trying to portray the recipients of aid with dignity and respect in messages sent to donors and the media many of these conversations can be found on social media with the hashtags shiftthepower and decolonizeglobalhealth jennifer lentfer a communications strategist who has worked in the field for two decades says she has never seen so much excitement around decolonizing global development there are already events scheduled in 2020 to tackle the subject in the coming weeks lentfer is hosting a couple of online workshops on topics that question western motives to make a difference and help because it is our moral imperative and in january graduate students at duke university are organizing a conference called decolonizing global health 2020 there s a real question as to how to flip the leadership says lentfer and that s coming to a big head malaka gharib satellite imagery could improve global health this year expect to see more research on global health and development from a sky high point of view imagery produced by satellites is becoming more ubiquitous and inexpensive and an increasingly vital source of data on poverty disease and environmental challenges marshall burke deputy director of stanford university s center on food security and the environment is one of a growing number of researchers who are training artificial intelligence software to scan through millions of satellite images to look for clues about where these challenges exist and test solutions to them let s say you run a government agency in a low income country and want to identify the poorest 10 of villages or determine how many people live within easy reach of a medical facility or close to bodies of water that could be a source of mosquito borne diseases satellite imagery can help you answer those questions burke says in a way that s much less expensive and time consuming than traditional boots on the ground surveys cars large buildings and well tended farms can all be indications of income and population density and are easily spotted from space satellite imagery is already helping cattle herders in the sahel look for water and assisting regulators in west africa in cracking down on illegal gold mining it can help humanitarian agencies navigate in the aftermath of natural disasters in some cases it might help us peer into the future in december the world resources institute unveiled an online tool that uses satellite imagery in conjunction with other data to predict water shortages and conflicts in 2020 burke says expect to see more satellite based software tools move out of research labs and into the hands of aid agencies and policymakers and although today most of the images come from satellites owned by the u s and the european union more may soon come from satellites operated by developing countries including ethiopia s first observatory satellite launched in late december tim mcdonnell youth activists will lead the fight for a better world it s not just greta thunberg the 16 year old swedish climate activist who seized time s person of the year cover for 2019 helena gualinga a teen indigenous activist from the ecuadorian amazon took world leaders to task at the cop 25 climate summit and accused oil companies of violating our human rights university students in india are protesting a new citizenship law that excludes muslim migrants young people are in the lead said u n secretary general antónio guterres in a statement on human rights day everywhere they are marching against corruption repression and inequality and for human rights and human dignity in 2020 youth activists will continue to speak up for the world they want to see says jessica taft a youth movement researcher and professor of latin american studies at the university of california santa cruz that kind of involvement by young people isn t new taft says but what has changed she says is that today s social media platforms make their contributions more visible to the world and to each other with their phones set to retweet they can instantly amplify movements that are half a world away a common refrain from young activists is that the failures of previous generations have left them stuck in a flawed version of the world that an older generation helped make many of the issues that they re focusing on right now are ones that they re able to claim moral authority around as young people says taft that includes topics such as climate change and gun violence which young people can address from personal experience like the students at stoneman douglas high school in parkland fla who captured the world s attention after the shooting at their school matt deitsch a graduate of the school and an organizer of the march for our lives rally in washington d c told npr in an interview in 2019 if we re not standing up and organizing ourselves then we re not doing enough to save lives in america pien huang cash will be king of aid it s an idea that has been gaining popularity for more than two decades instead of giving poor people goods and services say a cow or job training why not just give them money and let them decide how best to spend it interest in cash transfers as this form of aid is often referred to is likely to get even bigger over the coming decade says david evans a senior fellow at the washington d c think tank center for global development one reason is that researchers will increasingly be able to study the long term effects of some of the earliest large scale cash transfer programs a series of government assistance schemes that began in latin america in the late 1990s already we re starting to see the first wave of long term evaluations says evans who is on leave as a lead economist at the world bank so far the evidence suggests that poor people who received this cash aid mainly used it to meet short term needs like giving their families enough food each day rather than finding ways to lift themselves out of poverty in a permanent way but these families were also able to give their children more schooling and now that the kids are aging into the workforce it will become clear whether the extra education translates into enough additional income to vault this next generation out of poverty if so says evans that will be an exciting thing to find nurith aizenman access to college will boom more and more people are going to college access to higher education has expanded rapidly across the globe over the last five years

s around a million more people than were in need of assistance in 2019 and the number is expected to continue to rise up to 200 million people by 2022 the u n expects that providing this assistance in 2020 could cost up to 29 billion hot spots include burkina faso where a surge in violence by religious extremists has displaced more than half a million people the philippines where a christmas eve typhoon killed more than two dozen and venezuela where an economic collapse has resulted in the exodus of nearly 5 million people in the last five years shannon scribner associate director for humanitarian policy and programs at oxfam america says that funding to respond to these crises is not keeping pace with the need and that will continue to be a challenge scribner says another concern is an increasing number of restrictions on international ngos that make it harder to enter and operate in conflict affected areas such as syria and yemen humanitarian law isn t being upheld in some of the countries where we re working says scribner and we don t see world leaders talking about human rights the way they once did one key solution she says channel more funding to small local groups that know the terrain intimately rather than big international ngos tim mcdonnell second tier diseases will go gangbusters over the last 12 months the world made steady progress against the big infectious killers hiv malaria and tuberculosis but other illnesses some of them easily preventable stole the limelight those second tier diseases include measles and dengue which did gangbusters in the tropics cholera raged in yemen polio clawed its way back from the brink of defeat in pakistan polio cases were up more than tenfold from a low of just nine in 2018 in a cruel unintended consequence of the polio eradication effort a dozen countries that had been polio free including china angola and the philippines reported cases of vaccine derived polio in 2019 venezuela reported its first yellow fever case in more than a decade as that country s health care system continues its downward spiral despite efforts to rein it in a few cases of middle east respiratory syndrome are reported each month in the middle east and that will probably continue in the coming year recent high profile measles outbreaks in the u s europe the philippines and samoa should push health officials to make sure more kids are immunized this year to prevent outbreaks the world health organization says that roughly 95 of a community needs to be vaccinated against measles more than half the countries in the world including the u s at 94 haven t reached that threshold according to unicef where might there be a measles outbreak in 2020 afghanistan angola bolivia and haiti all have dismally low immunization rates below 40 but there are some signs of progress this year a new dengue vaccine might finally make a dent in the roughly 100 million cases of the disease that occur most years and the world is more prepared to deal with ebola than at any time in history two vaccines and several experimental treatments are in use all developed after the 2014 west africa outbreak the current ebola outbreak in eastern democratic republic of congo appears to say more about the dismal social conditions there than about the world s ability to battle this virus if there s an ebola outbreak outside a conflict zone in 2020 it would likely be contained and crushed quickly jason beaubien aid will become even more political it seems we re returning to the bad old days of the cold war when we used aid as a glorified payoff for friends and allies says jeremy konyndyk a senior fellow at the center for global development and former u s foreign disaster assistance chief under the obama administration instead of providing aid to improve health and foster economic development konyndyk says there s a growing mentality in the u s that aid can be used as a goody bag to incentivize foreign leaders to fall in line examples include trump s freezing and reinstatement of aid to el salvador guatemala and honduras in 2019 based on their immigration policies his threats to cut off countries that don t vote with the u s at the united nations and his withdrawal of aid to palestinians to pressure them to reconsider his peace plan the u k has also announced plans to merge its department for international development into its foreign office a move that more than 100 charities say risks politicizing u k aid these shifts by the u s and u k two of the world s largest aid donors could set the tone for a lot of aid policy around the world says konyndyk joanne lu unrest over inequality will grow 2019 was marked by angry protests over inequality around the world and according to some experts the demonstrations will grow more violent in 2020 since the 1980s income inequality has been on the rise says lucas chancel co director of the world inequality lab at the paris school of economics in the u s for example chancel says the richest 1 owned about 40 of the nation s wealth in 2016 up from 20 in the 1980s and trump s 2017 tax policies have only turbocharged inequality with the richest 400 families paying a lower average tax rate in 2018 than the poorest half of american households it is unlikely that 2020 brings anything different he says meaning inequality will deepen despite the efforts of angry protesters to stop it part of the problem is that inequality has a new face according to a new report by the united nations development programme people are no longer just angry about income they re concerned about inequalities in political representation and power higher education access to technology and the resources to survive climate change chancel says the protests in chile france lebanon hong kong and other countries demonstrate that governments still do not seem to have grasped the reality of the situation and have yet to

which the city s reservoirs ran almost completely out of water by the fall seasonal rains had resupplied the city at least temporarily but the looming specter of water scarcity is certain to continue in cities around the world in 2020 in india alone 21 cities are at risk of running dry in 2020 according to a government report and an august report from the world resources institute found that a

of the columbia water center says that while droughts linked to climate change can create water scarcity in many cases day zero events are caused more by government mismanagement of water resources i haven t seen any reasonable improvement he says so i think there will continue to be places that are stressed and at least one will pop up as a day zero this year the indian subcontinent is a prime candidate he says but on the plus side climate scientists expect 2020 to be an off year for el niño and la niña the weather patterns that occur every few years and can cause flooding in some areas and droughts in others the absence of those extremes might help stave off some instances of water scarcity either way victoria beard an urban planning professor at cornell university and world resources institute fellow says water scarcity will continue to be a problem especially in cities until governments of high risk localities pay to massively overhaul their water systems people are demanding of

it s the 25th anniversary of the beijing declaration and platform for action which is considered a landmark progressive blueprint for advancing women s rights the global community will be taking stock

less access to economic and educational opportunities and exclusion from decision making roles at the community and governmental levels by one measure the world will not achieve gender equality for nearly a century the most current estimate by the world economic forum which publishes an annual report to track country by country progress across economic educational health and political dimensions is that achieving parity across all four dimensions will take an average of 99 5 years at the current rate while the wef report found that achieving parity is relatively close at hand for educational attainment which could be possible in as soon as 12 years progress toward closing the economic opportunities gap is actually backsliding by that metric parity is a lowly 57 8 and will take 257 years to overcome emily vaughn hopeful trends global health will get woke this year expect more people in the global health and development community to address the injustices and inequities that can be traced to the era when western countries colonized poor countries stripping them of resources and autonomy people who work in the field know that much of the money influence and decision making about how to help low income countries still comes from wealthy countries with little input from the people who receive the assistance one reason for this mindset says renzo guinto a filipino physician and a member of the lancet planetary health s editorial board is the colonial roots of tropical medicine in the colonial era european researchers studied diseases in the colonies to protect the colonizers not the people living in those places from getting sick over the past couple of years he and a growing number of global health staffers have been working to make a change they aim to give medical professionals in low income countries real leadership roles at the university level students are calling on faculty to acknowledge the field s colonial history in global health curriculum and

excitement around decolonizing global development there are already events scheduled in 2020 to tackle the subject in the coming weeks lentfer is hosting a couple of online workshops on topics that question western motives to make a difference and help because it is our moral imperative and in january graduate students at duke university are organizing a conference called decolonizing global

more research on global health and development from a sky high point of view imagery produced by satellites is becoming more ubiquitous and inexpensive and an increasingly vital source of data on poverty disease and environmental challenges marshall burke deputy director of stanford university s center on food security and the environment is one of a growing number of researchers who are training artificial intelligence software to scan through millions of satellite images to look for clues about where these challenges exist and test solutions to them let s say you run a government agency in a low income country and want to identify the poorest 10 of villages or determine how many people live within easy reach of a medical facility or close to bodies of water that could be a source of mosquito borne diseases satellite imagery can help you answer those questions burke says in a way that s much less expensive and time consuming than traditional boots on the ground surveys cars large buildings and well tended farms can all be indications of income and population density and are easily spotted from space satellite imagery is already helping cattle herders in the sahel look for water and assisting regulators in west africa in cracking down on illegal gold mining it can help humanitarian agencies navigate in the aftermath of natural disasters in some cases it might help us peer into the future in december the world resources institute unveiled an online tool that uses satellite imagery in conjunction with other data to predict water shortages and conflicts in 2020 burke says expect to see more satellite based software tools move out of research labs and into the hands of aid agencies and policymakers and although today most of the images come from satellites owned by the u s and the european union more may soon come from satellites operated by developing countries including ethiopia s first observatory satellite launched in late december tim

marching against corruption repression and inequality and for human rights and human dignity in 2020 youth activists will continue to speak up for the world they want to see says jessica taft a youth movement researcher and professor of latin american studies at the university of california santa cruz that kind of involvement by young people isn t new taft says but what has changed she says is that today s social media platforms make their contributions more visible to the world and to each other with their phones set to retweet they can instantly amplify movements that are half a world away a common refrain from young activists is that the failures of previous generations have left them stuck in a flawed version of the world that an older generation helped make many of the issues that they re focusing on right now are ones that they re able to claim moral authority around as young people says taft that includes topics such as climate change and gun violence which young people can address from personal experience like the students at stoneman douglas high school in parkland fla who captured the world s attention after the shooting at their school matt deitsch a graduate of the school and an organizer of the march for our lives rally in washington d c told npr in an interview in 2019 if we re not standing up and organizing ourselves then we re not doing enough to save

why not just give them money and let them decide how best to spend it interest in cash transfers as this form of aid is often referred to is likely to get even bigger over the coming decade says david evans a senior fellow at the washington d c think tank center for global development one reason is that researchers will increasingly be able to study the long term effects of some of the earliest large scale cash transfer programs a series of government assistance schemes that began in latin america in the late 1990s already we re starting to see the first wave of long term evaluations says evans who is on leave as a lead economist at the world bank so far the evidence suggests that poor people who received this cash aid mainly used it to meet short term needs like giving their families enough food each day rather than finding ways to lift themselves out of poverty in a permanent way but these families were also able to give their children more schooling and now that the kids are aging into the workforce it will become clear whether the extra education translates into enough additional income to vault this next generation out of poverty if so says evans that will be an exciting thing to find nurith aizenman access to college will boom more and more people are going to college access to higher education has expanded rapidly across the globe over the last five years

than 50 countries that s around a million more people than were in need of assistance in 2019 and the number is expected to continue to rise up to 200 million people by 2022 the u n expects that providing this assistance in 2020 could cost up to 29 billion hot spots include burkina faso where a surge in violence by religious extremists has displaced more than half a million people the philippines where a christmas eve typhoon killed more than two dozen and venezuela where an economic collapse has resulted in the exodus of nearly 5 million people in the last five years shannon scribner associate director for humanitarian policy and programs at oxfam america says that funding to respond to these crises is not keeping pace with the need and that will continue to be a challenge scribner says another concern is an increasing number of restrictions on international ngos that make it harder to enter and operate in conflict affected areas such as syria and yemen humanitarian law isn t being upheld in some of the countries where we re working says scribner and we don t see world leaders talking about human rights the way they once did one key solution she says channel more funding to small local groups that know the terrain intimately rather than big international ngos tim mcdonnell second tier diseases will go gangbusters over the last 12 months the world made steady progress against the big infectious killers hiv malaria and tuberculosis but other illnesses some of them easily preventable stole the limelight those second tier diseases include measles and dengue which did gangbusters in the tropics cholera raged inyemen polio clawed its way back from the brink of defeat in pakistan polio cases were up more than tenfold from a low of just nine in 2018 in a cruel unintended consequence of the polio eradication effort a dozen countries that had been polio free including china angola and the philippines reported cases of vaccine derived polio in 2019 venezuela reported itsfirst yellow fever case in more than a decade as that country s health care system continues its downward spiral despite efforts to rein it in a few cases of middle east respiratory syndrome are reported each month in the middle east and that will probably continue in the coming year recent high profile measles outbreaks in the u s europe the philippines and samoa should push health officials to make sure more kids are immunized this year to prevent outbreaks the world health organization says that roughly 95 of a community needs to be vaccinated against measles more thanhalf the countries in the world including the u s at 94 haven t reached that threshold according to unicef where might there be a measles outbreak in 2020 afghanistan angola bolivia and haiti all have dismally low immunization rates below 40 but there are some signs of progress this year a newdengue vaccine might finally make a dent in the roughly 100 million cases of the disease that occur most years and the world is more prepared to deal with ebola than at any time in history two vaccines and several experimental treatments are in use all developed after the 2014 west africa outbreak the current ebola outbreak in eastern democratic republic of congo appears to say more about the dismal social conditions there than about the world s ability to battle this virus if there s an ebola outbreak outside a conflict zone in 2020 it would likely be contained and crushed quickly jason beaubien aid will become even more political it seems we re returning to the bad old days of the cold war when we used aid as a glorified payoff for friends and allies says jeremy konyndyk a senior fellow at the center for global development and former u s foreign disaster assistance chief under the obama administration instead of providing aid to improve health and foster economic development konyndyk says there s a growing mentality in the u s that aid can be used as a goody bag to incentivize foreign leaders to fall in line examples include trump s freezing andreinstatement of aid to el salvador guatemala and honduras in 2019 based on their immigration policies his threats tocut off countries that don t vote with the u s at the united nations and hiswithdrawal of aid to palestinians to pressure them to reconsider his peace plan the u k has also announced plans to merge its department for international development into its foreign office a move thatmore than 100 charities say risks politicizing u k aid these shifts by the u s and u k two of the world s largest aid donors could set the tone for a lot of aid policy around the world says konyndyk joanne lu unrest over inequality will grow 2019 was marked by angry protests over inequality around the world and according to some experts the demonstrations will grow more violent in 2020 since the 1980s income inequality has been on the rise says lucas chancel co director of the world inequality lab at the paris school of economics in the u s for example chancel says the richest 1 owned about 40 of the nation s wealth in 2016 up from 20 in the 1980s and trump s 2017 tax policies have only turbocharged inequality with the richest 400 families paying a lower average tax rate in 2018 than the poorest half of american households it is unlikely that 2020 brings anything different he says meaning inequality will deepen despite the efforts of angry protesters to stop it part of the problem is that inequality has a new face according to a new report by theunited nations development programme people are no longer just angry about income they re concerned about inequalities in political representation and power higher education access to technology and the resources to survive climate change chancel says the protests in chile france lebanon hong kong and other countries demonstrate that governments still do not seem to have grasped the reality of the situation and have yet to provide adequate solutions until they do the undp report warns the social unrest will likely continue joanne lu water taps continue to run dry in june 2019 chennai india reached day zero the day on which the city s reservoirs ran almost completely out of water by the fall seasonal rains had resupplied the city at least temporarily but the looming specter of water scarcity is certain to continue in cities around the world in 2020 in india alone 21 cities are at risk of running dry in 2020 according to a government report and an august report from the world resources institute found that a group of 17 countries that together are home to one quarter of the global population including botswana india iran and mexico are using as much or more water than they can replace upmanu lall director of the columbia water center says that while droughts linked to climate change can create water scarcity in many cases day zero events are caused more by government mismanagement of water resources i haven t seen any reasonable improvement he says so i think there will continue to be places that are stressed and at least one will pop up as a day zero this year the indian subcontinent is a prime candidate he says but on the plus side climate scientists expect 2020 to be an off year for el niño and la niña the weather patterns that occur every few years and can cause flooding in some areas and droughts in others the absence of those extremes might help stave off some instances of water scarcity either way victoria beard an urban planning professor at cornell university and world resources institute fellow says water scarcity will continue to be a problem especially in cities until governments of high risk localities pay to massively overhaul their water systems people are demanding of their leaders to see investments in basic services she says there s no self provision that s going to solve this problem in the long term there are no examples where it s a free for all and it works out well you need coordinated massive public investment tim mcdonnell gender equality is not on the horizon the u n calls gender equality a necessary foundation for a peaceful and prosperous world yet no country in the world is on track to achieve gender equality as defined by the u n s sustainable development goals by 2030 2020 will mark an important milestone in the long road to gender equality it s the 25th anniversary of the beijing declaration and platform for action which is considered a landmark progressive blueprint for advancing women s rights the global community will be taking stock of progress and lack thereof at gatherings such as that of the u n commission on the status of women in march worldwide women continue to face disproportionate rates of discrimination and violence less access to economic and educational opportunities and exclusion from decision making roles at the community and governmental levels by one measure the world will not achieve gender equality for nearly a century the most current estimate by the world economic forum which publishes an annual report to track country by country progress across economic educational health and political dimensions is that achieving parity across all four dimensions will take an average of 99 5 years at the current rate while the wef report found that achieving parity is relatively close at hand for educational attainment which could be possible in as soon as 12 years progress toward closing the economic opportunities gap is actually backsliding by that metric parity is a lowly 57 8 and will take 257 years to overcome emily vaughn hopeful trends global health will get woke this year expect more people in the global health and development community to address the injustices and inequities that can be traced to the era when western countries colonized poor countries stripping them of resources and autonomy people who work in the field know that much of the money influence and decision making about how to help low income countries still comes from wealthy countries with little input from the people who receive the assistance one reason for this mindset says renzo guinto a filipino physician and a member of the lancet planetary health s editorial board is the colonial roots of tropical medicine in the colonial era european researchers studied diseases in the colonies to protect the colonizers not the people living in those places from getting sick over the past couple of years he and a growing number of global health staffers have been working to make a change they aim to give medical professionals in low income countries real leadership roles at the university level students are calling on faculty to acknowledge the field s colonial history in global health curriculum and communications managers at charitable groups are trying to portray the recipients of aid with dignity and respect in messages sent to donors and the media many of these conversations can be found on social media with the hashtags shiftthepower and decolonizeglobalhealth jennifer lentfer a communications strategist who has worked in the field for two decades says she has never seen so much excitement around decolonizing global development there are already events scheduled in 2020 to tackle the subject in the coming weeks lentfer is hosting a couple of online workshops on topics that question western motives to make a difference and help because it is our moral imperative and in january graduate students at duke university are organizing a conference called decolonizing global health 2020 there s a real question as to how to flip the leadership says lentfer and that s coming to a big head malaka gharib satellite imagery could improve global health this year expect to see more research on global health and development from a sky high point of view imagery produced by satellites is becoming more ubiquitous and inexpensive and an increasingly vital source of data on poverty disease and environmental challenges marshall burke deputy director of stanford university s center on food security and the environment is one of a growing number of researchers who are training artificial intelligence software to scan through millions of satellite images to look for clues about where these challenges exist and test solutions to them let s say you run a government agency in a low income country and want to identify the poorest 10 of villages or determine how many people live within easy reach of a medical facility or close to bodies of water that could be a source of mosquito borne diseases satellite imagery can help you answer those questions burke says in a way that s much less expensive and time consuming than traditional boots on the ground surveys cars large buildings and well tended farms can all be indications of income and population density and are easily spotted from space satellite imagery is already helping cattle herders in the sahel look for water and assisting regulators in west africa in cracking down on illegal gold mining it can help humanitarian agencies navigate in the aftermath of natural disasters in some cases it might help us peer into the future in december the world resources institute unveiled an online tool that uses satellite imagery in conjunction with other data to predict water shortages and conflicts in 2020 burke says expect to see more satellite based software tools move out of research labs and into the hands of aid agencies and policymakers and although today most of the images come from satellites owned by the u s and the european union more may soon come from satellites operated by developing countries including ethiopia s first observatory satellite launched in late december tim mcdonnell youth activists will lead the fight for a better world it s not just greta thunberg the 16 year old swedish climate activist who seized time s person of the year cover for 2019 helena gualinga a teen indigenous activist from the ecuadorian amazon took world leaders to task at the cop 25 climate summit and accused oil companies of violating our human rights university students in india are protesting a new citizenship law that excludes muslim migrants young people are in the lead said u n secretary general antónio guterres in a statement on human rights day everywhere they are marching against corruption repression and inequality and for human rights and human dignity in 2020 youth activists will continue to speak up for the world they want to see says jessica taft a youth movement researcher and professor of latin american studies at the university of california santa cruz that kind of involvement by young people isn t new taft says but what has changed she says is that today s social media platforms make their contributions more visible to the world and to each other with their phones set to retweet they can instantly amplify movements that are half a world away a common refrain from young activists is that the failures of previous generations have left them stuck in a flawed version of the world that an older generation helped make many of the issues that they re focusing on right now are ones that they re able to claim moral authority around as young people says taft that includes topics such as climate change and gun violence which young people can address from personal experience like the students at stoneman douglas high school in parkland fla who captured the world s attention after the shooting at their school matt deitsch a graduate of the school and an organizer of the march for our lives rally in washington d c told npr in an interview in 2019 if we re not standing up and organizing ourselves then we re not doing enough to save lives in america pien huang cash will be king of aid it s an idea that has been gaining popularity for more than two decades instead of giving poor people goods and services say a cow or job training why not just give them money and let them decide how best to spend it interest in cash transfers as this form of aid is often referred to is likely to get even bigger over the coming decade says david evans a senior fellow at the washington d c think tank center for global development one reason is that researchers will increasingly be able to study the long term effects of some of the earliest large scale cash transfer programs a series of government assistance schemes that began in latin america in the late 1990s already we re starting to see the first wave of long term evaluations says evans who is on leave as a lead economist at the world bank so far the evidence suggests that poor people who received this cash aid mainly used it to meet short term needs like giving their families enough food each day rather than finding ways to lift themselves out of poverty in a permanent way but these families were also able to give their children more schooling and now that the kids are aging into the workforce it will become clear whether the extra education translates into enough additional income to vault this next generation out of poverty if so says evans that will be an exciting thing to find nurith aizenman access to college will boom more and more people are going to college access to higher education has expanded rapidly across the globe over the last five years says michael green ceo of social progress imperative and he expects it to continue in 2020 green and his organization through itssocial progress index have been tracking this every year since 2014 higher education has traditionally been concentrated in wealthy countries says green but many countries are making significant leaps both in terms of enrollment and quality and it s leading to a growing global middle class some of the biggest improvers according to their data include morocco slovakia and turkey our world in data an online publication based at oxford university also expects thenumber of people around the world with higher education degrees to increase as advanced skills become more important in both developing and developed economies the international institute for applied systems analysisprojects that this number will reach 1 billion by 2030 and 3 billion by 2100 compared with 725 million in 2015 although the improvement isn t in every country green says the

than 50 countries that s around a million more people than were in need of assistance in 2019 and the number is expected to continue to rise up to 200 million people by 2022 the u n expects that providing this assistance in 2020 could cost up to 29 billion hot spots include burkina faso where a surge in violence by religious extremists has displaced more than half a million people the philippines where a christmas eve typhoon killed more than two dozen and venezuela where an economic collapse has resulted in the exodus of nearly 5 million people in the last five years shannon scribner associate director for humanitarian policy and programs at oxfam america says that funding to respond to these crises is not keeping pace with the need and that will continue to be a challenge scribner says another concern is an increasing number of restrictions on international ngos that make it harder to enter and operate in conflict affected areas such as syria and yemen humanitarian law isn t being upheld in some of the countries where we re working says scribner and we don t see world leaders talking about human rights the way they once did one key solution she says channel more funding to small local groups that know the terrain intimately rather than big international ngos tim mcdonnell second tier diseases will go gangbusters over the last 12 months the world made steady progress against the big infectious killers hiv malaria and tuberculosis but other illnesses some of them easily preventable stole the limelight those second tier diseases include measles and dengue which did gangbusters in the tropics cholera raged inyemen polio clawed its way back from the brink of defeat in pakistan polio cases were up more than tenfold from a low of just nine in 2018 in a cruel unintended consequence of the polio eradication effort a dozen countries that had been polio free including china angola and the philippines reported cases of vaccine derived polio in 2019 venezuela reported itsfirst yellow fever case in more than a decade as that country s health care system continues its downward spiral despite efforts to rein it in a few cases of middle east respiratory syndrome are reported each month in the middle east and that will probably continue in the coming year recent high profile measles outbreaks in the u s europe the philippines and samoa should push health officials to make sure more kids are immunized this year to prevent outbreaks the world health organization says that roughly 95 of a community needs to be vaccinated against measles more thanhalf the countries in the world including the u s at 94 haven t reached that threshold according to unicef where might there be a measles outbreak in 2020 afghanistan angola bolivia and haiti all have dismally low immunization rates below 40 but there are some signs of progress this year a newdengue vaccine might finally make a dent in the roughly 100 million cases of the disease that occur most years and the world is more prepared to deal with ebola than at any time in history two vaccines and several experimental treatments are in use all developed after the 2014 west africa outbreak the current ebola outbreak in eastern democratic republic of congo appears to say more about the dismal social conditions there than about the world s ability to battle this virus if there s an ebola outbreak outside a conflict zone in 2020 it would likely be contained and crushed quickly jason beaubien aid will become even more political it seems we re returning to the bad old days of the cold war when we used aid as a glorified payoff for friends and allies says jeremy konyndyk a senior fellow at the center for global development and former u s foreign disaster assistance chief under the obama administration instead of providing aid to improve health and foster economic development konyndyk says there s a growing mentality in the u s that aid can be used as a goody bag to incentivize foreign leaders to fall in line examples include trump s freezing andreinstatement of aid to el salvador guatemala and honduras in 2019 based on their immigration policies his threats tocut off countries that don t vote with the u s at the united nations and hiswithdrawal of aid to palestinians to pressure them to reconsider his peace plan the u k has also announced plans to merge its department for international development into its foreign office a move thatmore than 100 charities say risks politicizing u k aid these shifts by the u s and u k two of the world s largest aid donors could set the tone for a lot of aid policy around the world says konyndyk joanne lu unrest over inequality will grow 2019 was marked by angry protests over inequality around the world and according to some experts the demonstrations will grow more violent in 2020 since the 1980s income inequality has been on the rise says lucas chancel co director of the world inequality lab at the paris school of economics in the u s for example chancel says the richest 1 owned about 40 of the nation s wealth in 2016 up from 20 in the 1980s and trump s 2017 tax policies have only turbocharged inequality with the richest 400 families paying a lower average tax rate in 2018 than the poorest half of american households it is unlikely that 2020 brings anything different he says meaning inequality will deepen despite the efforts of angry protesters to stop it part of the problem is that inequality has a new face according to a new report by theunited nations development programme people are no longer just angry about income they re concerned about inequalities in political representation and power higher education access to technology and the resources to survive climate change chancel says the protests in chile france lebanon hong kong and other countries demonstrate that governments still do not seem to have grasped the reality of the situation and have yet to provide adequate solutions until they do the undp report warns the social unrest will likely continue joanne lu water taps continue to run dry in june 2019 chennai india reached day zero the day on which the city s reservoirs ran almost completely out of water by the fall seasonal rains had resupplied the city at least temporarily but the looming specter of water scarcity is certain to continue in cities around the world in 2020 in india alone 21 cities are at risk of running dry in 2020 according to a government report and an august report from the world resources institute found that a group of 17 countries that together are home to one quarter of the global population including botswana india iran and mexico are using as much or more water than they can replace upmanu lall director of the columbia water center says that while droughts linked to climate change can create water scarcity in many cases day zero events are caused more by government mismanagement of water resources i haven t seen any reasonable improvement he says so i think there will continue to be places that are stressed and at least one will pop up as a day zero this year the indian subcontinent is a prime candidate he says but on the plus side climate scientists expect 2020 to be an off year for el niño and la niña the weather patterns that occur every few years and can cause flooding in some areas and droughts in others the absence of those extremes might help stave off some instances of water scarcity either way victoria beard an urban planning professor at cornell university and world resources institute fellow says water scarcity will continue to be a problem especially in cities until governments of high risk localities pay to massively overhaul their water systems people are demanding of their leaders to see investments in basic services she says there s no self provision that s going to solve this problem in the long term there are no examples where it s a free for all and it works out well you need coordinated massive public investment tim mcdonnell gender equality is not on the horizon the u n calls gender equality a necessary foundation for a peaceful and prosperous world yet no country in the world is on track to achieve gender equality as defined by the u n s sustainable development goals by 2030 2020 will mark an important milestone in the long road to gender equality it s the 25th anniversary of the beijing declaration and platform for action which is considered a landmark progressive blueprint for advancing women s rights the global community will be taking stock of progress and lack thereof at gatherings such as that of the u n commission on the status of women in march worldwide women continue to face disproportionate rates of discrimination and violence less access to economic and educational opportunities and exclusion from decision making roles at the community and governmental levels by one measure the world will not achieve gender equality for nearly a century the most current estimate by the world economic forum which publishes an annual report to track country by country progress across economic educational health and political dimensions is that achieving parity across all four dimensions will take an average of 99 5 years at the current rate while the wef report found that achieving parity is relatively close at hand for educational attainment which could be possible in as soon as 12 years progress toward closing the economic opportunities gap is actually backsliding by that metric parity is a lowly 57 8 and will take 257 years to overcome emily vaughn hopeful trends global health will get woke this year expect more people in the global health and development community to address the injustices and inequities that can be traced to the era when western countries colonized poor countries stripping them of resources and autonomy people who work in the field know that much of the money influence and decision making about how to help low income countries still comes from wealthy countries with little input from the people who receive the assistance one reason for this mindset says renzo guinto a filipino physician and a member of the lancet planetary health s editorial board is the colonial roots of tropical medicine in the colonial era european researchers studied diseases in the colonies to protect the colonizers not the people living in those places from getting sick over the past couple of years he and a growing number of global health staffers have been working to make a change they aim to give medical professionals in low income countries real leadership roles at the university level students are calling on faculty to acknowledge the field s colonial history in global health curriculum and communications managers at charitable groups are trying to portray the recipients of aid with dignity and respect in messages sent to donors and the media many of these conversations can be found on social media with the hashtags shiftthepower and decolonizeglobalhealth jennifer lentfer a communications strategist who has worked in the field for two decades says she has never seen so much excitement around decolonizing global development there are already events scheduled in 2020 to tackle the subject in the coming weeks lentfer is hosting a couple of online workshops on topics that question western motives to make a difference and help because it is our moral imperative and in january graduate students at duke university are organizing a conference called decolonizing global health 2020 there s a real question as to how to flip the leadership says lentfer and that s coming to a big head malaka gharib satellite imagery could improve global health this year expect to see more research on global health and development from a sky high point of view imagery produced by satellites is becoming more ubiquitous and inexpensive and an increasingly vital source of data on poverty disease and environmental challenges marshall burke deputy director of stanford university s center on food security and the environment is one of a growing number of researchers who are training artificial intelligence software to scan through millions of satellite images to look for clues about where these challenges exist and test solutions to them let s say you run a government agency in a low income country and want to identify the poorest 10 of villages or determine how many people live within easy reach of a medical facility or close to bodies of water that could be a source of mosquito borne diseases satellite imagery can help you answer those questions burke says in a way that s much less expensive and time consuming than traditional boots on the ground surveys cars large buildings and well tended farms can all be indications of income and population density and are easily spotted from space satellite imagery is already helping cattle herders in the sahel look for water and assisting regulators in west africa in cracking down on illegal gold mining it can help humanitarian agencies navigate in the aftermath of natural disasters in some cases it might help us peer into the future in december the world resources institute unveiled an online tool that uses satellite imagery in conjunction with other data to predict water shortages and conflicts in 2020 burke says expect to see more satellite based software tools move out of research labs and into the hands of aid agencies and policymakers and although today most of the images come from satellites owned by the u s and the european union more may soon come from satellites operated by developing countries including ethiopia s first observatory satellite launched in late december tim mcdonnell youth activists will lead the fight for a better world it s not just greta thunberg the 16 year old swedish climate activist who seized time s person of the year cover for 2019 helena gualinga a teen indigenous activist from the ecuadorian amazon took world leaders to task at the cop 25 climate summit and accused oil companies of violating our human rights university students in india are protesting a new citizenship law that excludes muslim migrants young people are in the lead said u n secretary general antónio guterres in a statement on human rights day everywhere they are marching against corruption repression and inequality and for human rights and human dignity in 2020 youth activists will continue to speak up for the world they want to see says jessica taft a youth movement researcher and professor of latin american studies at the university of california santa cruz that kind of involvement by young people isn t new taft says but what has changed she says is that today s social media platforms make their contributions more visible to the world and to each other with their phones set to retweet they can instantly amplify movements that are half a world away a common refrain from young activists is that the failures of previous generations have left them stuck in a flawed version of the world that an older generation helped make many of the issues that they re focusing on right now are ones that they re able to claim moral authority around as young people says taft that includes topics such as climate change and gun violence which young people can address from personal experience like the students at stoneman douglas high school in parkland fla who captured the world s attention after the shooting at their school matt deitsch a graduate of the school and an organizer of the march for our lives rally in washington d c told npr in an interview in 2019 if we re not standing up and organizing ourselves then we re not doing enough to save lives in america pien huang cash will be king of aid it s an idea that has been gaining popularity for more than two decades instead of giving poor people goods and services say a cow or job training why not just give them money and let them decide how best to spend it interest in cash transfers as this form of aid is often referred to is likely to get even bigger over the coming decade says david evans a senior fellow at the washington d c think tank center for global development one reason is that researchers will increasingly be able to study the long term effects of some of the earliest large scale cash transfer programs a series of government assistance schemes that began in latin america in the late 1990s already we re starting to see the first wave of long term evaluations says evans who is on leave as a lead economist at the world bank so far the evidence suggests that poor people who received this cash aid mainly used it to meet short term needs like giving their families enough food each day rather than finding ways to lift themselves out of poverty in a permanent way but these families were also able to give their children more schooling and now that the kids are aging into the workforce it will become clear whether the extra education translates into enough additional income to vault this next generation out of poverty if so says evans that will be an exciting thing to find nurith aizenman access to college will boom more and more people are going to college access to higher education has expanded rapidly across the globe over the last five years says michael green ceo of social progress imperative and he expects it to continue in 2020 green and his organization through itssocial progress index have been tracking this every year since 2014 higher education has traditionally been concentrated in wealthy countries says green but many countries are making significant leaps both in terms of enrollment and quality and it s leading to a growing global middle class some of the biggest improvers according to their data include morocco slovakia and turkey our world in data an online publication based at oxford university also expects thenumber of people around the world with higher education degrees to increase as advanced skills become more important in both developing and developed economies the international institute for applied systems analysisprojects that this number will reach 1 billion by 2030 and 3 billion by 2100 compared with 725 million in 2015 although the improvement isn t in every country green says the

than 50 countries that s around a million more people than were in need of assistance in 2019 and the number is expected to continue to rise up to 200 million people by 2022 the u n expects that providing this assistance in 2020 could cost up to 29 billion hot spots include burkina faso where a surge in violence by religious extremists has displaced more than half a million people the philippines where a christmas eve typhoon killed more than two dozen and venezuela where an economic collapse has resulted in the exodus of nearly 5 million people in the last five years shannon scribner associate director for humanitarian policy and programs at oxfam america says that funding to respond to these crises is not keeping pace with the need and that will continue to be a challenge scribner says another concern is an increasing number of restrictions on international ngos that make it harder to enter and operate in conflict affected areas such as syria and yemen humanitarian law isn t being upheld in some of the countries where we re working says scribner and we don t see world leaders talking about human rights the way they once did one key solution she says channel more funding to small local groups that know the terrain intimately rather than big international ngos tim mcdonnell second tier diseases will go gangbusters over the last 12 months the world made steady progress against the big infectious killers hiv malaria and tuberculosis but other illnesses some of them easily preventable stole the limelight those second tier diseases include measles and dengue which did gangbusters in the tropics cholera raged inyemen polio clawed its way back from the brink of defeat in pakistan polio cases were up more than tenfold from a low of just nine in 2018 in a cruel unintended consequence of the polio eradication effort a dozen countries that had been polio free including china angola and the philippines reported cases of vaccine derived polio in 2019 venezuela reported itsfirst yellow fever case in more than a decade as that country s health care system continues its downward spiral despite efforts to rein it in a few cases of middle east respiratory syndrome are reported each month in the middle east and that will probably continue in the coming year recent high profile measles outbreaks in the u s europe the philippines and samoa should push health officials to make sure more kids are immunized this year to prevent outbreaks the world health organization says that roughly 95 of a community needs to be vaccinated against measles more thanhalf the countries in the world including the u s at 94 haven t reached that threshold according to unicef where might there be a measles outbreak in 2020 afghanistan angola bolivia and haiti all have dismally low immunization rates below 40 but there are some signs of progress this year a newdengue vaccine might finally make a dent in the roughly 100 million cases of the disease that occur most years and the world is more prepared to deal with ebola than at any time in history two vaccines and several experimental treatments are in use all developed after the 2014 west africa outbreak the current ebola outbreak in eastern democratic republic of congo appears to say more about the dismal social conditions there than about the world s ability to battle this virus if there s an ebola outbreak outside a conflict zone in 2020 it would likely be contained and crushed quickly jason beaubien aid will become even more political it seems we re returning to the bad old days of the cold war when we used aid as a glorified payoff for friends and allies says jeremy konyndyk a senior fellow at the center for global development and former u s foreign disaster assistance chief under the obama administration instead of providing aid to improve health and foster economic development konyndyk says there s a growing mentality in the u s that aid can be used as a goody bag to incentivize foreign leaders to fall in line examples include trump s freezing andreinstatement of aid to el salvador guatemala and honduras in 2019 based on their immigration policies his threats tocut off countries that don t vote with the u s at the united nations and hiswithdrawal of aid to palestinians to pressure them to reconsider his peace plan the u k has also announced plans to merge its department for international development into its foreign office a move thatmore than 100 charities say risks politicizing u k aid these shifts by the u s and u k two of the world s largest aid donors could set the tone for a lot of aid policy around the world says konyndyk joanne lu unrest over inequality will grow 2019 was marked by angry protests over inequality around the world and according to some experts the demonstrations will grow more violent in 2020 since the 1980s income inequality has been on the rise says lucas chancel co director of the world inequality lab at the paris school of economics in the u s for example chancel says the richest 1 owned about 40 of the nation s wealth in 2016 up from 20 in the 1980s and trump s 2017 tax policies have only turbocharged inequality with the richest 400 families paying a lower average tax rate in 2018 than the poorest half of american households it is unlikely that 2020 brings anything different he says meaning inequality will deepen despite the efforts of angry protesters to stop it part of the problem is that inequality has a new face according to a new report by theunited nations development programme people are no longer just angry about income they re concerned about inequalities in political representation and power higher education access to technology and the resources to survive climate change chancel says the protests in chile france lebanon hong kong and other countries demonstrate that governments still do not seem to have grasped the reality of the situation and have yet to provide adequate solutions until they do the undp report warns the social unrest will likely continue joanne lu water taps continue to run dry in june 2019 chennai india reached day zero the day on which the city s reservoirs ran almost completely out of water by the fall seasonal rains had resupplied the city at least temporarily but the looming specter of water scarcity is certain to continue in cities around the world in 2020 in india alone 21 cities are at risk of running dry in 2020 according to a government report and an august report from the world resources institute found that a group of 17 countries that together are home to one quarter of the global population including botswana india iran and mexico are using as much or more water than they can replace upmanu lall director of the columbia water center says that while droughts linked to climate change can create water scarcity in many cases day zero events are caused more by government mismanagement of water resources i haven t seen any reasonable improvement he says so i think there will continue to be places that are stressed and at least one will pop up as a day zero this year the indian subcontinent is a prime candidate he says but on the plus side climate scientists expect 2020 to be an off year for el niño and la niña the weather patterns that occur every few years and can cause flooding in some areas and droughts in others the absence of those extremes might help stave off some instances of water scarcity either way victoria beard an urban planning professor at cornell university and world resources institute fellow says water scarcity will continue to be a problem especially in cities until governments of high risk localities pay to massively overhaul their water systems people are demanding of their leaders to see investments in basic services she says there s no self provision that s going to solve this problem in the long term there are no examples where it s a free for all and it works out well you need coordinated massive public investment tim mcdonnell gender equality is not on the horizon the u n calls gender equality a necessary foundation for a peaceful and prosperous world yet no country in the world is on track to achieve gender equality as defined by the u n s sustainable development goals by 2030 2020 will mark an important milestone in the long road to gender equality it s the 25th anniversary of the beijing declaration and platform for action which is considered a landmark progressive blueprint for advancing women s rights the global community will be taking stock of progress and lack thereof at gatherings such as that of the u n commission on the status of women in march worldwide women continue to face disproportionate rates of discrimination and violence less access to economic and educational opportunities and exclusion from decision making roles at the community and governmental levels by one measure the world will not achieve gender equality for nearly a century the most current estimate by the world economic forum which publishes an annual report to track country by country progress across economic educational health and political dimensions is that achieving parity across all four dimensions will take an average of 99 5 years at the current rate while the wef report found that achieving parity is relatively close at hand for educational attainment which could be possible in as soon as 12 years progress toward closing the economic opportunities gap is actually backsliding by that metric parity is a lowly 57 8 and will take 257 years to overcome emily vaughn hopeful trends global health will get woke this year expect more people in the global health and development community to address the injustices and inequities that can be traced to the era when western countries colonized poor countries stripping them of resources and autonomy people who work in the field know that much of the money influence and decision making about how to help low income countries still comes from wealthy countries with little input from the people who receive the assistance one reason for this mindset says renzo guinto a filipino physician and a member of the lancet planetary health s editorial board is the colonial roots of tropical medicine in the colonial era european researchers studied diseases in the colonies to protect the colonizers not the people living in those places from getting sick over the past couple of years he and a growing number of global health staffers have been working to make a change they aim to give medical professionals in low income countries real leadership roles at the university level students are calling on faculty to acknowledge the field s colonial history in global health curriculum and communications managers at charitable groups are trying to portray the recipients of aid with dignity and respect in messages sent to donors and the media many of these conversations can be found on social media with the hashtags shiftthepower and decolonizeglobalhealth jennifer lentfer a communications strategist who has worked in the field for two decades says she has never seen so much excitement around decolonizing global development there are already events scheduled in 2020 to tackle the subject in the coming weeks lentfer is hosting a couple of online workshops on topics that question western motives to make a difference and help because it is our moral imperative and in january graduate students at duke university are organizing a conference called decolonizing global health 2020 there s a real question as to how to flip the leadership says lentfer and that s coming to a big head malaka gharib satellite imagery could improve global health this year expect to see more research on global health and development from a sky high point of view imagery produced by satellites is becoming more ubiquitous and inexpensive and an increasingly vital source of data on poverty disease and environmental challenges marshall burke deputy director of stanford university s center on food security and the environment is one of a growing number of researchers who are training artificial intelligence software to scan through millions of satellite images to look for clues about where these challenges exist and test solutions to them let s say you run a government agency in a low income country and want to identify the poorest 10 of villages or determine how many people live within easy reach of a medical facility or close to bodies of water that could be a source of mosquito borne diseases satellite imagery can help you answer those questions burke says in a way that s much less expensive and time consuming than traditional boots on the ground surveys cars large buildings and well tended farms can all be indications of income and population density and are easily spotted from space satellite imagery is already helping cattle herders in the sahel look for water and assisting regulators in west africa in cracking down on illegal gold mining it can help humanitarian agencies navigate in the aftermath of natural disasters in some cases it might help us peer into the future in december the world resources institute unveiled an online tool that uses satellite imagery in conjunction with other data to predict water shortages and conflicts in 2020 burke says expect to see more satellite based software tools move out of research labs and into the hands of aid agencies and policymakers and although today most of the images come from satellites owned by the u s and the european union more may soon come from satellites operated by developing countries including ethiopia s first observatory satellite launched in late december tim mcdonnell youth activists will lead the fight for a better world it s not just greta thunberg the 16 year old swedish climate activist who seized time s person of the year cover for 2019 helena gualinga a teen indigenous activist from the ecuadorian amazon took world leaders to task at the cop 25 climate summit and accused oil companies of violating our human rights university students in india are protesting a new citizenship law that excludes muslim migrants young people are in the lead said u n secretary general antónio guterres in a statement on human rights day everywhere they are marching against corruption repression and inequality and for human rights and human dignity in 2020 youth activists will continue to speak up for the world they want to see says jessica taft a youth movement researcher and professor of latin american studies at the university of california santa cruz that kind of involvement by young people isn t new taft says but what has changed she says is that today s social media platforms make their contributions more visible to the world and to each other with their phones set to retweet they can instantly amplify movements that are half a world away a common refrain from young activists is that the failures of previous generations have left them stuck in a flawed version of the world that an older generation helped make many of the issues that they re focusing on right now are ones that they re able to claim moral authority around as young people says taft that includes topics such as climate change and gun violence which young people can address from personal experience like the students at stoneman douglas high school in parkland fla who captured the world s attention after the shooting at their school matt deitsch a graduate of the school and an organizer of the march for our lives rally in washington d c told npr in an interview in 2019 if we re not standing up and organizing ourselves then we re not doing enough to save lives in america pien huang cash will be king of aid it s an idea that has been gaining popularity for more than two decades instead of giving poor people goods and services say a cow or job training why not just give them money and let them decide how best to spend it interest in cash transfers as this form of aid is often referred to is likely to get even bigger over the coming decade says david evans a senior fellow at the washington d c think tank center for global development one reason is that researchers will increasingly be able to study the long term effects of some of the earliest large scale cash transfer programs a series of government assistance schemes that began in latin america in the late 1990s already we re starting to see the first wave of long term evaluations says evans who is on leave as a lead economist at the world bank so far the evidence suggests that poor people who received this cash aid mainly used it to meet short term needs like giving their families enough food each day rather than finding ways to lift themselves out of poverty in a permanent way but these families were also able to give their children more schooling and now that the kids are aging into the workforce it will become clear whether the extra education translates into enough additional income to vault this next generation out of poverty if so says evans that will be an exciting thing to find nurith aizenman access to college will boom more and more people are going to college access to higher education has expanded rapidly across the globe over the last five years says michael green ceo of social progress imperative and he expects it to continue in 2020 green and his organization through itssocial progress index have been tracking this every year since 2014 higher education has traditionally been concentrated in wealthy countries says green but many countries are making significant leaps both in terms of enrollment and quality and it s leading to a growing global middle class some of the biggest improvers according to their data include morocco slovakia and turkey our world in data an online publication based at oxford university also expects thenumber of people around the world with higher education degrees to increase as advanced skills become more important in both developing and developed economies the international institute for applied systems analysisprojects that this number will reach 1 billion by 2030 and 3 billion by 2100 compared with 725 million in 2015 although the improvement isn t in every country green says the

than 50 countries that s around a million more people than were in need of assistance in 2019 and the number is expected to continue to rise up to 200 million people by 2022 the u n expects that providing this assistance in 2020 could cost up to 29 billion hot spots include burkina faso where a surge in violence by religious extremists has displaced more than half a million people the philippines where a christmas eve typhoon killed more than two dozen and venezuela where an economic collapse has resulted in the exodus of nearly 5 million people in the last five years shannon scribner associate director for humanitarian policy and programs at oxfam america says that funding to respond to these crises is not keeping pace with the need and that will continue to be a challenge scribner says another concern is an increasing number of restrictions on international ngos that make it harder to enter and operate in conflict affected areas such as syria and yemen humanitarian law isn t being upheld in some of the countries where we re working says scribner and we don t see world leaders talking about human rights the way they once did one key solution she says channel more funding to small local groups that know the terrain intimately rather than big international ngos tim mcdonnell second tier diseases will go gangbusters over the last 12 months the world made steady progress against the big infectious killers hiv malaria and tuberculosis but other illnesses some of them easily preventable stole the limelight those second tier diseases include measles and dengue which did gangbusters in the tropics cholera raged inyemen polio clawed its way back from the brink of defeat in pakistan polio cases were up more than tenfold from a low of just nine in 2018 in a cruel unintended consequence of the polio eradication effort a dozen countries that had been polio free including china angola and the philippines reported cases of vaccine derived polio in 2019 venezuela reported itsfirst yellow fever case in more than a decade as that country s health care system continues its downward spiral despite efforts to rein it in a few cases of middle east respiratory syndrome are reported each month in the middle east and that will probably continue in the coming year recent high profile measles outbreaks in the u s europe the philippines and samoa should push health officials to make sure more kids are immunized this year to prevent outbreaks the world health organization says that roughly 95 of a community needs to be vaccinated against measles more thanhalf the countries in the world including the u s at 94 haven t reached that threshold according to unicef where might there be a measles outbreak in 2020 afghanistan angola bolivia and haiti all have dismally low immunization rates below 40 but there are some signs of progress this year a newdengue vaccine might finally make a dent in the roughly 100 million cases of the disease that occur most years and the world is more prepared to deal with ebola than at any time in history two vaccines and several experimental treatments are in use all developed after the 2014 west africa outbreak the current ebola outbreak in eastern democratic republic of congo appears to say more about the dismal social conditions there than about the world s ability to battle this virus if there s an ebola outbreak outside a conflict zone in 2020 it would likely be contained and crushed quickly jason beaubien aid will become even more political it seems we re returning to the bad old days of the cold war when we used aid as a glorified payoff for friends and allies says jeremy konyndyk a senior fellow at the center for global development and former u s foreign disaster assistance chief under the obama administration instead of providing aid to improve health and foster economic development konyndyk says there s a growing mentality in the u s that aid can be used as a goody bag to incentivize foreign leaders to fall in line examples include trump s freezing andreinstatement of aid to el salvador guatemala and honduras in 2019 based on their immigration policies his threats tocut off countries that don t vote with the u s at the united nations and hiswithdrawal of aid to palestinians to pressure them to reconsider his peace plan the u k has also announced plans to merge its department for international development into its foreign office a move thatmore than 100 charities say risks politicizing u k aid these shifts by the u s and u k two of the world s largest aid donors could set the tone for a lot of aid policy around the world says konyndyk joanne lu unrest over inequality will grow 2019 was marked by angry protests over inequality around the world and according to some experts the demonstrations will grow more violent in 2020 since the 1980s income inequality has been on the rise says lucas chancel co director of the world inequality lab at the paris school of economics in the u s for example chancel says the richest 1 owned about 40 of the nation s wealth in 2016 up from 20 in the 1980s and trump s 2017 tax policies have only turbocharged inequality with the richest 400 families paying a lower average tax rate in 2018 than the poorest half of american households it is unlikely that 2020 brings anything different he says meaning inequality will deepen despite the efforts of angry protesters to stop it part of the problem is that inequality has a new face according to a new report by theunited nations development programme people are no longer just angry about income they re concerned about inequalities in political representation and power higher education access to technology and the resources to survive climate change chancel says the protests in chile france lebanon hong kong and other countries demonstrate that governments still do not seem to have grasped the reality of the situation and have yet to provide adequate solutions until they do the undp report warns the social unrest will likely continue joanne lu water taps continue to run dry in june 2019 chennai india reached day zero the day on which the city s reservoirs ran almost completely out of water by the fall seasonal rains had resupplied the city at least temporarily but the looming specter of water scarcity is certain to continue in cities around the world in 2020 in india alone 21 cities are at risk of running dry in 2020 according to a government report and an august report from the world resources institute found that a group of 17 countries that together are home to one quarter of the global population including botswana india iran and mexico are using as much or more water than they can replace upmanu lall director of the columbia water center says that while droughts linked to climate change can create water scarcity in many cases day zero events are caused more by government mismanagement of water resources i haven t seen any reasonable improvement he says so i think there will continue to be places that are stressed and at least one will pop up as a day zero this year the indian subcontinent is a prime candidate he says but on the plus side climate scientists expect 2020 to be an off year for el niño and la niña the weather patterns that occur every few years and can cause flooding in some areas and droughts in others the absence of those extremes might help stave off some instances of water scarcity either way victoria beard an urban planning professor at cornell university and world resources institute fellow says water scarcity will continue to be a problem especially in cities until governments of high risk localities pay to massively overhaul their water systems people are demanding of their leaders to see investments in basic services she says there s no self provision that s going to solve this problem in the long term there are no examples where it s a free for all and it works out well you need coordinated massive public investment tim mcdonnell gender equality is not on the horizon the u n calls gender equality a necessary foundation for a peaceful and prosperous world yet no country in the world is on track to achieve gender equality as defined by the u n s sustainable development goals by 2030 2020 will mark an important milestone in the long road to gender equality it s the 25th anniversary of the beijing declaration and platform for action which is considered a landmark progressive blueprint for advancing women s rights the global community will be taking stock of progress and lack thereof at gatherings such as that of the u n commission on the status of women in march worldwide women continue to face disproportionate rates of discrimination and violence less access to economic and educational opportunities and exclusion from decision making roles at the community and governmental levels by one measure the world will not achieve gender equality for nearly a century the most current estimate by the world economic forum which publishes an annual report to track country by country progress across economic educational health and political dimensions is that achieving parity across all four dimensions will take an average of 99 5 years at the current rate while the wef report found that achieving parity is relatively close at hand for educational attainment which could be possible in as soon as 12 years progress toward closing the economic opportunities gap is actually backsliding by that metric parity is a lowly 57 8 and will take 257 years to overcome emily vaughn hopeful trends global health will get woke this year expect more people in the global health and development community to address the injustices and inequities that can be traced to the era when western countries colonized poor countries stripping them of resources and autonomy people who work in the field know that much of the money influence and decision making about how to help low income countries still comes from wealthy countries with little input from the people who receive the assistance one reason for this mindset says renzo guinto a filipino physician and a member of the lancet planetary health s editorial board is the colonial roots of tropical medicine in the colonial era european researchers studied diseases in the colonies to protect the colonizers not the people living in those places from getting sick over the past couple of years he and a growing number of global health staffers have been working to make a change they aim to give medical professionals in low income countries real leadership roles at the university level students are calling on faculty to acknowledge the field s colonial history in global health curriculum and communications managers at charitable groups are trying to portray the recipients of aid with dignity and respect in messages sent to donors and the media many of these conversations can be found on social media with the hashtags shiftthepower and decolonizeglobalhealth jennifer lentfer a communications strategist who has worked in the field for two decades says she has never seen so much excitement around decolonizing global development there are already events scheduled in 2020 to tackle the subject in the coming weeks lentfer is hosting a couple of online workshops on topics that question western motives to make a difference and help because it is our moral imperative and in january graduate students at duke university are organizing a conference called decolonizing global health 2020 there s a real question as to how to flip the leadership says lentfer and that s coming to a big head malaka gharib satellite imagery could improve global health this year expect to see more research on global health and development from a sky high point of view imagery produced by satellites is becoming more ubiquitous and inexpensive and an increasingly vital source of data on poverty disease and environmental challenges marshall burke deputy director of stanford university s center on food security and the environment is one of a growing number of researchers who are training artificial intelligence software to scan through millions of satellite images to look for clues about where these challenges exist and test solutions to them let s say you run a government agency in a low income country and want to identify the poorest 10 of villages or determine how many people live within easy reach of a medical facility or close to bodies of water that could be a source of mosquito borne diseases satellite imagery can help you answer those questions burke says in a way that s much less expensive and time consuming than traditional boots on the ground surveys cars large buildings and well tended farms can all be indications of income and population density and are easily spotted from space satellite imagery is already helping cattle herders in the sahel look for water and assisting regulators in west africa in cracking down on illegal gold mining it can help humanitarian agencies navigate in the aftermath of natural disasters in some cases it might help us peer into the future in december the world resources institute unveiled an online tool that uses satellite imagery in conjunction with other data to predict water shortages and conflicts in 2020 burke says expect to see more satellite based software tools move out of research labs and into the hands of aid agencies and policymakers and although today most of the images come from satellites owned by the u s and the european union more may soon come from satellites operated by developing countries including ethiopia s first observatory satellite launched in late december tim mcdonnell youth activists will lead the fight for a better world it s not just greta thunberg the 16 year old swedish climate activist who seized time s person of the year cover for 2019 helena gualinga a teen indigenous activist from the ecuadorian amazon took world leaders to task at the cop 25 climate summit and accused oil companies of violating our human rights university students in india are protesting a new citizenship law that excludes muslim migrants young people are in the lead said u n secretary general antónio guterres in a statement on human rights day everywhere they are marching against corruption repression and inequality and for human rights and human dignity in 2020 youth activists will continue to speak up for the world they want to see says jessica taft a youth movement researcher and professor of latin american studies at the university of california santa cruz that kind of involvement by young people isn t new taft says but what has changed she says is that today s social media platforms make their contributions more visible to the world and to each other with their phones set to retweet they can instantly amplify movements that are half a world away a common refrain from young activists is that the failures of previous generations have left them stuck in a flawed version of the world that an older generation helped make many of the issues that they re focusing on right now are ones that they re able to claim moral authority around as young people says taft that includes topics such as climate change and gun violence which young people can address from personal experience like the students at stoneman douglas high school in parkland fla who captured the world s attention after the shooting at their school matt deitsch a graduate of the school and an organizer of the march for our lives rally in washington d c told npr in an interview in 2019 if we re not standing up and organizing ourselves then we re not doing enough to save lives in america pien huang cash will be king of aid it s an idea that has been gaining popularity for more than two decades instead of giving poor people goods and services say a cow or job training why not just give them money and let them decide how best to spend it interest in cash transfers as this form of aid is often referred to is likely to get even bigger over the coming decade says david evans a senior fellow at the washington d c think tank center for global development one reason is that researchers will increasingly be able to study the long term effects of some of the earliest large scale cash transfer programs a series of government assistance schemes that began in latin america in the late 1990s already we re starting to see the first wave of long term evaluations says evans who is on leave as a lead economist at the world bank so far the evidence suggests that poor people who received this cash aid mainly used it to meet short term needs like giving their families enough food each day rather than finding ways to lift themselves out of poverty in a permanent way but these families were also able to give their children more schooling and now that the kids are aging into the workforce it will become clear whether the extra education translates into enough additional income to vault this next generation out of poverty if so says evans that will be an exciting thing to find nurith aizenman access to college will boom more and more people are going to college access to higher education has expanded rapidly across the globe over the last five years says michael green ceo of social progress imperative and he expects it to continue in 2020 green and his organization through itssocial progress index have been tracking this every year since 2014 higher education has traditionally been concentrated in wealthy countries says green but many countries are making significant leaps both in terms of enrollment and quality and it s leading to a growing global middle class some of the biggest improvers according to their data include morocco slovakia and turkey our world in data an online publication based at oxford university also expects thenumber of people around the world with higher education degrees to increase as advanced skills become more important in both developing and developed economies the international institute for applied systems analysisprojects that this number will reach 1 billion by 2030 and 3 billion by 2100 compared with 725 million in 2015 although the improvement isn t in every country green says the

philippines where a christmas eve typhoon killed more than two dozen and venezuela where an economic collapse has resulted in the exodus of nearly 5 million people in the last five years shannon scribner associate director for humanitarian policy and programs at oxfam america says that funding to respond to these crises is not keeping pace with the need and that will continue to be a challenge scribner says another concern is an increasing number of restrictions on international ngos that make it harder to enter and operate in conflict affected areas such as syria and yemen humanitarian law isn t being upheld in some of the countries where we re working says scribner and we don t see world leaders talking about human rights the way they once did one key solution she says

according to some experts the demonstrations will grow more violent in 2020 since the 1980s income inequality has been on the rise says lucas chancel co director of the world inequality lab at the paris school of economics in the u s for example chancel says the richest 1 owned about 40 of the nation s wealth in 2016 up from 20 in the 1980s and trump s 2017 tax policies have only turbocharged inequality with the richest 400 families paying a lower average tax rate in 2018 than the poorest half of american households it is unlikely that 2020 brings anything different he says meaning inequality will deepen despite the efforts of angry protesters to stop it part of the problem is that inequality has a new face according to a new report by theunited nations development programme people are no longer just angry about income they re concerned about inequalities in political representation and power higher education access to technology and the resources to survive climate

no country in the world is on track to achieve gender equality as defined by the u n s sustainable development goals by 2030 2020 will mark an important milestone in the long road to gender equality it s the 25th anniversary of the beijing declaration and platform for action which is considered a landmark progressive blueprint for advancing women s rights the global community will be taking stock

less access to economic and educational opportunities and exclusion from decision making roles at the community and governmental levels by one measure the world will not achieve gender equality for

to overcome emily vaughn hopeful trends global health will get woke this year expect more people in the global health and development community to address the injustices and inequities that can be traced to the era when western countries colonized poor countries stripping them of resources and autonomy people who work in the field know that much of the money influence and decision making about how to help low income countries still comes from wealthy countries with little input from the people who receive the assistance one reason for this mindset says renzo guinto a filipino physician and a member of the lancet planetary health s editorial board is the colonial roots of tropical medicine in the colonial era european researchers studied diseases in the colonies to protect the colonizers not the people living in those places from getting sick over the past couple of years he and a growing number of global health staffers have been working to make a change they aim to give medical professionals in low income countries real leadership roles at the university level students are calling on faculty to acknowledge the field s colonial history in global health curriculum and communications managers at charitable groups are trying to portray the recipients of aid with dignity and respect in messages sent to donors and the media many of these conversations can be found on social media with the hashtags shiftthepower and decolonizeglobalhealth jennifer lentfer a communications strategist who has worked in the field for two decades says she has never seen so much excitement around decolonizing global development there are already events scheduled in 2020 to tackle the subject in the coming weeks lentfer is hosting a couple of online workshops on topics that question western motives to make a difference and help because it is our moral imperative and in january graduate students at duke university are organizing a conference called decolonizing global health 2020 there s a real question as to how to flip the leadership says lentfer and that s coming to a big head malaka gharib satellite imagery could improve global health this year expect to see more research on global health and development from a sky high point of view imagery produced by satellites is becoming more ubiquitous and inexpensive and an increasingly vital source of data on poverty disease and environmental challenges marshall burke deputy director of stanford university s center on food security and the environment is one of a growing number of researchers who are training artificial intelligence software to scan through millions of satellite images to look for clues about where these challenges exist and test solutions to them let s say you run a government agency in a low income country and want to identify the poorest 10 of villages or determine how many people live within easy reach of a medical facility or close to bodies of water that could be a source of mosquito borne diseases satellite imagery can help you answer those questions burke says in a way that s much less expensive and time consuming than traditional boots on the ground surveys cars large buildings and well tended farms can all be indications of income and population density and are easily spotted from space satellite imagery is already helping cattle herders in the sahel look for water and assisting regulators in west africa in cracking down on illegal gold mining it can help humanitarian agencies navigate in the aftermath of natural disasters in some cases it might help us peer into the future in december the world resources institute unveiled an online tool that uses satellite imagery in conjunction with other data to predict water shortages and conflicts in 2020 burke says expect to see more satellite based software tools move out of research labs and into the hands of aid agencies and policymakers and although today most of the images come from satellites owned by the u s and the european union more may soon come from satellites operated by developing countries including ethiopia s first observatory satellite launched in late december tim mcdonnell youth activists will lead the fight for a better world it s not just greta thunberg the 16 year old swedish climate activist who seized time s person of the year cover for 2019 helena gualinga a teen indigenous activist from the ecuadorian amazon took world leaders to task at the cop 25 climate summit and accused oil companies of violating our human rights university students in india are protesting a new citizenship law that excludes muslim migrants young people are in the lead said u n secretary general antónio guterres in a statement on human rights day everywhere they are marching against corruption repression and inequality and for human rights and human dignity in 2020 youth activists will continue to speak up for the world they want to see says jessica taft a youth movement researcher and professor of latin american studies at the university of california santa cruz that kind of involvement by young people isn t new taft says but what has changed she says is that today s social media platforms make their contributions more visible to the world and to each other with their phones set to retweet they can instantly amplify movements that are half a world away a common refrain from young activists is that the failures of previous generations have left them stuck in a flawed version of the world that an older generation helped make many of the issues that they re focusing on right now are ones that they re able to claim moral authority around as young people says taft that includes topics such as climate change and gun violence which young people can address from personal experience like the students at stoneman douglas high school in parkland fla who captured the world s attention after the shooting at their school matt deitsch a graduate of the school and an organizer of the march for our lives rally in washington d c told npr in an interview in 2019 if we re not standing up and organizing ourselves then we re not doing enough to save lives in america pien huang cash will be king of aid it s an idea that has been gaining popularity for more than two decades instead of giving poor people goods and services say a cow or job training why not just give them money and let them decide how best to spend it interest in cash transfers as this form of aid is often referred to is likely to get even bigger over the coming decade says david evans a senior fellow at the washington d c think tank center for global development one reason is that researchers will increasingly be able to study the long term effects of some of the earliest large scale cash transfer programs a series of government assistance schemes that began in latin america in the late 1990s already we re starting to see the first wave of long term evaluations says evans who is on leave as a lead economist at the world bank so far the evidence suggests that poor people who received this cash aid mainly used it to meet short term needs like giving their families enough food each day rather than finding ways to lift themselves out of poverty in a permanent way but these families were also able to give their children more schooling and now that the kids are aging into the workforce it will become clear whether the extra education translates into enough additional income to vault this next generation out of poverty if so says evans that will be an exciting thing to find nurith aizenman access to college will boom more and more people are going to college access to higher education has expanded rapidly across the globe over the last five years says michael green ceo of social progress imperative and he expects it to continue in 2020 green and his organization through itssocial progress index have been tracking this every year since 2014 higher education has traditionally been concentrated in wealthy countries says green but many countries are making significant leaps both in terms of enrollment and quality and it s leading to a growing global middle class some of the biggest improvers according to their data include morocco slovakia and turkey our world in data an online publication based at oxford university also expects thenumber of people around the world with higher education degrees to increase as advanced skills become more important in both developing and developed economies the international institute for applied systems analysisprojects that this number will reach 1 billion by 2030 and 3 billion by 2100 compared with 725 million in 2015 although the improvement isn t in every country green says the rise in the global average is still a striking win joanne lu copyright 2021 npr to see more visit

how to help low income countries still comes from wealthy countries with little input from the people who receive the assistance one reason for this mindset says renzo guinto a filipino physician and a member of the lancet planetary health s editorial board is the colonial roots of tropical medicine in the colonial era european researchers studied diseases in the colonies to protect the colonizers not the people living in those places from getting sick over the past couple of years he and a growing number of global health staffers have been working to make a change they aim to give medical professionals in low income countries real leadership roles at the university level students are calling on faculty to acknowledge the field s colonial history in global health curriculum and communications managers at charitable groups are trying to portray the recipients of aid with dignity and respect in messages sent to donors and the media many of these conversations can be found on social media with the hashtags shiftthepower and decolonizeglobalhealth jennifer lentfer a communications strategist who has worked in the field for two decades says she has never seen so much excitement around decolonizing global development there are already events scheduled in 2020 to tackle the subject in the coming weeks lentfer is hosting a couple of online workshops on topics that question western motives to make a difference and help because it is our moral imperative and in january graduate students at duke university are organizing a conference called decolonizing global health 2020 there s a real question as to how to flip the leadership says lentfer and that s coming to a big head malaka gharib satellite imagery could improve global health this year expect to see more research on global health and development from a sky high point of view imagery produced by satellites is becoming more ubiquitous and inexpensive and an increasingly vital source of data on poverty disease and environmental challenges marshall burke deputy director of stanford university s center on food security and the environment is one of a growing number of researchers who are training artificial intelligence software to scan through millions of satellite images to look for clues about where these challenges exist and test solutions to them let s say you run a government agency in a low income country and want to identify the poorest 10 of villages or determine how many people live within easy reach of a medical facility or close to bodies of water that could be a source of mosquito borne diseases satellite imagery can help you answer those questions burke says in a way that s much less expensive and time consuming than traditional boots on the ground surveys cars large buildings and well tended farms can all be indications of income and population density and are easily spotted from space satellite imagery is already helping cattle herders in the sahel look for water and assisting regulators in west africa in cracking down on illegal gold mining it can help humanitarian agencies navigate in the aftermath of natural disasters in some cases it might help us peer into the future in december the world resources institute unveiled an online tool that uses satellite imagery in conjunction with other data to predict water shortages and conflicts in 2020 burke says expect to see more satellite based software tools move out of research labs and into the hands of aid agencies and policymakers and although today most of the images come from satellites owned by the u s and the european union more may soon come from satellites operated by developing countries including ethiopia s first observatory satellite launched in late december tim

india are protesting a new citizenship law that excludes muslim migrants young people are in the lead said u n secretary general antónio guterres in a statement on human rights day everywhere they are marching against corruption repression and inequality and for human rights and human dignity in 2020 youth activists will continue to speak up for the world they want to see says jessica taft a youth movement researcher and professor of latin american studies at the university of california santa cruz that kind of involvement by young people isn t new taft says but what has changed she says is that today s social media platforms make their contributions more visible to the world and to each other with their phones set to retweet they can instantly amplify movements that are half a world away a common refrain from young activists is that the failures of previous generations have left them stuck in a flawed version of the world that an older generation helped make many of the issues that they re focusing on right now are ones that they re able to claim moral authority around as young people says taft that includes topics such as climate change and gun violence which young people can address from personal experience like the students at stoneman douglas high school in parkland fla who captured the world s attention after the shooting at their school matt deitsch a graduate of

lives in america pien huang cash will be king of aid it s an idea that has been gaining popularity for more than two decades instead of giving poor people goods and services say a cow or job training why not just give them money and let them decide how best to spend it interest in cash transfers as this form of aid is often referred to is likely to get even bigger over the coming decade says david evans a senior fellow at the washington d c think tank center for global development one reason is that researchers will increasingly be able to study the long term effects of some of the earliest large scale cash transfer programs a series of government assistance schemes that began in latin america in the late 1990s already we re starting to see the first wave of long term evaluations says evans who is on leave as a lead economist at the world bank so far the evidence suggests that poor people who received this cash aid mainly used it to meet short term needs like giving their families enough food each day rather than finding ways to lift themselves out of poverty in a permanent way but these families were also able to give their children more schooling and now that the kids are aging into the workforce it will become clear whether the extra education translates into enough additional income to vault this next generation out of poverty if so says evans that will be an

predicting that 168 million people a record will need humanitarian assistance in 2020 because of extreme weather large infectious disease outbreaks and intensifying protracted conflicts across more than 50 countries that s around a million more people than were in need of assistance in 2019 and the number is expected to continue to rise up to 200 million people by 2022 the u n expects that providing this assistance in 2020 could cost up to 29 billion hot spots include burkina faso where a surge in violence by religious extremists has displaced more than half a million people the philippines where a christmas eve typhoon killed more than two dozen and venezuela where an economic collapse has resulted in the exodus of nearly 5 million people in the last five years shannon scribner associate director for humanitarian policy and programs at oxfam america says that funding to respond to these crises is not keeping pace with the need and that will continue to be a challenge scribner says another concern is an increasing number of restrictions on international ngos that make it harder to enter and operate in conflict affected areas such as syria and yemen humanitarian law isn t being upheld in some of the countries where we re working says scribner and we don t see world leaders talking about human rights the way they once did one key solution she says channel more funding to small local groups that know the terrain intimately rather than big international ngos tim mcdonnell second tier diseases will go gangbusters over the last 12 months the world made steady progress against the big infectious killers hiv malaria and tuberculosis but other illnesses some of them easily preventable stole the limelight those second tier diseases include measles and dengue which did gangbusters in the tropics cholera raged inyemen polio clawed its way back from the brink of defeat in pakistan polio cases were up more than tenfold from a low of just nine in 2018 in a cruel unintended consequence of the polio eradication effort a dozen countries that had been polio free including china angola and the philippines reported cases of vaccine derived polio in 2019 venezuela reported itsfirst yellow fever case in more than a decade as that country s health care system continues its downward spiral despite efforts to rein it in a few cases of middle east respiratory syndrome are reported each month in the middle east and that will probably continue in the coming year recent high profile measles outbreaks in the u s europe the philippines and samoa should push health officials to make sure more kids are immunized this year to prevent outbreaks the world health organization says that roughly 95 of a community needs to be vaccinated against measles more thanhalf the countries in the world including the u s at 94 haven t reached that threshold according to unicef where might there be a measles outbreak in 2020 afghanistan angola bolivia and haiti all have dismally low immunization rates below 40 but there are some signs of progress this year a newdengue vaccine might finally make a dent in the roughly 100 million cases of the disease that occur most years and the world is more prepared to deal with ebola than at any time in history two vaccines and several experimental treatments are in use all developed after the 2014 west africa outbreak the current ebola outbreak in eastern democratic republic of congo appears to say more about the dismal social conditions there than about the world s ability to battle this virus if there s an ebola outbreak outside a conflict zone in 2020 it would likely be contained and crushed quickly jason beaubien aid will become even more political it seems we re returning to the bad old days of the cold war when we used aid as a glorified payoff for friends and allies says jeremy konyndyk a senior fellow at the center for global development and former u s foreign disaster assistance chief under the obama administration instead of providing aid to improve health and foster economic development konyndyk says there s a growing mentality in the u s that aid can be used as a goody bag to incentivize foreign leaders to fall in line examples include trump s freezing andreinstatement of aid to el salvador guatemala and honduras in 2019 based on their immigration policies his threats tocut off countries that don t vote with the u s at the united nations and hiswithdrawal of aid to palestinians to pressure them to reconsider his peace plan the u k has also announced plans to merge its department for international development into its foreign office a move thatmore than 100 charities say risks politicizing u k aid these shifts by the u s and u k two of the world s largest aid donors could set the tone for a lot of aid policy around the world says konyndyk joanne lu unrest over inequality will grow 2019 was marked by angry protests over inequality around the world and according to some experts the demonstrations will grow more violent in 2020 since the 1980s income inequality has been on the rise says lucas chancel co director of the world inequality lab at the paris school of economics in the u s for example chancel says the richest 1 owned about 40 of the nation s wealth in 2016 up from 20 in the 1980s and trump s 2017 tax policies have only turbocharged inequality with the richest 400 families paying a lower average tax rate in 2018 than the poorest half of american households it is unlikely that 2020 brings anything different he says meaning inequality will deepen despite the efforts of angry protesters to stop it part of the problem is that inequality has a new face according to a new report by theunited nations development programme people are no longer just angry about income they re concerned about inequalities in political representation and power higher education access to technology and the resources to survive climate change chancel says the protests in chile france lebanon hong kong and other countries demonstrate that governments still do not seem to have grasped the reality of the situation and have yet to provide adequate solutions until they do the undp report warns the social unrest will likely continue joanne lu water taps continue to run dry in june 2019 chennai india reached day zero the day on which the city s reservoirs ran almost completely out of water by the fall seasonal rains had resupplied the city at least temporarily but the looming specter of water scarcity is certain to continue in cities around the world in 2020 in india alone 21 cities are at risk of running dry in 2020 according to a government report and an august report from the world resources institute found that a group of 17 countries that together are home to one quarter of the global population including botswana india iran and mexico are using as much or more water than they can replace upmanu lall director of the columbia water center says that while droughts linked to climate change can create water scarcity in many cases day zero events are caused more by government mismanagement of water resources i haven t seen any reasonable improvement he says so i think there will continue to be places that are stressed and at least one will pop up as a day zero this year the indian subcontinent is a prime candidate he says but on the plus side climate scientists expect 2020 to be an off year for el niño and la niña the weather patterns that occur every few years and can cause flooding in some areas and droughts in others the absence of those extremes might help stave off some instances of water scarcity either way victoria beard an urban planning professor at cornell university and world resources institute fellow says water scarcity will continue to be a problem especially in cities until governments of high risk localities pay to massively overhaul their water systems people are demanding of their leaders to see investments in basic services she says there s no self provision that s going to solve this problem in the long term there are no examples where it s a free for all and it works out well you need coordinated massive public investment tim mcdonnell gender equality is not on the horizon the u n calls gender equality a necessary foundation for a peaceful and prosperous world yet

it s the 25th anniversary of the beijing declaration and platform for action which is considered a landmark progressive blueprint for advancing women s rights the global community will be taking stock of progress and lack thereof at gatherings such as that of the u n commission on the status of women in march worldwide women continue to face disproportionate rates of discrimination and violence less access to economic and educational opportunities and exclusion from decision making roles at the community and governmental levels by one measure the world will not achieve gender equality for nearly a century the most current estimate by the world economic forum which publishes an annual report to track country by country progress across economic educational health and political dimensions is that achieving parity across all four dimensions will take an average of 99 5 years at the current rate while the wef report found that achieving parity is relatively close at hand for educational attainment which could be possible in as soon as 12 years progress toward closing the economic opportunities gap is actually backsliding by that metric parity is a lowly 57 8 and will take 257 years

how to help low income countries still comes from wealthy countries with little input from the people who receive the assistance one reason for this mindset says renzo guinto a filipino physician and a member of the lancet planetary health s editorial board is the colonial roots of tropical medicine in the colonial era european researchers studied diseases in the colonies to protect the colonizers not the people living in those places from getting sick over the past couple of years he and a growing number of global health staffers have been working to make a change they aim to give medical professionals in low income countries real leadership roles at the university level students are calling on faculty to acknowledge the field s colonial history in global health curriculum and communications managers at charitable groups are trying to portray the recipients of aid with dignity and respect in messages sent to donors and the media many of these conversations can be found on social media with the hashtags shiftthepower and decolonizeglobalhealth jennifer lentfer a communications strategist who has worked in the field for two decades says she has never seen so much excitement around decolonizing global development there are already events scheduled in 2020 to tackle the subject in the coming weeks lentfer is hosting a couple of online workshops on topics that question western motives to make a difference and help because it is our moral imperative and in january graduate students at duke university are organizing a conference called decolonizing global health 2020 there s a real question as to how to flip the leadership says lentfer and that s coming to a big head malaka gharib satellite imagery could improve global health this year expect to see more research on global health and development from a sky high point of view imagery produced by satellites is becoming more ubiquitous and inexpensive and an increasingly vital source of data on poverty disease and environmental challenges marshall burke deputy director of stanford university s center on food security and the environment is one of a growing number of researchers who are training artificial intelligence software to scan through millions of satellite images to look for clues about where these challenges exist and test solutions to them let s say you run a government agency in a low income country and want to identify the poorest 10 of villages or determine how many people live within easy reach of a medical facility or close to bodies of water that could be a source of mosquito borne diseases satellite imagery can help you answer those questions burke says in a way that s much less expensive and time consuming than traditional boots on the ground surveys cars large buildings and well tended farms can all be indications of income and population density and are easily spotted from space satellite imagery is already helping cattle herders in the sahel look for water and assisting regulators in west africa in cracking down on illegal gold mining it can help humanitarian agencies navigate in the aftermath of natural disasters in some cases it might help us peer into the future in december the world resources institute unveiled an online tool that uses satellite imagery in conjunction with other data to predict water shortages and conflicts in 2020 burke says expect to see more satellite based software tools move out of research labs and into the hands of aid agencies and policymakers and although today most of the images come from satellites owned by the u s and the european union more may soon come from satellites operated by developing countries including ethiopia s first observatory satellite launched in late december tim mcdonnell youth activists will lead the fight for a better world it s not just greta thunberg the 16 year old swedish climate activist who seized time s person of the year cover for 2019 helena gualinga a teen indigenous activist from the ecuadorian amazon took world leaders to task at the cop 25 climate summit and accused oil companies of violating our human rights university students in india are protesting a new citizenship law that excludes muslim migrants young people are in the lead said u n secretary general antónio guterres in a statement on human rights day everywhere they are marching against corruption repression and inequality and for human rights and human dignity in 2020 youth activists will continue to speak up for the world they want to see says jessica taft a youth movement researcher and professor of latin american studies at the university of california santa cruz that kind of involvement by young people isn t new taft says but what has changed she says is that today s social media platforms make their contributions more visible to the world and to each other with their phones set to retweet they can instantly amplify movements that are half a world away a common refrain from young activists is that the failures of previous generations have left them stuck in a flawed version of the world that an older generation helped make many of the issues that they re focusing on right now are ones that they re able to claim moral authority around as young people says taft that includes topics such as climate change and gun violence which young people can address from personal experience like the students at stoneman douglas high school in parkland fla who captured the world s attention after the shooting at their school matt deitsch a graduate of the school and an organizer of the march for our lives rally in washington d c told npr in an interview in 2019 if we re not standing up and organizing ourselves then we re not doing enough to save lives in america pien huang cash will be king of aid it s an idea that has been gaining popularity for more than two decades instead of giving poor people goods and services say a cow or job training why not just give them money and let them decide how best to spend it interest in cash transfers as this form of aid is often referred to is likely to get even bigger over the coming decade says david evans a senior fellow at the washington d c think tank center for global development one reason is that researchers will increasingly be able to study the long term effects of some of the earliest large scale cash transfer programs a series of government assistance schemes that began in latin america in the late 1990s already we re starting to see the first wave of long term evaluations says evans who is on leave as a lead economist at the world bank so far the evidence suggests that poor people who received this cash aid mainly used it to meet short term needs like giving their families enough food each day rather than finding ways to lift themselves out of poverty in a permanent way but these families were also able to give their children more schooling and now that the kids are aging into the workforce it will become clear whether the extra education translates into enough additional income to vault this next generation out of poverty if so says evans that will be an exciting thing to find nurith aizenman access to college will boom more and more people are going to college access to higher education has expanded rapidly across the globe over the last five years says michael green ceo of social progress imperative and he expects it to continue in 2020 green and his organization through its social progress index have been tracking this every year since 2014 higher education has traditionally been concentrated in wealthy countries says green but many countries are making significant leaps both in terms of enrollment and quality and it s leading to a growing global middle class some of the biggest improvers according to their data include morocco slovakia and turkey our world in data an online publication based at oxford university also expects the number of people around the world with higher education degrees to increase as advanced skills become more important in both developing and developed economies the international institute for applied systems analysisprojects that this number will reach 1 billion by 2030 and 3 billion by 2100 compared with 725 million in 2015 although the improvement isn t in every country green says the

we don t have a crystal ball but as journalists covering global health and development we have a pretty good nose for emerging trends with some help from our favorite expert sources some likely trends give cause for optimism signs of progress in solving the world s problems other trends are pessimistic threats and challenges that are expected to worsen in the year ahead here are 11 trend lines we ll be watching in 2020 first we ll give you the bad news then the hopeful predictions 1 of 5 global trends to watch in 2020 global trends to watch in 2020 zine by malaka gharib npr image by ben de la

watch in 2020 global trends to watch in 2020 zine by malaka gharib npr image by ben de la cruz npr grim trends a record number of people will need humanitarian assistance the united nations is predicting that 168 million people a record will need humanitarian assistance in 2020 because of extreme weather large infectious disease outbreaks and intensifying protracted conflicts across more than 50 countries that s around a million more people than were in need of assistance in 2019 and the number is expected to continue to rise up to 200 million people by 2022 the u n expects that providing this assistance in 2020 could cost up to 29 billion hot spots include burkina faso where a surge in violence by religious extremists has displaced more than half a million people the philippines where a christmas eve typhoon killed more than two dozen and venezuela where an economic collapse has resulted in the exodus of nearly 5 million people in the last five years shannon scribner associate director for humanitarian policy and programs at oxfam america says that funding to respond to these crises is not keeping pace with the need and that will continue to be a challenge scribner says another concern is an increasing number of restrictions on international ngos that make it harder to enter and operate in conflict affected areas such as syria and yemen humanitarian law isn t being upheld in some of the countries where we re working says scribner and we don t see world leaders talking about human rights the way they once did one key solution she says channel more funding to small local groups that know the terrain intimately rather than big international ngos tim mcdonnell second tier diseases will go gangbusters over the last 12 months the world made steady progress against the big infectious killers hiv malaria and tuberculosis but other illnesses some of them easily preventable stole the limelight those second tier diseases include measles and dengue which did gangbusters in the tropics cholera raged inyemen polio clawed its way back from the brink of defeat in pakistan polio cases were up more than tenfold from a low of just nine in 2018 in a cruel unintended consequence of the polio eradication effort a dozen countries that had been polio free including china angola and the philippines reported cases of vaccine derived polio in 2019 venezuela reported itsfirst yellow fever case in more than a decade as that country s health care system continues its downward spiral despite efforts to rein it in a few cases of middle east respiratory syndrome are reported each month in the middle east and that will probably continue in the coming year recent high profile measles outbreaks in the u s europe the philippines and samoa should push health officials to make sure more kids are immunized this year to prevent outbreaks the world health organization says that roughly 95 of a community needs to be vaccinated against measles more thanhalf the countries in the world including the u s at 94 haven t reached that threshold according to unicef where might there be a measles outbreak in 2020 afghanistan angola bolivia and haiti all have dismally low immunization rates below 40 but there are some signs of progress this year a newdengue vaccine might finally make a dent in the roughly 100 million cases of the disease that occur most years and the world is more prepared to deal with ebola than at any time in history two vaccines and several experimental treatments are in use all developed after the 2014 west africa outbreak the current ebola outbreak in eastern democratic republic of congo appears to say more about the dismal social conditions there than about the world s ability to battle this virus if there s an ebola outbreak outside a conflict zone in 2020 it would likely be contained and crushed quickly jason beaubien aid will become even more political it seems we re returning to the bad old days of the cold war when we used aid as a glorified payoff for friends and allies says jeremy konyndyk a senior fellow at the center for global development and former u s foreign disaster assistance chief under the obama administration instead of providing aid to improve health and foster economic development konyndyk says there s a growing mentality in the u s that aid can be used as a goody bag to incentivize foreign leaders to fall in line examples include trump s freezing andreinstatement of aid to el salvador guatemala and honduras in 2019 based on their immigration policies his threats tocut off countries that don t vote with the u s at the united nations and hiswithdrawal of aid to palestinians to pressure them to reconsider his peace plan the u k has also announced plans to merge its department for international development into its foreign office a move thatmore than 100 charities say risks politicizing u k aid these shifts by the u s and u k two of the world s largest aid donors could set the tone for a lot of aid policy around the world says konyndyk joanne lu unrest over inequality will grow 2019 was marked by angry protests over inequality around the world and according to some experts the demonstrations will grow more violent in 2020 since the 1980s income inequality has been on the rise says lucas chancel co director of the world inequality lab at the paris school of economics in the u s for example chancel says the richest 1 owned about 40 of the nation s wealth in 2016 up from 20 in the 1980s and trump s 2017 tax policies have only turbocharged inequality with the richest 400 families paying a lower average tax rate in 2018 than the poorest half of american households it is unlikely that 2020 brings anything different he says meaning inequality will deepen despite the efforts of angry protesters to stop it part of the problem is that inequality has a new face according to a new report by theunited nations development programme people are no longer just angry about income they re concerned about inequalities in political representation and power higher education access to technology and the resources to survive climate change chancel says the protests in chile france lebanon hong kong and other countries demonstrate that governments still do not seem to have grasped the reality of the situation and have yet to provide adequate solutions until they do the undp report warns the social unrest will likely continue joanne lu water taps continue to run dry in june 2019 chennai india reached day zero the day on which the city s reservoirs ran almost completely out of water by the fall seasonal rains had resupplied the city at least temporarily but the looming specter of water scarcity is certain to continue in cities around the world in 2020 in india alone 21 cities are at risk of running dry in 2020 according to a government report and an august report from the world resources institute found that a group of 17 countries that together are home to one quarter of the global population including botswana india iran and mexico are using as much or more water than they can replace upmanu lall director of the columbia water center says that while droughts linked to climate change can create water scarcity in many cases day zero events are caused more by government mismanagement of water resources i haven t seen any reasonable improvement he says so i think there will continue to be places that are stressed and at least one will pop up as a day zero this year the indian subcontinent is a prime candidate he says but on the plus side climate scientists expect 2020 to be an off year for el niño and la niña the weather patterns that occur every few years and can cause flooding in some areas and droughts in others the absence of those extremes might help stave off some instances of water scarcity either way victoria beard an urban planning professor at cornell university and world resources institute fellow says water scarcity will continue to be a problem especially in cities until governments of high risk localities pay to massively overhaul their water systems people are demanding of their leaders to see investments in basic services she says there s no self provision that s going to solve this problem in the long term there are no examples where it s a free for all and it works out well you need coordinated massive public investment tim mcdonnell gender equality is not on the horizon the u n calls gender equality a necessary foundation for a peaceful and prosperous world yet no country in the world is on track to achieve gender equality as defined by the u n s sustainable development goals by 2030 2020 will mark an important milestone in the long road to gender equality it s the 25th anniversary of the beijing declaration and platform for action which is considered a landmark progressive blueprint for advancing women s rights the global community will be taking stock of progress and lack thereof at gatherings such as that of the u n commission on the status of women in march worldwide women continue to face disproportionate rates of discrimination and violence less access to economic and educational opportunities and exclusion from decision making roles at the community and governmental levels by one measure the world will not achieve gender equality for nearly a century the most current estimate by the world economic forum which publishes an annual report to track country by country progress across economic educational health and political dimensions is that achieving parity across all four dimensions will take an average of 99 5 years at the current rate while the wef report found that achieving parity is relatively close at hand for educational attainment which could be possible in as soon as 12 years progress toward closing the economic opportunities gap is actually backsliding by that metric parity is a lowly 57 8 and will take 257 years

editor s note after a two year hiatus tom konrad s popular series 10 clean energy stocks makes a comeback in 2020 be sure you don t miss a post by subscribing to our newsletter if it s tough to follow a winner 2020 is going to be an especially tough year for my ten clean energy stocks model portfolio i ve been publishing lists of ten clean energy stocks that i think will do well in the year to come since 2008 with a 46 percent total return the 2019 list has had its best year since 2009 when it managed a 57 percent return by catching the rebound off the 2008 crash this year s returns were also achieved in the context of full to over valuation of most of the clean energy income stocks i now specialize in going international with this as background my main goal with the 2020 list is to find stocks which will be resilient in the event of a us bear market early 2019 saw bear market fears surface when the us yield curve inverted only to fade again when the inversion vanished the yield curve has inverted before every recession over the last 50 years and there has only been one yield curve inversion which did not proceed a recession in that time will we get another recession in the two years following march 2019 it is clearly too early to say investor complacency is not a predictor of a recession but it is an ingredient of bull market peaks i am not at all complacent about the prospects of the us stock market european and emerging markets have not enjoyed the same bull run the us did in 2019 so they still have some relatively good values left if you do not have much experience in trading foreign stocks i ve published some thoughts here the short version is decide how much you want to pay for the stock and use a good til cancelled limit order the article also has some notes in what the multiple ticker symbols mean for the purposes of tracking performance i will be using the stock price in the company s home market translated into dollars at current exchange rates the list returning stocks from 2019 unsurprisingly the stocks i m keeping from last year s list are those that that have not seen the biggest run up covanta holding corp cva and valeo sa fr pa vleef vleey have both been making progress implementing their business plans but have not been fully rewarded by the market the way i would expect given the massive run up in other stocks the thesis for retaining green plains partners gpp remains the same as the one for including it last year the ethanol mlp enjoys revenue guarantees from its parent green plains inc gpre despite the continuing pain the ethanol market caused in large part by the trump administration s trade war and giveaways to friends in the petroleum refining industry these guarantees should allow gpp to maintain its healthy 1 90 annual dividend if trump loses in november i expect that the stock price to produce further gains as the market anticipates a return to business as usual and an end to the trump epa s give aways to refiners new stocks for 2020 nfi group inc nfi to nfyef formerly new flyer industries is a leading manufacturer of transit buses and motor coaches new flyer was a great 10 clean energy stocks success story it appeared on the 2012 list at 5 65 gaining 54 that year it returned in 2014 for a 22 total return and in 2015 with an 80 return i dropped it from the 2016 list because it was starting to look overvalued the stock did not peak until the start of 2018 but for the last two years it has since been struggling when the stock was last in the list it was simply the leading manufacturer of heavy duty transit buses in north america now it is a leading global manufacturer of both transit buses and motor coaches its current problems do not seem permanent in nature some arose from the recent acquisition of alexander dennis and a build up of work in progress as nfi experienced some hiccups internalizing much of its parts manufacturing despite many people s unpleasant experiences with diesel buses bus transit is an inherently clean and low emission form of transport because it is an effective way to take numerous cars off the road but buses are rapidly getting greener as they have some of the best economics for electrification electric transit bus manufacturers like proterra argue that an electric bus is best designed from the ground up as electric in order to take advantage of the flexible layout possibilities that electric propulsion enables in contrast nfi takes a propulsion agnostic approach and uses third party drivetrains including diesel hybrids natural gas battery electric and fuel cell electric to meet its customers needs i see value in both approaches i think many of the large transit agencies that are considering heavy duty electric transit buses from both proterra and nfi will find comfort in the new technology when it is backed by a large traditional supplier with a large parts and service arm that they have been dealing with for years while others will prefer a bus designed from the ground up to be electric from a competitive standpoint i expect both strategies to flourish at the expense of smaller competitors without the resources to deliver credible electrified and hybrid options proterra however is not a public company nfi is and it currently trades at an attractive price with a healthy dividend like new flyer mix telematics mixt is also a blast from the past the company provides vehicle management systems and telematics systems to fleet owners their systems improve safety reduce fuel use and theft and help with regulatory compliance the company s software as a service saas platform enables it to leverage its technology platform for relatively rapid growth and high margins mix is a global company based in south africa with operations on six continents this global presence gives it an edge over its competitors in serving large multinational clients especially in transportation and resource industries mix first entered the list in 2014 at 12 17 i was too optimistic about its valuation at the time and it was the biggest loser of the year falling 45 there were nothing wrong with the company s fundamentals however and i kept it in the list in 2015 when it fell another 32 in 2016 i doubled down and it gained 51 followed by a 110 gain in 2017 closing the year 12 76 plus a few dividends i dropped it from the list in 2018 because i felt the valuation was reasonable but not as attractive as many other opportunities that year i sold most of my holdings in the mid teens which i mentioned here as the stock rose further in 2018 mixt eventually made it as high as 20 before falling back to near where it was at the end of 2017 two years later overall that would not have been that great a run except that when stocks i like fall i tend to buy more today mixt stands near where it was in late 2019 with the difference being that it has been growing its subscriber base at a little more than ten percent annually subscription revenue has been growing even faster as mix adds more products and features to its offerings there is plenty of room for this growth to continue as well only 19 commercial vehicles have a telematics solution brazilian utility companhia energetica de minas gerais a k a cemig cig is a relatively conservative pick in a very volatile stock market it is the third largest electricity generation utility and has the largest transmission and distribution utility in brazil in terms of sustainability the company s generation assets are almost all hydroelectric with a few relatively new wind farms and one fossil plant it also has a gas distribution utility in its home province of minas gerais from the perspective of risk the biggest risk of investing in cemig is investing in brazil itself the current bolsonaro administration is business friendly cemig shares saw a sharp spike in late 2018 when the current president was elected bolsonaro is not environmentally friendly however and i generally avoid holding stocks which put my financial interests at odds with my ideals in this case i am hoping that bolsonaro loses the next election in 2022 so i would not plan to hold cemig more than a couple years red eléctrica corporación s a ree mc rdeif rdeiy is the electric transmission utility for spain it also owns some transmission assets in portugal and latin america as well as some telecom assets long distance transmission and the integration of electric grids over large areas is an essential part of all plans to transition to high percentages of renewable electricity red electrica sees sustainability and renewables integration as key parts of its mission and has been making large investments in interconnections with france and spain s outlying islands as a regulated utility the company is included in the portfolio as a relatively low risk pick that pays a healthy dividend veolia environnement s a vie pa veoef veoey is a france based global company operating in the water waste and energy management although i generally prefer to invest in more focused companies an investment in veolia gives access to a number of interesting clean energy technologies which are not available as pure plays one of the most interesting to me is the production of biogas and other useful products from sewage building energy management also has great potential to cost effectively reduce waste energy use and greenhouse gas emissions the problem is that most companies do not have the in house expertise to achieve its full potential veolia has the scale and expertise to solve this problem at practically any scale they can also bring their expertise to bear to reduce energy use by understanding and influencing the behavior of building occupants through communication and education hedging and pseudo cash in line with my goal of protecting the model portfolio against a possible market downturn i settled on using puts on spdr s p oil gas exploration production etf xop as a hedge in particular my model 20 000 portfolio will include one xop january 2022 20 put contract that put gives us the right to sell 100 shares of xop for 20 each at any time before january 21 2022 as of the close of trading on december 31st these puts were trading for 253 a single contract gives control of 2 000 worth of xop which should make this holding about as volatile as the other positions in the portfolio while i plan to use the january 2022 20 put for tracking purposes really any put with a strike price between 20 and 25 expiring in january of 2021 or 2022 will do the trick puts that have higher strike prices will cost more but have a higher chance of paying off which puts that expire in 2021 will cost less but not act as a hedge for as long shorting xop and selling xop calls are also valid hedging options but keep in mind that both these strategies can potentially produce unlimited losses far greater than the size of the initial investment i generally avoid these strategies for this reason but the losses can be manageable if the hedge is a very small portion of your portfolio i currently have sold naked calls on nextera energy partners nep as a hedge against my many large yieldco holdings i am currently losing money on this hedge because all yieldcos have been going up for the past few months but my gains on other yieldcos far outweigh the losses on nep calls because the hedge is tiny compared to the other yieldco holdings the oil and gas e p sector has had several bad years and i was a little hesitant to choose an effective short position in a sector which has had such a bad run however stocks in declining industries don t necessarily have a bottom a quick look at the long term chart for the vaneck vectors coal etf kol will show you that i would have considered kol for this hedge if not for the fact that kol only has options contracts going out 6 months and so using kol should have required options trading in the middle of the year the reasons i think xop might continue to go down are stranded asset risk political risk divestment risk legal liability from past deception about climate change stranded asset risk is the risk that past investments to develop fossil fuel reserves will never see a payoff the world simply cannot burn all the oil and gas that companies count among their proven reserves and avoid catastrophic global warming i m not confident that we will avoid that but i do know that the more fossil fuels we use the more catastrophic the outcome will be since climate change fueled natural disasters are becoming a commonplace occurrence i see governments and individuals around the world starting to take swifter action to deal with the problem this takes the form of political risk when governments decide to regulate emissions increase fuel economy standards regulate oil drilling and remove existing subsidies but it can also arise when individuals worried about climate change take steps like driving less by taking actions like combining trips using mass transit and walking and biking more and ridesharing as well as by shifting to electric vehicles divestment risk is simply the risk that as more individuals and institutions adopt policies of not investing in fossil fuel companies the stock prices will fall simply because of a lack of buyers as i wrote in september 2014 in divesting the last one out loses anyone who read that article back then could have sold xop for over 70 a share as opposed to 23 today but there are still more people who can sell legal liability arises from big oil companies long term deception about climate change right now there are a large number of state lawsuits alleging that big oil companies knew about the risks of climate change but deceived the public and investors about the risks none of these lawsuits has a giant chance of succeeding but it only takes one if a single such lawsuit succeeds it will open the floodgates to every state and municipality which has seen some negative effect of climate change to file additional lawsuits i don t know when or even if it will happen but big oil could be on the verge of its big tobacco moment the reason i chose to use puts is because shorting is always risky even with all the risks above there could still be a short term oil price spike in 2020 which sends all oil stocks gushing upward buy buying a single put we are limiting the risk to the option premium yieldco pattern energy group pegi is currently in the process of being bought out by the canada pension plan investment board for 26 75 per share the transaction is expected to close before june 30 2020 and the company will continue to pay its quarterly dividend of 0 422 per share until it closes i m including pattern in this list mainly because i think of it as a good place to park cash for 4 6 months as insurance against a market downturn compared to a bank cd there is a small risk that the transaction will not go through in which case the stock might fall 10 or so in the short term the upside is that readers who buy at or below the 26 75 will collect a 0 422 1 57 dividend for holding the stock for 4 6 months approximately double the return available from comparable cds there is further upside from the chance that the buyout is delayed until after june 30 and holders collect a second 0 422 dividend this is also unlikely but considerably more probable than the merger falling through i suggest readers who do not still own pattern from 2019 and previous years buy pegi using limit orders at the buyout price 26 75 or better if the price rises and your trade does not execute just keep the money in cash i will have a new stock pick to replace pegi after the deal is complete for the purposes of tracking the portfolio i will be considering the 2000 which i would have allocated to pegi to be held as cash unless or until the stock trades at 26 75 or below in 2020 excess cash from the 2000 position allocated to xop will also be allocated to pegi if it trades at or below 26 75 in 2020 all of this money will be allocated to one or two new or existing positions chosen after the pegi sale completes bonus pick polaris infrastructure inc pif to rampf is a tiny geothermal and run of river hydropower yieldco build around the assets of ram power long time readers may recall ram power as a bonus speculative pick from the 2014 list like most speculations that particular gamble did not pay off and the company went into bankruptcy after repeated drilling failed to stabilize electricity production at its main geothermal asset san jacinto tizate in nicaragua even after extensive additional drilling unable to meet its debt obligations with the lower than expected electricity revenues the bondholders ended up owning the company and they re listed it without its former heavy debt burden and a healthy dividend in 2015 in early december i had hoped to include polaris in the list but the stock price ran up over 10 in the last two weeks of the year while its yield is very attractive compared to other yieldcos its small size and continued need for additional drilling at san jacinto tizate to offset natural production declines make me cautious about buying this company at anything but rock bottom prices nevertheless it is one to watch and if the price falls back in 2020 it s a leading candidate to replace pegi when the buyout is complete portfolio for the first time this year i plan to track the model portfolio based on an initial 20 000 investment using actual share numbers and cash in the past i have assumed that dividends would be re invested in each position this year i will track them as cash and only re invest if i see an attractive opportunity i will track foreign stocks using their stock prices in their home markets with values translated into us dollars at current exchange rates using the five letter foreign stock ticker readers should note that stock price quotes for these tickers are often stale and so they will likely vary slightly from my calculated prices readers who are using adrs rather than foreign stocks in their own portfolios should use 2 shares of vleey and rdeiy in place of one share of vleef or rdeif because of the adr multipliers in contrast shares of veoey and veoef have equal value see my recent article on trading foreign stocks and options for more details i will track the price of the xop put option using the midpoint of the bid and the ask at market close rather than the most trade which could be hours or even days old and so may not reflect recent price movements in the underlying etf xop as i have for the last few years i will continue to use global x yieldco renewable energy income

i have been preparing for a large market correction for more than half of 2019 and the us stock market has continued to advance unstoppably valuations seem extremely stretched the political climate could not be more volatile and the federal reserve has indicated that they do not intend to keep lowering interest rates with this backdrop it should not take much to send the stock market into a tailspin on the other hand my friend jan schalkwijk cfa of jps global investments an advertiser on this website recently reminded me that most bull markets end in euphoria when there is no one left to get excited about the stock market that is hardly the situation today and i am hardly the only voice of caution among stock market pundits i also have a track record of being too early i often get out of bull markets long before they peak and start buying declining stocks long before they bottom so i m far from confident that the bear i expect will appear soon or even in 2020 but when it comes to bear markets it s better to get out too soon than too late ten clean energy stocks for 2020 is probably the most diversified and defensive model portfolio in the series since i started it in 2008 yet with my worries about the coming year i will not be surprised if the portfolio ends 2020 lower than it begins the year let s hope that does not happen but if it does the model portfolio should decline

predicting that 168 million people a record will need humanitarian assistance in 2020 because of extreme weather large infectious disease outbreaks and intensifying protracted conflicts across more than 50 countries that s around a million more people than were in need of assistance in 2019 and the number is expected to continue to rise up to 200 million people by 2022 the u n expects that providing this assistance in 2020 could cost up to 29 billion hot spots include burkina faso where a surge in violence by religious extremists has displaced more than half a million people the philippines where a christmas eve typhoon killed more than two dozen and venezuela where an economic collapse has resulted in the exodus of nearly 5 million people in the last five years shannon scribner associate director for humanitarian policy and programs at oxfam america says that funding to respond to these crises is not keeping pace with the need and that will continue to be a challenge scribner says another concern is an increasing number of restrictions on international ngos that make it harder to enter and operate in conflict affected areas such as syria and yemen humanitarian law isn t being upheld in some of the countries where we re working says scribner and we don t see world leaders talking about human rights the way they once did one key solution she says channel more funding to small local groups that know the terrain intimately rather than big international ngos tim mcdonnell second tier diseases will go gangbusters over the last 12 months the world made steady progress against the big infectious killers hiv malaria and tuberculosis but other illnesses some of them easily preventable stole the limelight those second tier diseases include measles and dengue which did gangbusters in the tropics cholera raged inyemen polio clawed its way back from the brink of defeat in pakistan polio cases were up more than tenfold from a low of just nine in 2018 in a cruel unintended consequence of the polio eradication effort a dozen countries that had been polio free including china angola and the philippines reported cases of vaccine derived polio in 2019 venezuela reported itsfirst yellow fever case in more than a decade as that country s health care system continues its downward spiral despite efforts to rein it in a few cases of middle east respiratory syndrome are reported each month in the middle east and that will probably continue in the coming year recent high profile measles outbreaks in the u s europe the philippines and samoa should push health officials to make sure more kids are immunized this year to prevent outbreaks the world health organization says that roughly 95 of a community needs to be vaccinated against measles more thanhalf the countries in the world including the u s at 94 haven t reached that threshold according to unicef where might there be a measles outbreak in 2020 afghanistan angola bolivia and haiti all have dismally low immunization rates below 40 but there are some signs of progress this year a newdengue vaccine might finally make a dent in the roughly 100 million cases of the disease that occur most years and the world is more prepared to deal with ebola than at any time in history two vaccines and several experimental treatments are in use all developed after the 2014 west africa outbreak the current ebola outbreak in eastern democratic republic of congo appears to say more about the dismal social conditions there than about the world s ability to battle this virus if there s an ebola outbreak outside a conflict zone in 2020 it would likely be contained and crushed quickly jason beaubien aid will become even more political it seems we re returning to the bad old days of the cold war when we used aid as a glorified payoff for friends and allies says jeremy konyndyk a senior fellow at the center for global development and former u s foreign disaster assistance chief under the obama administration instead of providing aid to improve health and foster economic development konyndyk says there s a growing mentality in the u s that aid can be used as a goody bag to incentivize foreign leaders to fall in line examples include trump s freezing andreinstatement of aid to el salvador guatemala and honduras in 2019 based on their immigration policies his threats tocut off countries that don t vote with the u s at the united nations and hiswithdrawal of aid to palestinians to pressure them to reconsider his peace plan the u k has also announced plans to merge its department for international development into its foreign office a move thatmore than 100 charities say risks politicizing u k aid these shifts by the u s and u k two of the world s largest aid donors could set the tone for a lot of aid policy around the world says konyndyk joanne lu unrest over inequality will grow 2019 was marked by angry protests over inequality around the world and according to some experts the demonstrations will grow more violent in 2020 since the 1980s income inequality has been on the rise says lucas chancel co director of the world inequality lab at the paris school of economics in the u s for example chancel says the richest 1 owned about 40 of the nation s wealth in 2016 up from 20 in the 1980s and trump s 2017 tax policies have only turbocharged inequality with the richest 400 families paying a lower average tax rate in 2018 than the poorest half of american households it is unlikely that 2020 brings anything different he says meaning inequality will deepen despite the efforts of angry protesters to stop it part of the problem is that inequality has a new face according to a new report by theunited nations development programme people are no longer just angry about income they re concerned about inequalities in political representation and power higher education access to technology and the resources to survive climate change chancel says the protests in chile france lebanon hong kong and other countries demonstrate that governments still do not seem to have grasped the reality of the situation and have yet to provide adequate solutions until they do the undp report warns the social unrest will likely continue joanne lu water taps continue to run dry in june 2019 chennai india reached day zero the day on which the city s reservoirs ran almost completely out of water by the fall seasonal rains had resupplied the city at least temporarily but the looming specter of water scarcity is certain to continue in cities around the world in 2020 in india alone 21 cities are at risk of running dry in 2020 according to a government report and an august report from the world resources institute found that a group of 17 countries that together are home to one quarter of the global population including botswana india iran and mexico are using as much or more water than they can replace upmanu lall director of the columbia water center says that while droughts linked to climate change can create water scarcity in many cases day zero events are caused more by government mismanagement of water resources i haven t seen any reasonable improvement he says so i think there will continue to be places that are stressed and at least one will pop up as a day zero this year the indian subcontinent is a prime candidate he says but on the plus side climate scientists expect 2020 to be an off year for el niño and la niña the weather patterns that occur every few years and can cause flooding in some areas and droughts in others the absence of those extremes might help stave off some instances of water scarcity either way victoria beard an urban planning professor at cornell university and world resources institute fellow says water scarcity will continue to be a problem especially in cities until governments of high risk localities pay to massively overhaul their water systems people are demanding of their leaders to see investments in basic services she says there s no self provision that s going to solve this problem in the long term there are no examples where it s a free for all and it works out well you need coordinated massive public investment tim mcdonnell gender equality is not on the horizon the u n calls gender equality a necessary foundation for a peaceful and prosperous world yet no country in the world is on track to achieve gender equality as defined by the u n s sustainable development goals by 2030 2020 will mark an important milestone in the long road to gender equality it s the 25th anniversary of the beijing declaration and platform for action which is considered a landmark progressive blueprint for advancing women s rights the global community will be taking stock of progress and lack thereof at gatherings such as that of the u n commission on the status of women in march worldwide women continue to face disproportionate rates of discrimination and violence less access to economic and educational opportunities and exclusion from decision making roles at the community and governmental levels by one measure the world will not achieve gender equality for nearly a century the most current estimate by the world economic forum which publishes an annual report to track country by country progress across economic educational health and political dimensions is that achieving parity across all four dimensions will take an average of 99 5 years at the current rate while the wef report found that achieving parity is relatively close at hand for educational attainment which could be possible in as soon as 12 years progress toward closing the economic opportunities gap is actually backsliding by that metric parity is a lowly 57 8 and will take 257 years to overcome emily vaughn hopeful trends global health will get woke this year expect more people in the global health and development community to address the injustices and inequities that can be traced to the era when western countries colonized poor countries stripping them of resources and autonomy people who work in the field know that much of the money influence and decision making about how to help low income countries still comes from wealthy countries with little input from the people who receive the assistance one reason for this mindset says renzo guinto a filipino physician and a member of the lancet planetary health s editorial board is the colonial roots of tropical medicine in the colonial era european researchers studied diseases in the colonies to protect the colonizers not the people living in those places from getting sick over the past couple of years he and a growing number of global health staffers have been working to make a change they aim to give medical professionals in low income countries real leadership roles at the university level students are calling on faculty to acknowledge the field s colonial history in global health curriculum and communications managers at charitable groups are trying to portray the recipients of aid with dignity and respect in messages sent to donors and the media many of these conversations can be found on social media with the hashtags shiftthepower and decolonizeglobalhealth jennifer lentfer a communications strategist who has worked in the field for two decades says she has never seen so much excitement around decolonizing global development there are already events scheduled in 2020 to tackle the subject in the coming weeks lentfer is hosting a couple of online workshops on topics that question western motives to make a difference and help because it is our moral imperative and in january graduate students at duke university are organizing a conference called decolonizing global health 2020 there s a real question as to how to flip the leadership says lentfer and that s coming to a big head malaka gharib satellite imagery could improve global health this year expect to see more research on global health and development from a sky high point of view imagery produced by satellites is becoming more ubiquitous and inexpensive and an increasingly vital source of data on poverty disease and environmental challenges marshall burke deputy director of stanford university s center on food security and the environment is one of a growing number of researchers who are training artificial intelligence software to scan through millions of satellite images to look for clues about where these challenges exist and test solutions to them let s say you run a government agency in a low income country and want to identify the poorest 10 of villages or determine how many people live within easy reach of a medical facility or close to bodies of water that could be a source of mosquito borne diseases satellite imagery can help you answer those questions burke says in a way that s much less expensive and time consuming than traditional boots on the ground surveys cars large buildings and well tended farms can all be indications of income and population density and are easily spotted from space satellite imagery is already helping cattle herders in the sahel look for water and assisting regulators in west africa in cracking down on illegal gold mining it can help humanitarian agencies navigate in the aftermath of natural disasters in some cases it might help us peer into the future in december the world resources institute unveiled an online tool that uses satellite imagery in conjunction with other data to predict water shortages and conflicts in 2020 burke says expect to see more satellite based software tools move out of research labs and into the hands of aid agencies and policymakers and although today most of the images come from satellites owned by the u s and the european union more may soon come from satellites operated by developing countries including ethiopia s first observatory satellite launched in late december tim mcdonnell youth activists will lead the fight for a better world it s not just greta thunberg the 16 year old swedish climate activist who seized time s person of the year cover for 2019 helena gualinga a teen indigenous activist from the ecuadorian amazon took world leaders to task at the cop 25 climate summit and accused oil companies of violating our human rights university students in india are protesting a new citizenship law that excludes muslim migrants young people are in the lead said u n secretary general antónio guterres in a statement on human rights day everywhere they are marching against corruption repression and inequality and for human rights and human dignity in 2020 youth activists will continue to speak up for the world they want to see says jessica taft a youth movement researcher and professor of latin american studies at the university of california santa cruz that kind of involvement by young people isn t new taft says but what has changed she says is that today s social media platforms make their contributions more visible to the world and to each other with their phones set to retweet they can instantly amplify movements that are half a world away a common refrain from young activists is that the failures of previous generations have left them stuck in a flawed version of the world that an older generation helped make many of the issues that they re focusing on right now are ones that they re able to claim moral authority around as young people says taft that includes topics such as climate change and gun violence which young people can address from personal experience like the students at stoneman douglas high school in parkland fla who captured the world s attention after the shooting at their school matt deitsch a graduate of the school and an organizer of the march for our lives rally in washington d c told npr in an interview in 2019 if we re not standing up and organizing ourselves then we re not doing enough to save lives in america pien huang cash will be king of aid it s an idea that has been gaining popularity for more than two decades instead of giving poor people goods and services say a cow or job training why not just give them money and let them decide how best to spend it interest in cash transfers as this form of aid is often referred to is likely to get even bigger over the coming decade says david evans a senior fellow at the washington d c think tank center for global development one reason is that researchers will increasingly be able to study the long term effects of some of the earliest large scale cash transfer programs a series of government assistance schemes that began in latin america in the late 1990s already we re starting to see the first wave of long term evaluations says evans who is on leave as a lead economist at the world bank so far the evidence suggests that poor people who received this cash aid mainly used it to meet short term needs like giving their families enough food each day rather than finding ways to lift themselves out of poverty in a permanent way but these families were also able to give their children more schooling and now that the kids are aging into the workforce it will become clear whether the extra education translates into enough additional income to vault this next generation out of poverty if so says evans that will be an exciting thing to find nurith aizenman access to college will boom more and more people are going to college access to higher education has expanded rapidly across the globe over the last five years says michael green ceo of social progress imperative and he expects it to continue in 2020 green and his organization through itssocial progress index have been tracking this every year since 2014 higher education has traditionally been concentrated in wealthy countries says green but many countries are making significant leaps both in terms of enrollment and quality and it s leading to a growing global middle class some of the biggest improvers according to their data include morocco slovakia and turkey our world in data an online publication based at oxford university also expects thenumber of people around the world with higher education degrees to increase as advanced skills become more important in both developing and developed economies the international institute for applied systems analysisprojects that this number will reach 1 billion by 2030 and 3 billion by 2100 compared with 725 million in 2015 although the improvement isn t in every country green says the

in cities around the world in 2020 in india alone 21 cities are at risk of running dry in 2020 according to a government report and an august report from the world resources institute found that a

of the columbia water center says that while droughts linked to climate change can create water scarcity in many cases day zero events are caused more by government mismanagement of water resources i

their leaders to see investments in basic services she says there s no self provision that s going to solve this problem in the long term there are no examples where it s a free for all and it works out well you need coordinated massive public investment tim mcdonnell gender equality is not on the horizon the u n calls gender equality a necessary foundation for a peaceful and prosperous world yet no country in the world is on track to achieve gender equality as defined by the u n s sustainable development goals by 2030 2020 will mark an important milestone in the long road to gender equality it s the 25th anniversary of the beijing declaration and platform for action which is considered a landmark progressive blueprint for advancing women s rights the global community will be taking stock of progress and lack thereof at gatherings such as that of the u n commission on the status of women in march worldwide women continue to face disproportionate rates of discrimination and violence less access to economic and educational opportunities and exclusion from decision making roles at the community and governmental levels by one measure the world will not achieve gender equality for nearly a century the most current estimate by the world economic forum which publishes an annual report to track country by country progress across economic educational health and political dimensions is that achieving parity across all four dimensions will take an average of 99 5 years at the current rate while the wef report found that achieving parity is relatively close at hand for educational attainment which could be possible in as soon as 12 years progress toward closing the economic opportunities gap is actually backsliding by that metric parity is a lowly 57 8 and will take 257 years to overcome emily vaughn hopeful trends global health will get woke this year expect more people in the global health and development community to address the injustices and inequities that can be traced to the era when western countries colonized poor countries stripping them of resources and autonomy people who work in the field know that much of the money influence and decision making about how to help low income countries still comes from wealthy countries with little input from the people who receive the assistance one reason for this mindset says renzo guinto a filipino physician and a member of the lancet planetary health s editorial board is the colonial roots of tropical medicine in the colonial era european researchers studied diseases in the colonies to protect the colonizers not the people living in those places from getting sick over the past couple of years he and a growing number of global health staffers have been working to make a change they aim to give medical professionals in low income countries real leadership roles at the university level students are calling on faculty to acknowledge the field s colonial history in global health curriculum and

social media with the hashtags shiftthepower and decolonizeglobalhealth jennifer lentfer a communications strategist who has worked in the field for two decades says she has never seen so much excitement around decolonizing global development there are already events scheduled in 2020 to tackle the subject in the coming weeks lentfer is hosting a couple of online workshops on topics that question western motives to make a difference and help because it is our moral imperative and in january graduate students at duke university are organizing a conference called decolonizing global

more research on global health and development from a sky high point of view imagery produced by satellites is becoming more ubiquitous and inexpensive and an increasingly vital source of data on poverty disease and environmental challenges marshall burke deputy director of stanford university s center on food security and the environment is one of a growing number of researchers who are training artificial intelligence software to scan through millions of satellite images to look for clues about where these challenges exist and test solutions to them let s say you run a government agency in a low income country and want to identify the poorest 10 of villages or determine how many people live within easy reach of a medical facility or close to bodies of water that could be a source of mosquito borne diseases satellite imagery can help you answer those questions burke says in a way that s much less expensive and time consuming than traditional boots on the ground surveys cars large buildings and well tended farms can all be indications of income and population density and are easily spotted from space satellite imagery is already helping cattle herders in the sahel look for water and assisting regulators in west africa in cracking down on illegal gold mining it can help humanitarian agencies navigate in the aftermath of natural disasters in some cases it might help us peer into the future in december the world resources institute unveiled an online tool that uses satellite imagery in conjunction with other data to predict water shortages and conflicts in 2020 burke says expect to see more satellite based software tools move out of research labs and into the hands of aid agencies and policymakers and although today most of the images come from satellites owned by the u s and the european union more may soon come from satellites operated by developing countries including ethiopia s first observatory satellite launched in late december tim

marching against corruption repression and inequality and for human rights and human dignity in 2020 youth activists will continue to speak up for the world they want to see says jessica taft a youth movement researcher and professor of latin american studies at the university of california santa cruz that kind of involvement by young people isn t new taft says but what has changed she says is that today s social media platforms make their contributions more visible to the world and to each other with their phones set to retweet they can instantly amplify movements that are half a world away a common refrain from young activists is that the failures of previous generations have left them stuck in a flawed version of the world that an older generation helped make many of the issues that they re focusing on right now are ones that they re able to claim moral authority around as young people says taft that includes topics such as climate change and gun violence which young people can address from personal experience like the students at stoneman douglas high school in parkland fla who captured the world s attention after the shooting at their school matt deitsch a graduate of

why not just give them money and let them decide how best to spend it interest in cash transfers as this form of aid is often referred to is likely to get even bigger over the coming decade says david evans a senior fellow at the washington d c think tank center for global development one reason is that researchers will increasingly be able to study the long term effects of some of the earliest large scale cash transfer programs a series of government assistance schemes that began in latin america in the late 1990s already we re starting to see the first wave of long term evaluations says evans who is on leave as a lead economist at the world bank so far the evidence suggests that poor people who received this cash aid mainly used it to meet short term needs like giving their families enough food each day rather than finding ways to lift themselves out of poverty in a permanent way but these families were also able to give their children more schooling and now that the kids are aging into the workforce it will become clear whether the extra education translates into enough additional income to vault this next generation out of poverty if so says evans that will be an

predicting that 168 million people a record will need humanitarian assistance in 2020 because of extreme weather large infectious disease outbreaks and intensifying protracted conflicts across more than 50 countries that s around a million more people than were in need of assistance in 2019 and the number is expected to continue to rise up to 200 million people by 2022 the u n expects that providing this assistance in 2020 could cost up to 29 billion hot spots include burkina faso where a surge in violence by religious extremists has displaced more than half a million people the philippines where a christmas eve typhoon killed more than two dozen and venezuela where an economic collapse has resulted in the exodus of nearly 5 million people in the last five years shannon scribner associate director for humanitarian policy and programs at oxfam america says that funding to respond to these crises is not keeping pace with the need and that will continue to be a challenge scribner says another concern is an increasing number of restrictions on international ngos that make it harder to enter and operate in conflict affected areas such as syria and yemen humanitarian law isn t being upheld in some of the countries where we re working says scribner and we don t see world leaders talking about human rights the way they once did one key solution she says channel more funding to small local groups that know the terrain intimately rather than big international ngos tim mcdonnell second tier diseases will go gangbusters over the last 12 months the world made steady progress against the big infectious killers hiv malaria and tuberculosis but other illnesses some of them easily preventable stole the limelight those second tier diseases include measles and dengue which did gangbusters in the tropics cholera raged inyemen polio clawed its way back from the brink of defeat in pakistan polio cases were up more than tenfold from a low of just nine in 2018 in a cruel unintended consequence of the polio eradication effort a dozen countries that had been polio free including china angola and the philippines reported cases of vaccine derived polio in 2019 venezuela reported itsfirst yellow fever case in more than a decade as that country s health care system continues its downward spiral despite efforts to rein it in a few cases of middle east respiratory syndrome are reported each month in the middle east and that will probably continue in the coming year recent high profile measles outbreaks in the u s europe the philippines and samoa should push health officials to make sure more kids are immunized this year to prevent outbreaks the world health organization says that roughly 95 of a community needs to be vaccinated against measles more thanhalf the countries in the world including the u s at 94 haven t reached that threshold according to unicef where might there be a measles outbreak in 2020 afghanistan angola bolivia and haiti all have dismally low immunization rates below 40 but there are some signs of progress this year a newdengue vaccine might finally make a dent in the roughly 100 million cases of the disease that occur most years and the world is more prepared to deal with ebola than at any time in history two vaccines and several experimental treatments are in use all developed after the 2014 west africa outbreak the current ebola outbreak in eastern democratic republic of congo appears to say more about the dismal social conditions there than about the world s ability to battle this virus if there s an ebola outbreak outside a conflict zone in 2020 it would likely be contained and crushed quickly jason beaubien aid will become even more political it seems we re returning to the bad old days of the cold war when we used aid as a glorified payoff for friends and allies says jeremy konyndyk a senior fellow at the center for global development and former u s foreign disaster assistance chief under the obama administration instead of providing aid to improve health and foster economic development konyndyk says there s a growing mentality in the u s that aid can be used as a goody bag to incentivize foreign leaders to fall in line examples include trump s freezing andreinstatement of aid to el salvador guatemala and honduras in 2019 based on their immigration policies his threats tocut off countries that don t vote with the u s at the united nations and hiswithdrawal of aid to palestinians to pressure them to reconsider his peace plan the u k has also announced plans to merge

according to some experts the demonstrations will grow more violent in 2020 since the 1980s income inequality has been on the rise says lucas chancel co director of the world inequality lab at the paris school of economics in the u s for example chancel says the richest 1 owned about 40 of the nation s wealth in 2016 up from 20 in the 1980s and trump s 2017 tax policies have only turbocharged inequality with the richest 400 families paying a lower average tax rate in 2018 than the poorest half of american households it is unlikely that 2020 brings anything different he says meaning inequality will deepen despite the efforts of angry protesters to stop it part of the problem is that inequality has a new face according to a new report by theunited nations development programme people are no longer just angry about income they re concerned about inequalities in political representation and power higher education access to technology and the resources to survive climate change chancel says the protests in chile france lebanon hong kong and other countries demonstrate that governments still do not seem to have grasped the reality of the situation and have yet to

in cities around the world in 2020 in india alone 21 cities are at risk of running dry in 2020 according to a government report and an august report from the world resources institute found that a group of 17 countries that together are home to one quarter of the global population including botswana india iran and mexico are using as much or more water than they can replace upmanu lall director of the columbia water center says that while droughts linked to climate change can create water scarcity in many cases day zero events are caused more by government mismanagement of water resources i haven t seen any reasonable improvement he says so i think there will continue to be places that are stressed and at least one will pop up as a day zero this year the indian subcontinent is a prime candidate he says but on the plus side climate scientists expect 2020 to be an off year for el niño and la niña the weather patterns that occur every few years and can cause flooding in some areas and droughts in others the absence of those extremes might help stave off some instances of water scarcity either way victoria beard an urban planning professor at cornell university and world resources institute fellow says water scarcity will continue to be a problem especially in cities until governments of high risk localities pay to massively overhaul their water systems people are demanding of their leaders to see investments in basic services she says there s no self provision that s going to solve this problem in the long term there are no examples where it s a free for all and it works out well you need coordinated massive public investment tim mcdonnell gender equality is not on the horizon the u n calls gender equality a necessary foundation for a peaceful and prosperous world yet no country in the world is on track to achieve gender equality as defined by the u n s sustainable development goals by 2030 2020 will mark an important milestone in the long road to gender equality it s the 25th anniversary of the beijing declaration and platform for action which is considered a landmark progressive blueprint for advancing women s rights the global community will be taking stock of progress and lack thereof at gatherings such as that of the u n commission on the status of women in march worldwide women continue to face disproportionate rates of discrimination and violence less access to economic and educational opportunities and exclusion from decision making roles at the community and governmental levels by one measure the world will not achieve gender equality for nearly a century the most current estimate by the world economic forum which publishes an annual report to track country by country progress across economic educational health and political dimensions is that achieving parity across all four dimensions will take an average of 99 5 years at the current rate while the wef report found that achieving parity is relatively close at hand for educational attainment which could be possible in as soon as 12 years progress toward closing the economic opportunities gap is actually backsliding by that metric parity is a lowly 57 8 and will take 257 years to overcome emily vaughn hopeful trends global health will get woke this year expect more people in the global health and development community to address the injustices and inequities that can be traced to the era when western countries colonized poor countries stripping them of resources and autonomy people who work in the field know that much of the money influence and decision making about how to help low income countries still comes from wealthy countries with little input from the people who receive the assistance one reason for this mindset says renzo guinto a filipino physician and a member of the lancet planetary health s editorial board is the colonial roots of tropical medicine in the colonial era european researchers studied diseases in the colonies to protect the colonizers not the people living in those places from getting sick over the past couple of years he and a growing number of global health staffers have been working to make a change they aim to give medical professionals in low income countries real leadership roles at the university level students are calling on faculty to acknowledge the field s colonial history in global health curriculum and communications managers at charitable groups are trying to portray the recipients of aid with dignity and respect in messages sent to donors and the media many of these conversations can be found on social media with the hashtags shiftthepower and decolonizeglobalhealth jennifer lentfer a communications strategist who has worked in the field for two decades says she has never seen so much excitement around decolonizing global development there are already events scheduled in 2020 to tackle the subject in the coming weeks lentfer is hosting a couple of online workshops on topics that question western motives to make a difference and help because it is our moral imperative and in january graduate students at duke university are organizing a conference called decolonizing global health 2020 there s a real question as to how to flip the leadership says lentfer and that s coming to a big head malaka gharib satellite imagery could improve global health this year expect to see more research on global health and development from a sky high point of view imagery produced by satellites is becoming more ubiquitous and inexpensive and an increasingly vital source of data on poverty disease and environmental challenges marshall burke deputy director of stanford university s center on food security and the environment is one of a growing number of researchers who are training artificial intelligence software to scan through millions of satellite images to look for clues about where these challenges exist and test solutions to them let s say you run a government agency in a low income country and want to identify the poorest 10 of villages or determine how many people live within easy reach of a medical facility or close to bodies of water that could be a source of mosquito borne diseases satellite imagery can help you answer those questions burke says in a way that s much less expensive and time consuming than traditional boots on the ground surveys cars large buildings and well tended farms can all be indications of income and population density and are easily spotted from space satellite imagery is already helping cattle herders in the sahel look for water and assisting regulators in west africa in cracking down on illegal gold mining it can help humanitarian agencies navigate in the aftermath of natural disasters in some cases it might help us peer into the future in december the world resources institute unveiled an online tool that uses satellite imagery in conjunction with other data to predict water shortages and conflicts in 2020 burke says expect to see more satellite based software tools move out of research labs and into the hands of aid agencies and policymakers and although today most of the images come from satellites owned by the u s and the european union more may soon come from satellites operated by developing countries including ethiopia s first observatory satellite launched in late december tim mcdonnell youth activists will lead the fight for a better world it s not just greta thunberg the 16 year old swedish climate activist who seized time s person of the year cover for 2019 helena gualinga a teen indigenous activist from the ecuadorian amazon took world leaders to task at the cop 25 climate summit and accused oil companies of violating our human rights university students in india are protesting a new citizenship law that excludes muslim migrants young people are in the lead said u n secretary general antónio guterres in a statement on human rights day everywhere they are marching against corruption repression and inequality and for human rights and human dignity in 2020 youth activists will continue to speak up for the world they want to see says jessica taft a youth movement researcher and professor of latin american studies at the university of california santa cruz that kind of involvement by young people isn t new taft says but what has changed she says is that today s social media platforms make their contributions more visible to the world and to each other with their phones set to retweet they can instantly amplify movements that are half a world away a common refrain from young activists is that the failures of previous generations have left them stuck in a flawed version of the world that an older generation helped make many of the issues that they re focusing on right now are ones that they re able to claim moral authority around as young people says taft that includes topics such as climate change and gun violence which young people can address from personal experience like the students at stoneman douglas high school in parkland fla who captured the world s attention after the shooting at their school matt deitsch a graduate of the school and an organizer of the march for our lives rally in washington d c told npr in an interview in 2019 if we re not standing up and organizing ourselves then we re not doing enough to save lives in america pien huang cash will be king of aid it s an idea that has been gaining popularity for more than two decades instead of giving poor people goods and services say a cow or job training why not just give them money and let them decide how best to spend it interest in cash transfers as this form of aid is often referred to is likely to get even bigger over the coming decade says david evans a senior fellow at the washington d c think tank center for global development one reason is that researchers will increasingly be able to study the long term effects of some of the earliest large scale cash transfer programs a series of government assistance schemes that began in latin america in the late 1990s already we re starting to see the first wave of long term evaluations says evans who is on leave as a lead economist at the world bank so far the evidence suggests that poor people who received this cash aid mainly used it to meet short term needs like giving their families enough food each day rather than finding ways to lift themselves out of poverty in a permanent way but these families were also able to give their children more schooling and now that the kids are aging into the workforce it will become clear whether the extra education translates into enough additional income to vault this next generation out of poverty if so says evans that will be an exciting thing to find nurith aizenman access to college will boom more and more people are going to college access to higher education has expanded rapidly across the globe over the last five years says michael green ceo of social progress imperative and he expects it to continue in 2020 green and his organization through itssocial progress index have been tracking this every year since 2014 higher education has traditionally been concentrated in wealthy countries says green but many countries are making significant leaps both in terms of enrollment and quality and it s leading to a growing global middle class some of the biggest improvers according to their data include morocco slovakia and turkey our world in data an online publication based at oxford university also expects thenumber of people around the world with higher education degrees to increase as advanced skills become more important in both developing and developed economies the international institute for

china s central bank decided on wednesday to inject more than 800 billion yuan 115 billion into the financial sector by reducing the amount of cash financial institutions must keep in reserve the move is designed to maintain reasonably ample liquidity and lower financing costs for the real economy the reserve ratio requirement for most financial institutions will be reduced by 0 5 percentage point on monday the people s bank of china the central bank said in a statement after this cut the reserve ratio will be in a range of 6 percent to 12 5 percent with the largest banks at the higher end the central bank has cut the reserve ratio eight times since early 2018 to spur economic growth the latest move should not be seen as a change in prudent monetary policy and it is not a flood irrigation type of easing according to the central bank the monetary authority is asking commercial banks to use the 115 billion fund to increase financial support for small micro and private companies small and medium sized commercial banks whose main business is lending to small enterprises may receive more than 120 billion yuan from the reserve cut according to estimates by economists experts in the financial sector predicted the capital injection several days ago as the monetary authority usually takes measures to hedge against potential liquidity shortages before chinese lunar new year which falls on jan 25 this year lou feipeng a senior economist at postal savings bank of china said the first reserve ratio cut in 2020 aims to reduce social financing costs by providing capital for the early issuance of local government bonds that will strengthen infrastructure construction as the cut was made at the start of the year commercial banks are able to lend more to companies and receive profits earlier the reserve ratio cut is a countercyclical measure to stabilize growth and a reflection of the flexibility of monetary policy lou said before the announcement central bank advisers achieved a consensus in the most recent central bank monetary policy committee meeting regarding more flexible fine tuning of monetary policy the use of various tools is expected to keep liquidity ample and provide cheaper loans for small and private businesses which are striving for a good start to 2020 with upward economic growth momentum other measures may include lowering the interest rate of medium term lending facilities ª the price of the central bank s lending to financial institutions ª so they can lend the cheaper money to small business at a lower cost maintaining reasonably ample liquidity is one of the priorities of chinese monetary policy in light of economic downside risks and rapid changes in the global environment the central bank said on wednesday in a separate statement about the monetary policy committee meeting the committee held its fourth quarter meeting in 2019 on friday chaired by yi gang governor of the central bank committee members held that china s major macroeconomic indicators are within a reasonable range maintaining growth momentum with strong resilience amid external challenges before the end of 2019 the announcement of a phase one trade deal between washington and beijing strengthened investor confidence the latest economic indicators in china including the stronger than expected manufacturing purchasing managers index in december also reflected positive expectations on economic performance in the new year economists said in the statement the central bank said it will continue to pay close attention to the profound changes in the international and domestic economic and financial situation to turn the external pressure into a strong driving force for deepening reform and opening up it also said the exchange rate of the yuan is largely stable with improved two way flexibility and enhanced ability to sustain external shocks liu wei president of renmin university of china and a member of the committee wrote in an article that the monetary policy this year is expected to be prudent but there is a tendency toward relative loosening through cutting the reserve ratio requirement and lowering the interest rate of the medium term lending facility and open market repo rates the central bank can supplement liquidity and increase financial support for small and micro businesses said liu who predicted the gdp growth target of 2020 will stay above 6 percent and the target for the consumer price index ª a gauge of inflation ª may be no higher than 3 percent

this year is destined to be a major one for china as the country is set to become a moderately well off society and to have eliminated all forms of extreme poverty in time for next year s 100th anniversary of the communist party of china many observers expect another challenging year for the economy which has been affected over the past 12 months by both trade friction with the united states and slowing global growth with the us recording the longest period of expansion in its history in july the inevitable consensus among economists on the global economy is that a recession cannot be far away even if it doesn t occur this year relations between beijing and washington will again be in focus as political fervor heats up for the us presidential election in november the united kingdom is set to leave the european union making brexit a reality but there is still a risk that no free trade agreement will be reached the year ahead also promises to be another important one for the belt and road initiative with a number of important projects underway across many continents as far as the chinese economy is concerned the three day central economic work conference which was attended by the country s leaders last month emphasized stability as a result commentators believe that the central leadership will set a target of around 6 percent for gdp growth in the government work report in march compared with the range of 6 to 6 5 percent set last year forecasts sino us ties in focus after the government revised growth for 2018 in november a 6 percent expansion this year would be sufficient to achieve a doubling of 2010 s gdp which would equate to china becoming a moderately well off society imogen page jarrett china research analyst at the economist intelligence unit an economics research organization is forecasting gdp to grow by 5 9 percent the expected growth rate will still be enough for the government to meet its centennial goal we expect it to introduce more aggressive stimuli in 2020 to ensure economic growth reaches this level including continued monetary loosening and government spending on infrastructure as well as moderate loosening of policy in the property sector in certain regions she said louis kuijs head of asia economics at the consultancy oxford economics also believes that setting a lower target would be the right course of action it would make sense as it would imply a further softening of the target compared with 2019 without leading to too strong a deceleration he said jing ulrich vice chairman of global banking and asia pacific at investment bank jp morgan chase co said chinese leaders were right to emphasize at the conference the importance of transitioning from high speed to high quality growth chinese policymakers have been responsive in managing the nation s financial and economic risks with the economy facing headwinds they have reiterated the continuation of supply side structural reforms in the pursuit of high quality growth she said if china does succeed in eliminating extreme poverty this year it would be a remarkable achievement and one that even some developed economies have failed to match it would be the culmination of a 40 year journey that has seen 800 million moved out of poverty the highest number ever in such a short period of time stephen roach senior fellow at the jackson institute for global affairs at yale university pointed out that 4 8 million citizens in the us still live in absolute poverty â below the 3 20 a day purchasing power parity threshold some 2 million of them do not have running water the elimination of poverty is an important achievement on the road to prosperity for any nation developing or developed with many of the world s wealthiest nations still afflicted with significant pockets of poverty china s progress is all the more impressive he said china s unparalleled progress on poverty alleviation may well be the singular achievement of its growth and development miracle douglas mcwilliams who carried out extensive research on poverty for his recent book the inequality paradox how capitalism can work for everyone argues that china has been particularly successful in not leaving people behind as it become wealthier it has made creating prosperity translate into reduced poverty and there are lessons other countries could learn from he said most commentators expect the global economy to remain sluggish this year however page jarrett from the eiu believes global growth will pick up slightly from 2 3 per cent last year to 2 4 percent with continued uncertainty in the global operating environment we expect that business confidence and investment will remain subdued she said the world s major central banks will continue to pursue ultra loose monetary policy this will cushion demand in developed markets and limit the financial pressures that some heavily indebted emerging market economies might otherwise face kuijs at oxford economics doubts that this year will herald the start of a global recession we are not very bullish on the global economic outlook for 2020 but we think that the risk of a recession or something close to that remains modest given the insurance policy provided by monetary and fiscal stimulus pursued across the world he said last month the us and china agreed phase one of a trade deal but many observers expect anti china rhetoric to increase in the upcoming presidential election shi yinhong director of the american studies institute at renmin university and one of china s leading foreign policy experts believes there will be considerable china bashing from both the republicans and democrats on the campaign trail this is not new but it will be more to the fore because of the trade dispute as to the outcome i think trump has quite a remarkable probability of being re elected he said if he isn t and the democrats win i am not certain what the impact on china will be a democrat president might be a little more predictable and there might be a little more certainty wang huiyao founder and president of the center for china and globalization a leading independent think tank based in beijing believes the phase one trade agreement has provided much needed stability the trade dispute for now has probably stabilized and the challenge is to maintain china us relations and not let them deteriorate he said roach at yale agrees the agreement has eased tensions for the time being but he thinks they will resurface this year it takes a worrisome source of uncertainty out of the near term global growth equation but as the events of the past 21 months have indicated there is far more to this conflict than tariffs tensions over innovation policy technology leadership cybersecurity and state sponsored industrial policy underscore both the breadth and the depth of the protracted tensions between the world s two largest economies he said however shi at renmin university believes that the us and china will continue to decouple and the world will become more protectionist rejecting globalization the forces of protectionism are becoming stronger countries across the world are looking inwards this is a trend that is not going to end any time soon he said as with last year another source of uncertainty this year could be brexit the uk will leave the eu by the end of this month but will then enter an implementation period prime minister boris johnson has enshrined in law that this period will end on dec 31 regardless of whether the uk agrees a free trade agreement with the eu creating the prospect of further business uncertainty throughout the year page jarrett at the eiu believes the uk will not be able to meet its self imposed deadline given the complexity of negotiating the final status arrangement we expect that the uk will be forced to seek a further extension concluding a free trade agreement by december 2022 instead she said this will lead to instability in the currency the pound will remain volatile in the coming months and again toward the end of next year while the uk is disentangling itself from the eu the belt and road initiative now in its eighth year will continue to forge new links between countries mcwilliams also founder and executive deputy chairman of the centre for economics and business research an economics consultancy based in london said the initiative will provide one of the most significant global boosts this year according to a report by his consultancy it will add 7 1 trillion annually to global gdp over the next two decades involving a significant surge in infrastructure spending this will add some 4 2 percent to global gdp by 2040 the bri is a huge boost to the world economy while its peripheral elements are important the biggest one is the development of land based trading routes from asia to europe which will transform china s trading links with europe he said it now costs just 2 600 to send 1 metric ton of freight from chengdu capital of sichuan province toã ã³dã in poland in 14 days by rail a fraction of what it would cost by author modes of transportation this is transformative it is also making the chinese and russian economies heavily integrated which will enhance their links bukola ogunsina editor of the sunday edition of the leadership newspaper in nigeria said the belt and road initiative is particularly important in africa where it is fostering a deeper relationship between china and the continent chinese companies are building bridges roads and hydroelectric plants in nigeria and i think people are beginning to grasp the whole concept of what the initiative means she said what china is offering is a mutual relationship based on respect it is not a one sided thing at all ulrich at jp morgan chase also thinks there is a growing global realization of the scale of the initiative it presents substantial opportunities for the nations involved ideally boosting regional economic co operation promoting growth and fostering trade and investment she said not only this year but the new decade as a whole is likely to be an important time for technology with major breakthroughs expected in artificial intelligence robotics and telecommunications and with chinese tech giant huawei already a leader in 5g china has set itself the target of being a global leader in technology by 2035 jeffrey towson professor of investment at peking university guanghua school of management feels that china is already ahead in a number of areas china s digital giants are now the leaders in e commerce messaging and payments alibaba is better than amazon wechat is better than facebook i expect them to extend this lead in 2020 he said towson author of the best selling the 1 hour china book with jonathan woetzel said china has had particular success with consumer products silicon valley is dreadfully boring on the consumer side â almost stagnant china and asia as a whole is where the excitement and innovation is for most everything on a smartphone china s tech giants will continue to evolve into global leaders â huawei in telecommunications and smartphones tiktok known as douyin in china in entertainment and ant financial in payments he said roach author of unbalanced the codependency of america and china said it is important to be realistic about the prospects for this year the good news is that key sources of idiosyncratic risk appear to have been addressed for the time being â namely the tariff war between the us and china as well as the political uncertainty surrounding brexit he said the bad news however is the downward growth momentum in europe â especially in germany â and in japan you also have the sluggish state of global trade continuing to take a toll on the export led economies of east asia and also mexico mcwilliams at cebr said any predictions about this year have to be tempered with the knowledge that a global recession is looming this year looks likely to be a better one than 2019 but there are a lot of imbalances in the global economy that have not been resolved and there is likely to be quite a severe recession within the next five years he said
this article is more than 4 years old getty let s address an elephant in the room the rapidly expanding federal debt each annual deficit raises the total debt and forces the treasury to issue more debt in hopes someone will buy it the us government ran a 343 billion deficit in the first two months of fiscal 2020 october and november and the 12 month budget deficit again surpassed 1 trillion federal spending rose 7 from a year earlier while tax receipts grew only 3 no problem some say we owe it to ourselves and anyway people will always buy uncle sam s debt that is unfortunately not true foreign treasury buyers are turning away the foreign buyers on whom we have long depended are turning away as peter boockvar noted foreign selling of us notes and bonds continued in october by a net 16 7b this brings the year to date selling to 99b with much driven by liquidations from the chinese and japanese it was back in 2011 and 2012 when in each year foreigners bought over 400b worth thus it is domestically where we are now financing our ever increasing budget deficits the fed now has also become a big part of the monetization process via its purchases of t bills which also drives banks into buying notes the fed s balance sheet is now 335b higher than it was in september at 4 095 trillion again however the fed wants to define what it s doing market participants view this as qe4 with all the asset price inflation that comes along with qe programs it will be real interesting to see what happens in 2020 to the repo market when the fed tries to end its injections and how markets respond when its balance sheet stops increasing in size it s so easy to get involved and so difficult to leave declining foreign purchases are in part a consequence of the trade war the dollars china and japan use to buy our t bills are the same dollars we pay them for our imported goods but interest and exchange rates also matter with rates negative or lower than ours in most of the developed world the us had been the best parking place but in the last year other central banks started looking for a nirp exit higher rate expectations elsewhere combined with stable or falling us rates give foreign buyers who must also pay for currency hedges less incentive to buy us debt if you live in a foreign country and have a particular need for its local currency an extra 1 in yield isn t worth the risk of losing even more in the exchange rate i know some think china or other countries are opting out of the us treasury market for political reasons but it s simply business the math just doesn t work especially when president trump is explicitly saying he wants the dollar to weaken and interest rates go even lower if you are in country x why would you do that trade you might if you re in a country like argentina or venezuela where the currency is toast anyway but europe japan china the rest of the developed world it s a coin toss the fed began cutting rates in july funding pressures emerged weeks later coincidence i suspect not the fed started monetizing debt it sure looks like through qe4 and other activities the fed is taking the first steps toward monetizing our debt if so many more steps are ahead because the debt is only going to get worse as you can see from the chart below the fed is well on its way to reversing that 2018 quantitative tightening gavekal data macrobond luke gromen of forest for the trees is one of my favorite macro thinkers he thinks the monetization plan will get more obvious in early 2020 those that believe that the fed will begin undoing what it has done since september after the year end turn are either going to be proven right or they are going to be proven wrong in q1 2020 we strongly believe they will be proven wrong if when they are the fftt view that the fed is committed to financing us deficits with its balance sheet may go from a fringe view to the mainstream both parties in congress are committed to more spending no matter who is in the white house they will encourage the federal reserve to engage in more quantitative easing so the deficit spending can continue and even grow the next recession whenever it happens will bring a 2 trillion deficit meaning a 40 trillion dollar national debt by the end of the decade at least 20 trillion of which will be on the fed s balance sheet my side bet is that in 2030 we will look back and see that i was an optimist sometime in the middle to late 2020s we will see a great reset that profoundly changes everything you know about money and investing crisis isn t simply coming we are already in the early stages of it i think we will look back at late 2019 as the beginning this period will be rough but survivable if we prepare now in fact it will bring lots of exciting opportunities i predict an unprecedented crisis that will lead to the biggest wipeout of wealth in history and most investors are completely unaware of the pressure building right now learn more here

why southeast asian real estate markets remain attractive to chinese investors in recent years china s government has been sticking to the principle that houses are used for living in and not for speculation thus imposing restrictions on domestic real estate transactions by means of limited purchase property tax and higher lending rates this has pushed china s home buyers and investors to shift their attention to overseas real estate markets as a result china replaces the us and as the world s largest source of cross border real estate investors according to the 2019 h1 global cross border real estate investment data report released by uoolu com as compared to china the purchase of properties in other countries is not as restricted in terms of the number of units that can be purchased apart from this there are obvious advantages as well while demands of cross border home buyers lie mainly in investment more have started to consider other value added aspects besides the capital appreciation and rental income home buying is also driven by factors such as immigration education and retirement investors are now trying to actualise more demands at the same time for each property purchase by investing in properties outside china the investors can also enjoy other additional benefits such as a better living environment first class medical care international educational resources easier access to realise multinational business expansion more convenient visa policy and a chance to acquire permanent residency in a foreign country however as traditional real estate investment markets in developed countries such as the us the uk canada and australia become nearly saturated china s investors have started to pay more attention to southeast asian countries especially those in the emerging markets cross border real estate investors with a budget of rmb 1 million to rmb 3 million is now accounting for 67 of the total population in china compared with far fetched property prices in traditional real estate markets such as north america europe and australia home prices in southeast asian countries mainly range from rmb 11 382 m2 kuala lumpur malaysia to rmb 32 104 m2 bangkok thailand the latter s price range is similar to second tier cities in china thus making it more affordable to chinese investors besides there are fewer taxes and fees related to property purchases and payment methods are very conducive for investment under limited budget most importantly properties in southeast asian countries are commanding a high rental yield apart from a low investment threshold investors also pay more attention to return on investment roi in the real estate market it is reported that a city with more than 5 of roi can be rated as suitable for investment and cities such as manila phnom penh and bangkok all fall within this category in addition a good majority of south east asian countries allow freehold ownership of both land and dwelling with the rapid urbanisation and the development of these cities land prices in these countries can only increase which in turn will drive the property prices higher as for the developed countries such as singapore and malaysia whilst there are certain entry thresholds for real estate investment asset preservation and roi are more evident as compared to properties in china secondly the largest age group of chinese investors are those between 30 years old to 49 years old which accounts for 78 of the total population majority of these buyers have reaped the fruits of the real estate and internet market boom in china years ago not only are they equipped financially these buyers have also become much more affluent with the ability to source for overseas real estate investments these buyers have now moved beyond the scope of investment as other intangible considerations like education and retirement become major factors in overseas property purchase with international schools in china now over priced many of these chinese buyers have found a cheaper and yet authentic alternative in south east asian countries the climate and ecological environment in some of these countries are also more suitable for own stay especially for retirees coupled with a lower cost of living more and more chinese are beginning to migrate to these countries with their family through visa programs such as srrv in thailand and the philippines and mm2h in malaysia thirdly like most investors property value appreciation potential is another key factor in deciding to acquire overseas properties most investors would definitely go for a currency that is strong enough to hedge against any potential depreciation risk when selecting the countries to invest according to uoolu s user inquiries thailand is still firmly the no 1 in cross border real estate investment due to the currency advantage in the past 5 years the us dollar depreciated by only 1 5 against the baht thailand s baht is exceptionally strong amongst the regional currencies and this looks to be a sustained trend last but not least the belt and road initiative rolled out by the chinese government has enabled stronger diplomatic relations and increased investment with the south east asian countries this is clearly evident in the huge infrastructure investment by the chinese government in south east asia notably the east coast railway line in malaysia and the thai chinese rail line these cross border partnerships between nations will only boost the development of the real estate market in this region in addition these countries also use preferential tax policies and zero foreign exchange control to encourage foreign investment and foreign enterprises to enter their market hence attracting more and more chinese companies and entrepreneurs how well will the thailand real estate market perform according to thai media reports one in five home buyers in bangkok comes from china thailand is the no 1 tourist attraction in the world and it s the same to the chinese due to its huge population and high foreign visitor influx bangkok is also a good rental market since 2014 the gdp of thai construction industry has risen from 55 billion baht to 77 billion baht the rapid development of the construction industry has laid a solid foundation for the real estate industry which is another strong economic pillar after tourism over the past 2 years chinese internet giants such as alibaba and jd have invested in thailand recently china s huawei was invited to assist thailand in developing the

by andrew moody china daily updated 2020 01 02 05 46 this year is destined to be a major one for china as the country is set to become a moderately well off society and to have eliminated all forms of extreme poverty in time for next year s 100th anniversary of the communist party of china many observers expect another challenging year for the economy which has been affected over the past 12 months by both trade friction with the united states and slowing global growth with the us recording the longest period of expansion in its history in july the inevitable consensus among economists on the global economy is that a recession cannot be far away even if it doesn t occur this year relations between beijing and washington will again be in focus as political fervor heats up for the us presidential election in november the united kingdom is set to leave the european union making brexit a reality but there is still a risk that no free trade agreement will be reached the year ahead also promises to be another important one for the belt and road initiative with a number of important projects underway across many continents as far as the chinese economy is concerned the three day central economic work conference which was attended by the country s leaders last month emphasized stability as a result commentators believe that the central leadership will set a target of around 6 percent for gdp growth in the government work report in march compared with the range of 6 to 6 5 percent set last year forecasts sino us ties in focus after the government revised growth for 2018 in november a 6 percent expansion this year would be sufficient to achieve a doubling of 2010 s gdp which would equate to china becoming a moderately well off society imogen page jarrett china research analyst at the economist intelligence unit an economics research organization is forecasting gdp to grow by 5 9 percent the expected growth rate will still be enough for the government to meet its centennial goal we expect it to introduce more aggressive stimuli in 2020 to ensure economic growth reaches this level including continued monetary loosening and government spending on infrastructure as well as moderate loosening of policy in the property sector in certain regions she said louis kuijs head of asia economics at the consultancy oxford economics also believes that setting a lower target would be the right course of action it would make sense as it would imply a further softening of the target compared with 2019 without leading to too strong a deceleration he said jing ulrich vice chairman of global banking and asia pacific at investment bank jp morgan chase co said chinese leaders were right to emphasize at the conference the importance of transitioning from high speed to high quality growth chinese policymakers have been responsive in managing the nation s financial and economic risks with the economy facing headwinds they have reiterated the continuation of supply side structural reforms in the pursuit of high quality growth she said if china does succeed in eliminating extreme poverty this year it would be a remarkable achievement and one that even some developed economies have failed to match it would be the culmination of a 40 year journey that has seen 800 million moved out of poverty the highest number ever in such a short period of time stephen roach senior fellow at the jackson institute for global affairs at yale university pointed out that 4 8 million citizens in the us still live in absolute poverty below the 3 20 a day purchasing power parity threshold some 2 million of them do not have running water the elimination of poverty is an important achievement on the road to prosperity for any nation developing or developed with many of the world s wealthiest nations still afflicted with significant pockets of poverty china s progress is all the more impressive he said china s unparalleled progress on poverty alleviation may well be the singular achievement of its growth and development miracle douglas mcwilliams who carried out extensive research on poverty for his recent book the inequality paradox how capitalism can work for everyone argues that china has been particularly successful in not leaving people behind as it become wealthier it has made creating prosperity translate into reduced poverty and there are lessons other countries could learn from he said most commentators expect the global economy to remain sluggish this year however page jarrett from the eiu believes global growth will pick up slightly from 2 3 per cent last year to 2 4 percent with continued uncertainty in the global operating environment we expect that business confidence and investment will remain subdued she said the world s major central banks will continue to pursue ultra loose monetary policy this will cushion demand in developed markets and limit the financial pressures that some heavily indebted emerging market economies might otherwise face kuijs at oxford economics doubts that this year will herald the start of a global recession we are not very bullish on the global economic outlook for 2020 but we think that the risk of a recession or something close to that remains modest given the insurance policy provided by monetary and fiscal stimulus pursued across the world he said last month the us and china agreed phase one of a trade deal but many observers expect anti china rhetoric to increase in the upcoming presidential election shi yinhong director of the american studies institute at renmin university and one of china s leading foreign policy experts believes there will be considerable china bashing from both the republicans and democrats on the campaign trail this is not new but it will be more to the fore because of the trade dispute as to the outcome i think trump has quite a remarkable probability of being re elected he said if he isn t and the democrats win i am not certain what the impact on china will be a democrat president might be a little more predictable and there might be a little more certainty wang huiyao founder and president of the center for china and globalization a leading independent think tank based in beijing believes the phase one trade agreement has provided much needed stability the trade dispute for now has probably stabilized and the challenge is to maintain china us relations and not let them deteriorate he said roach at yale agrees the agreement has eased tensions for the time being but he thinks they will resurface this year it takes a worrisome source of uncertainty out of the near term global growth equation but as the events of the past 21 months have indicated there is far more to this conflict than tariffs tensions over innovation policy technology leadership cybersecurity and state sponsored industrial policy underscore both the breadth and the depth of the protracted tensions between the world s two largest economies he said however shi at renmin university believes that the us and china will continue to decouple and the world will become more protectionist rejecting globalization the forces of protectionism are becoming stronger countries across the world are looking inwards this is a trend that is not going to end any time soon he said as with last year another source of uncertainty this year could be brexit the uk will leave the eu by the end of this month but will then enter an implementation period prime minister boris johnson has enshrined in law that this period will end on dec 31 regardless of whether the uk agrees a free trade agreement with the eu creating the prospect of further business uncertainty throughout the year page jarrett at the eiu believes the uk will not be able to meet its self imposed deadline given the complexity of negotiating the final status arrangement we expect that the uk will be forced to seek a further extension concluding a free trade agreement by december 2022 instead she said this will lead to instability in the currency the pound will remain volatile in the coming months and again toward the end of next year while the uk is disentangling itself from the eu the belt and road initiative now in its eighth year will continue to forge new links between countries mcwilliams also founder and executive deputy chairman of the centre for economics and business research an economics consultancy based in london said the initiative will provide one of the most significant global boosts this year according to a report by his consultancy it will add 7 1 trillion annually to global gdp over the next two decades involving a significant surge in infrastructure spending this will add some 4 2 percent to global gdp by 2040 the bri is a huge boost to the world economy while its peripheral elements are important the biggest one is the development of land based trading routes from asia to europe which will transform china s trading links with europe he said it now costs just 2 600 to send 1 metric ton of freight from chengdu capital of sichuan province to łódź in poland in 14 days by rail a fraction of what it would cost by author modes of transportation this is transformative it is also making the chinese and russian economies heavily integrated which will enhance their links bukola ogunsina editor of the sunday edition of the leadership newspaper in nigeria said the belt and road initiative is particularly important in africa where it is fostering a deeper relationship between china and the continent chinese companies are building bridges roads and hydroelectric plants in nigeria and i think people are beginning to grasp the whole concept of what the initiative means she said what china is offering is a mutual relationship based on respect it is not a one sided thing at all ulrich at jp morgan chase also thinks there is a growing global realization of the scale of the initiative it presents substantial opportunities for the nations involved ideally boosting regional economic co operation promoting growth and fostering trade and investment she said not only this year but the new decade as a whole is likely to be an important time for technology with major breakthroughs expected in artificial intelligence robotics and telecommunications and with chinese tech giant huawei already a leader in 5g china has set itself the target of being a global leader in technology by 2035 jeffrey towson professor of investment at peking university guanghua school of management feels that china is already ahead in a number of areas china s digital giants are now the leaders in e commerce messaging and payments alibaba is better than amazon wechat is better than facebook i expect them to extend this lead in 2020 he said towson author of the best selling the 1 hour china book with jonathan woetzel said china has had particular success with consumer products silicon valley is dreadfully boring on the consumer side almost stagnant china and asia as a whole is where the excitement and innovation is for most everything on a smartphone china s tech giants will continue to evolve into global leaders huawei in telecommunications and smartphones tiktok known as douyin in china in entertainment and ant financial in payments he said roach author of unbalanced the codependency of america and china said it is important to be realistic about the prospects for this year the good news is that key sources of idiosyncratic risk appear to have been addressed for the time being namely the tariff war between the us and china as well as the political uncertainty surrounding brexit he said the bad news however is the downward growth momentum in europe especially in germany and in japan you also have the sluggish state of global trade continuing to take a toll on the export led economies of east asia and also mexico mcwilliams at cebr said any predictions about this year have to be tempered with the knowledge that a global recession is looming this year looks likely to be a better one than 2019 but there are a lot of imbalances in the global economy that have not been resolved and there is likely to be quite a severe recession within the next five years he said
opening this year construction of the new terminal at lf wade international airport is one of the projects that has helped boost the island s gross domestic product during the past few years photograph by blaire simmons economically speaking bermuda is emerging from a largely painful decade and all residents will hope that 2020 can herald a new era of sustained economic growth however such success would have to be achieved against the grain of demographics with the island s workforce on track to shrink as scores of baby boomers retire over the next few years one in four will be a senior by 2026 government projections show without people with the right skills to replace them the island s economic engine is likely to stutter rather than accelerate and with more seniors drawing out of the system while fewer working people pay into it the risks to the fiscal stability of an already heavily indebted government are very real if 2019 was the year in which bermudafirst started the conversation on changing the path we re on by proposing sweeping reforms then perhaps there is hope that 2020 will be the year that the talk turns to action as a non political body of 80 bermudians from different walks of life commissioned by david burt the premier to draw up a socio economic plan to meet the island s future challenges bermudafirst s proposals deserve to be taken seriously immigration reforms to ensure the island can draw on the global talent necessary to maintain a strong 21st century economy education reforms to best equip all bermudians to participate in that economy and moves to create a sustainable healthcare system are all part of their plan to ensure the prosperity of bermuda and bermudians politics has proved a barrier to progress on these fronts with 2019 s aborted attempts to table legislation on immigration reform a good example of how difficult it is to change the status quo when it involves making decisions that may be unpopular with many voters but as peter heller of the fiscal responsibility panel warned in an interview with the royal gazette the status quo will not deliver a good future for bermudians or their children philip butterfield the chairman of bermudafirst will not shrink from pestering government ministers to make progress on the critical issues he has vowed that his group s future state report was not an ending but a beginning and he believes transformative change is critical for a sustainable future economy many would agree him gross domestic product a measure of economic activity has been growing over the last three years with much help from short term factors such as the america s cup and construction of the new terminal at lf wade international airport and work on hotel renovations and newbuilds as well as belco s new north power station the 3 6 per cent real gdp growth in 2017 was followed by 0 1 per cent growth in 2018 and quarterly reports for the first half of 2019 showed the economy growing at a more than 3 per cent clip aided by the value of construction work put in place these numbers will mean little to many struggling workers and businesses weighed down by increasing taxes rising healthcare costs and bermuda s high cost of living and doing business who may argue that gdp is not a great measure of the health of the economy when it comes to the lot of the average bermudian certainly there are indications that many have been tightening their purse strings not only did retail sales decline year over year for 16 months out of 18 through august 2019 but quarterly gdp reports show household consumption on a declining trend since the start of 2018 as for businesses their outlook has become increasingly pessimistic the bermuda business confidence index plunged 23 6 points to an all time low of 62 8 last year having dropped 19 points in the survey before that fewer than one third of the business leaders surveyed said they were confident in the island s economic future suggesting that much of the private sector is focusing on survival rather than looking to invest and hire respondents top answer when asked for changes that would improve the business environment immigration and work permit processing on the bright side when the large construction projects are complete their products will continue to contribute to growth the new airport terminal scheduled to open this summer may help to boost employment with its restaurants and retail outlets while the airport will be better equipped to cope with more flights and passengers greater airlift would provide a further fillip to the tourism industry which has been on a growth spurt in recent years helped by factors such as the rapid growth of online rental accommodation particularly through airbnb the america s cup and its legacy and the effectiveness of the bermuda tourism authority the new st regis hotel in st george s is slated for a 2021 opening creating dozens of new jobs in the sector with the arrival of 97 more hotel rooms and 25 suites bermuda s entrepreneurial spirit also offers hope for the economy especially given the escalating efforts to support those with business ideas the bermuda economic development corporation is more empowered than ever to help small businesses and the private sector business accelerator ignite which emerged in 2019 with impressive early success is doubling its intake of budding entrepreneurs in 2020 the bermuda government s efforts to build a new fintech industry on the back of a pioneering regulatory framework for digital assets is proving to be a slow burner the premier told the house of assembly in late september that eight fintech companies had established offices on the island and 31 people worked in the industry 15 of them bermudian there are reasons to expect some acceleration in 2020 not least the level of support bermuda has from influential innovator investors who featured in last october s tech week jeff pulver voice over internet protocol pioneer believes the island will be rewarded for embracing innovators in a way that few other countries have he said bermuda could develop a thriving start up economy over the next decade with a community of innovators using technology to tackle the world s challenges in many sectors cormac kinney a celebrated entrepreneur and software designer with a lengthy track record of successful start ups and technology businesses is equally enthusiastic about the island and is setting up an electronic diamond trading exchange here that already has commitments from 32 of the world s top diamond companies the government s pioneering electronic id initiative could grab further attention from innovators the island s openness to digital assets comes against a backdrop of moves towards making cryptocurrencies more mainstream the european central bank for example is considering launching a stablecoin that could have a serious implications on the businesses of intermediaries like banks and payment processing companies bermuda s international insurance industry has held up remarkably well over the last couple of years despite fears over the impact of a wave of mergers and ever growing international pressure against offshore financial jurisdictions us tax reform that took effect at the start of 2018 has proved to be far from the doomsday scenario that some had feared while the loss of jobs from the many takeovers in the property and casualty re insurance business has been offset to some extent by strong growth in the life reinsurance and annuities businesses and the insurance linked securities side of the industry in 2019 economic substance rules introduced to tackle european union concerns about offshore shell companies used to avoid paying taxes in the countries where they make their money were the new concern companies who lack the required substance on island in terms of employees physical presence local spending or revenue generating activities will have a choice of leaving or ramping up their presence it is too early to say whether the result will be a net gain for bermuda s economy however there has been no mass exodus so far indeed by the end of the second quarter of 2019 there were just as many international businesses registered in bermuda as there were 18 months earlier however more international pressure is sure to be brought to bear in 2020 the organisation for economic co operation and development is leading the way with its pillar two proposal designed to establish a minimum global rate of taxation for multinational companies in its pillar two consultation document the oecd states a minimum tax rate on all income reduces the incentive for taxpayers to engage in profit shifting and establishes a floor for tax competition among jurisdictions the aim seems to be to give multinationals as few reasons as possible for basing entities in places like bermuda and even though the main targets are surely the tech giants whose internet derived earnings have proved difficult to tax under laws that have failed to keep pace with the digital age other industries will be captured in the crosshairs reaching international consensus on how taxes should be allocated between nations would seem ambitious particularly with countries like france and britain having already gone it alone on imposing sales based digital taxes but we will know more by the end of this year about the initiative s chances of becoming reality whatever else happens external pressures will continue in 2020 and the demographic time bomb will keep ticking what is not so certain is whether the government and the people of bermuda will be able to overcome protectionist tendencies to push ahead with the bermudafirst style reforms that surely offer us our best chance of prosperity as the new decade dawns the challenges are daunting and the time for kicking the can down the road is fast running out
how japan has fared since the stock market bubble burst nostalgia for the good times has been a coping mechanism for the world s third largest economy by justin mccurry the guardian tokyo on dec 28 1989 japan s nikkei hit a high of 38 916 a milestone that proved to be the last hurrah of the country s asset inflated bubble economy a period of ostentatious consumption and overconfidence in the infallibility of japan inc what followed was a spectacular fall from the heights of the mid to late 1980s the stock market plummeted losing more than us 2 trillion in value by december 1990 in the years that followed the japanese surveyed an alien landscape of restructuring code for cost cutting deflation and stagnation when the bubble party ended its hosts appeared to have no idea how to clean up the mess left by absurdly high share and property prices illustration mountain people occasional outbreaks of nostalgia for the excesses of the boom years when the ground beneath the imperial palace was said to be worth more than the entire state of california have become a coping mechanism for a country now facing a new set of economic problems japan s 1980s bubble was the bursting start of a long adaption from a young fast growing economy to an aging slow growth new normal said martin schulz senior economist at the fujitsu research institute it took until 2002 to bail out the banks from the real estate adjustment it took another 10 years to put the necessary supply side and social security reforms in place the benign impact of the global financial crisis has shown that japan s economy has fully adjusted to its new normal of slow but solid long term growth the economic policies of japanese prime minister shinzo abe have done some good for a nation that remains a global powerhouse as the world s third largest economy schulz said abenomics is working to get innovation going again and to improve future expectations japan is now much better integrated in asia with its long term growth prospects its service economy is flourishing again and embraces digitalization people find jobs well into retirement and the young generation is optimistic he said what s missing are better work life balances to enable families to have children again and a more proactive stance to deal with the long term debt overhang the end of the bubble era coincided with the enthronement of then japanese emperor akihito who sought to bring the imperial family closer to ordinary people much of his three decades on the chrysanthemum throne which ended with his abdication in april last year was marked by policy drift and a creeping fear that japan s post bubble woes were merely the precursor to long term decline enter abe hawkish on defense and conservative on social issues but wedded to keynesian notions of the state as a benign spending force for economic good japan is back he declared when he became prime minister for the second time in late 2012 it was not long before optimism over abenomics at home and abroad began to chip away at the lost decades narrative that followed the bubble era the first two of abe s three arrows fiscal stimulus in the form of infrastructure spending and loose monetary policy from the bank of japan in the form of 0 percent interest rates and buying bonds off financial institutions in a process known as quantitative easing had the desired effect the nikkei began to rise although at about 24 000 points it is far from the levels of 30 years ago and export dependent manufacturers cheered a weaker yen however after seven years of abe who recently became japan s longest serving prime minister a more mixed picture is emerging there are more jobs than people to fill them and record numbers of tourists mainly from other parts of asia are bringing a glimmer of hope to depopulated regions but there have been policy failures that highlight the perils of vowing to nudge japan out of its deflationary low growth orbit abe s attempt to achieve 2 percent inflation came up short the consumer price index rate is running at 0 5 percent and questions persist over corporate governance in the wake of the allegations against the former nissan chairman carlos ghosn growth in the japanese economy was 0 4 percent in the third quarter of last year but there are fears that soft global demand and the us china trade dispute will hit exports there is concern too that a recent rise in the sales tax from 8 percent to 10 percent to address japan s public debt burden the highest in the industrial world and more than twice the size of its us 5 trillion economy will weaken private consumption abe s first two arrows are still in flight with the government announcing a record budget last month that its architect hopes will buy his economic project time and win him support after a series of damaging political scandals it includes 13 2 trillion us 121 billion in public spending on disaster reconstruction infrastructure and scientific research designed to shield the economy from a possible slowdown caused by a us japan trade war and a hangover from this year s tokyo olympics however critics say the third and most critical part of his program structural reform looks more like a badly thrown dart than an arrow despite grim warnings about the failure to address the effects on long term growth of a super aging declining population abe has encouraged more women to enter the workforce and relaxed immigration laws to allow a modest number of blue collar workers to fill gaps in pressurized sectors of the economy but much needed reforms of the labor market corporate governance and healthcare have been slow to materialize monetary easing and fiscal stimulus were supposed to make room for structural reform but structural reform hasn t happened said koichi nakano a politics professor at sophia university in tokyo this means the japanese economy continues to depend on government steroids god knows what will happen after the olympics abe s economic policy gave him enough political capital to push through much of his right wing agenda like the state secrets law and security legislation but the government can t continue to pump money into the economy and the bank of japan can t continue to subsidize japan inc nakano said it is telling that he never achieved his inflation target nakano said the fundamental weaknesses of the japanese economy have never been properly addressed
by there s a problem with america s favorite statistic gdp it avoids pretty much everything that s actually truly really good for society including the importance of robust ecology still it s the biggest measure of what s happening with the economy and used around the world even though horribly flawed according to some forward thinkers gross domestic product gdp the monetary value of all finished goods and services is a distortion that needs fixing nobel winning economist joseph stiglitz s former chief economist of the world bank new book measuring what counts the global movement for well being the new press 2019 tackles the issue by exposing its paramount importance in judging how society gauges prosperity or alternatively the failure of prosperity e g one in eight americans 40 million is on food stamps during the longest economic expansion in memory and 40 50 of americans don t have 400 readily available for emergencies is this failed prosperity gdp distorts reality by giving an appearance of real economic growth even as living standards stagnate for lower middling classes additionally gdp totally misses ecosystem collapse by abuse misuse overuse which is only noticed by the general public after it s way too late when it s easily noticeable even by those of low self esteem that blindly follow tyrannical maniacs hmm according to stiglitz the world is facing three existential crises 1 a climate crisis 2 an inequality crisis and 3 a crisis in democracy yet the accepted ways by which we measure economic performance gives absolutely no hint that we might be facing a problem accordingly politicians see positive gdp numbers which inspires them to continue with the status quo meaning they do not focus on key aspects for sustainability as well as human well being gdp does not compute environmental degradation gdp does not register societal divisions that build tension over massive wealth disparity and gdp overlooks calculations of lowered standards of living for the abandoned middle class as they increasingly deploy mountain loads of debt to support bogus lifestyles according to pew research center in real terms average hourly earnings peaked more than 45 years ago source for most u s workers real wages have barely budged in decades pew research center august 7 2018 where s prosperity furthermore according to stiglitz if growth is not sustainable because we are destroying the environment and using up scarce natural resources our statistics should warn us if we measure the wrong thing we will do the wrong thing stiglitz s new book with co authors french economists jeapaul fitoussi and martine durand discusses alternative metrics that more properly account for details like sustainability as well as how people feel about their lives in other words gdp does not paint a true life picture rather it s a wobbly ghostly statistic that measures business activity without consideration for humanity or ecology begging the question what s really important in life gdp numbers do not hint at trouble with 1 sustainability of resources 2 climate crises or 3 the well being of the people yet all three are crucial issues under stress like never before as an interesting side note according to jorgen randers a global forecast for the next forty years 2052 a report to club of rome commemorating the 40th anniversary of the limits to growth chelsea green publishing 2012 there s already a shift away from the use of gdp the sustainability revolution has already begun the new paradigm already emerged forty years ago or perhaps even fifty with rachel carson in 1962 it has spread since but it is still not mainstream we have evolved an increased understanding of the need to replace fossil energy but we have not really embarked on the challenge and some even in high places have started to talk seriously about the need to replace gdp growth with growth in well being as the overriding societal goal randers pg 13 furthermore gdp totally misses crucial points supporting societal existence from an ecological perspective as stated by christopher o clugston s blip humanity s 300 year self terminating experiment with industrialism booklocker press 2019 the premise of blip is that increasingly pervasive global nonrenewable natural resource nnr scarcity is causing faltering global human prosperity which is causing increasing global political instability economic fragility and societal unrest this scenario will intensity during the coming decades and culminate in humanity s self inflicted global societal species collapse almost certainly by the year 2050 gdp does not calculate does not represent and does not hint at the scarcity value associated with overuse abuse of natural resources accompanied by egregious planet wide degradation e g the gooey tar sands in alberta canada this is the world s most destructive oil operation and it s growing national geographic 2019 the missing gdp calculations result in cultural upheaval as people increasingly hit the streets in protest aware that something is not right and the canadian tar sands are proof positive that something is way way way off course it literally frightens the daylights out of people that seriously contemplate future prospects for society it s an actual horror story in the making in full operation and actually celebrated by neoliberal

after the turn of the millennium the united states suffered its weakest decade of economic growth in the post world war ii era and served as ground zero of the global financial crisis forecasters predicted a long american decline instead over the course of the 2010s the united states staged a comeback as an economic superpower and even more as a financial superpower the united states economy grew faster than other rich countries and navigated the decade without suffering a single recession a first since records began in the 1850s defying the declinists the united states was one of only two major countries alongside china to expand its share of the global economy in the 2010s with central banks consumers and investors around the world increasingly eager to hold dollars the greenback ruled global money flows as never before the american stock market rose 200 percent in the 2010s while the rest of the world s stock markets including those of china and germany registered meager gains today seven of the world s 10 largest companies by stock market value are american up from three in late 2009 but if history is a guide the 2020s will be anything but another american decade economic trends that define one decade rarely define the next this cycle has repeated itself throughout the postwar era america was the hottest story in the world economy and markets in the 1960s but gave way to emerging nations in the 1970s and japan in the 1980s before rising again in the 1990s after the turn of the millennium emerging nations made another strong run and by 2010 forecasters were predicting that emerging markets would be the story of the next century excluding china emerging countries as a group saw their share of the global economy shrink during the 2010s the average annual gain for emerging stock markets was close to zero their worst decade since the 1930s why does this cycle play out in such a predictable way the answer is straightforward after a good run national leaders grow complacent and start spending irresponsibly businesses and consumers run up debts investors end up overpaying for stocks and the dominant companies get lethargic and fall back into the pack the united states at the dawn of the 2020s is a complacent land with a rising government deficit spreading corporate debts and swollen prices not only for the stock of megacorporations like amazon and alphabet but also for financial assets of all kinds meanwhile many other countries particularly in the emerging world were forced by pressing financial circumstances to spend the last decade reducing deficits and debt and enacting reforms that should put their economies in a position to grow more rapidly quietly global economic forces are shifting in ways that could set the stage for a comeback by smaller nations and businesses in the 2020s as the united states and china battle to contain each other their titanic struggle is scaring off trade and investment that is instead shifting to smaller countries including vietnam taiwan mexico the netherlands and ireland to insulate themselves from the superpower trade war nations like brazil and japan are signing regional and bilateral trade deals the big american tech companies in contrast face a global regulatory backlash against their monopolistic power these giants have bought out smaller rivals and driven many out of business but they also enable many others because their platforms allow millions of entrepreneurs to reach wide audiences often catering to specific national or regional tastes it used to be that big companies competed for limited shelf space in retail stores by winning consumer trust in multiyear multibillion dollar tv ad campaigns now internet platforms allow small companies to bypass stores win public trust instantly through consumer reviews and build a brand on cheap internet ads even free youtube videos globalization is thus gradually giving way to localization which makes this a promising time for countries with domestic markets large enough to support significant expansion in local businesses that s especially true of countries where the population is still relatively young and fast growing like indonesia the philippines egypt and mexico though stock markets worldwide are still dominated by mega caps companies with a market value or capitalization above 200 billion they face an emerging challenge from companies below that threshold in finance the hottest companies are digital payment apps and the small banks that back them in insurance the hot subsector is mobile internet insurance services insurtech the fastest growing american food and beverage manufacturers are small ones search ketchup an american staple once virtually synonymous with a single brand and you will find more than 680 results including local purveyors selling flavors such as bacon driven by apps that serve as gateways to food delivery services a similar rise of the solo chef is underway worldwide many internet platforms also provide cloud computing which allows entrepreneurs to build back office operations like customer relations and bill collection much more quickly and cheaply barriers to entry are falling particularly since many of the hottest internet companies own few physical assets uber the world s largest taxi company owns no taxis but that means future rivals won t have to buy them either at the same time the rise of populist nationalism is injecting patriotic fervor into buy local movements in an october survey chinese consumers cited national loyalty as the main reason they would rethink u s brands an ad from an indian food company urged customers to perform your patriotic duties and boycott products made in china usa uk europe these forces conspire to unseat the global giants which are mainly american the united states market accounts for well over half of the global value of stock markets and has never been more expensive relative to other national markets but remember churn is the norm among the world s 10 largest companies today only one microsoft was on the top 10 list in december 2009 if the usual pattern holds it s likely that america will peak and smaller nations and companies will make a comeback if the 2010s were a golden age for the world s largest economy and its megacorporations the 2020s are likely to be remembered as the decade when smaller was beautiful again ruchir sharma author of the rise and fall of nations forces of change in the post crisis world is the chief global strategist at morgan stanley investment management and a
