june 2017 net international reserves nir increased by around 13bn to reach 44 3bn thus covering 8 4 months of merchandise imports at end of june 2018 according to the cbe the increase was a result of the rise in foreign currencies by about 11bn and in special drawing rights sdrs by 2bn during the report s preparation nir reached 44 5bn at end of october 2018 banks net foreign assets decreased by 2

favourable structure as 86 7 of the debt are medium and long term the weighted average of the interbank foreign exchange market rate revealed that the egyptian pound interbank rate appreciated by 1 1 during fy 2017 18 as the egp reached 17 8878 per us dollar at end of june 2018 against egp 18 0911 per us dollar at end of june 2017 bop performance the cbe stated that egypt s transactions with the

capital and financial account recorded a net inflow of about 22bn against about 31bn moreover the cbe noted that the decline in the current account deficit was mainly traceable to the services surplus which surged by 98 1 recording about 11 1bn against about 5 6bn and net unrequited current transfers scaled up by 21 2 to about 26 5bn versus about 21 8bn while the trade deficit remained stable at 37 3bn and the income balance ran a deficit of about 6 3bn against about 4 6bn trade on goods the cbe pointed out that trade volume increased by 10 2 to reach 88 9bn 35 5 of gdp during fy 2017 18 the trade deficit has stabilised at 37 3bn 14 9 of the gdp this was driven by increased merchandise exports by 18 9 to reach 25 8bn due to the increase in both oil exports by 33 1 to reach 8 8bn 34 of total exports and non oil exports by 12 7 to reach 17 1bn 66 of total exports as a result the exports imports ratio mounted to 40 9 from 36 8 merchandise imports increased by 6 9 to reach 63 1bn reflecting the increase in both non oil imports by 7 7 to 50 6bn 80 2 of total imports and oil imports by 3 9 to reach 12 5bn 19 8 of total imports hereunder is the geographical distribution of merchandise exports and imports egypt s main trade partners in terms of exports were italy the uae the us the uk turkey india saudi arabia germany switzerland and spain the report stated these countries combined accounted for some 57 9 of total exports as for imports egypt s trade partners were china saudi arabia the uae russia germany the us the uk france switzerland turkey italy and brazil these countries combined accounted for some 52 4 of total imports services balance services surplus doubled to about 11 1bn against about 5 6bn as the increase in services receipts outpaced the rise in services payments services receipts increased by 39 5 to some 21 5bn against about 15 4bn driven by the increase in tourism revenues to about 9 8bn against about 4 4bn driven by the increase in the number of tourist nights to 102 6 m nights against 50 9 m nights this was con current with the increase in the average of tourist expenditure per night transportation receipts also increased by 10 1 to about 8 7bn against some 7 9bn due to the increase in suez canal dues by 15 4 to about 5 7bn against some 4 9bn which increased in turn as a result of the rise in net tonnage by 9 8 and the increase of sdr against the us dollar by 3 8 another contributing factor was the increase in the receipts of egyptian navigation and airline companies other services receipts increased by 0 2 to about 2 34bn against about 2 33bn due to the increase in the receipts of constructions services the agencies commissions advertising and market research services on the other hand government services receipts decreased by 18 to 636 7m against 776 4m due to decrease in other governmental receipts services payments rose by 5 9 to about 10 4bn against about 9 8bn driven by the increase government services payments by 32 9 to 1 5bn against 1 1bn reflecting the increase in the salaries of government employees seconded abroad other governmental expenses and the expenses of egyptian embassies abroad other services payments also increased by 7 6 to about 4 9bn against about 4 6bn driven by the increase in the amounts transferred abroad by foreign petroleum companies communication services royalties and license fees computer services and subscription to magazines and newspapers furthermore transportation payments rose by 11 1 to 1 5bn against 1 3bn due to the rise in the amounts transferred by foreign navigation and airline companies airplanes and ships rental fees and amounts transferred as transportation services on the other hand travel payments fell by 10 5 to about 2 5bn against about 2 7bn due to the decline of e card payments abroad income balance the investment income balance ran a deficit of about 6 3bn in fy 2017 18 against some 4 6bn as an outcome of the rise of investment income payments to register about 7 1bn against some 5 1bn 58 7 of which were profit transfers by oil and non oil foreign companies operating in egypt meanwhile the investment income receipts increased to register 835 4m against 497 9m unrequited current transfers net net unrequited current transfers scaled up by 21 2 to about 26 5bn from 21 8bn mainly due to the increase in net private transfers from 21 7bn to 26 3bn supported by the increase in workers remittances by about 4 6bn capital and financial account the capital and financial account recorded a net inflow of about 22bn in fy 2017 18 against some 31 bn as an outcome of several points including total fdis inflows registered about 13 2bn while total outflows recorded about 5 4bn accordingly net inflows of fdis in egypt registered about 7 7bn noteworthy net inflows for the oil sector investments increased by 12 2 to post about 4 5bn the sectorial breakdown of total fdis inflows shows that the oil sector has the biggest share 67 3 as for the other sectors the majority of fdis went to the services sectors with 11 2 distributed to the communication and information technology 3 4 to other services sectors 2 9 to the real estate sector 2 7 to the financial sector and 1 9 to the tourism sector 0 3 the share of the manufacturing sector was 10 the construction sector was 4 5 the agricultural sector was 0 1 and the remaining portion was acquired by undistributed sectors portfolio investment in egypt retreated registering a net inflow of 12 1bn versus 16bn this was largely ascribed to the decrease in foreigners investments in egyptian treasury bonds t bonds recording net purchases of about 6 5bn against about 10bn as a result of the withdrawals of foreign investors from the emerging markets ems medium and long term loans and facilities recorded net disbursements of about 7 9bn against about 8bn short term suppliers credit realised net disbursements of about 2 4bn against about 1 7bn other assets and liabilities achieved a net outflow of about 7 7bn against about 2 5bn this came on the back of the net change in the liabilities of the cbe to the external world to post a net external repayment of about 3 9bn in the year under review against a net disbursement of about 8 1bn causing a decline in the cbe s liabilities to the external world to summarise the cbe stated that the tourism sector performance during 2017 18 points to an increase in tourist arrivals and nights and also shows a hike in receipts when compared with the previous year levels average expenditure per night increased from 86 1 night in the previous year to 95 6 night in 2017 18 the tourism sector performance during the fourth quarter q4 of 2017 18 according to the bop data during q4 2017 18 tourism receipts recorded an increase of 1015m or 65 95 to 2554m compared with the same period last year this is due to the 8 4 increase in the average expenditure per night in addition to the 6 6 increase in average nights spent per visitor egypt s tourism sector activity witnessed a moderate increase quarter over quarter in q4 of 2017 18 the number of tourist arrivals witnessed a 11 6 increase while tourist nights increased by 12 4 on the other hand the average expenditure per night stayed the same at 95 6 night during q3 and q4 of 2017 18 data shows a slight increase in the number of average tourist nights 10 4 nights per person compared to 10 3 nights per person tourists coming from africa and middle eastern countries topped the list in terms of the length of stay per visitor with 17 6 and 12 9 nights per visitor respectively hotel sector performance as regards hotel sector performance and its regional comparison during the first seven months of 2018 cairo hotels experienced a noticeable increase in terms of revenue per available room which reached 20 2 compared with the same period last year it also witnessed a shift from diversification toward concentration in favour of the european region as the herfindahl hirschman index hhi reached 0 6 in 2013 14 however the index then fell down this year reaching 0 41 indicating more diversity yet less diversified than the previous year which reached 0 35 this draws attention to the fact that necessary steps should be taken towards a more diversified tourism market to be able to mitigate any future demand shocks nevertheless egypt s market is still more diversified when compared to some neighbouring countries in the middle east and north africa mena region tourism sector performance the ministry of tourism figures show that a total of 2 661 000 tourists came from all over the world and spent 26 712 000 nights in q4 of 2017 18 with an increase of 46 in the number of tourist arrivals and an increase of 53 1 in the number of nights compared with the same period of the previous year the increase in tourist arrivals resulted from more visitors coming from the european countries 70 62 of total increase middle east region 16 92 african countries 7 11 the americas 2 61 and asia and the pacific region 1 4 meanwhile the average expenditure per night increased from 88 2 night in q4 of 2016 17 to 95 6 night in q4 of 2017 18 the positive growth in the number of tourist nights 12 4 was behind the increase in tourism receipts by 283m or 12 5 to 2554m q over q in q4 of 2017 18 during q4 of 2017 18 data shows that visitors stayed more nights registering an average of 10 4 nights per person compared to 9 8 nights per person in the corresponding quarter a year earlier tourists coming from africa headed the list in terms of the length of stay per visitor with an average of 17 6 nights the middle eastern countries were the runners up with 12 9 nights visitor followed by the americas with12 3 nights visitor asia and pacific region with 9 6 nights visitor and european countries with 8 9nights visitor hotel sector performance in order to make a sound judgment on hotel sector financial performance over the time and across key arab cities the cbe combined occupancy rate with revenue per available room revpar the revenue per available room provides a convenient snapshot of how well a hotel is filling its rooms as well as how much it is able to charge as a matter of fact there is a sharp increase in revpar during the first seven months of 2018 as compared to the same period of the previous year international investment position iip at end of june 2018 egypt s iip at the end of june 2018 recorded net external liabilities assets minus liabilities of about 147 3bn up by 12 4 compared to

of about 147 3bn versus 131 0 bn the cbe noted that assets increased by 17 9 to reach about 78 2bn at end of june 2018 from about 66 4bn at end of june 2017 the increase was mainly due to reserve assets increasing by 41 9 to about 43 5bn foreign direct investments increasing by 3 7 to about 7 6bn while portfolio investments abroad and other investment assets decreased by 15 5 and 3 7 to about 1 4bn and 25 7bn respectively liabilities increased by 14 2 to about 225 5bn at end of june 2018 from about 197 4bn at end of june 2017 the increase was mainly driven by portfolio investments in egypt increasing by 56 8 to about 33 6bn other investment liabilities increasing by 11 9 to about 78 3bn and fdis in egypt increasing by 7 2 to about 113 6bn egypt s negative net iip to the gdp at end of june 2018 increased to about 58 9 from about 55 8 at end of june 2017 assets to liabilities increased to about 34 7 at end of june 2018 from about 33 6 at end of june 2017 external liquidity with regards to nirs the cbe s decision to unpeg the egyptian pound led to the steady accumulation of foreign currency reserves through the formal channels during fy 2017 18 nirs remained on the rise increasing by around 13bn against 13 8bn a year earlier to reach 44 3bn thus covering 8 4 months of merchandise imports at end of june 2018 the increase was a result of the rise in foreign currencies

79bn at end of june 2017 this increase came as a result of the rise in net disbursements of loans and facilities by 13 2bn alongside the depreciation of most currencies of borrowing versus the us dollar by 0 4bn by original maturity external debt reaffirmed its usual pattern of long term external debt predominance at end of june 2018 long term external debt accounted for 69bn or 74 5 of the total external debt whereas medium term external debt reached 11 3bn or 12 2 and short term external debt accounted for 12 3bn or 13 3 by residual maturity medium and long term external debt decreased

this book by thomas piketty was first published in 2014 and became an instant best seller it had taken the author some 15 years to research and complete and deserves a detailed attention and analysis rather than the usual one off production line tracts which are read and instantly forgotten piketty describes the end of an old epoch the rise of the new the golden age of welfare capitalism le trente glorieuses the keynes beveridge consensus call it what you will circa 1945 1975 and the re emergence of a second rentier capitalism regime which began the early 1980s using apposite literary references to writers of the first gilded age he quotes it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife jane austen pride and prejudice an immortal sentence which says a thousand words such was the moral zeitgeist in europe during the 19th century piketty then drives home the point by adding honorė de balzac s novel pėre goriot which focuses on the decadent money grubbing dispensation of the bourbon restoration arguably the moral climate hasn t appreciably changed in our money worshipping age but the origins of a good fortune has what concerns piketty is the source and nature of this good fortune which is so sought after and also where this latest historical configuration is leading the world of austen and balzac lasted from roughly 1870 1910 representing the first belle époque of rentier capitalism the system involves ownership of capital assets in the 19th century mainly land and living from the rent in the broad sense derived from these assets latterly in what is the second golden age of the rentier regime the capital asset base has changed from simply land to ownership of financial assets real estate stocks and bonds and high corporate incomes this is not to say that the old rentier classes have ceased to exist but they have been supplemented by an emergent new class of hedge fund managers corporate executives and ceos investment bank chiefs and former entrepreneurs like bill gates which for a better term we will call the working rich as piketty explains the top decile 10 always encompasses two different worlds the 9 in which income from labour predominates and the 1 of true rentiers in which income from capital becomes progressively more important thus former entrepreneurs such as bill gates cease to live off their labour as their accumulation of capital enables them to enter the genuine rentier class the class able to live off capital the new rentiers would also include heiresses such as liliane bettencourt of l oreal and paris hilton neither of whom have ever done a day s work in their lives consequently the rentier class grows with every passage of successful entrepreneurs entering its ranks it might also be added that there has also been the rise of a parasitic speculative financial sector class who make a living by purchasing and selling various asset classes in the main stocks property and bonds historically speaking piketty asserts that the trend line for return on capital has been 4 5 this has been an historical fact rather than some inexorable law whereas growth has lagged at 1 to 1 5 this process is expressed in the equation r g where r is return on capital and g is growth accumulated capital as stock has tended to increase as a ratio to income as flow moreover the distribution of national income gdp has become increasingly skewed to the top decile according to piketty this has been a technical as well as a social political process the consequences of which will be profound when the rate of return on capital significantly exceeds the growth rate of the economy as it did throughout history up to and including the 19th century and as is likely to be the case in the 21st century then it logically follows that inherited wealth grows faster than output and income under such conditions it is almost inevitable that inherited wealth will dominate wealth amassed from a lifetime s labour by a wide margin and that the concentration of capital will attain extremely high levels levels potentially incompatible with the meritocratic values and principles of social justice fundamental to modern democratic societies the rise of the neo rentier sector i e finance insurance and real estate f i r e consisting of banks credit agencies investment companies brokers and dealers of commodities and securities security and commodity exchanges insurance agents buyers sellers lessors lessees and so forth has now reached such a level that it has become larger more ubiquitous and profitable than productive industry prior to the ascent of financialised capitalism and the deregulation and privatisation mania racket the role of finance was usually restricted to greasing the wheels of the productive value creating economy commercial banks took the publics deposits and funnelled it as credit into manufacturing and commercial enterprises in this regulated environment commercial banks and other financial institutions were legally circumscribed in the level of credit they could extend this development was in large part given additional impetus by the big bang a term used in reference to the sudden deregulation of financial markets by margaret thatcher s administration in 1986 finance was off the leash instead of producing real value as embodied in goods and services selling of ownership titles and tapping into income streams was to become the chosen field of investment thus the rentier class both then and now accumulates and lives off what david ricardo 1772 1823 once described as economic rent income in his time derived from land ownership rent in this sense should be understood as a payment over and above the costs of ownership to the aristocratic land owning rentier class who don t actually produce any value as such but economic rent is not restricted to land tenure it is any income flow which contains a surplus increment over and above the costs of production maintenance and ownership thus monopolies and oligopolistic corporate structures are able to gouge economic rent from captive consumers as for banks they produce little in terms of value loan money into existence and draw rental interest from these loans mainly mortgages it should be emphasised that economic rent is not be confused with profit in marxist terms surplus value profit involves the production of wealth and expansion of capital rent is merely an extraction of wealth it does not create any new value employees of goldman sachs or any other financial institution do not produce profit they produce rental monetary flows which are in fact a cost levied on productive value creation the financial sector in this sense is purely bloodsucking on the productive sector of the economy not that this contemporary rentier regime has always had its own way at a guess and with due deference to mr p i would say that the democratisation and equalisation process which ended the first epoch of the rentier ancien regime began with roosevelt s new deal 1933 and continued during the war and post 1945 the profound shocks both political and social of the period 1914 1945 tended to narrow both the capital income ratio and the grotesquely unequal share of the rentier classes in national income gdp these shocks were of both a technical and political nature high rates of growth are both cause and effect of deep going economic social and political change primarily war preparation for war and post war reconstruction new economic functions and innovations were of necessity constantly being created and new skills were needed education perforce became more widespread and compulsory as the system revolutionised itself from within and new classes and work methods emerged which required increased rates of social mobility in this sense the permanent revolution in the economic structures gave rise to changes in the occupational political and social structures this process tended to spread the social product more evenly tilting it towards more egalitarian levels additionally political developments trade unions workers political parties and movements and the growing militancy of the working class tended to add an additional momentum to this process the increasing state regulation of the system which now introduced progressive taxation and the number of lost fortunes during the depression years in addition to the capital destruction during world wars 1 and 2 resulted in the ancien regime of rentierdom undergoing a severe contraction unfortunately this was not to be a permanent fait accompli as revisionists like the labour party grandee anthony crosland and his epigones imagined from 1980 2010 reactionary forces were to a significant extent able to re establish the status quo ante the neo liberal counter revolution eventually overturned the post 1945 settlement and became the new orthodoxy it was a return to business as usual but considerably more ruthless this new age did not brook failure or poverty in the words of the late freddie mercury and queen the band there was no time for losers pikkety s mooted solution to this inexorable increase in income and wealth inequality is a progressive tax on capital which will it is argued prevent the ultimately unsustainable mal distribution of wealth into fewer and fewer hands this land tax policy was very widespread during the 19th century it was a view shared by ricardo and j s mill who noted the injustice of those landowners who enriched themselves in their sleep one of the leading proponents of this theory was henry george 1839 1897 the american land reformer as contained in his popular writings and who at the time was giving spellbinding performances during a lecture tour of england in 1882 in addition to land tax piketty stipulates taxes on capital which would generally include any levy on the flow of income from capital such as corporate income tax as well as tax on capital stock such as real estate tax and or a wealth tax capital controls could be used to stop inflows and outflows of hot money which has been largely a function of tax competition between states and a generally destabilising force a contemporary of pikkety michael hudson argues along the same lines volumes ii and iii of marx s capital describe how debt grows exponentially burdening the economy with carrying charges this overhead is subjecting today s western finance capitalist economies to austerity shrinking living standards and capital investment while increasing their cost of living and doing business that is the main reason why they are losing their export markets and becoming de industrialized the most pressing policy challenge is to keep down the cost of housing rising housing prices mean larger and larger debts extracting interest out of the economy the strongest way to prevent this is to tax away the rise in land prices collecting the rental value for the government instead of letting it be pledged to the banks as mortgage interest the same logic applies to public collection of natural resource and monopoly rents failure to tax them away will enable banks to create debt against these rents building financial and other rentier charges into the pricing of basic needs ergo the best protection against this rentier burden is simple first tax away the land s rising rental valuation to prevent it from being paid out for bank loans and second keep control of banks in public hands credit is necessary but should be directed productively and debts written down when paying them threatens to create financial armageddon agreed all very well and good however at this point i must raise a particular issue piketty like j a hobson sismondi keynes and most other underconsumption theorists tended to think of capitalism s malfunctions as problems of distribution no problems were apparently situated on the supply side production of the economy this i believe is a glaring oversight for it is the case that capitalism does have supply side malfunctions which lead to a secular tendency toward stagnation regardless of the level of aggregate demand this has been pointed out by inter alia ricardo diminishing returns keynes the collapse in the marginal efficiency of capital schumpeter disappearing investment opportunities marx the tendency of the rate of profit to fall none of which warrant a mention in the reformers lexicon see further below as an aside these theories are much to detailed to go into and beyond the scope of this article i m not trying to squirm out but deserved to be mentioned and form an article in their own right one day moreover the problem of increasing secular stagnation tends to be viewed as being a fundamentally technical problem all that was needed was just get the macro economic and fiscal variables correctly lined up and bingo problem solved once all the technical ducks were in a row it was possible to have a system which produced the goods ad infinitum this is not how capitalism particularly in its mature i e stagnant stage really works however the system is characterised by laws of motion internal and intrinsic to the system this raises the question whether capitalism like the eu can really be reformed at all one v i lenin certainly didn t think so it goes without saying that if capitalism could develop agriculture which today is everywhere lagging terribly behind industry if it could raise the living standard of the masses who in spite of technical progress are everywhere half starved and poverty stricken there would be no question of a surplus of capital this argument is very often advanced by petit bourgeois critics of capitalism but if capitalism did these things it would not be capitalism for both uneven development and semi starvation levels of existence levels of the masses particularly in the third world my emphasis fl are inevitable conditions and constitute the premises of this mode of production as long as capitalism remains what it is surplus capital will be utilised not for the purposes of raising the standard of living of the masses in a given country for this would mean a decline in the profits for the capitalists but for the purpose of increasing profits by exporting capital abroad to the backward countries at the present time debt is growing faster than output in an attempt to obviate the onset of diminishing returns or in marx s terms the tendency of the rate of profit to fall see both the work of david harvey and michael roberts us public debt to gdp ratio was 30 in 1980 it is now in 2019 105 the us sovereign debt is bigger than its gdp let s not even go to private debt and unfunded future liabilities social security medicare and medicaid it might frighten the children profitability which drives corporate investment has declined and resulted in spare capacity since as profits fall so does investment corporations therefore attempted to fatten up the bottom line by launching the offensive against organized labour by pushing down wages and working conditions moved offshore to take advantage of lower costs clamoured for corporate tax cuts bought back their own stocks with free money courtesy of the central bank to push up stock prices as well as engaging in some very dubious mergers and acquisitions in an attempt to restore profitability or at the least to stay solvent thus we have the emergence of a late capitalist zombie economy low interest rates create zombie companies weak businesses survive when they ought to have gone out of business directing cash flow to cover interest on loans but not the principal that cannot be repaid but that banks will not write off with capital tied up banks reduce lending to productive enterprises especially small and medium sized ones which account for a large proportion of economic activity and employment firms do not dispose of or restructure unproductive investments the creative destruction of the slump when businesses of this type go out of existence and debts are wiped out and the reallocation of resources necessary to restore the economy does not for better or worse take place today thus a zombie economy where failed businesses are kept artificially afloat is one where the necessary adjustments including liquidation of unproductive enterprises and assets are allowed to continue and the necessary restructuring fails to take place this thus results in a semi permanent depressed conditions until the next downturn comes along all very austrian but it has to be said basically correct a debt saturated economy will increasingly stagnate debts must be written off or restructured as the sine qua non for any genuine recovery under neoliberalism fat chance additionally the problem is as much political and ideological as technical history clearly evinces that the ruling elites will not give up their wealth and power without a tenacious struggle and moreover they won t hesitate to use extra parliamentary methods to defend their privileges the programme advanced by piketty whilst worthwhile in a technical sense is weak in political content in terms of what a popular resistance to the status quo would look like he poses the question can we imagine a 21st century in which capitalism will be transcended in a more peaceful and more lasting way or must we simply await the next crisis or the next war this time truly global on the basis of history which i have brought to light here can we imagine political institutions that might regulate today s global patrimonial capitalism justly as well as efficiently good question which brings us to the class struggle mindful of the expected petit bourgeois sniggers one of the great political truisms is that substantial economic social and political reforms tend to be achieved by a combination of irresistible and often extra parliamentary pressure from below without the mass movement and without the theoretical direction and programme of such a movement such well intentioned well thought out and sensible policies seldom get off the ground such was the essence and creation of the trente glorieuses 1945 1975 resulting from the new deal in the us in the 1930s and roosevelt s reforms and in 1945 of a strong labour party government and trade union bloc committed to fundamental reform under the theoretical tutelage of j m keynes economic policies and william lord beveridge s social policies which provided a theoretical rationale for this movement which was to lead to a fundamental changes in both the us 1930s and uk 1940s and western europe as a whole alas this epoch is no more it was swept away by the thatcher reagan counter revolution of the 1980s yet it still remains the blueprint for a more humane and rational society europe will i believe be the crucible for this struggle which in fact is already starting game on notes rentier capitalism refers to the derivation of rent from possession of assets that are scarce or artificially made scarce most familiar is rental income from land property minerals or financial investments but other sources have grown too they include the income lenders gain from debt interest income from ownership of intellectual

capitalist road by michael hudson wednesday may 2 2018 peking university 2018 under consumption theory is based upon the premise that capitalist crises are caused by insufficient aggregate demand in terms of both investment and consumption this is however a half truth what needs explaining is why during an upswing particularly when it reaches its most febrile levels of expansion aggregate demand disappears marx points out that it is sheer tautology to say that crises are caused by the scarcity of effective consumption or of effective consumers the capitalist system does not know any other modes of consumption that are not effective are always preceded by precisely a period in which wages rise generally and that the working class gets a greater share of that part of the annual product which is intended by consumption from the point of view of those advocates of sound and simple common sense such a period should rather remove the crisis marx capital volume 2 p414 exactly so increasing and unstoppable aggregate demand eventually arrives at the inflexion point when asset prices outpace corporate and individual ability to earn and or borrow sufficient funds to support such price levels then the whole upswing of the boom bust cycle goes into reverse from the glut of aggregated demand to a scarcity of aggregate demand and the descent into bust this was also a view voiced by keynes when he spoke of the collapse in the marginal efficiency of capital i suggest that a more typical and often more predominant explanation of the crisis is not primarily due to a rise in the rate of interest but a sudden collapse in the marginal efficiency of capital the general theory p315 this bears comparison with marx s theory of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall and ricardo s theory of diminishing marginal returns all of which attributed causes of capitalism s to supply side conditions as well as demand side factors in the boe paper the two economists point out that the rate of return on capital has fallen since the early 1990s but not by as much as the risk free interest rate so that the cost of borrowing for risky investment has increased by around 100bps in other words the cost of borrowing to invest has stayed up while profitability on investment has fallen squeezing the profitability of enterprise and lowering the incentive to invest the boe paper refers to

this is the first article in an occasional series exploring wealth and income inequality in connecticut and its impact on a state struggling to cope with massive debt even within a nation racing dangerously toward unprecedented levels of income and wealth inequality connecticut stands apart the gap between its richest and poorest citizens and that between the top and the middle class outstrips those in most other states and in many other corners of the globe since the last recession inequality in connecticut has not been a simple case of hedge fund principals reaping rewards that dwarf a still prosperous middle class rather only the richest of connecticut s most affluent households on average have improved their standing while economists and politicians differ over how to address the problem those on all sides of the inequality debate generally agree there is an economic tipping point when disparities become too extreme and too many are struggling when adequate investment in human capital higher education adequate health care and decent housing are impossible because of debt or under employment inequality becomes a significant drag on economic growth further complicating connecticut s struggle with accelerating inequality the state is divvying up responsibility for paying a historic bill brought on by its own fiscal imprudence over decades unprecedented pension and other debt costs that already are placing extreme pressure on services and taxpayers how to address economic inequality and a crushing debt at the same time will be at the core of connecticut s political debate for years to come some warn against expensive government social programs and economically stifling taxes that could drive connecticut s richest citizens from the state in droves others counter that inequality not only takes a heavy toll in human collateral damage galvanizing racial divides and restricting access to health care education and affordable housing but also undermines connecticut s economy faster than any potential exodus of millionaires collectively these trends threaten more than connecticut s most vulnerable citizens but also the state s economic future inequality is one of the reasons the world s falling apart fred carstensen connecticut center for economic analysis these structural issues apart from the business cycle the high cost of doing business demographic shifts the unfunded liabilities are pulling at the very fabric of the connecticut economy said don klepper smith an economist with datacore partners who served as chief economic advisor to gov m jodi rell these things exert pressure on the quality of life in connecticut inequality said fred v carstensen who heads the connecticut center for economic analysis at the university of connecticut is one of the reasons the world s falling apart the income inequality pendulum of the last century inequality of resources has been a source of tension sometimes subtle and sometimes overt throughout history just as some say greater rewards are crucial to encourage people to work harder others say extreme disparities leave too many unable to prosper sinking into despair and dependence upon others but over the last century inequality of income how much a household earns or receives annually from various sources has largely been a two part story between 1928 one year before the stock market crash that launched the great depression and 1979 disparities in income steadily shrank nationally and in every state except alaska according to a 2016 analysis by the economic policy institute of washington d c a nonprofit nonpartisan think tank rising minimum wages low unemployment after the 1930s and widespread growth in collective bargaining in private industries shifted the landscape dramatically but since then the pendulum has swung toward inequality and has accelerated considerably since the last recession ended nearly one decade ago over the five decades ending in 1979 the top 1 percent saw their share of the nation s income decline the epi study reported in connecticut it fell from 24 percent to 11 percent over that period between 1979 and 2013 though the top 1 percent rebounded to 20 percent of all income nationally and nearly 30 percent in connecticut why did conditions flip flop economists cite several reasons globalization of trade in the last 40 years the nation s economy has become increasingly reliant on imports particularly from china reducing the number of domestic jobs available since the late 1990s the nation s trade deficit generally has worsened and a rebound in 2008 and 2009 was not enough to reverse that trend meanwhile economists say lost manufacturing and computer software jobs often have been replaced by lower paying service sector positions government institutions starting in the late 1970s and accelerating with the presidencies of ronald reagan and george h w bush u s governmental policies have emphasized deregulation de unionization and less progressive income tax rates technology and education as technology advances the need for many jobs particularly among unskilled workers is eliminated a march 2017 forecast from pricewaterhousecoopers warned that 38 percent of u s jobs are at high risk of automation by the early 2030s meanwhile the cost of public colleges and universities rose faster than inflation as state governments generally asked families to absorb more college costs the rate of annual growth for college tuition nationally between 1980 and 2014 more than doubled that of overall inflation according to the u s department of education wealth concentration this theory holds that inequality tends to worsen in a vicious cycle in most cases newly created wealth is concentrated among the already wealthy who have the resources necessary to invest in new products services and skills inequality explodes with the great recession while it took about three and a half decades to roll back the push toward equality from the previous 50 years it was the four years beginning with the last recession that really left its mark simply put the trend toward inequality shifted into high gear as the country and connecticut entered its worst economic downturn in eight decades the top 1 percent nationally captured 85 percent of all income growth between 2009 and 2013 leaving the remaining 99 percent on average to share the remaining 15 percent according to the epi analysis overall the top 1 percent nationally emerged earning 25 3 times annually what the bottom 99 percent earned on average but in 10 states including connecticut the numbers were even more extreme here the top 1 percent took home 100 percent of the income growth over that period specifically the top 1 percent got 17 2 percent richer on average while the remaining 99 percent didn t grow more slowly they actually got poorer losing 1 6 percent of their income in connecticut the top 1 percent out earned the rest by 42 6 to 1 one of just six states with a gap greater than 30 to 1 only in neighboring new york was the ratio higher at 45 4 to 1 and connecticut s wealthiest out earned their new york neighbors on average by almost 400 000 who are the top 1 percent the average income of the top 1 percent of households in connecticut was 2 4 million in 2013 while the bottom 99 percent average 56 445 according to epi nationally the top 1 percent earned 1 15 million on average while the bottom 99 made 45 567 just to make the cut in connecticut it meant a household income had to top 659 979 nationally the bar was set at 389 436 a 2016 analysis from connecticut voices for children a new haven based progressive public policy advocacy group found the ratio at its most extreme in fairfield county where much of the state s wealth and its financial services sector is located the average income of the top 1 percent in fairfield county was 6 06 million 73 7 times greater than the 82 222 average income for the bottom 99 percent wealth gives you a cushion but carstensen said the problem of income inequality is modest when set against wealth disparities think of wealth inequality as income inequality s big brother while income is limited to the earnings one household receives over a set time usually a year wealth incorporates stocks property and other assets a household possesses as well as the mortgages and debts that burden it blighted buildings face bridgeport s superior court on golden hill street it gives you a cushion carstensen said if you don t have wealth if you don t have assets against which you can draw so you can balance things out over a longer time period you are living literally paycheck to paycheck one popular barometer of wealth in the u s is forbes magazine s list of the nation s 400 wealthiest americans in 1982 the average member of that list had a net worth of 230 million by 2016 the average member was worth 6 billion after adjusting for inflation and needed at least 1 7 billion just to make the list according to the congressional budget office the top 10 percent of the nation s richest families held two thirds of the nation s wealth in 1989 compared to 30 percent for those in the 51st through 90th percentiles and 3 percent for the bottom half by 2013 the split was 76 percent for the top 10 percent 23 percent for the 51st through 90th percentiles and just 1 percent for the rest over that period wealth had grown by 153 percent in the top group and 4 percent in the middle while the bottom half s holdings had declined by 19 percent for the middle class declines in housing values took a big bite out of their overall wealth and for both the middle class and the poor non mortgage debt credit card balances consumer loans and student loans became a much bigger problem the cbo found that especially after 2007 the numbers of families with more debt than assets increased as did their average indebtedness for example 8 percent of families had more debts than assets in 2007 and they were 20 000 in debt on average by 2012 it had grown to 12 percent of families with an average of 32 000 in debt and for the poorest 25 percent of americans families held an average debt of just 1 000 in 1989 2 000 by 2007 and 13 000 by 2013 impacts of wealth inequality are broad while many studies break income inequality down along state lines few do so when it comes to wealth still there is evidence that many of the national wealth trends are reflected here how connecticut responds to growing wealth and income inequality may be the defining debate that charts the state s future for many years to come according to ellen shemitz executive director of connecticut voices for children why because although connecticut has a reputation for having a very generous safety net for the poor and disabled it is not what it used to be social service advocates say connecticut has on average a child poverty rate of 15 percent one in seven kids raised under these circumstances this is better than the national average which is closer to one in five but some sections of connecticut are well below the national average in bridgeport the ratio is one in three in hartford it is about 1 in 2 or 53 percent a university of connecticut analysis in 2011 just after the great recession found that despite having the highest per capita income of any state connecticut ranked among the bottom four in terms of the percentage of that income used to fund public services we re really not doing well and in fact a lot of people are doing worse said jim horan executive director of the connecticut association for human services it s not just because high income people are getting wealthier child poverty levels have increased statewide by 50 percent since 2000 horan said with lower and middle income households in connecticut losing income on average during the first four years after the last recession and with debt costs steadily absorbing more of the state budget social services advocates say the trend is clear higher education quality elementary and secondary schools health care decent housing and retirement security are becoming harder for many connecticut households to attain in addition shemitz said wealth disparities galvanize racial divides in so many of these areas harming many households now and threatening the state s economic future research is clear that when children don t have a fair start in life when they are born into difficult circumstances there s so many barriers to their success shemitz said and those barriers end up impeding not only their progress but the health of the entire community and the state elementary and secondary education harding high school in bridgeport a coalition of parents teachers and local elected officials has asked the state supreme court to reconsider its january ruling that the state provides students from impoverished communities the minimally adequate education the connecticut constitution requires the justices denied that request at the same time a report from connecticut voices showed suspension rates in the state are four times higher for black students than for whites chronic absenteeism is 2 1 2 times higher graduation rates are 16 percent less and black students comprise just 7 percent of gifted and talent enrollment in connecticut schools educators long have argued children from poverty stricken neighborhoods are more are risk of developmental delays poor nutrition and many other obstacles to learning than students from more affluent suburbs typically face and they also insist there is a correlation between these problems and communities taxable property wealth in other words those municipalities with a more valuable tax base usually have students on average with fewer impediments to learning meanwhile lower and middle income families also are struggling with higher education costs tuition and fees at public colleges and universities rose dramatically after the last recession between 2010 and 2017 tuition and mandatory fees for an in state resident attending the university of connecticut rose by 35 percent over the same period the increases for the connecticut state university and community college systems were 25 percent and 23 percent respectively according to the nonprofit institute for college access and success the average debt held by a connecticut resident graduating college public or private rose from 18 906 in 2004 to 29 750 in 2014 that 57 percent increase was topped by graduates from just six other states a lack of retirement security another major change in the 1990s and the 2000s involved a major overhaul of the private pension system according to a 2014 analysis of wealth by the national bureau of economic research 46 percent of all households held a defined benefit pension plan in 1989 but just 34 percent did by 2007 and the u s bureau of labor statistics reported in 2013 that among private sector workers those covered by pensions fell to just 18 percent down from roughly double that figure in the early 1990s many of these pension plans were replaced with defined contribution plans typically 401 k s and individual retirement accounts or iras the share of households with these plans nationally rose from 24 percent in 1989 to 53 percent by 2007 this is key the bureau analysis asserts because pension wealth is not included in most standard measures of overall household wealth but 401 k and ira plans are which is likely to lead to an overstatement of the true gains in household wealth in other words some of the wealth that middle class and poor households reportedly gained in the 1990s and 2000s simply involved the substitution of one retirement plan for another in 2016 the connecticut legislature began a process to make government administered 401 k style benefits available to private sector workers who lack access to any type of retirement plan comptroller kevin p lembo estimates close to 600 000 connecticut residents need this alternative there is an entire generation of employees many of them lifelong hardworking middle class people who are headed to retirement financially unequipped in part due to lack of access to a workplace based retirement savings option the comptroller said when the program was authorized preserving access to health care access to sufficient health insurance carstensen said is another key factor in wealth disparity across the united states in many cases a majority of low income households debt involves health care bills in arrears and while connecticut s reputation is one of having one of the most generous social safety nets in the nation its track record has been a mixed bag since the last recession according to patricia baker president and ceo of the nonprofit connecticut health foundation the federal affordable care act added medicaid coverage for an estimated 200 000 connecticut residents with 90 percent of the funding needed to cover that provided by washington we have an infusion of funding we need to be grateful for baker said but at the same time connecticut has begun to peel back assistance for some of its poorest working residents despite pledges from gov dannel p malloy and others not to shred the safety net what we have seen in terms of state revenue the dollars available to keep that safety net in place have continued to be eroded and eroded baker said in 2015 connecticut legislators tightened eligibility for the husky a program reducing medicaid health coverage for an estimated 23 700 adults earning between 201 percent and 155 percent of the federal poverty level in 2015 dollars that meant a family of three earning between 40 380 and 31 139 lost coverage and health care advocates also estimate 80 percent of those removed from the rolls could not afford to purchase insurance on the state s health care exchange lawmakers ordered a second tightening in 2017 from 155 percent to 138 percent of the federal poverty level a limit of 28 676 for a family of three this would have removed coverage for another 13 500 families but the general assembly reversed that decision in early may but baker said the problem goes far beyond the husky program federally qualified health centers and school based clinics here have lost significant funding since the last recession and these are key access points for health care for minority adults and children five cities in connecticut contain more than 50 percent of the state s medicaid population she said i don t think anybody wants this to happen necessarily but you see this gradual death by 1 000 cuts she said adding connecticut cannot solve its fiscal crisis solely through austerity are taxes a dirty word baker said you have this narrative of how taxed we are and we don t have the ability to create revenues at the same time we are facing increased pressures around the state budget who pays for ct s huge fiscal mess looming behind all of these inequalities are two huge challenges the first is to figure out who is going to pay the bill for state government s massive debt most of which is tied to poorly funded retirement benefit programs connecticut has nearly 80 billion in long term obligations a burden the state commission on fiscal stability and economic growth says is closer to 100 billion if more realistic assumptions are applied to pension fund investment projections analysts say paying pensions for municipal teachers and pensions and retirement health care for state employees will place unprecedented pressure on state finances for the next 15 to 20 years all of these programs suffer from more than seven decades of inadequate savings ordered by numerous legislatures and governors in 2007 just before the last recession retirement benefit costs and payments on bonded debt represented about 17 percent of the budget s general fund one year ago they had topped 30 percent and even after a major union concessions plan and a deal to defer billions of dollars in pension contributions until after 2032 these expenses still eat up more than 28 percent of the general fund not surprisingly legislators other state officials unions study panels and various advocacy groups have spent much of the past few years trying to solve one question how should the bill for connecticut s legacy of debt get divvied up and should wealth and income be a factor in determining who pays public sector employee unions legislators from connecticut s poorest districts social service advocates continue to press for higher taxes on wealthy households don williams of the cea the income tax avoidance industry for the wealthiest taxpayers has flourished since the inception of the state income tax in 1991 the income tax avoidance industry for the wealthiest taxpayers has flourished donald williams executive director of the connecticut education association said in february while testifying before the state s fiscal stability panel in 1991 just before legislators established the state income tax connecticut taxed large earnings tied to capital gains and dividends as high as 7 and 14 percent respectively but once the income tax was established nearly all earnings were subject to the same flat 4 5 percent rate in other words wealthy households with huge investment related income received an enormous state tax break even at present 27 years later the top marginal rate on the state income tax is 6 99 percent hartford attorney daniel livingston who bargains for all state employee unions on benefits rejected the argument that connecticut s rich will flee if taxed more citing a 2016 study by stanford university and u s treasury analysts it concluded that while the wealthy do monitor state tax rates the magnitude of the migration response is small and has little effect on the millionaire tax base elites are embedded in the regions where they achieve success and they have limited interest in moving to procure tax advantages but businesses most republican legislators and a fair number of democrats in state government including malloy urge varying degrees of caution about asking the wealthy to pay more the fiscal stability panel sparked fierce debate but little consensus earlier this spring the 14 member commission s report featured a wide array of recommendations centered on a major redistribution of state taxes primarily reducing income tax rates across the board while boosting the sales and corporation levies but because the wealthy pay the majority of state income taxes they also would benefit disproportionately from a rate reduction and even though the panel recommended raising the state s minimum wage to 15 per hour critics said overall it was a blueprint to worsen inequality in connecticut the more you make the more you pay that s my response to that report said rep robyn porter d new haven that s common sense and you know we don t have a lot of that in this building rep robyn porter d new haven right the more you make the more you pay a member of the legislature s appropriations committee porter took the fiscal stability panel to task during a march 23 public hearing porter questioned why the commission says the income tax adjustments and other changes that benefit the wealthy such as eliminating tax on estates valued at more than 2 million should occur quickly while a proposal to bolster the minimum wage to 15 per hour should be implemented gradually taking until 2022 why do we have to wait why do they get immediate relief and we get gradual relief she asked adding that severe income inequality also strongly reinforces racial inequality having a strong economy makes us able to make the kind of investments in cities you would like to make commission co chairman jim smith who also is chairman and former ceo of webster bank responded to porter cindi bigelow ceo of bigelow tea and a member of the state s fiscal stability panel put it more succinctly at a commission meeting earlier in the year we want to make sure we are protecting the wealthy because they will just leave she said ray dalio founder of westport based bridgewater associates one of the world s largest hedge funds asserts connecticut s wealth dilemma is more complicated than that in a december op ed piece in valuewalk com an online financial services news site dalio wrote that connecticut and other states that face higher federal tax burdens because of the new limits on state and local tax deductions face a quandary these states can neither cut their financial supports to the have nots because their conditions are already unacceptably low nor raise taxes on the haves because they will move due to tax rates dalio whom bloomberg listed as one of the world s 100 wealthiest people wrote it is financially smart for high income taxpayers to escape these taxes and debt burdens by moving to lower tax and less indebted locations so they do because both the remaining high income and low income folks are increasingly stressed and tend to blame the other tensions rise which makes these environments even more inhospitable but carstensen said there is almost no evidence that state and local tax rates have any influence on where you live the biggest driver is where your job is and if your job is in connecticut or on wall street you re not going to relocate finding a balance in connecticut so what s the solution how do you reduce inequality and boost economic growth when major tax hikes while helping with the former would be a drag on the latter there s consensus there are no easy remedies to severe income and wealth inequality let alone in a state grappling with major debt issues the centerpiece of the fiscal stability commission s plan was a major redistribution of state taxes primarily reducing income tax rates across the board while boosting the sales and corporation levies but it ran into criticism from legislators from both parties for different reasons because the wealthy pay the majority of state income taxes they also would benefit disproportionately from a rate reduction while the middle class pays much of the sales tax democrats objected to this shift some republicans balked at raising the sales and corporation taxes after big state tax increases in 2011 and 2015 to close major projected deficits legislators and malloy have steered clear of big hikes in the last three years and focused on spending cuts but legislators from both parties have acknowledged that state finances are not projected to remain stable and connecticut s recovery from the last recession still lags the nation having regained just 80 percent of jobs lost from the last downturn connecticut is the only state that has not achieved a full recovery a 2014 study of the u s and 22 other countries in north america and europe suggested a different tack targeting the lower portion of the inequality spectrum according to the organisation for economic cooperation and development a progressive policy think tank based in paris the key lies in reducing income disparities at the bottom of the income distribution countries that had dramatically reduced poverty enjoyed more robust economic growth than those that had produced extreme degrees of income inequality some degree of tax hikes by raising top marginal rates and closing deductions which tend to benefit high earners disproportionally may well be necessary but the other key is to use those funds to increase access to public services including high quality education job training transportation and health care it is not just poverty the incomes of the lowest 10 percent of the population that inhibits growth the study states policymakers need to be concerned about the bottom 40 percent more generally including the vulnerable lower middle classes at risk of failing to benefit from the recovery and future growth anti poverty programs will not be enough connecticut is not doing enough to prevent the hollowing out of the middle class carstensen said adding that simply trying to keep tax rates down and attract more multi millionaires to the state isn t the answer if warren buffett moved to connecticut it would not change the calculus he said if you don t have people working in connecticut if you don t have people making a reasonably good income in connecticut then you are going to have a revenue problem the second article in this series to be published wednesday will examine vast disparities in municipal spending and the resources available to connecticut s poorest cities and most affluent towns future elements of this issue we plan to explore how wealth and income inequality galvanize the racial divide in connecticut the struggles of connecticut s poor and middle income families to preserve access to quality education health care and social services the debate over raising tax rates on rich households and major corporations amid fears of an accelerating wealth exodus from connecticut the competing theories of how the state should resolve massive public sector pension obligations and

it was a roller coaster ride for the rupee in 2018 the currency plummeted over 14 per cent during the year to record an all time low of 74 48 against the dollar in october 2018 however it managed to clawback from these depths to close 2018 at 69 77 with 8 5 per cent loss the year 2019 has not been too good for the rupee so far the currency has failed to gain momentum and reversed lower again after making a high of 69 23 against the dollar in early january it is down about 2 per cent so far this year what drove the rupee in 2018 and what s in store for it in 2019 an analysis the drivers in 2018 crude oil is india s biggest import component as such oil price remained the most important mover of the rupee all through 2018 brent crude oil prices surging 45 per cent from 60 a barrel to 87 a barrel made india s oil import bill soar 38 per cent from 10 3 billion in december 2017 to 14 2 billion in october 2018 the trade deficit widened from 14 billion to 17 billion over the same period as a result the current account deficit cad rose from 13 7 billion in december 2017 to 19 1 billion in september 2018 the widening twin deficits trade and current account dragged the rupee to its all time low of 74 48 against the dollar by october last year however the crash in oil prices by about 43 per cent from 87 to 50 by december eased the trade deficit towards 13 billion by december this in turn helped the rupee recover from its all time low towards the end of 2018 the second major driver of the rupee in 2018 was foreign portfolio investors fpis sales in indian debt and equities after pumping in a robust 23 billion in the indian debt segment in 2017 fpis pulled out 6 9 billion in 2018 the highest outflow since 2013 and the second highest outflow on record from the data available since 2002 the equity segment saw an outflow for the first time since 2011 the fpis sold 4 3 billion in indian equities last year indeed the combined debt and equity outflow of 11 25 billion is the highest recorded from the data available since 2002 along with the oil price and the fpi money outflow the strength of the dollar also weighed on the rupee though the us dollar index fell in the initial part of 2018 it managed to reverse sharply higher from february the index surged 10 per cent from around 88 last february to the current levels of 97 what s in store in 2019 oil price will continue to largely influence the rupee movement but the outlook for oil prices remains mixed the supply glut and weak demand due to slowdown in global growth may keep prices subdued the us energy information administration eia forecasts the world oil supply to exceed demand by 0 44 million barrels per day mbpd in 2019 and by 0 63 mbpd in 2020 it also expects oil prices this year to remain subdued compared to 2018 brent crude oil prices are expected to average around 61 a barrel this year and 62 a barrel in 2020 way lower than the average prices of 71 per barrel seen in 2018 this will keep a lid on the country s oil import bill and in turn stabilise both the current account and trade deficits and avert the sharp depreciation of the rupee against the dollar but any further production cuts from the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec and event risks such as the on going supply disruption from us sanctions on venezuela may trigger a rise in oil prices in such a scenario the rupee can fall since the currency has a strong negative correlation with oil global slowdown the other major concern that has been emerging over the last few months is the global economic slowdown the international monetary fund imf has slashed the global growth outlook for 2019 to 3 5 per cent from its earlier forecast of 3 7 per cent major economies such as the us the uk and the european union eu have also cut their growth forecast for 2019 the federal reserve expects us growth to slow down to 2 1 per cent in 2019 after growing at a pace of 2 5 per cent in 2018 similarly the eu and the uk s growth forecasts have also been slashed recently the bank of england cut its growth forecast for the uk in 2019 to 1 2 per cent from its earlier projection of 1 7 per cent the eu on the other hand expects the euro zone to grow at a much slower rate of 1 3 per cent down from its previous forecast of 1 9 per cent growth on the one hand global slowdown can result in low oil demand which in turn can bring down the prices this is a positive for the rupee on the other hand the dollar may gain on safe haven demand in such a scenario also slowdown in the uk and the eu may hit india s exports as europe accounts for an average of 20 per cent of india s total exports and the share of the north american region averages about 17 per cent so broadly global slowdown will have a net negative impact on the rupee the us rate decision the fed has projected two rate hikes for 2019 any change in the rate hike pace may impact the dollar the dollar may strengthen if the fed decides to increase the rates more than two times in which case the rupee may reverse lower reserves to the rescue the reserve bank of india rbi had built a record forex reserves of 426 billion by april 2018 the central bank used these reserves to arrest the rupee fall last year it has been intervening in the market using the reserves to protect the rupee from a free fall this is evident from the consistent selling since april 2018 which brought down the forex reserves from 426 billion in april 2018 to the current levels of 398 billion as on february 8 2019 strong reserves may continue to come to the rescue of the rupee in case of any abnormal volatility in currency market event risks two major global events could impact the dollar movement the brexit and the us china trade war one increasing uncertainty on finalising the brexit deal is raising concerns as the march 29 deadline nears two developments in the on going trade war between the us and china are likely to influence the global currency movements the us had announced that it would double the tariffs on chinese imports worth 200 billion which is coming into effect from march 1 there are noises on the us considering to push back the march 1 deadline by 60 days the presidents of the us and china are expected to meet towards the end of this month failure to strike a deal will increase the nervousness in the market and can trigger a sharp sell off there are chances that a trade deal may be negotiated between the two countries before this month end failure to reach a deal will result in additional tariffs being imposed by the us on chinese goods from march 1 2019 uncertainty over both these events will provide support to the dollar as risk aversion rises so the rupee can trade under pressure as a result of a strong dollar election and foreign flows on the domestic front the upcoming general election in may will impact the rupee on the one hand if the current ruling party gets re elected or a stable government is formed by any party the market could get a boost this will create a positive sentiment and increase foreign portfolio flows however the quantum of flow will be determined by the global growth outlook and the pace of interest rate hikes from the us on the other hand a mixed outcome from the elections with no majority for any single big party resulting in the formation of a coalition government will be negative for the market which could trigger a strong sell off the fpi will also pull out money from the country at a much faster pace which can increase the likelihood of the rupee falling to new record lows takeaway the global growth slowdown can keep the lid on oil prices and provide some breather for the rupee on the deficit front however the dollar which may gain on safe haven demand can make the rupee vulnerable while capping the upside this coupled with the outcome of the general election will determine the trend for the rupee for the second half of the year broadly the rupee may remain range bound between 68 and 74 until the elections with the bias on the negative side for the currency to decline below 74 from a medium to long term perspective the reading on the charts though the fundamental picture is mixed for the rupee the bias is slightly negative from a medium term perspective us dollar index the us dollar index has been broadly range bound between 94 and 98 since july 2018 it currently heads towards 98 the upper end of the range inability to breach 98 in the coming weeks will trigger a pull back move to 96 and 94 once again and keep the sideways move intact a breakout on either side of 94 or 98 will only determine the direction of the next move for the dollar index a strong break above 98 will boost the bullish momentum and increase the likelihood of the index revisiting 100 and 101 in the coming months such a rally in the us dollar index can keep the rupee under pressure on the other hand if the dollar index declines below 94 it can fall to 92 or even 90 in such a scenario the rupee can gain strength bullish outlook for crude although the fundamental picture is mixed for brent crude on the charts the outlook is bullish both from a short and medium term perspective the prices are currently testing the near term resistance level of 66 an inverted head and shoulder bullish reversal pattern is visible on the charts the neckline support of this pattern is around 63 a strong break and a decisive close above 66 will pave way for a fresh rally to 68 70 or even 72 over the medium term such a rally in oil can drag the rupee lower rupee outlook the rupee has a major resistance at 69 against the dollar this hurdle has held well by halting the corrective rally that had begun from the all time low of 74 48 in october 2018 also historically any corrective rally in the rupee from a major low has not breached the 50 61 8 per cent fibonacci retracement region of the prior fall this region is in between 69 and 68 as such the rupee strengthening beyond 68 is less likely however any fresh and sharp fall breaking below the previous low of 74 48 also looks less probable on the charts therefore the rupee can remain range bound between 68 69 and 74 at least until the general election a prolonged sideways move within this range also cannot be ruled out a breakout on either side of 68 or 74 will then determine the direction of the next move the bias on the chart remains bearish for a break and fall below 74 towards 76 over the medium to long term
if people think that capitalism is just economic exchange or free enterprise then they need to think a little deeper because that is precisely what the oligarchs have been able to perpetuate in order to suck the economic blood of nations and destroy any viable or sustainable economy the rothschild family did that for years naomi klein s the shock doctrine the rise of disaster capitalism also shows how the oligarchs were able to use capitalism to destroy countries like poland south africa russia iraq etc capitalism as economist john quiggin of the university of queensland has pointed out is zombie economics but no matter how bad capitalism has become the oligarchs continue to use it because it relieves them from any moral responsibility whatsoever don t believe me get this amazon made a profit of 11 200 000 000 in 2018 how much are they going to pay in federal income taxes nothing rien nada anneyo this is one of the most pathetic and duplicitous activities that has come to dominate much of our present age the people who are making billions upon billions of dollars want to free themselves from any economic responsibility but if you are trying to put food on the table well too bad that you got screwed with more taxes perhaps we need another person who will drive the money changers out of the temple because the money changers themselves have astronomically used all kinds of deceits and malicious activities to cheat the system so when trump promised that his tax plan would give most americans a tax cut he was inadvertently talking about the rich and powerful not the average american who was still struggling to raise a family and make ends meet listen to this many in the middle class have been shocked to find that instead of the nice little chunk of change they were expecting with their return they actually owe money to uncle sam what s the reason for this financial switcheroo it stems from president trump s tax reform which was passed in 2017 and was touted by trump and the gop as a win for the middle class however with the new tax system now in place americans are discovering that most of the tax relief from the bill is actually being experienced by corporations meanwhile many people are seeing an increase in taxes due to the bill eliminating many of the deductions that were used by middle class families in order to lower the amount of taxes they were required to pay most notably the tax reform placed a cap on deductions for taxes on both state and local levels unsurprisingly people have not been happy to discover that what they expected to be a decrease in taxes paid is actually an increase those who had been supporters of trump are especially infuriated as many were under the assumption that he would provide financial relief for middle class families something that he consistently promised during his presidential campaign many have even taken their anger online with goptaxscamstories trending on twitter as more and more members of the middle class express their feelings of betrayal towards trump and republicans dennis jordan lamented i am a republican voter i just did our taxes the gop tax bill cost my family thousands of dollars this year on our return due to changes thereby hitting us with the largest tax increase of our lives we are middle class homeowners and you raised our taxes infuriating similarly matt davis regretted realdonaldtrump i trusted and voted for you now screwed by you i fall just above a tax bracket i don t get the 5000 return i ve gotten the last 3 years money my family depends on to start us over i served my country honorably i will not make the same mistake twice david hoffman said last year i got a tax refund this year with unchanged salary i owe 1 300 i m middle class yet the wealthy got huge cuts thanksrepublicans joel serbin declared potus thank you for screwing the middle class with your tax reform i have never in my life i m 49 years old had to pay into the irs until this year we have a combined income of 150 000 the middle class voted for you i will not make the same mistake twice was trump s move really a surprise not really trump passed his tax bill plan in 2017 and the oligarchs couldn t be happier if you make less than 100 000 you more than likely will see a rise on your taxes but if you make more than that then you don t have to worry you will pay less taxes and perhaps no taxes at all trump obviously knows that the average american doesn t make 100 000 in fact approximately 80 percent of american households do not even come close to that figure so the only people trump was actually representing were the oligarchs and the money changers the very people who always end up destroying economic progress through their usurious contracts as historian robert s mcelvaine put it then the gop has been singing from the market is god hymnal for well over a century telling us that deregulation tax cuts for the rich and the concentration of ever more wealth in the bloated accounts of the richest people will result in prosperity for the rest of us the party is now trying to pass a scam that throws a few crumbs to the middle class temporarily millions of middle class americans will soon see a tax hike if the bill is enacted while heaping benefits on the super rich multiplying the national debt and endangering the american economy in 1926 calvin coolidge s treasury secretary andrew mellon one of the world s richest men pushed through a massive tax cut that would substantially contribute to the causes of the great depression republican sen george norris of nebraska said that mellon himself would reap from the tax bill a larger personal reduction than the aggregate of practically all the taxpayers in the state of nebraska the same is true now of donald trump the koch brothers sheldon adelson and other fabulously rich people mcelvaine moved on to add republicans have already tried deregulation and it failed miserably their solution well they deny its failure and try it again and again and again quiggin would call that zombie economics this diabolical activity again only works for the rich and powerful and the average guy will get screwed again pay close attention since the senate passed its version of the tax bill on december 2 29 companies have announced 70 2 billion in stock buybacks a maneuver that uses company cash to buy its own shares which then drives up the price of those shares rewarding major investors and executives whose compensation is directly tied to the company s stock price the central issue is that the oligarchs always try to play dice with the economy a pernicious enterprise which goes all the way back to the ciompi rebellion which took place in florence in 1378 the end result has always been the same whenever the oligarchs suppress the masses with heavy taxes whenever the average person cannot support his family then insurrections ensue as our dear friend e michael jones has meticulously documented in his 1400 page tome barren metal a history of capitalism as the conflict between labor and usury the oligarchs always try to cheat labor out of the workers as he puts it from the time of roger bacon to the medicis to john dee to isaac newton to george soros in the present alchemy has exerted its unique attraction over the mind of man who is interested in getting out from under the necessity of labor as the road to wealth the oligarchs don t really want to pay taxes but the government and the oligarchs want to bury the average worker beneath the avalanche of taxes this is contrary to true economic businesses the only person who understood this in recent history was henry ford ford knew that the national economy cannot grow if the average person cannot afford to put food on the table therefore ford did what was unheard of in 1914 he paid his workers 5 a day when they were being paid less than 3 elsewhere what was the result economic growth this is not to suggest that ford single handedly created the american middle class but he was one of the first business leaders to articulate what economists call the virtuous circle of growth well paid workers generating consumer demand that in turn promotes business expansion and hiring other executives bought his logic and just as important strong unions fought for rising pay and good benefits in contracts like the 1950 treaty of detroit between general motors and the united auto workers riding the dynamics of the virtuous circle america enjoyed its best period of sustained growth in the decades after world war ii from 1945 to 1973 even though income tax rates were far higher than today it created not only unprecedented middle class prosperity but also far greater economic equality than today from 1948 to 1973 the productivity of all nonfarm workers nearly doubled as did average hourly compensation the working class and the average american loved ford precisely because his company allowed them to build nuclear families which are the salt of any nation ford essentially helped create the baby boomers the opening of a ford factory in detroit during the 1900s resulted in a population boom as workers and their families migrated to grab the available job opportunities the financial editor at the new york times thought that ford was out of his mind when he was paying his workers enough money to support their families he s crazy isn t he don t you think he s crazy ford also reduced the work day from 9 hours to 8 hours a significant drop from the 60 hour work week that was the standard in american manufacturing this also allowed him to have the best workers ford said if the floor sweeper s heart is in his job he can save us five dollars a day by picking up small tools instead of sweeping them out ford s formula was straightforward keep wages high and prices low then you will eventually have prosperous workers prosperous businesses and a prosperous nation ford continued the owner the employees and the buying public are all one and the same and unless an industry can so manage itself as to keep wages high and prices low it destroys itself for otherwise it limits the number of its customers one s own employees ought to be one s own best customers was ford right well you be the judge in 1914 the company sold 308 000 of its model ts more than all other carmakers combined by 1915 sales had climbed to 501 000 by 1920 ford was selling a million cars a year ford concluded we increased the buying power of our own people and they increased the buying power of other people and so on and on it is this thought of enlarging buying power by paying high wages and selling at low prices that is behind the prosperity of this country the saturday evening post reported in 1919 ford raised his minimum wage again this time to 6 00 a day again the wage hike produced higher production numbers ford obviously understood the dark vision of the oligarchs of his day when he said we believe in making 20 000 men prosperous and contended rather than follow the plan of making a few slave drivers in our establishment multimillionaires the wage of the average worker said ford in his autobiography determines the prosperity of the country he called the average worker partners it is not usual to speak of an employee as a partner he wrote and yet what else is he he moved on to say the moment a man calls for assistance in his business even though the assistant be but a boy that moment he has taken a partner no man is independent as long as he has to depend on another man to help him it is a reciprocal relation the boss is the partner of his worker the worker is partner of his boss and such being the case it is useless for one group or the other to assume that it is the one indispensable unit it is foolish for capital or for labor to think of themselves as groups they are partners when they pull and haul against each other they simply injure the organization in which they are partners and from which both draw support it ought to be the employer s ambition as leader to pay better wages than any similar line of business and it ought to be the workman s ambition to make this possible that was devastating to the oligarchs and usurers who saw their workers as expendables or subjects to be used and reused at will of course there are limits to wages and ford understood that concept but ford was against employers oppressing or abusing their employees and vice versa the employer can gain nothing by looking over the employees and asking himself how little can i get them to take nor the employee by glaring back and asking how much can i force him to give eventually both will have to turn to the business and ask how can this industry be made safe and profitable so that it will be able to provide a sure and comfortable living for all of us contrast ford s workable way of doing business to our day where companies like goldman sachs treat their customers as muppets and where oligarchs like jeff bezos pay no federal tax despite the fact that they have amassed billions of dollars the solution very simple the average person is not really coveting the wealth of the oligarchs what the average person is asking is a living wage a working person has to be able to support his family otherwise the family itself will be in ruins and when the family is destroyed then the nation will eventually crumble it s just that simple this is not socialism or communism ford was not implementing socialism when he paid his working a living wage in fact ford was against socialism and subversive movements if the government doesn t understand that simple formula then they can kiss a prosperous economy goodbye if this seems farfetched then i would

steven rattner s opinion piece in the new york times and furman s interview on national public radio are perfect examples of the ideas that mmt want to debunk deficits are not normal deficits crowd out private investment the public debt is a burden on our grandchildren our ability to respond to societal problems is limited by the fact that the us government does not have enough money to confront them below is an alternative interview to the furman s interview that reviews these points this blog will run like a traditional interview and all the evidence for the points made are in appendices at the end dear ms cornish i hope you will forgive me but i will plagiarize you entirely for the sake of this exercise audie cornish host the national debt surpassed 22 trillion this week a new record and this despite candidate donald trump s promise to reduce u s debt once he became president there was a time when the soaring national debt caused panic in washington now it s mostly crickets at least from the officials who have control over the federal budget so what s changed we re going to ask eric tymoigne he is an associate professor of economics at lewis clark college his works shows that one must make a crucial distinction between monetarily sovereign and non monetarily sovereign governments when discussing issues surrounding the public debt and fiscal deficits welcome to the program eric tymoigne thanks for having me cornish so you ve written about the debt and you hear that 22 trillion figure and you argue that it s not so scary how come tymoigne let me give you a bit of context the public debt is the sum of all ious owed by the us treasury it can be measured as gross debt all outstanding ious owed by the treasury or net debt it excludes treasury ious that other federal agencies holds 22 trillion is the outstanding gross public debt until the 1930s gross public debt fell more often than it rose and only major wars caused rapid increases in the public debt while the public debt decreased more often than it grew overall the public debt did grow slowly because increases were on average larger since the great depression the public debt has increased almost continuously appendix 1 regarding the context of your question i don t think anything has changed in terms of the hysteria surrounding the public debt since 1789 when the us treasury was established pundits journalists treasury officials and or politicians among others have all sounded the alarm about the threats posed by a growing public debt this interview is just the latest example of such daily mass hysteria yes politicians are currently less vocal about it but many others have taken their place this hysteria has been so strong that it has led to inaction or inadequate responses to the problem of our times politicians are so focused on the debt number that they lose sight of the issues at hand for example the misplaced fear about the upcoming insolvency of the social security system has reduced our leaders ability to response to the challenges of an aging society only the will to go to war provides strong enough of a motive to leave the debt concern aside in the mind of our political leaders worries about climate change poverty unemployment healthcare childcare or any other socio economic issue have always been secondary to worries about the public debt regarding your question there are several reasons why one needs not to be fixated on and worried about the size of the public debt first treasury securities one type of ious included in the public debt provide to the non federal sectors such as households firms pension funds state governments and foreigners a means to accumulate financial wealth in a safe way treasury securities are also the backbone of the financial system they serve as safe collateral and are a crucial means to meet the requirements of financial regulations second one should worry about the public debt only if it negatively influenced economic variables such as economic growth inflation tax rates or interest rates the evidence of that are scant despite the broken records continuously played by those who promote hysteria about the public debt for example some argues that the current situation is special because we have a high public debt and low interest rate this situation is the norm there is no relationship between the fiscal position deficit balanced budget or surplus of the us government and interest rates none interest rates are not driven by fiscal policy matters they are driven almost entirely by the monetary policy of the federal reserve appendix 2 the crowding out does not exist in terms of economic growth the greater involvement of the us government in the economy has not generated a decline in economic growth however the greater involvement of the government has considerably reduced the volatility of economic growth by sustaining the income of the private sector the economy has recorded fewer contractions contractions have been much milder much less lengthy and more spaced appendix 3 in terms of tax rates the public debt will never be repaid we have not been burdened with higher tax rates to repay the public debt created at the time of our grandparents our children and grandchildren won t be burdened by higher tax rates to repay the public debt created today we may raise tax rates in the future but not with the goal of repaying the public debt there is no reason to do so and doing so would be harmful to the finances of households banks firms and other for the reasons i just provided the public debt will keep piling up to accommodate the needs of our growing economy and the us government will keep paying it on time the us government does not has never and ought not to manage the public debt in the same way you and i manage our private debts it is incorrect to analyze the finances of the us government by taking household or business finances as a point of reference public and private debts are totally different animals when a monetarily sovereign government is involved cornish to you what has changed what s different tymoigne nothing has changed as usual fiscal deficits government spending larger than taxes are a boost to the saving of the domestic private sector state and local governments and the rest of the world in the short run deficits sustain private incomes by injecting more money in the economy than they remove through taxes deficits help to sustain private investment by stabilizing the profit of businesses expected sales not interest rates are the main driver of business investment and fiscal deficits boost the sales of businesses while having a negligible impact on the cost of credit in the long run deficits translate into the public debt that provides a reliable source of net wealth to non federal sectors as i just explained if i had to cite one issue that i have regarding the public debt it is with regard to the change in the structure of ownership of the public debt on one side foreign holders have owned a growing proportion of the public debt since the 1970s mostly via ownership through foreign central banks foreign treasuries and other official institutions this reflects the growing role of the us dollar in the international economy on the other side households and non financial companies have recorded a major decline in their share of ownership of the public debt the worry here is not that the us treasury is more and more dependent on foreigners to finance its expenses it is not instead the us treasury does foreigners a favor by being willing to exchange their non interest earning dollars into interest earning dollars the worry is that this change of ownership has reoriented the interest payments on the public debt away from the domestic economy where it boosts private income toward the rest of the world this unfortunate change creates a drag on economic growth and the growth of domestic private wealth appendix 4 cornish but as you re talking about i mean the economy is good unemployment is low if there was ever a time when we should be shrinking the national deficit shouldn t this be it i mean is this the time for some dramatic moves tymoigne the main reason the us treasury runs a deficit is not deliberate reckless policies or politicians who do not know how to put the us government finances in order the us government actually has little control over the size of its expenditures and revenues tax revenues are heavily influenced by the income earned by the domestic private sector and this fluctuates widely with the business cycle for a given tax structure that sets the tax rate on each income level the us treasury is highly dependent on the vagaries of the economy for its tax revenues in an economic expansion tax revenues rise quickly because private sector income rises in a recession tax revenues fall quickly because private sector income falls in terms of government expenditures a large portion of them is set by legal requirements social security medicare etc appendix 5 of course this begs the question of what if not the us government determines the size of the fiscal position and so the growth of the public debt the main drivers are the desire of other economic sectors to accumulate financial wealth deficits inject income in the domestic private sector and the foreign sector usually these sectors desire to save some of that extra income they desire to do so because it provides them financial flexibility and because they have retirement needs educational needs among others at the macroeconomic level not all economic sectors can record a surplus at the same time at least one of them must be in deficit for the others to be in surplus there is actually a macroeconomic accounting identity that shows this but i won t go into it in this interview the central implication of that accounting identity is that at least the domestic private sector or the government sector or the foreign sector must be in deficit if one of the other sector is in surplus in the case of the united states the domestic private sector and the foreign sector want a surplus they record a surplus therefore the government sector must record a deficit appendix 6 in other words fiscal deficits are a normal state of affairs for the us government they have been so for decades this is the norm in the united states and throughout the world get over it so no the government should not proactively try to reduce its fiscal deficit and repay its public debt the government should let it fiscal positions be whatever it needs to be in order to accommodate the desires of the other sectors to improve their financial standing going against the desired surplus of the non government sectors will only result in a recession cornish the new tax law has been in effect for a little over a year now are we actually moving in that direction tymoigne again the fiscal position will adjust to the needs of the economy we should forget altogether about the fiscal position and the public debt and pay attention to the real issues in that case the tax law was a major issue in the sense that it has provided massive permanent tax breaks to income categories that do not need them in that sense we are moving in the wrong direction because we are reinforcing income and wealth inequalities that are already extremely high the new tax law perpetuates and encourages the rise of dynasties that already have overwhelming influences on our socio eco political life cornish if the national debt is an indicator of long term economic health then why wouldn t we be worried tymoigne the national debt is not an indicator of our long term economic health the public debt can always be repaid analysts who acknowledge that the us government is monetarily sovereign have long understood that there is zero probability of default on the public debt appendix 7 the us government cannot be forced to default on its public debt this of course does not mean that we ought to repay the debt at once by printing money this is a silly conclusion that would be massively inflationary and i already stated that it is in nobody s interest to repay the public debt and we won t what monetary sovereignty means is that the us government has control over the cost of its public debt that it can decide what type of debt to offer to other sectors and that government has the financial flexibility to spend on whatever its society decided is the public purpose the government is not dependent on china s willingness to purchase us treasuries and bond vigilantes don t dictate the cost of debt appendix 2 the public debt is not managed like a private debt its growth and structure proportion of short term ious vs long term ious are managed to accommodate the needs of the economy rather than to prevent bankruptcy if other sectors want to hold more public debt the us government issues more if other sectors want more long term securities instead of short term securities the us government accommodates even if the interest rate is higher if other sectors want to hold less public debt the us government fiscal position turns into a surplus for example if foreigners decide they do not want to hold us dollars assets they can try to dump them quickly which would negatively impact them or they can start buying more goods and services from the us than they sell to the us in the second case the us government fiscal position will move toward a surplus in order to accommodate the will of the foreign sector to be in deficit with the us a few countries mostly in scandinavia recently are in a similar situation this is an unusual case as long as the cost of public debt stays low relative to the growth of the economy the public debt will not explode relative to the size of the economy the usual case is that the interest rate on the public debt is below the growth rate of the economy precisely because a monetarily sovereign government has a strong control over that interest rate olivier blanchard recently received a lot of attention for making that point but it has been made for a long time by other economists such as for example scott fullwiler what are indicators of health for our economy standard of living life expectancy literacy rate availability and quality of childcare and healthcare are major indicators low unemployment moderate income and wealth inequalities that encourage individual initiatives quality infrastructures that accommodate the needs of the society and environmental sustainability are others we are failing on a number of these indicators of economic health take a look at the crumbling state of our infrastructures that requires trillions of dollars to be brought back up to standard today the greatest threat is environmental sustainability not only in terms of climate change but also in terms of the sustainability of our consumption oriented society this problem is so large that it directly threatens human existence since the 1970s at least species have been dying left and right at an accelerating rate environmental systems are collapsing rapidly and yet very little is done a green new deal would be a good start but much more would be needed in the us and abroad responding effectively to these pressing issues will require massive government spending and generate a rapid increase in the public debt here and abroad we did it during world war two we can do it again the question you have to ask yourself is if tackling these issues is more important than a number on a spreadsheet while solving these issues may require sacrifice in terms of productive resources especially if a rapid reengineering of our economy is required which it is for some issues it will not require a sacrifice in financial terms for the us government and our grandchildren what is productively possible is always financially possible for a monetarily sovereign government we may have to declare war on climate change for people to realize that cornish eric tymoigne associate professor of economics at lewis clark college thank you for speaking with us tymoigne thanks so much for having me appendix 1 change to gross public debt relative to gdp 1791 2018 three major wars war of 1812 civil war and world war i caused unusually rapid increases in the public debt but otherwise the public debt grew slowing or declined since the great depression the public debt has mostly gone up with only five recorded declines 1947 49 1951 1956 57 major wars world war two vietnam war war on terror have rapidly increased the public debt but sizeable increases have become a permanent feature of the post 1920s period appendix 2 monetary policy drives interest rates not fiscal policy figures 2 and 3 show that the fiscal position is unrelated to the cost of credit while monetary policy has a very strong influence when the us treasury runs very large deficits it usually does so in periods of recession when tax revenues plummet during these periods the federal reserve also lowers its policy interest rate to help the economy and all other rates follow during world war ii when the fiscal deficit ran past 20 of gdp as government spending increased very rapidly the federal reserve set interest rates on the public debt very low for years and all other private interest rates followed and stayed low for years appendix 3 big government and economic stability figure 4 shows that the growth rate of gross national product gnp is the same prior to and after world war two the volatility of the growth rate of gnp has declined significantly after world war two the blue line fluctuates much less there also are less contractions grey bars and they are thinner and more spaced out when there is a recession gnp falls less and recovers faster appendix 4 ownership of the gross public debt the share of public debt held by the domestic private nonfinancial sector has shrunk from 40 of the public debt to 5 meanwhile the share held by the rest of the world especially official institutions has grown tremendously appendix 5 revenues and expenditures by the federal government move automatically tax revenues move very widely appendix 6 not all sectors can record a surplus at the same time figure 6 illustrates the point by showing the financial balance surplus or deficit of the three major sectors of the economy in accounting terms we know that government balance domestic private sector balance foreign balance 0 this applies at all times usually the government sector runs a deficit and the other sectors record a surplus we had an unusual period in the late 1990s and mid 2000s when the domestic private sector balance the black area in the graph was negative and the government sector briefly recorded a small surplus democrats were so proud of this although their fiscal policy pushed the domestic private sector balance further and further in the red this ultimately led to the great recession because contrary to the us government the domestic private sector cannot sustain a deficit appendix 7 the us government is always able to pay its debt as long as it is denominated in usd
trade talk optimism trade pessimism drove markets up and down last week in the end presidents of us and china decided to give markets some lip service and boosted stocks towards weekly close words rather than substance are enough to make investors happy yen and swiss franc ended as the weakest ones on late rally in stocks sterling followed as the third weakest for the week as brexit impasse continued but strong retail sales from uk did give the pound a mild lift on the other hand commodity currencies made a strong come back new zealand dollar ended as strongest as rbnz did nothing to endorse market views that next move is a cut australian dollar followed as second with help from the impression that us and china will finally make a trade deal but the aussie is set to face a string of tests in rba minutes wage price and employment data this week canadian dollar was pulled up to third place by rallying oil prices with wti crude oil ended above 56 handle us china trade talks made unknown progress to be continued in washington specifics were virtually non existent regarding the week long us china trade negotiations in beijing but markets nevertheless cheered positive words from both sides trump hailed that the talks was going extremely well and we re a lot closer than we ever were in this country with having a real trade deal he even offered that it would be my honor to remove the tariffs if they cane make the deal on the rumor of 60 day extension to the march 1 trade truce deadline trump said there is a possibility that i will extend the date but if i do that if i see that we re close to a deal or the deal is going in the right direction i would do that at the same tariffs that we re charging now i would not increase the tariffs white house also issued a statement regrading the meetings in beijing it s noted that these detailed and intensive discussions led to progress between the two parties both sides will continue working on all outstanding issues in advance of the march 1 2019 deadline united states and chinese officials have agreed that any commitments will be stated in a memoranda of understanding between the two countries according to a statement published by china daily both sides reached consensus in principle on major issues and had specific discussions about a memorandum of understanding on bilateral economic and trade issues the two sides said they will step up their work within the time limit for consultations set by both heads of state and strive for consensus now both team will meet again in washington this week starting feb 18 at both ministerial and vice ministerial levels focus will be on whether they could really deliver a certain mou fed might stand pat through 2019 or maybe just one hike the shockingly poor us december retail sales which released was delayed due to government shutdown was more than enough to offset the positive impact from higher than expected january inflation reading headline sales dropped 1 2 mom while ex auto sales decreased 1 8 that was the worse contraction in nine years since 2009 the data prompted atlanta fed to slash its q4 gdp estimate by 1 2 to just 1 5 less than half of q3 s 3 4 later in the week new york fed also halved q1 s gdp forecast to 1 08 from 2 17 just a week ago fed officials generally played down the importance of just one month of data but they re firmer than ever of their patient stance regarding monetary policy san francisco fed president mary daly said the case for a rate increase isn t there for 2019 if the economy evolves as i just said i expect it to 2 percent growth 1 9 percent inflation no sense that price pressures are going up no sense that we have any acceleration fed governor lael brainard warned that downside risks have definitely increased relative to that modal outlook for continued solid growth and on monetary policy she s comfortable waiting and learning and the current policy is in a good place and she would weigh what move if any later in the year atlanta fed president raphael bostic though said his outlook for 2019 is still above trend at around 2 3 to 2 5 growth fed will still likely need to raise interest rates once this year fed fund futures are pricing in 85 3 chance of federal funds rate staying at current 2 25 2 5 after december fomc meeting up from 76 0 a week ago and 72 7 a month ago dow surged on trade optimism now in key resistance zone dow reaccelerated on friday to close strongly at 25883 25 last week above 78 6 retracement of 26951 81 to 21712 53 at 25830 60 there is no clear loss of momentum as we expected yet but our overall view is unchanged that rebound from 21712 53 is a leg in the medium to long term corrective pattern from 26951 81 that is the long term up trend shouldn t be ready to resume yet thus we d still expected overbought condition to limit upside inside 25830 60 26951 81 resistance zone to limit upside break of 24883 04 support should indicate completion of the rebound and near term reversal however s p 500 and nasdaq are kept rather well below equivalent 78 6 fibonacci level at 2813 72 and 7717 47 respectively thus as two catch up there is a chance for dow to be squeezed through 26951 81 high briefly yield curve flattened further 10 and 30 year yield at critical support meanwhile market optimism was not quite reflected in treasury yields 10 year yield lost 2 7 handle again to close at 2 666 30 year yield also close below 3 0 handle at 2 997 also 5 year yield closed at 2 495 below 6 month yield at 2 504 yield curve continued to flatten between 1 month 2 423 and 5 year even though it s not seriously inverted technically we re still expect strong support at 38 2 retracement of 1 366 to 3 248 at 2 517 in 10 year yield to bring reversal 30 year yield should also see strong support from 2 963 which is close to 38 2 retracement of 2 102 to 3 447 at 2 933 to bring sustainable rebound but let s see position trading we entered aud jpy short at 78 40 last week as last updated here the rebound to 79 24 was firstly stronger than expected and sequent fall which was contained at 78 09 as supported by risk appetite was also quite disappointing nevertheless aud jpy is for now kept by falling 55 day ema with daily macd staying negative we re not seeing clear strength in aussie or weakness in yen elsewhere for example aud usd is held below 55 day ema at 0 7158 eur aud is kept well above 1 5721 short term bottom gbp aud is kept well above 1 7868 support aud cad is also kept below 55 day ema at 0 9499 on the other hand usd jpy failed to sustain above key fibonacci level at 110 77 eur jpy and gbp jpy are held well below 125 95 and 144 85 highs cad jpy was also rejected by 83 98 resistance last week so we ll hold short in aud jpy with stop placed at 79 84 with target at 61 8 retracement of 70 27 to 79 84 at 73 92 usd cad weekly outlook usd cad edged higher to 1 3340 last week but failed to break through 1 3375 resistance and retreated initial bias remains neutral this week first and some more consolidation could be seen for now further rise is in favor as long as 1 3196 minor support holds we re favoring the case that decline from 1 3664 has completed with three waves down to 1 3068 already on bullish convergence condition in 4 hour macd just ahead of medium term channel support decisive break of 1 3375 resistance will confirm this bullish case and target a test on 1 3664 high however break of 1 3196 will now dampen our view and turn bias back to the downside for 1 3068 support instead in the bigger picture structure of the medium term rise from 1 2061 2017 low to 1 3664 is not clearly impulsive hence we d stay cautious on strong resistance from 61 8 retracement of 1 4689 2016 high to 1 2061 at 1 3685 and 1 3793 resistance to limit upside and bring medium term topping but in any case medium term outlook will stay bullish as long as channel support now at 1 3095 holds sustained break of 1 3793 will pave the way to retest 1 4689 2015 high firm break of the channel support should confirm reversal target 1 2061 low again in the longer term picture corrective fall from 1 4689 2015 high should have completed with three waves down to 1 2061 just ahead of 50 retracement of 0 9406 2011 low to 1 4689 2015 high at 1 2048 the development keeps long term up trend from 0 9406 and that from 0 9056 2007 low intact for now there is still prospect of extending the long term up trend through 1 4689

washington ap in president donald trump s estimation the good times began to roll for the country on the night he was elected so he doesn t hesitate to swipe job growth from the twilight of the obama administration and claim it as his own that overreach seen in his state of the union speech and other forums extends to his boast about the shrinking numbers of people on food stamps where he s helped himself even more heartily to obama era progress likewise a surge in energy production under president barack obama ended up on trump s ledger of achievement trump s speech to congress made for a bountiful week of exaggeration partial truth and outright error some highlights jobs trump we have created 5 3 million new jobs and importantly added 600 000 new manufacturing jobs something which almost everyone said was impossible to do state of the union speech the facts that s not what he s done he s measuring from election day in november 2016 rather than when he took office on jan 20 2017 in this feb 5 2019 photo president donald trump gives his state of the union address to a joint session of congress at the capitol in washington as vice president mike pence left and house speaker nancy pelosi look on in trump s estimation the good times began to roll for the country on the night he was elected so he doesn t hesitate to swipe job growth from the twilight of the obama administration and claim it as his own doug mills the new york times via ap pool since january 2017 the u s has added 4 9 million jobs not 5 3 million of them 454 000 were in manufacturing not 600 000 according to the bureau of labor statistics trump apparently reasons that employers and investors were so encouraged by his victory that they stepped up their hiring and investing right after the nov 8 election but the economy simply does not turn on a dime like that and trump did not inherit a mess here s what history will record more jobs were created in obama s last two years 5 1 million than in trump s first two years 4 9 million growth in manufacturing employment began in obama s second term when 386 000 jobs were added and accelerated under trump ___ food stamps trump nearly 5 million americans have been lifted off food stamps state of the union address the facts the number of people receiving food stamps actually hasn t declined nearly that much since trump took office or even since he was elected in january 2017 42 7 million people were using food stamps that declined to 38 6 million in september 2018 a drop of 4 1 million not nearly 5 million monthly comparisons don t mean much because the numbers go up and down over the short term a more meaningful measure is how many people were using food stamps on average over the course of a year by that measure the food stamp rolls declined by only 1 8 million in the 2017 and 2018 budget years even that period which began in october 2016 includes a substantial drop that happened under obama go back to october 2015 the start of the 2016 budget year and the drop is 3 9 million ___ energy trump we have unleashed a revolution in american energy the united states is now the no 1 producer of oil and natural gas in the world state of the union address the facts that depends on what the definition of we is his claim is true in the unlikely event he was also crediting obama and other recent presidents who were aggressive about energy production the government says the u s became the world s top natural gas producer in 2013 under the obama administration the u s now leads the world in oil production too under trump that s largely because of a boom in production from shale oil which also began under obama ___ economy trump in just over two years since the election we have launched an unprecedented economic boom a boom that has rarely been seen before there s been nothing like it an economic miracle is taking place in the united states state of the union address the facts the president is vastly exaggerating what has been a mild improvement in growth and hiring the economy is healthy but not nearly one of the best in u s history the economy expanded at an annual rate of 3 8 percent last spring and summer a solid pace but it was just the fastest in four years in the late 1990s growth topped 4 percent for four straight years a level it has not yet reached under trump in 1984 growth even reached 7 2 percent almost all independent economists expect slower growth this year as the effect of the trump administration s tax cuts fade trade tensions and slower global growth hold back exports and higher interest rates make it more expensive to borrow to buy cars and homes ___ trump the u s economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when i took office state of the union address the facts this may be true we don t know the exact growth figure for 2018 because the 35 day partial government shutdown has delayed the release of fourth quarter data if it turns out to be roughly 3 percent as expected that would be close to double the 1 6 percent growth of 2016 a slow year surrounded by better ones growth in 2015 was 2 9 percent for example ___ health care trump the next major priority for me and for all of us should be to lower the cost of health care and prescription drugs and to protect patients with pre existing conditions state of the union address the facts his rhetoric is at odds with his actions when it comes to protecting people with pre existing medical conditions in reality his administration is seeking in a lawsuit to eliminate such coverage his justice department is arguing in court that those protections in the obama era health law should fall the short term health plans trump often promotes as a bargain alternative offer no guarantee of covering pre existing conditions government lawyers said in legal filings last june that they will no longer defend key parts of the affordable care act including provisions that guarantee access to health insurance regardless of any medical conditions then attorney general jeff sessions wrote in a letter to congress that trump approved the legal strategy a federal judge in texas in december ruled the entire obama era law including coverage for pre existing conditions was unconstitutional because congress repealed its fines on uninsured people the suit has moved to the 5th u s circuit court of appeals in new orleans in the meantime the law s provisions remain in effect trump has hailed the initial court ruling as great and predicted that it would go to the supreme court and be upheld obama s health care law requires insurers to take all applicants regardless of medical history and patients with health problems pay the same standard premiums as healthy ones bills supported in 2017 by trump and congressional republicans to repeal the law could have pushed up costs for people with pre existing conditions ___ immigrants jobs trump working class americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration reduced jobs state of the union address the facts employment data suggest that the influx of immigrants helps increase overall hiring for the u s economy rather than erode job growth the trend is clear in the government s monthly jobs report the statistics don t distinguish between immigrants who are in the u s legally and illegally nearly 64 percent of immigrants hold jobs compared with roughly 60 percent of workers born in the united states according to the labor department last year immigrants accounted for roughly 40 percent of the 2 4 million jobs added because a steady growth in the workforce helps the economy expand economists say fewer immigrants would equal slower growth and fewer jobs falling birth rates and the retirement of the vast generation of baby boomers mean fewer people will flow into the workforce in the coming years a drag on economic growth which will in turn probably limit hiring many economists have noted that adding immigrants would help maintain the flow of workers into the economy and support growth ___ immigrants wages trump working class americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration lower wages state of the union address the facts the weight of research suggests that immigrants have not suppressed wages david card an economist at the university of california berkeley first studied the issue in 1990 by reviewing the arrival of cuban migrants in miami during the 1980 mariel boat lift this historical rush of immigrants created a natural experiment to measure what then happened to incomes in the local area he concluded the influx appears to have had virtually no effect on the wages or unemployment rates of less skilled workers giovanni peri an economist at the university of california davis studied immigration into california between 1960 and 2005 he wrote in a 2010 paper that it had essentially no effect on wages or employment of native born workers but many people seeking to reduce immigration rely on research from george borjas a harvard economist his research found that the arrival of cubans in the mariel boat lift caused wages to fall for native born high school dropouts in miami other economists have questioned his methodology in addition borjas findings would apply to a small fraction of u s jobholders today only about 6 2 percent of whom lack a high school degree other explanations for sluggish wage growth go beyond immigration they include the decline in unionization an intensified push to maximize corporate profits growing health insurance costs that supplant wages and the rise of a lower wage global labor force that in an intertwined worldwide economy can hinder pay growth for americans ___ labor force trump all americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before state of the union address trump more people are working now than at any time in the history of our country one hundred fifty seven million people at work the facts yes but that s because the population has grown it s more than doubled since 1950 and in recent months it s been increasing by 150 000 to nearly 200 000 per month births are the primary driver of population growth with immigration also contributing in 2030 that s expected to change with immigration overtaking the natural increase from births exceeding deaths as for women the big question is whether greater percentages of them are working or searching for a job than at any point in history and on this count women have enjoyed better times women s labor force participation rate right now is 57 5 percent according to the labor department the rate has ticked up recently but it was higher in 2012 and peaked in 2000 at roughly 60 percent overall 63 2 percent of americans are working or looking for work that s a few ticks higher than when trump was inaugurated when it was 62 9 percent but far below the 2000 peak of 67 3 percent the rate has declined partly because of aging as a wave of baby boomers retire but even among younger workers it s below where it was nearly two decades ago ___ border el paso trump the border city of el paso texas used to have extremely high rates of violent crime one of the highest in the entire country and considered one of our nation s most dangerous cities now immediately upon its building with a powerful barrier in place el paso is one of the safest cities in our country simply put walls work and walls save lives state of the union address the facts that s a distorted picture of el paso where trump is going monday to showcase his push for a border wall el paso has never been considered one of the nation s most dangerous cities in fact its murder rate was less than half the national average in 2005 the year before the start of its border fence the city has experienced ebbs and flows in violent crime but they have largely mirrored national trends and been under national averages for decades ___ border security trump the lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety and security and financial well being of all america state of the union address the facts whether the border is sufficiently secure or not cuts to the core of a heated national debate but it s far from lawless the number of people arrested for crossing illegally has plunged in the past decade and is near its lowest level since the mid 1990s illustrating a substantial downward trend in the number of migrants trying to sneak in border patrol personnel detection technology and physical barriers have increased in that time ___ legal immigration trump i want people to come into our country in the largest numbers ever but they have to come in legally state of the union address the facts his policy recommendations to date do not reflect this wish the plan he proposed upon taking office would have sharply limited the ability of citizens and permanent residents to bring in family which he derisively called chain migration the cato institute which favors more open immigration policies estimated his plan would cut the number of legal immigrants by up to 44 percent the largest cut to legal immigration since the 1920s according to data from the homeland security department about 750 000 of more than 1 1 million people who obtained green cards in 2017 or two thirds did so through family relations trump s plan called for limiting family based green cards to spouses and minor children of u s citizens and green card holders a dramatic cut he s also slashed the number of refugees the u s will accept for two straight years and he wants to eliminate diversity visas he s talked about switching to merit based instead of family based immigration and said at times that he wants to make it easier for temporary workers to work and graduates from top colleges to stay in the country but researchers have said the net effect of his proposals would be fewer legal immigrants __ middle east wars trump our brave troops have now been fighting in the middle east for almost 19 years state of the union address the facts trump exaggerated the length of the wars in iraq and afghanistan the war in afghanistan began in october 2001 in the aftermath of the sept 11 attacks the invasion of iraq was in march 2003 the u s has been at war for a bit more than 17 years also he refers to fighting in the middle east iraq is in the middle east but afghanistan is in central asia ___ stacey abrams economy abrams former candidate for georgia governor in the democratic response to trump s speech the republican tax bill rigged the system against working people rather than bringing back jobs plants are closing layoffs are looming and wages struggle to keep pace with the actual cost of living the facts the economy is doing better after the introduction of the trump administration s tax cuts than abrams suggests the number of people seeking unemployment benefits a proxy for layoffs briefly fell to a five decade low last month and average hourly pay is running ahead of inflation ___ tariffs trump we recently imposed tariffs on 250 billion of chinese goods and now our treasury is receiving billions of dollars state of the union address the facts this is misleading yes money from tariffs is going into the federal treasury but it s largely coming from u s businesses and consumers it s not foreign countries that are paying these import taxes by cutting a check to the government his reference to money coming into the treasury now belies the fact that tariffs go back to the founding of the country this revenue did not start with his increased tariffs on some goods from china tariffs did produce 41 3 billion in tax revenues in the last budget year according to the treasury department but that is a small fraction of a federal budget that exceeds 4 1 trillion the tariffs paid by u s companies also tend to result in higher prices for consumers which is what happened for washing machines after the trump administration imposed import taxes ___ trade nafta trump our new u s mexico canada agreement or usmca will replace nafta and deliver for american workers bringing back our manufacturing jobs expanding american agriculture protecting intellectual property and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with the four beautiful words made in the usa state of the union address the facts it s unlikely to do all those things because the new agreement largely preserves the structure and substance of nafta in addition the deal has not been ratified and its chances in congress are uncertain in one new feature the deal requires that 40 percent of cars contents eventually be made in countries that pay autoworkers at least 16 an hour that is in the united states or canada but not in mexico it also requires mexico to pursue an overhaul of labor law to encourage independent unions that will bargain for higher wages and better working conditions for mexicans still just before the agreement was signed general motors announced that it would lay off 14 000 workers and close five plants in the united states and canada philip levy senior fellow at the chicago council on global affairs and a trade official in republican president george w bush s white house says president trump has seriously overhyped this agreement ___ drug pricing trump already as a result of my administration s efforts in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years state of the union address the facts trump is selectively citing statistics to exaggerate what seems to be a slowdown in prices a broader look at the data shows that drug prices are still rising but more moderately some independent experts say criticism from trump and congressional democrats may be causing pharmaceutical companies to show restraint the consumer price index for prescription drugs shows a o 6 percent reduction in prices in december 2018 when compared with december 2017 the biggest drop in nearly 50 years the government index tracks a set of medications including brand drugs and generics however that same index showed a 1 6 percent increase when comparing the full 12 months of 2018 with the entire previous year the annualized number gives you a better picture said economist paul hughes cromwick of altarum a nonprofit research organization it could be that something quirky happened in december separately an analysis of brand name drug prices by the associated press shows there were 2 712 price increases in the first half of this january as compared with 3 327 increases during the same period last year the size of this year s increases was not as pronounced both this year and last the number of price cuts was minuscule the information for the analysis was provided by the health data firm elsevier ___ wages trump wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades and growing for blue collar workers who i promised to fight for they re growing faster than anyone else thought possible state of the union address the facts this is an unsupported statement because the data on hourly wages for private workers only go back to 2006 not decades but data on wages for production workers date back to 1939 and trump s claim appears to be unfounded average hourly earnings for production and nonsupervisory workers are up 3 4 percent over the past year according to the labor department those wage gains were higher as recently as early 2009 and they were averaging roughly 4 percent before the start of the great recession in late 2007 there are other ways to track wage gains and those don t work in trump s favor either adjusted for inflation median weekly wages rose just 0 6 percent in 2018 the gains in weekly wages were 2 1 percent in 2015 ___ abrams migrant children abrams in the democratic response we know bipartisanship could craft a 21st century immigration plan but this administration chooses to cage children and tear families apart the facts the cages that abrams mentions are actually chain link fences and the obama administration used them too children are held behind them inside holding border patrol facilities under the trump administration as well obama s administration detained large numbers of unaccompanied children inside chain link fences in 2014 images that circulated online of children in cages during the height of trump s family separations controversy were actually from 2014 when obama was in office children are placed in such areas by age and sex for safety reasons and are held for up to 72 hours by the border patrol the department of homeland security s inspector general visited five detention facilities for unaccompanied children on the texas border with mexico in late june during the height of the furor over family separations and found they appeared to comply with detention standards the government watchdog reported that cleanliness was inconsistent but that the children had access to toilets food drinks clean bedding and hygiene items at the height of the family separations about 2 400 children were separated since then 118 children were separated immigration officials are allowed to take a child from a parent in certain cases serious criminal charges against a parent concerns over the health and welfare of a child or medical concerns that policy has long been in place and is separate from the now suspended zero tolerance trump administration policy that saw children separated from parents only because they had crossed illegally ___ minority unemployment trump african american hispanic american and asian american unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded state of the union address the facts what he s not saying is that the unemployment rates for all three groups have gone up since reaching record low levels black unemployment reached a record low 5 9 percent in may but rose to 6 8 percent in january latino unemployment fell to 4 4 percent its lowest ever last october and asian unemployment fell to a record low of 2 2 percent in may but latino and asian unemployment also have increased in part because of the government shutdown which elevated unemployment last month the african american rate is still nearly double the jobless rate for whites at 3 5 percent the most dramatic drop in black unemployment came under obama when it fell from a recession high of 16 8 percent in march 2010 to 7 8 percent in january 2017 ___ human trafficking trump human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the united states and to sell them into prostitution and modern day slavery state of the union address the facts his administration has not supplied evidence that women and girls are smuggled by the thousands across remote areas of the border for these purposes what has been established is nearly 80 percent of international trafficking victims cross through legal ports of entry a flow that would not be stopped by a border wall trump distorts how often trafficking victims come from the southern border according the counter trafficking data collaborative a global hub for trafficking statistics with data contributed by organizations from around the world the national human trafficking hotline a venture supported by federal money and operated by the anti trafficking group polaris began tracking individual victim records in 2015 from january through june 31 2018 it tracked 35 000 potential victims of those there was a near equal distribution between foreigners on one hand and u s citizens and legal permanent residents on the other most of the labor trafficking victims were foreign and most of the sex trafficking victims were u s citizens of foreign nationals mexico had the most frequently trafficked ___ associated press writers josh boak juliet linderman colleen long ricardo alonso zaldivar ellen

the african continent in recent years has come to be major geo strategic importance to the oil dependent industrialized economies and giving attention that africa receives from state actors on the global stage in the context of international politics the idea of an african rebirth seems to be finding more and more acceptance within the contemporary global politics this is due to the continent cherished and rich oil and other riches but had this new love for africa developed by beijing and washington nowadays produces any benefits for the continent s larger impoverished inhabitants and eliminates the curse of rampant corruption and bad governance or only benefit foreign capitalists corrupt political bureaucrats and heads of governments by josephus moses gray contributor 231 776824437 let me quote the words of former president ellen johnson sirleaf of liberia africa is not poor it is poorly managed conflicts and crises such as civil strife have affected governance in africa as well as the establishment of sustainable growth performance although some countries have recovered from civil wars good governance remains a challenge this includes boosting national capacity to avoid crises in governance maintaining good internal relationship and peace building as well as reinforcement of issues regarding national security reducing and crime in the post independence eras african states became weak pawns in the world economy subject to cold war rivalries their path to development largely blocked by their debilitating colonial past more recently the west has choked africa with an onerous debt regime forcing many nations to pay more in interest on debts to the world bank and international monetary fund imf than on health care education infrastructure and other vital services combined the development landscape in africa is changing with new partners from the global south taking on a more important role as providers of much needed socio economic growth and know how for africa s development china has been the most prominent emerging partner and chinese entrepreneurs have increased their trade and investment relations with african counterparts by a factor of more than ten over the past decade but the pool of actors has widened and europe and washington are no longer at ease china s robust economic growth in the past 30 years which has lifted 600 million people out of extreme poverty offers lessons for other regions especially africa to pay keen attention china and africa have always belonged to a community of shared values and fruitful future and have always been good friends who stand together through thick and thin good partners who share weal and woe and good brothers who fully trust each other despite changes in the international landscape this might sound ridiculous but it is a glimpsing fact that oil s curse can be avoidable and turn into fruitful and praiseworthy blessings but the saddest nightmare always plagues dozen of oil rich african states that mismanaged their resources that generate most needed wealth since oil resource often in many instances fostered corruption benefits and profoundly serves foreign capitalists and corrupt leaders deep seated interests to the displeasure of the largest society thereby restricting bulk of the population to abject poor and inhumane sufferings africa has long proclaimed its desire to industrialize its economy in an effort to attain higher living standards and increase productive including employment opportunities for its populace but the rush for the continent s cherished riches especially oil remain the one of the major causes for a civil war on the continent which leads to abject poverty and suffering in many of africa s most oil rich countries such as nigeria angola libya southern sudan the republic of congo gabon and equatorial guinea oil instead of being a blessing for the population it becomes a curse and produces corruption as an endemic debacle oil discovery in africa automatically leads to corruption menace which gives birth to doom and gloom driven poverty in some continents the situation is to the contrary oil is a blessing and not a curse it removes the people from poverty to better their livelihoods let s look at the case of north america that produces more oil than africa has the lowest resource rents as a share of gdp and has good governance ratings according to us department of energy canada as one of the top ten world oil producers has one of the least corrupt governments in the world on the other hand norway is one of the top ten exporters of crude oil in the world while maintaining its stature as a perennial leader of the united nations human development index in africa poor governance has led to poor economic growth and it is manifested through corruption political instability ineffective rule of laws and institutions some african countries went through governance failures and corruption at some point in time but their governance capacity made them recover and ensure the maintenance of rapid growth performance through constant demands to improve government and reduce corruption in many african countries corruption takes place as a rule based on decisions that is public officials influence the economic decision in detriment of the entire society this results in inefficiency and high transaction costs as well as distortion of transparent and normal market operations and thus creating insecurity for investors corruption takes place when public officials break the laws to fulfill their own interest the most common types of corruption are bribery and extortion as well as the allocation of public resources to favor political benefits in most cases the african leaders try to run the country by copying the modern western state systems at domestic level and neglect the tradition and culture of their own people the leadership in most african countries is centralized thus the local government does not have the power and authority to take any decision therefore it hinders efficient the capacity of the local administrations due to rampant corruption african children do not have access to quality education which is required to let them gain knowledge and skills to equip them to have better ideas and opportunities for employment other correlated problems as well for example lack of skills and strong policies and that is the low economic performance with high inflation the ruling class in africa many a times pleads ignorance of the fact that they are in power in order to be of service to the citizens and not vice versa they exploit their positions to put as much public money as they can in their pockets and even get away with it unfortunately most african countries have come to recognize corruption as a normal occurrence and often see it as a means to an end in 1999 the united nations approximated that the ruling elites drained more than 250 billion dollars out of africa each year in their private over sea back accounts in europe where they have invested their ill gotten gains and wealth stolen from their motherland africa continues to be poor because politics is considered an easy ticket to prosperity to add to that the leadership has no continuity agenda and opt for dying in office being some of the richest people in the world amidst the most poverty stricken citizens in the world in this day and age corruption and bad leadership and corruption are killing africa s progress while the greater number of the continent s population lives on less than one one united states dalloes a day the population in most cases is suppressed by their leaders the autocratic means that keep these corrupt political bureaucrats in the hands of power again abject poverty and rampant corruption served as major obstacles to growth and development on the continent with on the other hand gross human rights violations injustices disrespect for rule of law and order misused of national resources and state wealth by autocrats and corrupt leaders and their families and friends dishonest bureaucrats foreign capitalists and the lack of proper democracy are some of the problems responsible for the continent s backwardness in the context of growth and development governance has increasingly become a major instrument for successful growth performance and development purposes in the world the government does not provide productive institutional framework to sustain good governance transparency and accountability of its institutions in many african countries weak institutions do not secure the required long run sustainable growth however many african leaders are contented with a short term solution that imposes a long term cost to the nation from the 1950s to 2000s africa has experienced lots of assassinations either by coups d etat or by civil naughty including political detentions thus depriving africa of the men and women who would perhaps have built a better future each assassination each coup d etat each civil disobedient and each political exile dealt a blow to africa all these ugly activities are direct results of bad governances perhaps under the influences of foreign capitalists to plunge the continent into perpetual crises to enable the foreign powers indirectly loot africa rich oil and other riches africa is perceived mainly by the west as insignificance but the continent s oil and gas are among the few outstanding exceptions to the perceived insignificance of africa by the west and other foreign capitalists several big powers will soon depend on africa for a quarter of its total crude oil imports and africa already accounts for more than a quarter of china s oil imports today in the words of the former chief executive of bp john browne unless geologists succeed in finding new and so far unidentified provinces as consumers we will all be dependent on supplies from just three areas west africa russia and the middle east dozens of research findings point to the fast that the people s republic of china and united states interests in africa are complex and many issues such as terrorism are high on the agenda africa is littered with fragile states upcoming and existing oil producing countries in africa have been marred by coup attempts and poverty in addition the failure to share the revenues generated by natural resources such as oil in an equitable manner has created disenchanted and disillusioned within the young populations which have provided a fertile ground for crisis and a haven for rebellions as evident of the arab spring which rapidly propelled the destructions and demised of many leaders accordingly crude oil is one of the world s most important strategic resources and africa has attracted a lot of attention among corporate and political decision makers because of growing global oil demand indeed it has been suggested that africa is experiencing a new diplomatic race thanks primarily to its oil and gas wealth with the united states and the people s republic of china actively competing for access to africa s resources china is currently africa s third most important trading partner ahead of the united kingdom and behind the united states and france in a world where both developed and developing countries require huge quantities of oil resources africa has once again become strategic for major actors in the international system strategic considerations related to africa are of course influenced by global processes and rivalries with china s great power status having recently received particular attention china s new style of diplomacy and its foreign policy principle of non interference but one china policy have been characterized as sensitive to local conditions in africa rather than imposing standards as the case of the united states which imposes conditions such as human right political and economic performance criteria for its foreign investment aid assistances and support towards projects in africa unlike in other regions like latin america and europe where the united states maintains political influence china on one hand maintains robust economic influence in africa the united states finds it difficult to outweigh china in its financial aid to african due to beijing new checkbook diplomacy and aid to african governments and institutions although the u s militarily out spent china in contrast and comparison this subject looks at washington and beijing growing impact on the african continent in the context of influence and support to the continent while it is difficult to draw out a definite conclusion empirically china is posing great threat to the u s influence in africa except for other regions such as the latin america asia and middle east where u s commends greater respect china and the united states use tools of soft power in different ways and with varying effects since the mid 1990s the prc has adopted an increasingly active and pragmatic diplomatic approach in africa that emphasizes complementary economic interests china s influence and image have been bolstered through its increasingly open and sophisticated diplomatic corps as well as through prominent prc funded infrastructure public works and economic investment projects in many african countries beijing have diplomatic missions in 49 african countries the u s international public image is gradually declining on the continent perhaps due to its foreign policies that remain unpopular abroad the united states continues to exert global foreign aid leadership and maintain a major and much appreciated aid presence in central asia africa the middle east and latin america u s foreign assistance to southeast asia has increased markedly since 2001 although most new funding has been directed at counter terrorism the regions with the largest u s public diplomacy efforts in terms of funding are europe eurasia and the western hemisphere latin america and the carribean likewise the u s international military education and training imet program seeks to promote democratic values mutual understanding and professional and personal relationships in addition to military capacity many aspects of u s social economic cultural academic technological and other forms of influence much of which emanate from the private sector or outside the scope of government remain unmatched in the world many american ideals have long term universal appeal while the united states continues to be a magnet for immigrants and foreign students despite a perceived lack of attention among elites the united states has maintained favorable public image ratings in many african and latin american countries as well as in the philippines a u s ally the united states and china share the same vital national interests of security and prosperity although each has a particular additional interest and each defines its interests somewhat differently each seeks freedom from fear and want and to preserve its territorial integrity for the united states its particular interest lies in value preservation and projection of those values china has thus made in roads into the oil sectors in nigeria africa s largest oil producer and angola africa s second largest producer which accounts for 13 per cent of china s crude oil imports other african countries with chinese oil interests include gabon mauritania niger equatorial guinea algeria liberia ghana southern sudan and chad us oil interests are locked into major oil producers such as nigeria angola algeria gabon and the new oil boom states chad equatorial guinea and sao tome and principe since most of the oil being discovered is off shore it also has the added advantage of being beyond the reach of protesting oil communities on land that are capable of disrupting the oil flow as had been the case in the restive nigerian oil rich niger delta since the 1990 s obi 2006a 93 94 it is fair to argue that the african continent has not traditionally been at the center of the united states of america usa foreign policy historical links between the u s and african countries date back centuries but significant change in both relations has been the growing concern about the hunt for resources and terrorist activities on the continent particularly in the horn of africa and the sahel regions the united states recent re engaging with the continent indicates that africa does occupy a central place in us global foreign policy strategy the us is the world s largest development aid donor and has programs dedicated to africa with billions of dollars being spent in various sectors on the continent the sino african oil relationship can become complex due to other linked areas of concern oil as part of china s desire to acquire more natural resources has brought criticism of china s neo colonialist presence in africa and questions whether china s presence benefits governance and the african people china and africa have since then become all weather friends that understand support and help each other fifty one of the continent s fifty four countries have established diplomatic ties with china thus far the most recent being south sudan in 2011 while most western analysts believe that the main driving force behind china s investment in africa is for natural resources and thus focuses on a few resources rich countries china is currently the second largest consumer of oil in the world and more than half of its crude oil is imported and by 2020 official sources estimate that china will import about 65 percent of its crude oil china s presence in africa according to shelly zhao briefing paper april 2011 to secure oil resources has been increasing the study of international relations has historically focused on the activities of large powerful states dismissing the smaller entities of the international system as unimportant or merely objects of policy for the larger entities this truism extends especially to those entities that exist in a partially recognized limbo neither a full part of the international system nor an ungoverned space yet in the post cold war world following the dissolution of large multi national states such as the ussr these entities have begun to proliferate such is the case of moscow in ukraine and syrian s brutal civil crises this proliferation provides a significant challenge to an international system in which the primary participants are states and to the institutions created to oversee their interaction for world peace this new race for africa s resources is already engendering conflicts across the region by analyzing the likely impact on the economies of oil producing states it considers whether we should dismay or rejoice over the new scramble for africa it concludes that the existence of a new scramble or a us chinese race for africa should be treated with some caution while the economic impact of oil investments is likely to be bleak both the american and the chinese governments were important in paving the way for american and chinese oil interests in expanding in africa the us government used diplomatic instruments such economic incentives and military aid china has proven more supportive and has provided loans debt relief scholarships training and provision of military hardware without political or economic pre conditions in exchange for a foothold in the oil business in turn incumbent african leaders have identified chinese unconditional financial resources cheap products and know how as an important tool to fend off pressure for political and economic reforms from international organizations such as the international monetary fund imf the world bank and western governments china is the new superstar on the african continent when it comes to new diplomatic ties trade expansion and investments in large scale development projects in the democratic republic of congo where copper and diamonds have inspired wars and mayhem there is currently intense competition and militia rivalries over the mining and sale a critical raw material used in mobile phones and electronic devices the battle over uranium used in feeding nuclear reactors continues to be at the root of conflicts in niger the connection between conflict and foreign exploitation of mineral resources can be drawn with respect to other countries including nigeria sudan cote d ivoire liberia libya namibia and zimbabwe for african governments china s new interest mostly has been a blessing diplomatically their dependence on western countries is eased allowing new diplomatic competition as in the cold war era and giving pariah leaders an alternative backing chinese aid funds are also popular because beijing asks no questions on good governance and is fond of prestigious grand projects economically however the chinese advance has come with mixed blessings for africa with china s admittance to the world trade organization wto it has boomed into an economic superpower of cheap mass produced exports giving no room for african competition but beijing is not only interested in gaining african export markets the economic superpower is not endowed with many natural resources making beijing dependent on mass imports of crude materials most importantly there is evidence of greater involvement of the united states and china in africa in terms of both commercial interests and political engagement china s bilateralism in relation to africa could undermine regional and continental institutions as it replays the colonialist divide and conquer tactics wars need money from liberia to sierra leone angola to nigeria natural resources such as oil timber diamonds and minerals have helped fund armies and militias who murder rape and commit other human rights abuses against civilians currently there is an amazing infrastructure race taking place within east africa helping to reduce investment risk within the region we see east asian powers providing infrastructure in order to gain a competitive advantage in these regions china is taking a very broad approach and accessing the region whole heartily we are also seeing japan s involvement and the us through anadarko s involvement in mozambique infrastructure is being built for mining and mineral interests and hydrocarbons are taking a secondary spot this will provide energy companies with an opportunity to wait for infrastructure to develop this fact increases a company s incentive to be a little less aggressive in terms of entering and building infrastructure specifically for energy battling to overcome its own created problems such as bad governance africa throughout the cold war until the mid 2000s played only an insignificant role on the world s stage in the context of international relations and diplomacy this is not to say that africa was irrelevant but the developments of the cold war somewhat overshadowed the continent on the global stage during the cold war period most of africa remained within the spheres of influence of the former colonial powers which made use of the relative freedom they were given by the great powers to materialize their interests in africa but with the end of the cold war things somehow turned the other way in the interest of the continent africa s recent advancement on the world s stage has sparked out neurons calls for the continent to occupy a seat on the security council with an equal veto but the question that arises is which of the three african countries to occupy the dedicated seat nigeria south africa and morocco are all vying and not ready to allow either one of the three to represent africa if the occasion arises the continent in recent time has been repositioning in the international system as far as international relations and politics are concerned but greed for power and wealth and bad governances are some of the major problems that are affecting the continent according to un s report eighty five percent of africans have no access to standard pipe borne water good healthcare delivery system electricity social security benefits sanitation facilities and good meals a day the report further indicates that 25 8 million people of the two thirds of the total world population suffering from hiv aids live in africa africa remains a continent abundant in human and natural resources but are managed to enrich only a handful of african leaders corrupt bureaucrats certain individuals and foreign capitalists who continue to exploit the continent nowadays more than ever as jean françois bayart wrote rather provocatively a decade ago the discourse on africa s marginality is baloney the economic demographic and political developments on the african continent suggest that africa is moving away from the periphery of the international system not without consequences for the traditional international actors in the region but farsighted political figures also agreed that africa has entered a new phase of history which is characterized by increased african actors on the world stage with greater influences considering africa s economic apathy and development gape the construction of a community of shared future for mankind entails instituting the right policy at the right time by the right people at the right place while those at the helm of leadership on the continent must be proactive not reactive and worse of all passive in paying keen attention to innovations industrialization and sound economic policy will lead to growth and prosperity on the continent about the author josephus moses gbala hinnih gray phd is an assistant professor at the university of liberia graduate studies program he is a

venezuela s opposition is playing with fire the maduro government has put venezuela in satan s record books that hellish distinction is because venezuela is in the grip of one of the world s 58 episodes of hyperinflation hyperinflation occurs when the monthly inflation rate exceeds 50 mo for at least 30 consecutive days of the 58 episodes of hyperinflation venezuela s inflation rate is middling it ranks as the 23rd most severe episode today i measured venezuela s annual rate of inflation at 132 743 yr see the chart below this contrasts sharply with the national assembly s lying statistic of 1 698 488 yr for december 2018 and the imf s absurd forecast of 10 000 000 yr for december 2019 prof steve h hanke although venezuela falls in the middle of the pack when it comes to hyperinflation magnitudes it is experiencing an extended hyperinflation 28 months and counting this ranks venezuela s episode as the fifth longest in history it is clear that the number one problem facing any new government in venezuela will be to crush hyperinflation if a new government solves the hyperinflation problem it will gain immediate credibility then it will be able to proceed to clean up the mess created during the chavez maduro years if a new government fails to smash hyperinflation and establish stability it will face the public s wrath and will be short lived to smash hyperinflation a new exchange rate regime will be required venezuela has a self proclaimed president juan guaidó a man plucked from the opposition however it is not clear what his views or other members of the opposition s are on what would be venezuela s new exchange rate regime but there are straws in the wind on february 2nd the economist reported in a briefing on venezuela that the opposition was cozying up to ricardo hausmann and his national plan the day after this plan calls for a massive amount of foreign aid and government to government credit huge write downs on venezuela s debt and an opening of venezuela s oil sector to private oil companies however hausmann is rather short on details when it comes to solving venezuela s number one problem hyperinflation all he told the economist is that he favored a pegged exchange rate system as opposed to a currency board he also indicated that he didn t wish to discuss the details of his peg plan in public because it might spawn currency speculation so we don t know exactly what he has up his sleeve but we know enough to conclude that if the opposition embraces any one of the many variants of a pegged exchange rate regime it will be playing with fire and it will fail indeed pegged exchange rate systems are fatally flawed they have a near perfect record of failure in contrast currency boards the system hausmann eschews have a perfect record of success to understand why consider that there are three distinct types of exchange rate regimes floating fixed and pegged each with different characteristics and results see accompanying table prof steve h hanke although floating and fixed rates appear dissimilar they are members of the same free market family both operate without exchange controls and are free market mechanisms for balance of payments adjustments with a floating rate a central bank sets a monetary policy but has no exchange rate policy the exchange rate is on autopilot in consequence the monetary base is determined domestically by a central bank with a fixed rate there are two possibilities either a currency board sets the exchange rate but has no monetary policy the money supply is on autopilot or a country is dollarized and uses a foreign currency as its own in consequence under a fixed rate regime a country s monetary base is determined by the balance of payments moving in a one to one correspondence with changes in its foreign reserves with both of these free market exchange rate mechanisms there cannot be conflicts between monetary and exchange rate policies and balance of payments crises cannot rear their ugly heads indeed under floating and fixed rate regimes market forces act to automatically rebalance financial flows and avert balance of payments crises fixed and pegged rates appear to be the same on the surface however they are fundamentally different pegged rate systems often employ exchange controls and are not free market mechanisms for international balance of payments adjustments pegged rates require a central bank to manage both the exchange rate and monetary policy with a pegged rate the monetary base contains both domestic and foreign components unlike floating and fixed rates pegged rates invariably result in conflicts between monetary and exchange rate policies for example when capital inflows become excessive under a pegged system a central bank often attempts to sterilize the ensuing increase in the foreign component of the monetary base by selling bonds reducing the domestic component of the base and when outflows become excessive a central bank attempts to offset the decrease in the foreign component of the base by buying bonds increasing the domestic component of the monetary base balance of payments crises erupt as a central bank begins to offset more and more of the reduction in the foreign component of the monetary base with domestically created base money when this occurs it is only a matter of time before currency speculators spot the contradictions between exchange rate and monetary policies as they did in the asian financial crisis of 1997 98 and force a devaluation or the imposition of exchange controls like the big devaluations during the asian financial crisis the same contradictions tangled up argentina s convertibility system which was not a currency board and resulted in a maxi devaluation and chaos so forget pegs they will always fail what about floating as a means to smash hyperinflation in a country in which no institutions have a semblance of credibility floating would be a disaster just look at what happened to indonesia during the asian financial crisis on the advice of the international monetary fund indonesia floated the rupiah on august 14 1997 but the rupiah didn t float on a sea of tranquility it sank like a stone in consequence inflation soared and food riots ensued these events ultimately forced suharto out of office on may 21 1998 currency boards have always worked to smash inflation and establish stability i know i have designed and helped to install currency boards in estonia lithuania bulgaria and bosnia herzegovina currency boards not only work but they also have an impressive theoretical pedigree the late nobelist sir john hicks made that perfectly clear according to hicks the currency board rests soundly on the strand of classical monetary theory developed by david ricardo 1772 1823 as hicks put it on strict ricardian principles there should have been no need for central banks a currency board working on a rule should have been enough those ricardian principles were put into practice in 1849 when the first currency board was established in mauritius since then there have been over 70 currency boards operating in most parts of the world although ignored by most observers their rich history has been overwhelmingly characterized by success even in the most trying times currency boards always produce stable money and maintain full convertibility countries with currency boards also keep their fiscal houses in order and realize respectable economic growth rates in addition they foster stable banking systems in which financial crises are rare as hicks recounts at the zenith of currency boards early in the 20th century the financial cycle was almost disappearing alas even an allusion to this exemplary historical record is absent from most of the contemporary literature including hausmann s national plan the day after venezuela s opposition must take note before its fingers are burnt by steve h

the u s federal reserve opened the year with a dovish turnaround in its monetary policy due to concerns over global economic growth and muted domestic inflation it was done by signaling adherence to the status quo on policy interest rates for the time being as well as a willingness to stop the balance sheet runoff earlier than envisaged the u s stock market welcomed the moves with higher share prices and a weaker dollar it also gave emerging economies breathing room to pursue higher yields however the shift in u s monetary policy has generated greater uncertainty over japan s exchange rate and financial markets first the yen has stabilized at around 109 to 110 against the dollar somewhat below the comfortable 110 to 115 range which continued for over half a year until the rise in u s capital market volatility in late december in addition the yen experienced a flash crash against the dollar on jan 3 appreciating nearly 4 percent to around 104 in less than 10 minutes this speculative attack took place during the new year s holidays when the foreign exchange market was shallow and has kept japan s government on alert for another flash crash during the 10 day golden week holiday from late april
every element of global economic trade is controlled and exploited by massive institutions multinational banks and multinational corporations institutions like the world trade organization wto world bank and international monetary fund imf control trillions of dollars in economic activity underneath that economic activity there are people who hold the reigns of power over the outcomes these individuals and groups are the stakeholders in direct opposition to principles of america first national economics the modern financial constructs of these entities have been established over the course of the past three decades when you understand how they manipulate the economic system of individual nations you begin to understand why they are so fundamentally opposed to president trump in the western world separate from communist control perspectives ie china global markets are a modern myth nothing more than a talking point meant to keep people satiated with sound bites they might find familiar but the truth is global markets have been destroyed over the past three decades by multinational corporations who control the products formerly contained within global markets the same is true for commodities markets the multinational trade and economic system run by corporations and multinational banks now controls the product outputs of independent nations the free market economic system has been usurped by entities who create what is best described as controlled markets u s president trump smartly understands what has taken place additionally trump uses economic leverage as part of a broader national security policy to understand who opposes president trump specifically because of the economic leverage he creates it becomes important to understand the objectives of the global and financial elite who run and operate the institutions the big club understanding how trillions of trade dollars influence geopolitical policy we begin to understand the three decade global financial construct they seek to protect that is global financial exploitation of national markets four basic elements multinational corporations purchase controlling interests in various national outputs harvests an raw materials and ancillary industries of developed industrial western nations example the multinational corporations making the purchases are underwritten by massive global financial institutions multinational banks note in china it is the communist government underwriting the purchase the multinational banks and the multinational corporations then utilize lobbying interests to manipulate the internal political policy of the targeted nation state s with control over the targeted national industry or interest the multinationals then leverage export of the national asset exfiltration through trade agreements structured to the benefit of lesser developed nation states where they have previously established a proactive financial footprint against the backdrop of president trump confronting china and against the backdrop of nafta renegotiated and against the necessary need to support the key u s steel industry revisiting the economic influences within the modern import export dynamic will help conceptualize the issues at the heart of the matter there are a myriad of interests within each trade sector that make specific explanation very challenging however here s the basic outline for three decades economic globalism has advanced quickly everyone accepts this statement yet few actually stop to ask who and what are behind this and why influential people with vested financial interests in the process have sold a narrative that global manufacturing global sourcing and global production was the inherent way of the future the same voices claimed the american economy was consigned to become a service driven economy what was always missed in these discussions is that advocates selling this global economy message have a vested financial and ideological interest in convincing the information consumer it is all just a natural outcome of economic progress it s not it s not natural at all it is a process that is entirely controlled promoted and utilized by large conglomerates lobbyists purchased politicians and massive financial corporations again i ll try to retain the larger altitude perspective without falling into the traps of the esoteric weeds i freely admit this is tough to explain and i may not be successful bulletpoint 1 multinational corporations purchase controlling interests in various national elements of developed industrial western nations this is perhaps the most challenging to understand in essence thanks specifically to the way the world trade organization wto was established in 1995 national companies expanded their influence into multiple nations across a myriad of industries and economic sectors energy agriculture raw earth minerals etc this is the basic underpinning of national companies becoming multinational corporations think of these multinational corporations as global entities now powerful enough to reach into multiple nations simultaneously and purchase controlling interests in a single economic commodity a historic reference point might be the original multinational enterprise energy via oil production exxon mobil bp etc however in the modern global world it s not just oil the resource and product procurement extends to virtually every possible commodity and industry from the very visible wheat corn to the obscure small minerals and even flowers bulletpoint 2 the multinational corporations making the purchases are underwritten by massive global financial institutions multinational banks during the past several decades national companies merged the largest lemon producer company in brazil merges with the largest lemon company in mexico merges with the largest lemon company in argentina merges with the largest lemon company in the u s etc etc national companies formerly of one nation become continental companies with control over an entire continent of nations or it could be over several continents or even the entire world market of lemon widget production these are now multinational corporations they hold interests in specific segments this example lemons across a broad variety of individual nations national laws on monopoly building are not the same in all nations most are not as structured as the u s a or other more developed nations with more laws during the acquisition phase when encountering a highly developed nation with monopoly laws the process of an umbrella corporation might be needed to purchase the targeted interests within a specific nation the example of monsanto applies here bulletpoint 3 the multinational banks and the multinational corporations then utilize lobbying interests to manipulate the internal political policy of the targeted nation state s in underdeveloped countries the process of buying a political outcome is called bribery within the united states we call it lobbying the process is exactly the same with control of the majority of actual lemons the multinational corporation now holds a different set of financial values than a local farmer or national market this is why commodities exchanges are essentially dead in the aggregate the mercantile exchange is no longer a free or supply based market it is now a controlled market exploited by mega sized multinational corporations instead of the traditional supply demand equation determining prices the corporations look to see what nations can afford what prices the supply of the controlled product is then distributed to the country according to their ability to afford the price this is essentially the bastardized and politicized function of the world trade organization wto this is also how the corporations controlling wto policy maximize profits back to the lemons a corporation might hold the rights to the majority of the lemon production in brazil argentina and california florida the price the u s consumer pays for the lemons is directed by the amount of inventory distribution the controlling corporation allows in the u s if the u s lemon harvest is abundant the controlling interests will export the product to keep the u s consumer spending at peak or optimal price a u s customer might pay 2 for a lemon a mexican customer might pay 50 and a canadian 1 25 the bottom line issue is the national supply in this example harvest yield is not driving the national price because the supply is now controlled by massive multinational corporations the mistake people often make is calling this a global commodity process in the modern era this global commodity phrase is particularly nonsense a true global commodity is a process of individual nations harvesting creating a similar product and bringing that product to a global market individual nations each independently engaged in creating a similar product under modern globalism this process no longer takes place it s a complete fraud massive multinational corporations control the majority of production inside each nation and therefore control the global product market and price it is a controlled system example part of the lobbying in the food industry is to advocate for the expansion of u s taxpayer benefits to underwrite the costs of the domestic food products they control by lobbying dc these multinational corporations get congress and policy makers to expand the basis of who can use ebt and snap benefits state reimbursement rates expanding the federal subsidy for food purchases is part of the corporate profit dynamic with increased taxpayer subsidies the food price controllers can charge more domestically and export more of the product internationally taxes via subsidies go into their profit margins the corporations then use a portion of those enhanced profits in contributions to the politicians it s a circle of money in highly developed nations this multinational corporate process requires the corporation to purchase the domestic political process as above with individual nations allowing the exploitation in varying degrees as such the corporate lobbyists pay hundreds of millions to politicians for changes in policies and regulations one sector one product or one industry at a time these are specialized lobbyists example the committee on foreign investment in the united states cfius cfius is an inter agency committee authorized to review transactions that could result in control of a u s business by a foreign person covered transactions in order to determine the effect of such transactions on the national security of the united states cfius operates pursuant to section 721 of the defense production act of 1950 as amended by the foreign investment and national security act of 2007 finsa section 721 and as implemented by executive order 11858 as amended and regulations at 31 c f r part 800 the cfius process has been the subject of significant reforms over the past several years these include numerous improvements in internal cfius procedures enactment of finsa in july 2007 amendment of executive order 11858 in january 2008 revision of the cfius regulations in november 2008 and publication of guidance on cfius s national security considerations in december 2008 more bulletpoint 4 with control over the targeted national industry or interest the multinationals then leverage export of the national asset exfiltration through trade agreements structured to the benefit of lesser developed nation states where they have previously established a proactive financial footprint the process of charging the u s consumer more for a product that under normal national market conditions would cost less is a process called exfiltration of wealth this is the basic premise the cornerstone behind the catch phrase globalism it is never discussed to control the market price some contracted product may even be secured and shipped with the intent to allow it to sit idle or rot it s all about controlling the price and maximizing the profit equation to gain the same 1 profit a widget multinational might have to sell 20 widgets in el salvador 25 each or two widgets in the u s 2 50 each think of the process like the historic reference of opec organization of petroleum exporting countries only in the modern era massive corporations are playing the role of opec and it s not oil being controlled thanks to the wto it s almost everything again this is highlighted in the example of taxpayers subsidizing the food sector ebt snap etc the multinational corporations can charge domestic u s consumers more ex more beef is exported red meat prices remain high at the grocery store but subsidized u s consumers can better afford the high prices of course if you are not receiving food payment assistance middle class you can t eat the steaks because you can t afford them not accidentally it s the same scheme in the obamacare healthcare system agriculturally multinational corporate monsanto says all your harvests are belong to us contract with us or you lose because we can control the market price of your end product downside is that once you sign that contract you agree to terms that are entirely created by the financial interests of the larger corporation not your farm the multinational agriculture lobby is massive we willingly feed the world as part of the system but you as a grocery customer pay more per unit at the grocery store because domestic supply no longer determines domestic price within the agriculture community the feed the world production export factor also drives the need for labor labor is a cost the multinational corps have a vested interest in low labor costs ergo open border policies ie willingly purchased republicans not supporting border wall etc this corrupt economic manipulation exploitation applies over multiple sectors and even in the sub sector of an industry like steel china india purchases the raw material coking coal then sells the finished good rolled steel back to the global market at a discount or it could be rubber or concrete or plastic or frozen chicken parts etc the america first trump trade doctrine upsets the entire construct of this multinational export control dynamic team trump focus exclusively on bilateral trade deals with specific trade agreements targeted toward individual nations not national corporations america first is also specific policy at a granular product level looking out for the national interests of the united states u s workers u s companies and u s consumers under president trump s trade positions balanced and fair trade with strong regulatory control over national assets exfiltration of u s national wealth is essentially stopped this puts many current multinational corporations globalists who previously took a stake hold in the u s economy with intention to export the wealth in a position of holding contracted interest of an asset they can no longer exploit perhaps now we understand better how massive multi billion multinational corporations and institutions are aligned against president trump countries that have treated us unfairly on trade for years are all coming to washington to negotiate this should have taken place many years ago but as the saying goes better late than never donald j trump realdonaldtrump july 24 2018 tariffs are the greatest either a country which has treated the united states unfairly on trade negotiates a fair deal or it gets hit with tariffs it s as simple as that and everybody s talking remember we are the piggy bank that s being robbed all will be great donald j trump realdonaldtrump july 24 2018 watch related the modern third dimension in american economics here the fed can t figure out the new economics here proof america first has disconnected main street from wall street here treasury secretary mnuchin begins creating a parallel banking system here how trump economic policy is interacting with the stock market here how multinationals have exported u s wealth here

course of the past three decades when you understand how they manipulate the economic system of individual nations you begin to understand why they are so fundamentally opposed to president trump in the western world separate from communist control perspectives ie china global markets are a modern myth nothing more than a talking point meant to keep people satiated with sound bites they might find familiar but the truth is global markets have been destroyed over the past three decades by multinational corporations who control the products formerly contained within global markets the same is true for commodities markets the multinational trade and economic system run by corporations and multinational banks now controls the product outputs of independent nations the free market economic system has been usurped by entities who create what is best described as controlled markets u s president trump smartly understands what has taken place additionally trump uses economic leverage as part of a broader national security policy to understand who opposes president trump specifically because of the economic leverage he creates it becomes important to understand the objectives of the global and financial elite who run and operate the institutions the big club understanding how trillions of trade dollars influence geopolitical policy we begin to understand the three decade global financial construct they seek to protect that is global financial exploitation of national markets four basic elements multinational corporations purchase controlling interests in various national outputs harvests an raw materials and ancillary industries of developed industrial western nations example the multinational corporations making the purchases are underwritten by massive global financial institutions multinational banks note in china it is the communist government underwriting the purchase the multinational banks and the multinational corporations then utilize lobbying interests to manipulate the internal political policy of the targeted nation state s with control over the targeted national industry or interest the multinationals then leverage export of the national asset exfiltration through trade agreements structured to the benefit of lesser developed nation states where they have previously established a proactive financial footprint against the backdrop of president trump confronting china and against the backdrop of nafta renegotiated and against the necessary need to support the key u s steel industry revisiting the economic influences within the modern import export dynamic will help conceptualize the issues at the heart of the matter there are a myriad of interests within each trade sector that make specific explanation very challenging however here s the basic outline for three decades economic globalism has advanced quickly everyone accepts this statement yet few actually stop to ask who and what are behind this and why influential people with vested financial interests in the process have sold a narrative that global manufacturing global sourcing and global production was the inherent way of the future the same voices claimed the american economy was consigned to become a service driven economy what was always missed in these discussions is that advocates selling this global economy message have a vested financial and ideological interest in convincing the information consumer it is all just a natural outcome of economic progress it s not it s not natural at all it is a process that is entirely controlled promoted and utilized by large conglomerates lobbyists purchased politicians and massive financial corporations again i ll try to retain the larger altitude perspective without falling into the traps of the esoteric weeds i freely admit this is tough to explain and i may not be successful bulletpoint 1 multinational corporations purchase controlling interests in various national elements of developed industrial western nations this is perhaps the most challenging to understand in essence thanks specifically to the way the world trade organization wto was established in 1995 national companies expanded their influence into multiple nations across a myriad of industries and economic sectors energy agriculture raw earth minerals etc this is the basic underpinning of national companies becoming multinational corporations think of these multinational corporations as global entities now powerful enough to reach into multiple nations simultaneously and purchase controlling interests in a single economic commodity a historic reference point might be the original multinational enterprise energy via oil production exxon mobil bp etc however in the modern global world it s not just oil the resource and product procurement extends to virtually every possible commodity and industry from the very visible wheat corn to the obscure small minerals and even flowers bulletpoint 2 the multinational corporations making the purchases are underwritten by massive global financial institutions multinational banks during the past several decades national companies merged the largest lemon producer company in brazil merges with the largest lemon company in mexico merges with the largest lemon company in argentina merges with the largest lemon company in the u s etc etc national companies formerly of one nation become continental companies with control over an entire continent of nations or it could be over several continents or even the entire world market of lemon widget production these are now multinational corporations they hold interests in specific segments this example lemons across a broad variety of individual nations national laws on monopoly building are not the same in all nations most are not as structured as the u s a or other more developed nations with more laws during the acquisition phase when encountering a highly developed nation with monopoly laws the process of an umbrella corporation might be needed to purchase the targeted interests within a specific nation the example of monsanto applies here bulletpoint 3 the multinational banks and the multinational corporations then utilize lobbying interests to manipulate the internal political policy of the targeted nation state s in underdeveloped countries the process of buying a political outcome is called bribery within the united states we call it lobbying the process is exactly the same with control of the majority of actual lemons the multinational corporation now holds a different set of financial values than a local farmer or national market this is why commodities exchanges are essentially dead in the aggregate the mercantile exchange is no longer a free or supply based market it is now a controlled market exploited by mega sized multinational corporations instead of the traditional supply demand equation determining prices the corporations look to see what nations can afford what prices the supply of the controlled product is then distributed to the country according to their ability to afford the price this is essentially the bastardized and politicized function of the world trade organization wto this is also how the corporations controlling wto policy maximize profits back to the lemons a corporation might hold the rights to the majority of the lemon production in brazil argentina and california florida the price the u s consumer pays for the lemons is directed by the amount of inventory distribution the controlling corporation allows in the u s if the u s lemon harvest is abundant the controlling interests will export the product to keep the u s consumer spending at peak or optimal price a u s customer might pay 2 for a lemon a mexican customer might pay 50 and a canadian 1 25 the bottom line issue is the national supply in this example harvest yield is not driving the national price because the supply is now controlled by massive multinational corporations the mistake people often make is calling this a global commodity process in the modern era this global commodity phrase is particularly nonsense a true global commodity is a process of individual nations harvesting creating a similar product and bringing that product to a global market individual nations each independently engaged in creating a similar product under modern globalism this process no longer takes place it s a complete fraud massive multinational corporations control the majority of production inside each nation and therefore control the global product market and price it is a controlled system example part of the lobbying in the food industry is to advocate for the expansion of u s taxpayer benefits to underwrite the costs of the domestic food products they control by lobbying dc these multinational corporations get congress and policy makers to expand the basis of who can use ebt and snap benefits state reimbursement rates expanding the federal subsidy for food purchases is part of the corporate profit dynamic with increased taxpayer subsidies the food price controllers can charge more domestically and export more of the product internationally taxes via subsidies go into their profit margins the corporations then use a portion of those enhanced profits in contributions to the politicians it s a circle of money in highly developed nations this multinational corporate process requires the corporation to purchase the domestic political process as above with individual nations allowing the exploitation in varying degrees as such the corporate lobbyists pay hundreds of millions to politicians for changes in policies and regulations one sector one product or one industry at a time these are specialized lobbyists example the committee on foreign investment in the united states cfius cfius is an inter agency committee authorized to review transactions that could result in control of a u s business by a foreign person covered transactions in order to determine the effect of such transactions on the national security of the united states cfius operates pursuant to section 721 of the defense production act of 1950 as amended by the foreign investment and national security act of 2007 finsa section 721 and as implemented by executive order 11858 as amended and regulations at 31 c f r part 800 the cfius process has been the subject of significant reforms over the past several years these include numerous improvements in internal cfius procedures enactment of finsa in july 2007 amendment of executive order 11858 in january 2008 revision of the cfius regulations in november 2008 and publication of guidance on cfius s national security considerations in december 2008 more bulletpoint 4 with control over the targeted national industry or interest the multinationals then leverage export of the national asset exfiltration through trade agreements structured to the benefit of lesser developed nation states where they have previously established a proactive financial footprint the process of charging the u s consumer more for a product that under normal national market conditions would cost less is a process called exfiltration of wealth this is the basic premise the cornerstone behind the catch phrase globalism it is never discussed to control the market price some contracted product may even be secured and shipped with the intent to allow it to sit idle or rot it s all about controlling the price and maximizing the profit equation to gain the same 1 profit a widget multinational might have to sell 20 widgets in el salvador 25 each or two widgets in the u s 2 50 each think of the process like the historic reference of opec organization of petroleum exporting countries only in the modern era massive corporations are playing the role of opec and it s not oil being controlled thanks to the wto it s almost everything again this is highlighted in the example of taxpayers subsidizing the food sector ebt snap etc the multinational corporations can charge domestic u s consumers more ex more beef is exported red meat prices remain high at the grocery store but subsidized u s consumers can better afford the high prices of course if you are not receiving food payment assistance middle class you can t eat the steaks because you can t afford them not accidentally it s the same scheme in the obamacare healthcare system agriculturally multinational corporate monsanto says all your harvests are belong to us contract with us or you lose because we can control the market price of your end product downside is that once you sign that contract you agree to terms that are entirely created by the financial interests of the larger corporation not your farm the multinational agriculture lobby is massive we willingly feed the world as part of the system but you as a grocery customer pay more per unit at the grocery store because domestic supply no longer determines domestic price within the agriculture community the feed the world production export factor also drives the need for labor labor is a cost the multinational corps have a vested interest in low labor costs ergo open border policies ie willingly purchased republicans not supporting border wall etc this corrupt economic manipulation exploitation applies over multiple sectors and even in the sub sector of an industry like steel china india purchases the raw material coking coal then sells the finished good rolled steel back to the global market at a discount or it could be rubber or concrete or plastic or frozen chicken parts etc the america first trump trade doctrine upsets the entire construct of this multinational export control dynamic team trump focus exclusively on bilateral trade deals with specific trade agreements targeted toward individual nations not national corporations america first is also specific policy at a granular product level looking out for the national interests of the united states u s workers u s companies and u s consumers under president trump s trade positions balanced and fair trade with strong regulatory control over national assets exfiltration of u s national wealth is essentially stopped this puts many current multinational corporations globalists who previously took a stake hold in the u s economy with intention to export the wealth in a position of holding contracted interest of an asset they can no longer exploit perhaps now we understand better how massive multi billion multinational corporations and institutions are aligned against president trump countries that have treated us unfairly on trade for years are all coming to washington to negotiate this should have taken place many years ago but as the saying goes better late than never donald j trump realdonaldtrump july 24 2018 tariffs are the greatest either a country which has treated the united states unfairly on trade negotiates a fair deal or it gets hit with tariffs it s as simple as that and everybody s talking remember we are the piggy bank that s being robbed all will be great donald j trump realdonaldtrump july 24 2018 watch

2019 bloomberg finance lp in two weeks china will probably be hit with 25 tariffs on 200 billion worth of goods if not by march 1 then after any trade truce ends supposedly 60 days later assuming an extension is still on the table the market is way too long on the china truce trade the dow jumped over 400 points to settle higher for the eighth straight week on friday president trump may see the gains as a sign that any pause in tariffs is welcomed on wall street and in theory cast aside the china hawks in his cabinet led by his trade representative robert lighthizer but consider this on friday trump spoke about the possibility of a trade deal with china during a rose garden press conference the main point of that presser was to talk about his decision to declare a national emergency at the border and fund his border wall without a congressional vote what was more interesting to the market was trump s trade war talk and saying he wants to include house speaker nancy pelosi and senate minority leader chuck schumer in on a china trade deal any deal i make with china schumer s going to stand up and say oh it should have been better that s not acceptable to me trump said during the press conference so i m thinking about doing something very different i m going to bring schumer or at least offer schumer and pelosi to come with me and i m going to say join me on the deal he said 2019 bloomberg finance lp schumer and pelosi are democratic party hawks on china pelosi was critical of china joining the world trade organization in the late 1990s china finally joined in 2001 the only thing schumer and trump see eye to eye on is china tariffs so either this is going to be a lousy deal and trump is going to tell the market look it s not just me it s all of us or this is going to create the bipartisan support needed to keep tariffs locked in on china long after trump is gone this seems to be lighthizer s thinking trump once again praised tariffs on friday he said the government was raking in billions of dollars from chinese tariffs imagine doubling those tariffs from the current level of 10 to 25 once the government gets addicted to that revenue what is going to stop them from removing it big business no they have petitioned the government for weeks now for exemptions to no avail wall street no wall street will get used to it after they pick the winners and losers in the stock market and learn where the companies hardest hit are going to get product instead of china there will be some serious revaluation going on see china is losing the trade war in nearly every way forbes stockcharts worth noting for china investors higher tariffs do not mean that china necessarily suffers great losses it can allow the market to lower the value of the yuan to make up for that cost and chinese manufacturers having grown exponentially over the last 20 years can relocate some of their product lines to other asian countries this shift has been taking place even before the first shots in the trade war were fired chinese manufacturers have been moving apparel shops to vietnam and bangladesh for instance some stitch and sew work is being moved into india if you get 25 tariffs the chinese economy will be under more pressure but that s a given says jin zhang a portfolio manager at vontobel asset management here in the u s companies like gm that have big businesses in china might be in a difficult situation and get beat up by the market you have to know what you own and try not to own companies that are in the crossfire he says we are underweight china what else can china do that is of interest to the u s while honestly protecting their made in china 2025 growth strategy and keeping their core economic policies in place there is no great deal in the works as trump continually hints is in the bag if there was a great deal he would not want to share that success with pelosi and schumer meanwhile the market is continually told by people close to trump including larry kudlow that the gap between both sides remains a big one how is that closing anytime soon china s offer to host trump in hainan a tropical island in south china was rejected by the white house in favor of a meeting with president xi jinping at mar a lago in florida as one investor told me in a casual conversation on friday why go to hainan only to reject china s offer it s better to bring xi to the u s and say look this is what we are going to do china may actually be fine with tariffs 2019 bloomberg finance lp here s why assuming sizable distance on key items up for debate namely subsidies by state owned enterprises to favorite enterprises especially in the advanced technology space then if china wants to keep those in place they can in exchange for keeping that status quo china gets 25 duties china has already opened its market to items on washington s wish list like financial services this will probably be expanded over time to payment service firms like visa and mastercard another positive for the american services trade with china american financial institutions are currently racing to set up shop in mainland china to tap the investor class there and help professionalize the mainland stock market as the msci index continues to increase the weighting of shanghai and shenzhen listed stocks in the massive msci emerging markets benchmark index u s firms will need equity analysts and other fundamental research on the ground to provide market insights to both chinese and global clients this is a very important market for american investment firms getting this market to open faster than originally planned without having to partner with a local firm can be chalked up as a positive for trump even though this move was in the works prior to the trade war china has also changed its intellectual property laws allowing u s firms to sue while they may not get a friendly court judge to rule in their favor the odds of washington being happy with that given all the theft of ip in the recent past are pretty slim companies will have to live with xi s pledge to toughen ip legal protections for all firms operating in china and that s that they will probably be fine with that too seeing how it is something they never had before it s a move in the right direction we can assume that xi is not going to make ip laws retroactive potentially opening the floodgates to american lawsuits against the country s best domestic companies for wrong doings prior to new laws still in the works 2019 bloomberg finance lp seeing how china is unlikely to change the way its state owned firms operate to appease the u s and assuming they have gone as far as they will on intellectual property the only thing the u s can do is keep tariffs as they are or tell the chinese look we don t like the role your state firms play in the market and we are not happy with your ip laws so we are going to punish you with a 25 duty and we might even put tariffs on more products as we see fit the end china doesn t have to do anything other than continue talks with the u s about market access in hopes to alleviate the burden of some tariffs on some sectors but in the meantime the communist party doesn t have a deadline to make trump happy for that the price is 25 take it or leave it either the tariffs stay as they are or they go up it doesn t take a harvard m b a and 10 years at goldman sachs to figure that out but tariffs won t come down especially broadly over time sectors or product lines might get a reprieve as trade talks work themselves out the return of tariff man and the bizarre invitation to schumer and pelosi to share responsibility for the outcome of a xi summit are suggestive of a president leaning towards 25 tariffs on march 1 says bryan mccarthy chief strategist for macrolens a boutique investment research firm focusing on china the market will sell off the second investors reach the tipping point on this and see more tariffs as the likely outcome
the u s federal reserve opened the year with a dovish turnaround in its monetary policy due to concerns over global economic growth and muted domestic inflation it was done by signaling adherence to the status quo on policy interest rates for the time being as well as a willingness to stop the balance sheet runoff earlier than envisaged the u s stock market welcomed the moves with higher share prices and a weaker dollar it also gave emerging economies breathing room to pursue higher yields however the shift in u s monetary policy has generated greater uncertainty over japan s exchange rate and financial markets first the yen has stabilized at around 109 to 110 against the dollar somewhat below the comfortable 110 to 115 range which continued for over half a year until the rise in u s capital market volatility in late december in addition the yen experienced a flash crash against the dollar on jan 3 appreciating nearly 4 percent to around 104 in less than 10 minutes this speculative attack took place during the new year s holidays when the foreign exchange market was shallow and has kept japan s government on alert for another flash crash during the 10 day golden week holiday from late april

it is increasingly clear that europe s populists want for the body what they want for the nation purity unity and self governance populist health policies mean citizens being free from outside influences whether vaccines devised by doctors regulations invented by politicians or diseases supposedly carried by migrants and in control of their own epidemiology the ongoing erosion of trust in the medical establishment as a whole is also to blame as frequent reports of dubious financial relationships between physicians professional medical societies and the pharmaceutical industry leave many questioning whether or not physicians can be trusted unsure of what to do and whom to listen to many seek answers to their questions elsewhere or simply rely on their gut feeling gavi s core goals is to shape markets for vaccines and other immunization products immunization protects people from being forced into poverty by high out of pocket expenses vaccines protect child health and support cognitive development allowing children to perform better at school and have more opportunities vaccinated healthy children grow into a productive workforce and become strong contributors to the economy and healthy children free up parents time so they are able to work vaccines are critical to building people s resilience to and mitigating the risk of disease outbreaks tied to climate change and good health is a critical determinant of peace and well being in a society people centered health systems are core social institutions in every country and immunisation is often the first point of contact between these systems and the population efforts will be made to support international conferences and the development and dissemination of strong international consensus statements and recommendations for the use of the new vaccines 76 we believe we can save lives by delivering the latest in science and technology to those with the greatest needs we work with partners to provide effective vaccines drugs and diagnostics and to develop innovative approaches to deliver health services to those who need it most and we invest heavily in developing new vaccines to prevent infectious diseases that impose the greatest burden to say that the bmgf has become an important actor in international development would be an understatement when it comes to global health and agriculture policies two of its key grant areas the bmgf has become probably the most influential actor in the world it is also likely that bill gates who has regular access to world leaders and is in effect personally bankrolling hundreds of universities international organisations ngos and media outlets has become the single most influential voice in international development but the bmgf s increasing global influence is not being subjected to democratic scrutiny unlike governments which are formally accountable to their electorates the bmgf is a private us foundation and remains unaccountable to public bodies except for tax reporting purposes even worse the bmgf appears to have bought the silence of academics ngos and the media who might otherwise be expected to criticize aspects of the foundation s work however it is not only big business but also big philanthropy that has an increasing influence in global development policy particularly large philanthropic foundations the scope of their influence in both past and present discourse and decision making processes is fully equal and in some cases goes beyond that of other private actors through the sheer size of their grant making personal networking and active advocacy large global foundations most notably the rockefeller foundation and the bill melinda gates foundation have played an increasingly active role in shaping the agenda setting and funding priorities of international organizations and governments vaccination coverage in the united state is high but in the face of the resurgence of vaccine preventable diseases such as pertussis and measles the existing gaps in the vaccination coverage of the us population have become worrisome gaps exist because not every patient who needs a vaccination gets it at the recommended age moreover the recommendations for new vaccines including vaccines for influenza and human papillomavirus hpv have been expanded pdi s field based medical sales representatives and inside medical sales representatives from our healthcare contact center can increase adoption of vaccines by responding to questions and concerns to increase immunization rates we must build sustainable systems for vaccination within the context of a changing healthcare system here some recommended steps toward achieving this goal assessment of the actual vaccination rate in a provider s practice consistently making recommendations for timely vaccinations to both the parents of pediatric patients and adult patients standing orders for non physician personnel to carry out vaccinations at the scheduled time without physician involvement educating physicians on emerging research of vaccine risks and on how to interact with parents who are concerned about the detrimental effects of the mmr and hpv vaccines and educating physicians about state sponsored and other programs that can help patients overcome financial barriers to vaccination on jan 16 2019 the world health organization who issued a report ranking vaccine hesitancy as one of the top ten threats to global health in 2019 alongside air pollution and climate change noncommunicable diseases global influenza pandemic antimicrobial resistance and infectious diseases such as ebola dengue fever and hiv throughout history the greatest contributors to disease and early death in human populations have been poverty poor sanitation and poor nutrition yet infectious diseases with pharmaceutical solutions dominated this list and there was no mention of the major opioid addiction crisis crippling and killing tens of thousands of people in the u s and europe or the iatrogenic medical error epidemic that every year claims more than 750 000 lives in europeand 250 000 lives in the u s where it is the third leading cause of death the immediate mainstream media response to the who s announcement was to focus on vaccine hesitancy on jan 19 the editorial board of the new york times declared that anti vaxxers are the enemy and called on the u s government to get tough by waging a bold and aggressive pro vaccine campaign that includes tightening restrictions around how much leeway states can grant families that want to skip essential vaccines by jan 23 the hill announced that washington state had declared a state of emergency because of 23 cases of measles reported in an anti vaccination community near portland oregon and there was a public call in the uk for social media platforms to clamp down on fake news and censor misleading information and negative messaging around vaccination the new york times editorial headline how to inoculate against anti vaxxers was a theme repeated in articles reacting to the who s suggestion that people wanting to make informed voluntary decisions about vaccination are a global menace one doctor suggested that parents who don t vaccinate their children are selfish it s a matter of i don t care about other people in the community i only care about the health and welfare of my own child there was no discussion about institutionally acknowledged gaps in vaccine safety scienceor the fact that most parents dutifully follow the advice of pediatricians and public health officials and only became vaccine safety critics after the risks of vaccination for their children turned out to be 100 percent no discussion about the fact that since 2011 pharmaceutical companies have no liability for injuries and deaths caused by government recommended and mandated vaccines they sell in the u s instead parents of vaccine injured children and others concerned about vaccine safety who for decades have been asking government and industry to produce better quality vaccine science and more humane vaccine policies that respect genetic and biological diversity were stereotyped as anti vaxxers and demonized as a threat to public health the editorial board of the new york times explained authoritatively the board its editor and the publisher of the new york times stated that scientists especially are uncomfortable with black and white statements because science is all about nuance but in the case of vaccines there are some hard truths that deserve to be trumpeted vaccines are not toxic and they do not cause autism full stop there was no discussion about why people are legitimately concerned about vaccine ingredientsand pharma paying the food and drug administration fda to fast track new vaccines to licensure without adequate testing no discussion about the fact that doctors are giving children 69 doses of 16 vaccines starting on the day of birth three times as many vaccinations as they got in 1983 and cannot explain why so many highly vaccinated children in the u s are sicker not healthier today 1 child in 6 learning disabledand 1 in 40 with autismand millions more suffering with asthma diabetes severe allergies epilepsy cancer schizophrenia depression and other chronic disease marked by chronic inflammation in the body the cdc states that 90 percent of the 3 3 trillion in annual health care expenditures are for people with chronic and mental health conditions the largely unexplained chronic disease and disability epidemic in the u s is bankrupting the u s health care system and there is no research being funded to investigate the role that ever increasing numbers of vaccines given to infants children and adults may be playing multi national pharmaceutical corporationsin command of a global 34 billion dollar vaccine marketare holding billion dollar contracts with mass communication companiesand public private partnerships with governments to purchase vaccines and create vaccine marketing campaignsthat dwarf the relatively small number of websites and blogs labeled anti vax simply for criticizing vaccine science and government policy yet there is no recognition by mainstream media articles of the fact that wealthy corporations and philanthropic foundations with political agendas well paid medical doctors and government health officials in charge of operating the vaccine systemare in privileged positions of power with a distinct advantage over ordinary people subjected to vaccine laws that place an unequal risk burden on individuals with genetic and biological susceptibility to suffering harm from vaccination in the uk the economist published an article entitled the campaign against vaccination in which an anonymous author declared across europe the rise of populism is damaging public health a common feature is skepticism of vaccines pointing to italy austria and france as hotbeds of political support for parental choice about vaccination the author attempted to politically tie growing public support for vaccine choice to a fear of migrants and coined a new term bio populism he or she went on to explain that bio populism is a combination of me first libertarianism and anti expertise herd mentality quoting italian medical professor dr roberto burioni who has stated authoritatively that vaccines are not an opinion and offered an explanation for why science can t be democratic the economist article ended with a warning that at least one pandemic will probably sweep the interconnected world in the next decade viruses after all know no borders there was no discussion of the fact that most parents and physicians calling for better quality vaccine science and informed consent protections in vaccine laws are ideologically diverse and do not all identify with one particular political party in fact a 2015 pew research center survey revealed that age and parenthood had more to do with vaccine hesitancy with young adults and parents with children under age 18 being less supportive of mandatory vaccination in the u s live science trumpeted anti vaccine movement joins ebola drug resistance on list of top global threats a doctor at johns hopkins center for health security was quoted as saying the reason that noncommunicable diseases and not infectious diseases made the who s top ten global threat list is a testament to how powerful vaccines are pointing to the jubilant public response to the release of polio vaccine in the 1950s he commented the headline people magazine chose was world health organization names anti vaxxers as a top threat to global health in 2019 at the beginning of the article the following statement appeared there is no scientific link between vaccines and autism according to the centers for disease control it ended with the statement to tackle the rising levels of vaccine hesitancy who plans to push forward with the goal of eliminating cervical cancer with greater application of hpv vaccine u s news world report ran this headline who anti vaccine movement a top threat in 2019 that author stated so called anti vaxxers refuse the required shots for their children on religious or philosophical grounds an increase in unvaccinated children has in part been tied to the medically discredited belief that vaccines cause autism spectrum disorder pointing out that a recent u s survey found that public trust in vaccination is on the decline she added the heightened mistrust researchers said was especially prevalent in small pockets of people in insular communities or like minded communities online pacific standard asked are anti vaxxers a major health threat the world health organization says yes this article included a quote from a pediatrician salon created the most sensational headline that asked the foreboding question the anti vaxxocalypse what happens to humanity if vaccine hesitancy continues the author explained to readers in other words the anti vaccination movement which has inspired many in first world countries to refuse or hesitate vaccination for easily preventable diseases is now a threat to global health and ergo stability the exaggerated response to the who announcement by corporations owning mainstream media outlets has been curiously uniform often using identical talking points perspective from parents and physicians in the u s and europe rationally calling for reform of the vaccine policies and laws is left out the politics of vaccination is in full swing but where is the money coming from to fund these vaccine marketing campaigns using name calling threats shaming and misinformation to demonize and call for discrimination against those who criticize vaccine science and government policy immediately after world war ii in 1945 the united nations un voted to establish a new international health organization in 1948 the world health organization who was founded by the un after ratification by 26 members states and given a budget of 5m who is a specialized agency of the un

great britain and northern ireland 23m brazil 19 5m italy 19m canada 15m australia 12m 56 because gates foundation grant money is earmarked for specific programs such as vaccine purchase delivery and promotion the gates foundation significantly influences the setting of who s program priorities in 2010 after a joint investigation by the british medical journal bmj in collaboration with the london based bureau of investigative journalism an article was published in the bmj revealing that three key scientists who influenced the who s decision to declare a swine flu h1n1 influenza pandemic in 2009 and recommend that all countries use and stockpile vaccines and pandemic flu drugs had financial ties to pharmaceutical companies profiting from the who recommendations glaxosmithkline and roche the 2009 pandemic h1n1 vaccine which was rushed to market to address a who declared pandemic that did not happen triggered an autoimmune reaction in more than 1 300 people in europe who got gsk s pandemrix vaccine and left them with narcolepsy an incurable immune mediated neurological disorder the who and the u s government are founding partners of gavi the vaccine alliance in 2000 the bill and melinda gates foundation provided 750m in seed money to spearhead the creation of gavi a public private partnership and multilateral funding mechanism involving the who governments the vaccine industry the world bank philanthropic foundations and civil society groups to improve access to new and underused vaccines for children living in the world s poorest countries the united kingdom has contributed 2 2b or 14 percent of gavi s total contributions the single biggest funding source for gavi is the gates foundation which has donated more than 3b or 20 percent of gavi s total income between 2000 and 2013 only about 10 percent of total funding provided by gavi 862m was used to strengthen health systems in developing countries such as improving sanitation and nutrition gavi is headquartered in geneva with an office in washington d c that carries out day to day operations and one ofin 2008 gavi announced that five countries italy norway canada the uk and russia had joined the gates foundation to pledge 1 5b in the advance market commitments amc to accelerate access to pneumococcal vaccines with donors providing up front funding commitments to support vaccine purchase and speed the introduction and use of vaccines in countries partnering with gavi currently the amc incentivizes vaccine manufacturers to sign contracts to provide pneumococcal vaccine to developing countries at lower per dose prices and be reimbursed by gavi funds by march 2015 pfizer and glaxosmithkline had received more than 1b from gavi s amc funds cdc officials provide gavi with technical support and guidance in 2015 the u s congress pledged to appropriate 1b to gavi that was spread over four years 2015 2018 64on oct 16 2018 at the world health summit in berlin gavi ceo dr seth berkley announced that 11 heads of the world s leading health and development organizations had signed a landmark commitment to find new ways to accelerate achieving goals of the united nation s sustainable development goals created in 2015 the new global action plan vaccine marketing initiative is being coordinated by the who relating sustainable development goals to vaccination of all the people in the world gavi states that in 2016 dr berkley and other gavi executives came under criticism in the uk in 2016 for taking excessively high salary packages according to an investigative news report which has been given 1 5 billion by britain another official at the geneva based group collects a pay package of more than 500 000 a year incredibly dr berkley was given a housing allowance on top of his 623 370 pay package in december 2018 dr berkley told cnn that while measles is one of the few diseases we could potentially eradicate that will never happen if wealthy countries like the united states can t maintain herd immunity because a measles case anywhere is a threat everywhere he said parents in the u s are delaying their children s vaccinations perhaps because they believe in immunization but are worried by some of the anti vaccine scaremongering this needs to stop echoing the idea that parents who don t go along with the vaccine program are selfish he added in countries like the united states we need to stop thinking about vaccination as something you only do to protect the ones you love and instead view it also as a goodwill act for the benefit of others according to the cdc in 2017 2018 vaccination coverage among kindergarteners remained high with 94 percent of children having received two doses of measles mumps and rubella mmr vaccine 4 or 5 doses of diphtheria tetanus and pertussis dtap vaccine and two doses of varicella zoster chickenpox vaccine among many other vaccines required by states for school attendance two percent of kindergarteners had an exemption from one or more state required vaccines the gates foundation was established in 2000 by microsoft corporation founder bill gates and his wife melinda headquartered in seattle washington a major goal of the gates foundation is to make sure every child in the world is vaccinated investor businessman warren buffet who took control of textile manufacturer berkshire hathaway inc in 1965 and went on to amass a personal fortune of more than 60b pledged 31b and became a co director of gates foundation in 2006 in 1998 the same year that the u s department of justice filed an anti trust lawsuit against microsoft corporation bill and melinda gates committed 100m to create the bill melinda gates children s vaccine program one purpose of that program was to establish an international consensus on vaccine use recommendations the homepage of the gates foundation proclaims all lives have equal value and states in 2016 global justice now published an investigative report gated development is the gates foundation always a force for good authors were critical of the unchecked political power and influence on global health programs and agricultural policies of bill gates and the bill and melinda gates foundation bmgf congress appropriated nearly 90b to the u s department of health and human services in 2018 and the biggest line item in the cdc s 11b budget was the vaccines for children program vfc 4 5b which was created by congress in 1993 under the vfc program the federal government purchases cdc recommended vaccines from vaccine manufacturers to administer to children who are on medicaid are uninsured or whose health insurance plans do not fully cover cdc recommended vaccines hundreds of millions of dollars are additionally allocated in the hhs budget for vaccination programs including 700m for the national center for immunization and respiratory diseases one of the most politically powerful public private partnerships in the world today is the lucrative one that has been forged by the pharmaceutical industry with government mainstream mediaand wealthy philanthropic foundations with political agendas in the past decade these public private partnerships have come under scrutiny by public policy analysts in 2015 authors of a special report published by the global policy forum observed for example the gates foundation has given johns hopkins more than 100m in research grants since 2015 including for vaccine development and promotion at the same time johns hopkins university receives more than 2b per year in funding from u s government agencies such as the national institutes of health nih and the national science foundation nsf to conduct research including for vaccine development and vaccine use promotion the national institutes of health nih and other federal health agencies give millions of dollars in taxpayer dollars to academic institutions and vaccine manufacturers to improve vaccine technology the u s government also partners with the gates foundation to develop and promote vaccine use for example in 2013 the cdc foundation received three grants totaling 13 5m from the gates foundation to globally advance the implementation of meningitis and rotavirus vaccine programs the centers for disease control and the cdc foundation have received more than 167m from the gates foundation vaccine manufacturers have also received millions of dollars in grants from the gates foundation including glaxosmithkline over 50m merck 1 4m 97 pfizer 16 5m and sanofi pasteur 3 6m mass media corporations are also under the influence of big pharma and big philanthropy money for example national public radio has received 20m in grantsand solutions journalism network has received 4min grants from the gates foundation recently gates microsoft corporation partnered with newsguard technologies inc a new corporation that is rating websites and online publications to fight false news misinformation and disinformation the newsguard corporation is also collaborating with other corporations such as google which owns over 90 percent of the internet search market one of the biggest investors in newsguard is publicis the oldest advertising company in the world and the third largest mass communications company today publicis is paid billions of dollars by pharmaceutical companies to market vaccines including a 1 5b media contract with glaxosmithkline pdi a publicis health company states it is clear that mass media communications today is being controlled by corporations financially tied to pharmaceutical companies and influenced by powerful political institutions in society ithe five largest companies in the world today are apple google microsoft amazon and facebook these and other technology corporations dominate online communications and sales and are positioned to join together to aggressively market vaccines and promote no exceptions vaccine use policies endorsed by the who and governments the threat to autonomy and freedom of thought and speech posed by these companies especially in censoring online public conversations about vaccination and health is considerable today everybody knows somebody who was healthy got vaccinated and was never healthy again the people whose lives are being impacted by business deals between governments big pharma and big philanthropy increasingly are being marginalized in the top down public policymaking process by wealthy and powerful institutions in society financing the global multi billion dollar vaccine industry this is evident when the people raise their voices to ask for better vaccine science and more humane public health policies and are demonized discriminated against and punished by those in control of those wealthy and powerful institutions a system that will not bend will break the responsibility for the crisis of trust in the global vaccination system lies squarely at the feet of those who operate the system and refuse to acknowledge the suffering of the people harmed by vaccines
the nonbinding green new deal resolution supported by socialist rep alexandria ocasio cortez of new york and many fellow democrats in congress including some running for president makes absolutely no sense it is a fantasy based on hopes and dreams with no basis in reality there s never been a more economically destructive job killing environmentally harmful costly and impractical proposal that has drawn so much support from members of congress and white house hopefuls not only is the green new deal impossible to achieve just trying to accomplish its absurd and harmful goals could send our nation into another great depression throw millions of americans out of work and turn the american dream into a nightmare marc thiessen alexandria ocasio cortez s green new deal accidentally exposes the left s big lie only one of the green new deal s goals reducing income inequality is realistic should our government ever try to seriously implement this crazy proposal wealth would disappear we d all be poverty stricken and america would be turned into a third world basket case another result of this nightmarish proposal would be a completely different crisis on our borders instead of the u s government worrying about migrants streaming into america illegally to build better lives mexico and canada would have to deal with millions of americans fleeing the poverty and hopelessness of the united states you could fill a book with all the harmful consequences of the green new deal the absurd plan would require destroying tens of thousands of acres of land to build thousands of new solar and wind facilities and it would eliminate millions of jobs in the oil gas and coal industries by banning nearly all fossil fuel use in just 10 years it would also impose numerous costly socialist policies like single payer health care a federal jobs guarantee and upgrading all existing buildings in the united states including every home since the resolution and an accompanying fact sheet and frequently asked questions were released feb 7 by ocasio cortez and sen ed markey d mass numerous radical parts of the proposal have received significant attention these include a promise to provide economic security to those who are unwilling to work and making air travel obsolete by building a nationwide high speed rail network however there are many other crazy proposals in the green new deal resolution and faq that haven t received the attention they deserve below are four important parts of the green new deal you probably haven t heard about 1 green new deal leadership should be inclusive except for white men according to the resolution green new deal legislation should ensure the use of democratic and participatory processes that are inclusive of and led by frontline and vulnerable communities and workers to plan implement and administer the green new deal mobilization at the local level elsewhere in the resolution frontline and vulnerable communities are defined as those belonging to indigenous communities communities of color migrant communities deindustrialized communities depopulated rural communities the poor low income workers women the elderly the unhoused people with disabilities and youth in other words everyone should be involved in green new deal leadership except for able bodied white men who are middle class or wealthy this racist and sexist provision is particularly strange considering that one of the primary co authors of the resolution sen markey is a wealthy white man 2 the green new deal s cost is so high that no amount of taxation could ever pay for it neither the green new deal resolution nor the faq provide an estimated total cost for the plan but the faq does state that the proposal would be so expensive that it would be impossible for private individuals and businesses to pay for it even if every company and billionaire were to pour all the resources at their disposal into this investment 3 how will democrats pay for the green new deal print trillions of dollars in many news stories about the green new deal reporters have stated ocasio cortez and markey have offered no plan for paying for their proposed massive new government programs however in the faq and in a separate green new deal draft resolution released in 2018 by ocasio cortez it was made clear that democrats suggest running up the national debt by trillions of dollars and printing money to pay for these socialist policies in the faq under a heading titled how will you pay for it ocasio cortez s team wrote the same way we paid for the new deal the 2008 bank bailout and extended quantitative easing programs the same way we paid for world war ii and all our current wars the federal reserve can extend credit to power these projects and investments and new public banks can be created to extend credit creating new public banks printing money and running up america s debt by tens of trillions of dollars would have disastrous long term effects not only would it rapidly increase inflation potentially forcing officials to raise interest rates to combat the inflation it would also significantly increase the proportion of the federal budget consumed by payments made to service the debt the current national debt is now 22 trillion and federal debt payments for fiscal year 2019 are expected to be 364 billion even without the green new deal interest payments are estimated to become the second largest budget expenditure by 2028 costing 761 billion if congress were to pass the green new deal americans would likely be forced to spend more than 1 trillion per year on interest payments by 2028 making it almost impossible to pay for numerous important government programs without destroying the value of our currency and the economy by extension by printing trillions of new dollars every year 4 promising tuition free college for millions of students in ocasio cortez s 2018 draft resolution and in democrats prior statements about the green new deal there s been no mention of a universal tuition free college program however the newly released nonbinding green new deal resolution promises to provide resources training and high quality education including higher education to all people of the united states with a focus on frontline and vulnerable communities so those communities may be full and equal participants in the green new deal mobilization there are about 13 3 million students currently attending a four year college and the average tuition for a public institution of higher education is about 10 000 if the government were to pick up the tab for every one of these students the total annual cost would be a whopping 133 billion or 1 3 trillion over the first 10 years and that doesn t include costs for the 6 7 million students attending two year colleges or the other training programs promised by the green new deal these socialistic proposals stem from the same marxist ideology that has along with the huge national debts they have incurred decimated countries like venezuela and the former soviet union click here to get the fox news app passing the green new deal would send america off the economic cliff and greatly expand the federal government s power over our lives we must stop democrats from enacting these dangerous policies click here to read more from justin

the main issues for investors have not changed there are three dominant ones trade growth and brexit unfortunately there won t be any closure in the week ahead and that may make short term participants reluctant to turn more aggressive the u s reported exceptionally poor december and january figures growth forecasts were adjusted the st louis fed s gdpnow tracker for example cut its estimate to 1 5 from2 7 the previous week the ny nowcasting estimate for q4 18 was shaved 0 2 to 2 2 but the q1 19 estimate was cut in half to 1 1 investors also learned ahead of the weekend that although the university of michigan s rose the long term inflation expectations slipped to a return to the cyclical low of 2 3 from 2 6 the fed s declared patience has clearly signaled no march what the fed decides to do around the middle of the year when some like ourselves see the window for a hike opening up will not be swayed by the data from the end of 2018 and q1 2019 there has been much talk from the commentariat about renewed deflation headline in january eased to 1 6 from 1 9 yet digging deeper the situation is not as benign as it may seem the fed tends to put weight on because over time the headline rate converges to the core rate not the other way around in turn many economists see the core rate being driven may wage growth core cpi rose 0 2 for the fourth consecutive month the year over year pace was unchanged at 2 2 real have risen 1 9 year over year in january up from 1 4 in december and is the fastest pace in more than three years the real average weekly earnings accelerated from 1 3 to 1 7 which is also the strongest rise since july 2016 the breakeven of 10 year tips has risen 20 bp since january 3 to 1 86 at his press conference at the end of last month fed chair powell singled out actual inflation not expectations as an important factor in determining the extent of his patience many observers are beginning to look for an opportunity to put on yield curve steepeners the pessimists see the curve steepening because the yield falls as the market moves to discount a fed cut some optimists see the yield curve steepening as the fed s volte face was premature and its patience means tolerance of the building price pressures and anticipates increasing more than short term rates falling recall that the flatness of the u s curve makes hedging the for international fixed income investors prohibitively expensive the u s economic calendar is light in the week ahead and if the unexpectedly poor retail sales and industrial output figures did not stress the dollar though there was some profit taking ahead of the weekend there is little reason to expect the high frequency economic reports until the in early march to be very impactful that said the will likely draw a great deal of attention as investors and analysts scrutinize the record with hopes of shedding light the apparent pivot and the providing more color on how it is thinking about patience and flexibility as well as any insight into its thinking about the balance sheet market participants are divided about china s economic outlook the pessimists think that is command system is terminal they have exhausted their options the situation will get increasingly worse this assessment seems to risk under estimating the political will of chinese officials to avoid a hard landing between tax cuts tariff reductions bank re capitalization issuance of perpetual bonds that can be swapped for pboc bills and the belated recognition of the importance of the shadow banking sector china has had its draghi moment whatever it takes this is doubly true because of the confrontation with the u s and the 70th anniversary of the 1949 revolution the u s china trade talks continue in the week ahead in washington reports indicate a memorandum of understanding may be struck that would signal sufficient progress is being made to extend the tariff freeze a comparison of the statements issued by china and the u s are different in tone and substance the u s statement includes chinese commitments china plays up the progress being made perhaps it hopes to deliver a fait accompli maneuvering to make it more difficult to announce the talks have failed if the freeze is to be extended tactically there is no advantage to agreeing to it until the last moment to keep the pressure on negotiators reports suggest the trump administration may be receptive to a 60 day extension there are rumors that china proposed a 90 day extension the rise of china was always going to be disruptive even as far back as napoleon there was some understanding of this how china has gone about integrating into the world economy has been more disruptive than it had to be china s reluctance to adhere to its commitments it made when it joined the wto in 2001 is an important source of frustration that is widely shared its excess capacity in numerous industries and its willingness to export its surplus makes it an economic threat to developing and developed countries however many countries experience the u s as another significant disruptor we have suggested that trump is the first post cold war president he has no time for ideological conflict he is a businessman economic rivalry is paramount there are no allies the u s is demanding a greater share of the gains from globalization rather than retreat from the global stage as the isolationist label suggest trump is pressing america s economic interests with renewed vigor the trade talks with china have exhausted the trade oxygen but soon europe and japan will move into the cross hairs the u s and europe are already having disagreements about what was agreed to be negotiated the actual document mou made a reference to not agriculture more broadly and this is what europe is insisting from the u s side because of eu resistance to agriculture reform see the common agriculture program or cap it agreed to substitute soybeans to make it more agreeable but it was understood by eu president juncker to represent agriculture the commerce department is expected to report on its investigation of auto imports and national security at the president s request observers are treating it as a foregone conclusion that commerce secretary ross will conclude that indeed reliance on foreign autos is a threat to national security and the president with a range of options including tariffs quotas and or some combination he will have 90 days from receiving the report to make a decision he has repeatedly threatened a 25 tariff on autos and auto part imports china has human rights violations that are abhorrent it often acts like a bully but there is nothing it is doing or threatening to do that is anything like this it would poison the well of trade talks with japan and europe and retaliatory measures would ensue auto prices would rise and some estimates forecast a loss of several hundred thousand jobs the impact could very well knock the slowing economy into a recession it is mad as in mutually assured destruction there may be no surer way to secure the decline of america s prestige and status in the world than to put a broad tariff on autos and auto imports it would be the 21st century version of smoot hawley it would mark the end of this attempt of globalization and american leadership resurgent nationalism may have also marked the end of the 19th century globalization under the british gold standard like nonconventional weapons the power of the auto tariffs may lie in their threat rather than in their use of course the threat has to be credible the fact that the and tariffs on national security grounds are still in effect for canada and mexican imports despite reaching a new agreement arguably makes the threat of auto tariffs more credible declaring a national emergency to take funds from military housing to build a wall on the mexican border may be legally challenged but the president is given a wide berth on defining national security the courts will be reluctant to second guess the commander in chief the conflict resolution mechanism of the wto is in disrepair because the u s is blocking the appointment of judges as terms have ended so it may not be able to make a timely judgment about this little explored defense national security for infringement of the best trade practices japan reports january while the uk releases the latest but the most important data point in the week ahead will be the eurozone s the weakness in the eurozone has been an important part of the economic landscape for the past nine months and the ecb has gotten increasingly concerned the has declined for five consecutive months to stand at 51 0 in january while the u s is enjoying what appears to be a record long even if unspectacular expansion the european cycle is short the 0 7 growth posted in each quarter of 2017 was the sprint to draghi s point there has not been the kind of structural reforms during the recovery and expansion that lifted growth potential the combination of weak productivity growth and little workforce growth makes for poor growth impulses perhaps the eurozone s flash pmi is like america s groundhog day if the pmi improves the economic spring could be at hand the worst may be passed the german auto emission issue may have been worked through the french economy is showing more resilience than expected in the face of the persistent yellow vest protests some of which have turned on themselves and macron s support has edged higher spain s snap election announcement hardly caused a flicker in the bond market where the benchmark yield finished half a basis point lower ahead of the weekend the same as at 1 23 and 2 79 respectively although there are of course eurosceptic officials in italy as there seems in all countries however league leader and deputy prime minister salvini distanced himself from his colleagues remarks and offered as close to a full throated endorsement of the eu albeit in need of reforms that can be imagined
new york feb 17 as wall street braces for the first quarterly decline in earnings in nearly three years some investors are wondering if the market is factoring in a bigger erosion in profit margins than will actually come to pass forecasts for us earnings after a big boost from corporate tax cuts in 2018 are falling sharply in 2019 but revenue forecasts remain relatively robust leaving an expected spike in costs as the main reason for profitability to weaken but some strategists say there is little evidence yet of such cost pressures and that margins may hold up better than expected companies since the 2008 trauma have made it a top priority to maintain and increase if possible their profit margins said ed yardeni president and chief investment strategist of yardeni research advertisement we don t expect that labor compensation and other costs will squeeze margins nor do we expect that an increase in those costs will boost prices he added rather we are betting on improving productivity besides the tightening labor market the trade war between the united states and china and the stronger us dollar are among the biggest potential risks to corporate margins this year for the first quarter analysts are forecasting a year over year s p 500 earnings decline of 0 5 per cent according to ibes data from refinitiv second quarter earnings are still expected to grow 3 5 per cent though that estimate also is down sharply from the start of the year advertisement the drop in forecasts has led to talk of a profit recession defined as at least two consecutive quarters of year over year earnings declines the last us profit recession ran from july 2015 through june of 2016 projected revenue for s p 500 companies has been more resilient with first quarter revenue growth estimated at 5 3 per cent based on refinitiv s data credit suisse strategists said profit margins are holding up better than the estimates suggest at least for the majority of s p 500 companies they said profit margins are eroding sharply for several heavily weighted companies including apple exxon mobil and chipmakers like micron technology which are skewing data for the entire s p benchmark index a recent drop in oil prices has hurt margins for energy companies a slowdown in the semiconductor business cycle has hit companies in that space and other firms have boosted investment expenses said patrick palfrey senior equity strategist at credit suisse securities in new york it s not a broad based macro issue he said when you look at the median company we see margins quite stable moreover worries that a tight labor market will drive up wages have been limited in earnings calls for the fourth quarter reporting period which is nearing an end goldman sachs strategists wrote in a note on wednesday that while some companies are feeling the pressures of rising wages more consumer facing companies including discover financial services viewed the trend as a positive for consumer spending also they wrote most management teams expected growth in the us economy to moderate but remain positive while the labor market has been tightening other measures of inflation have not moved much in the 12 months through january the us consumer price index rose 1 6 per cent the smallest gain since june 2017 according to us data released on wednesday though slower than 2018 us economic growth was forecast to average 2 4 per cent this year according to a reuters poll of economists when the overall economy is relatively strong that typically means there s still sufficient demand for products and it helps stabilize margins in general said keith lerner chief market strategist atsuntrust advisory services in atlanta georgia reuters
this is the fourth article in an occasional series exploring wealth and income inequality in connecticut and its impact on a state struggling to cope with massive debt find the other articles here christy regis had only recently gone from working three jobs to one when the dreaded notice to quit possession notice fluttered from her stratford apartment door in august the pre eviction warning nudging regis and her 2 year old daughter out of their home came after she fell 1 000 behind on her rent because she used the money instead to fix her 13 year old broken down nissan with nowhere else to go the pair moved in with regis mother uncle and brother in milford regis has since started a second job and said she will likely need a third if she hopes to rent another home in a safe community with decent schools even when i was working the amount i was investing in child care and everything it just did not add up and it was just like the money was going everywhere but where it needed to regis said we needed to eat it got to the point where it was like you had to pick and choose what you put your money to regis dilemma not being able to afford a home in a suburban area is a common one for many of connecticut s low income residents particularly people of color because of the state s longstanding and widespread lack of affordable housing an ongoing series local housing advocates place racism and the now illegal practice of redlining at the center of a complicated web of factors that have led to persistent disparities in housing options available to people of color and whites despite the malloy administration s efforts over the last eight years to create more housing opportunities the problem remains intractable advocates say due to restrictive zoning ordinances persistent segregation and housing discrimination research by the kirwan institute for the study of race and ethnicity at ohio state university indicates a majority of black and latino households in connecticut live in areas with high crime and poverty rates low performing schools and a lack of employment opportunities this is typically coupled with black and latinos disproportionately lower incomes leaving them with a greater need for affordable housing and spurring the development and rehabilitation of those units in urban areas though wealth inequality the differences between different households income stocks property and other assets and debts is one of the chief forces of division in modern society more economists are becoming increasingly focused on differences in the housing component of the phenomenon representing both the disparities between housing quality and the availability of affordable shelter housing inequality stems both from market forces as well as discrimination and segregation it can be both the cause and the effect of poverty richard florida a professor and director at the university of toronto s martin prosperity institute wrote in an april 2018 essay in citylab that a mounting body of research suggests that housing inequality may well be the biggest contributor to our economic divides the ability to buy and own housing much more than income or any other source of wealth is a significant factor in the growing divides between the economy s winners and losers florida wrote it s a matter of liberty and opportunity if you re stuck in a kind of de facto apartheid where you can only live in certain places because price of admission to other towns is too high you have a problem david fink partnership for strong communities low income families lack of housing mobility often leaves them with fewer choices said david fink a consultant for partnership for strong communities they have greater access to child care health care recreation and fresh food by living in those places fink said it s a matter of liberty and opportunity if you re stuck in a kind of de facto apartheid where you can only live in certain places because price of admission to other towns is too high you have a problem while affordable housing has remained largely concentrated in connecticut s biggest municipalities cities and towns sovereignty over their zoning laws has amplified the divide more than two dozen municipalities across connecticut have enacted strict zoning ordinances prohibiting multi family housing a type of development housing advocates describe as the most effective way achieve affordability other communities have fought efforts to create affordable housing within their borders with residents often voicing concerns it will change the character of their town or bring traffic the state has long used the 1990 8 30g law also known as title 8 as a measuring stick for evaluating connecticut s broad access to affordable housing that law encourages but does not require all municipalities to have 10 percent of their housing stock deemed affordable under the statute developers who build affordable units can appeal to the courts to override local zoning codes in towns that don t meet that threshold non exempt municipalities can meet a four year moratorium if they are successful in increasing their affordable housing stock by two percent in 2017 only 30 of connecticut s 169 municipalities met or exceeded the 10 percent threshold according to the latest affordable housing appeals list connecticut s persistent problems in this area fall squarely amid a nationwide affordable housing crisis that has led states to tackle rising housing costs by building upward in 2016 connecticut had 140 531 households whose incomes met the definition of extremely low according to the national low income housing coalition the nlihc found the state had 36 affordable and available homes per 100 renter households in that category in another recent report the nlihc ranked connecticut as having the ninth most expensive housing wage in the nation it found that renters make an average of 17 38 an hour while the full time hourly wage needed to afford a decent two bedroom apartment is 24 90 that means those earning the 10 10 state minimum wage would have to work 99 hours a week to comfortably afford that apartment for people of color however the struggle to find affordable housing in safe communities with good schools is complicated by more than just a wage gap redlining illegal but discrimination persists when the federal fair housing act was passed in 1968 it ensured protection from race based discrimination in the sale rental and financing of a home but 50 years later black homeownership is virtually unchanged and hovers just over 40 percent according to an economic policy institute report that standstill has left blacks excluded from a major wealth building tool and form of financial security in this country wealth was and still is built on housing and homeownership and that s just a block that people of color but black people specifically have just been shut out of state rep robyn porter d new haven said we have to talk about the things that impact a family and their ability to thrive to achieve prosperity or the american dream and zip code has a lot to do with that housing advocates say connecticut is still coping with the consequences of redlining a practice the federal government designed in the 1930s that allowed banks to refuse to finance home loans in distressed urban areas the original 1937 holc map of the hartford region the new deal sponsored home owners loan corporation created color coded maps that indicated where lenders could safely insure mortgages segregating neighborhoods comprised of blacks and immigrants through demarcated red hazardous shading the federal fair housing act outlawed that practice but today neighborhoods of color still do not receive loans at the same rates as their white counterparts said erin kemple the executive director of the connecticut fair housing center cfhc research by the urban institute published last february found bridgeport has the fifth highest white and black homeownership gap among the 100 cities with the largest number of black households in the nation whites have a 76 5 percent homeownership rate while blacks have a 34 1 percent rate creating a 42 3 percent gap minneapolis has the highest disparity with a 50 percent homeownership gap in the hartford west hartford and east hartford area the organization found that whites have a 75 8 percent homeownership rate compared to a 38 1 percent rate for blacks a 37 7 percent gap the gap is similar in new haven and milford where whites have a 72 percent homeownership rate and blacks have a 36 7 percent rate in this country wealth was and still is built on housing and homeownership and that s just a block that people of color but black people specifically have just been shut out of state rep robyn porter d new haven although homeownership among blacks ticked upward with the proliferation of subprime loans in 2006 their rate of homeownership fell drastically when the housing bubble burst two years later and many of those who owned homes suddenly saw their main assets disappear since then people of color have been steered into government backed mortgages which tend to be more expensive than conventional mortgages kemple said that makes it more difficult for low income families to buy homes or invest in maintaining them she added kemple s organization has conducted mortgage lending race tests to examine whether whites and people of color experience different treatment when finding homes and applying for mortgages cfhc used white and minority testers who have face to face meetings with loan officers did walk in tests of branch locations and used email tests of lender forms those investigations found that from 2010 to 2014 blacks and latinos were denied home mortgages loans more often than whites and 53 percent of all tests showed that the minority tester was treated worse than the white tester connecticut has also remained physically segregated with two of every three persons of color living in just 15 of the state s 169 municipalities according to an analysis of impediments to fair housing choice 2015 report by the department of housing and cfhc what is clear is it will take years of effort to get those communities back to a place where people will choose to live there kemple said the north end of hartford bridgeport new haven have so much disinvestment that people who live there don t have a choice or they can t move any place else because of discrimination cfhc receives an average of 2 500 calls a year from people who believe they are the victim of housing discrimination according to kemple the state s commission on human rights and opportunities chro also fields complaints through its housing discrimination unit the chro received 217 housing related complaints in fiscal year 2016 sixty five complaints cited a physical disability while 33 were on the basis of race and another 32 corresponded to color the commission has fielded roughly the same level of housing complaints every year according to chro spokeswoman michelle dumas keuler kemple said that discrimination often can manifest as a lack of responses to applications or rejecting someone with a section 8 voucher or a landlord s failure to return telephone calls after hearing a racially distinct voice on the phone other times landlords will not advertise in publicly available places or restrict their advertisements to white neighborhoods making it more likely they will receive white applicants kemple said many of the people who have come to cfhc for assistance are afraid to speak publicly about their experiences because they fear retaliation from current or future landlords kemple said location location location christy regis credit ryan caron king wnpr as regis and her daughter s things remain packed away in storage the single mother remains firm in her decision not to rent a home until she can afford one in a safe community even though times are tough i don t want her raised in an area that s not safe regis said regis who could remain on a waiting list for affordable housing in westport for another three to four years is determined to largely steer clear of urban areas and find a reasonably priced home in a low crime suburb with decent schools but while regis continues her search connecticut s stock of federal and state subsidized units largely remains in areas with high crime and unemployment rates and low performing schools throughout his nearly eight years in office gov dannel p malloy has made homelessness and affordable housing among his administration s top priorities the governor has repeatedly stated tackling those issues will promote family stability spur job growth and attract businesses and private investments malloy embraced the obama administration s challenge for governors and mayors to eliminate veteran homelessness leading connecticut to become the second state to reach that objective in 2016 that achievement dovetailed with the state s broader commitment to rehabilitate and create more affordable housing in 2012 malloy committed 300 million toward a ten year plan to revitalize connecticut s affordable housing stock within the state sponsored housing portfolio the governor said he made that decision because not all of the public housing units that fell into disrepair needed to be replaced and instead could be salvaged or converted gov dannel p malloy credit mark pazniokas ctmirror org file photo in an interview with the ct mirror last month malloy said he believes people should be able to live in the communities where they work and that it s not good for us as a society to live in communities strictly of poverty and strictly of wealth i ve said build it where we can because i haven t been able to move the legislature to take a position that everyone should malloy said i also believe that we lived in a society that had turned its back on the affordable housing it had and given the opportunity to build new or rehab existing housing in cities that were open to that versus not doing anything i chose to do something the state has funded created or rehabilitated 21 000 affordable housing units since malloy took office in 2011 according to doh the connecticut housing finance authority committed nearly 575 million in loans for affordable housing from 2011 through 2017 and since 2011 the malloy administration has invested funding toward the development of affordable housing in 103 municipalities according to doh spokesman daniel arsenault but despite the administration s commitment to further affordable housing through different state administered subsidized housing programs and grants it has been criticized for largely failing to bring subsidized affordable units beyond densely populated urban areas the housing department has used the kirwan institute s opportunity mapping tool to show available resources across every community in connecticut including indicators like school performance homeownership percentages crime rates job diversity and unemployment rates the mapping rates areas on a five level scale of very high opportunity to very low opportunity typically upward of 85 percent of government subsidized units are located in very low low or moderate opportunity areas according to open community alliance oca a local housing advocacy organization housing commissioner evonne klein said affordable housing remains a tough issue on a local and legislative level but it is critical for connecticut residents and the state s economy in an updated analysis oca together with the kirwan institute and the cfhc found 73 percent of blacks and latinos live in low and very low opportunity areas in connecticut compared to 26 percent of whites and 36 percent of asians an updated map by oca cfhc and the kirwan institute shows the opportunity areas where people of color live credit open communities alliance klein said the department does not have any stated goal for the amount of affordable housing it would like to create or rehabilitate in high opportunity areas and does not plan to develop one the joint doh and cfhc 2015 report notes that historically connecticut s numerous strategies to promote affordable housing throughout the years have largely focused on the creation of affordable housing rather than its location in a diversity of areas klein said the department is working hard to change that a task she said involves changing the mindset of developers municipal and state leaders and connecticut s lawmakers here s the thing if we re not getting applications from developers who are building in high opportunity areas and we can give every incentive you could give if we re not getting those applications we don t control that klein said it s not good for us as a society to live in communities strictly of poverty and strictly of wealth gov dannel p malloy the joint 2015 report states that 63 percent of all government assisted housing under title 8 in 2011 is located in 20 municipalities that have disproportionately high minority populations furthermore 71 percent of the qualifying family units are in those same 20 municipalities only 29 percent of the qualifying family units are in municipalities that are disproportionately non hispanic white the report said malloy s administration has focused on crafting legislation to tackle strict municipal zoning regulations while simultaneously pushing back on attempts to loosen the state s affordable housing standards rep larry butler d waterbury credit kyle constable ctmirror org state rep larry butler d waterbury said he believes a bill the general assembly passed in 2017 after narrowly overriding a veto by malloy gives municipalities incentives to build more affordable housing malloy had argued it would do exactly the opposite the governor championed an unsuccessful bill in the last legislative session that would have pushed communities to end bans on multi family housing before it died lawmakers stripped the bill of language that would withhold discretionary funding from towns that didn t comply with its mandate requiring zoning regulations to provide for rather than encourage housing development opportunities to meet local and regional needs the bill also would have eliminated a requirement the regulations be made to consider the character of a district brian o connor the director of public policy for connecticut conference of municipalities ccm said the organization initially opposed the measure because it believed the bill was too punitive i think actually everyone recognizes connecticut is a high cost state and many communities are out of reach for some o connor said ccm supports examining policy decisions that would reduce municipalities dependence on property taxes and bolster alternative revenue sources to create more housing affordability o connor said local zoning power amplifies divide the sunday following a june 5 public hearing on a proposal to build a 37 unit affordable housing development in the picturesque shoreline community of old lyme the rev steve jungkeit stood in the pulpit of the first congregational church and said he found the entire evening depressing and dismaying in the extreme more than 500 residents of the town had crammed the middle school auditorium earlier that week to hear details about the application from the women s institute for housing and economic development and hope partnership to build affordable housing on two neighboring properties close to one of the town s two i 95 exit ramps residents who attended the hearing and the hearings that followed cited concerns about traffic and potential accidents environmental issues an ethical conflict on the part of one of the applicant s attorneys and the influx of students who would attend the local schools but it was the tenor of that first hearing one of antipathy spite and scorn that stood out to jungkeit a spirit of listening or the posing of honest questions in a spirit of seeking to understand was entirely absent said jungkeit those who supported the application believe it will bring much needed socio economic and racial diversity to the town although the town s zoning commission recently approved the application on a 3 2 vote ongoing anger and concern about the project are likely to lead to litigation making old lyme a microcosm of the argument over affordable housing that has played out in towns across connecticut these local battles are evidence of an inescapable fact the ability of low income families to move from urban to suburban areas is hampered not only by the location of state and federally subsidized housing but by municipal zoning policies and the limited jurisdiction of housing authorities in connecticut municipalities are each tasked with crafting their own zoning policies which according to housing attorney tim hollister gives cities and towns a great deal of authority in mapping residential areas and regions that accommodate multi family housing municipalities also have full discretion over zones that allow single family two family elderly and affordable housing title 8 defines affordable housing as units that are either government assisted or deed restricted where at least 15 percent are required to be rented for 40 years to families who make 60 percent or less of the median income and an additional 15 percent must be set aside for families earning 80 percent or less of the median income the joint doh and cfhc report states municipalities can also dictate large lot requirements and limitations on the number of units allowed per acre among other ordinances the report notes the average minimum lot size for a single family development across the state is 52 acres while for affordable housing developments it is 2 6 acres many other municipalities require 5 or more acres for multifamily and affordable developments regardless of the number of units and have at least one zone that requires less than an acre for single family units the report said many wealthy suburbs have historically enacted very restrictive zoning regulations to prevent racial migration across borders hollister said aside from those that bar it 20 cities and towns allow multi family housing which is defined as three or more units as a right under their zoning regulations another 122 allow it by special permit bethlehem does not have zoning ordinances and morris does not have multi family zoning ordinances erin boggs the executive director of oca said allowing municipalities to determine their own zoning regulations has been detrimental to the creation of affordable housing in some cases she said it has led to onerous more expensive zoning ordinances like requiring a large distance between multi family housing and the roadway known as a setback open communities alliance executive director erin boggs credit clarice silber ctmirror org it s been the driving force behind the segregation that we see right now in addition to the sort of government policy and subsidized housing boggs said it leads to this sort of race to the bottom kind of scenario where every town is competing against every other town to see who can have depending on your perspective fewer low income people or fewer people of color towns across the state have gone to battle with affordable housing developers to fight attempts to build in their municipalities through local petitions opposition testimony and advocacy websites those opposed to affordable housing developments often cite concerns that it will change the character of their town create congestion and erode local control over those decisions but when taken to court local zoning commissions have the burden of proving their denial of applications was necessary because of health or safety issues the dearth of affordable housing in suburban communities has not made things any easier for the people who run urban housing authorities and must contend daily with long waitlists for public housing units karen dubois walton the executive director of the new haven housing authority said in any given year there are upward of 6 000 families on the city s public housing waitlist about 200 spots open up each year out of the city s 2 500 units as families typically stay in their units for a 12 to 13 year period dubois walton said some families sit on the waiting list for a decade and the housing authority s informal polling suggests some of them go homeless while large numbers share housing with family or friends others are severely rent burdened and spend more than 50 percent of their income on housing housing authorities in connecticut are currently restricted by law to serve the municipalities where they are located which means they can only build units or assign a certain type of section 8 voucher within their jurisdiction in order to bypass that restriction the governing bodies of two separate municipalities must decide to collaborate and create a joint housing authority the doh and cfhc 2015 report states very few housing authorities use that option and because of that municipal housing authority structure funding for housing authorities generally must be used within municipal boundaries it leads to this sort of race to the bottom kind of scenario where every town is competing against every other town to see who can have depending on your perspective fewer low income people or fewer people of color erin boggs executive director open communities alliance the policy is yet another factor that has reinforced the concentration of affordable housing in connecticut s urban centers fink the psc consultant said there s a mismatch of housing stock available in connecticut most towns have an abundance of single family homes but not enough buyers fink said according to malloy s budget office the grand list residential property went down or remained flat in 151 of the state s 169 municipalities from 2008 through 2017 here s why that s so important all of these towns about 90 percent of their revenue comes from property taxes no sales tax no local income tax fink said you have a situation in connecticut where there s too many sellers and not enough buyers therefore the value of property falls the grand list shrinks and municipalities either have to raise taxes or cut services boggs said changing the state s affordable housing landscape and giving low income families the opportunity to move will come down to changing hearts and minds in towns and within the state legislature while also adhering to state and federal fair housing laws it s as simple as that boggs said and you know in my experience in this state it hasn t been until the law is used in most instances that you see significant change in behavior reporter keith m phaneuf contributed

miserable and happy in the sphere of economics misery tends to flow from high inflation steep borrowing costs and unemployment the most surefire way to mitigate that misery is economic growth all else equal happiness tends to blossom when growth is strong inflation and interest rates are low and jobs are plentiful many countries measure and report these economic metrics on a regular basis comparing them nation by nation can tell us a lot about where in the world people are sad or happy the first misery index was constructed by economist art okun in the 1960s as a way to provide president lyndon b johnson with an easily digestible snapshot of the economy that original misery index was just a simple sum of a nation s annual inflation rate and its unemployment rate the index has been modified several times first by robert barro of harvard and then by myself my modified misery index is the sum of the unemployment inflation and bank lending rates minus the percentage change in real gdp per capita higher readings on the first three elements are bad and make people more miserable these are offset by a good gdp per capita growth which is subtracted from the sum of the bads a higher misery index score reflects a higher level of misery for consistency and comparability i use data from the economist intelligence unit to calculate the misery index since the islamic revolution iran s misery index score has always been elevated indicating misery in 2017 for example iran s score was 34 6 that was a miserable score but in 2018 iranians were much worse off for 2018 iran s misery index score

by gareth vaughan with the reserve bank having recently declared the banking system robust to a severe dairy stress test it begs the question as to what could be big enough to really rattle the banking system or financial stability to its very foundations there are plenty of potential overseas scenarios that could threaten financial stability in new zealand an economic meltdown in china a prolonged freezing of international credit markets a major act of terrorism war etc etc but back in nz the reserve bank prudential regulator of our banks has effectively declared nz s banks safe from a major dairy derived disaster remember about 38 billion or 10 of their lending is to the dairy sector if we accept the reserve bank s conclusion from its dairy stress test then domestically only one sector banks lend to can be considered a threat to financial stability and that sector of course is the housing market my argument is that if as it clearly is housing is the biggest domestic threat to nz s financial stability banks should be holding more capital against their housing loans as the moody s chart below demonstrates nz banks have about 55 of their lending exposed to housing to give some context of size total household debt stood at 228 5 billion as of january which is equivalent to 93 of last year s 246 billion gross domestic product mortgage sizes are at record highs and as my colleague david hargreaves recently noted nz s household debt to disposable income ratio is at a record high of 162 more capital required to cover business rural loan losses than losses on housing lending against this backdrop it s worth pointing out that banks reserve bank enforced capital rules mean they hold less capital against housing loans than they do against lending to businesses and farmers to cover any losses a perusal of disclosure statements from anz the country s biggest bank and number one mortgage lender and from state owned bank kiwibank demonstrates this anz like asb bnz and westpac is allowed to use the internal ratings based irb regulatory capital approach this means they develop their own models to calculate their regulatory capital requirements and must then get them approved by the reserve bank all other banks including kiwibank run what s known as the standardised approach where the reserve bank prescribes their requirements the latest disclosure from anz shows what s known as a risk weighted exposure of 14 5 billion on 57 5 billion worth of on balance sheet residential mortgages the sum of risk weighted exposures represents the total credit exposure the bank has accepted anz thus has a total capital requirement held against its mortgages to cover potential losses of 1 163 billion just to reiterate for anz that s about 1 2 billion of capital held against total mortgages of 57 5 billion anz has an exposure weighted risk weight on residential mortgages of 24 in contrast anz s risk weight on 36 2 billion of corporate including rural lending is 56 with total capital held against this lending of 1 73 billion thus capital held against corporate lending exceeds what anz holds against mortgage exposures by 567 million or a third even though mortgages top the bank s corporate lending by 21 3 billion kiwibank has risk weighted exposure of 4 464 billion on 12 8 billion of on balance sheet residential mortgages thus its minimum capital requirement is 357 million and as a standardised bank kiwibank has a 35 risk weighting on its mortgages kiwibank has most of its much smaller business lending exposure 728 million at a 100 risk weighting with a small slice of this at 50 the reserve bank chart below gives an example of how risk weights impact the amount of capital banks hold against different asset classes although nz banks

as we reported last july nz s big banks do have higher risk weights on mortgage lending than their australian parents that s despite australia s 2014 15 financial system inquiry requiring the parents of nz s big four banks to raise about a 12 billion of capital to lift their mortgage risk weights to at least 25 from about 16 overall lending is weighted towards residential lending and away from the productive sector even within the banking industry not everyone thinks it s a good idea for banks to favour residential mortgage lending over business lending to the extent they do here s some comments i reported in 2012 from bnz s ceo of the time andrew thorburn he touched on the financial stability issue noting a house price fall of 10 could lead to greater wealth destruction than caused by the 1987 sharemarket crash and he also noted a massive long term bias towards investment in residential property at the expense of the productive sector thorburn acknowledged the imbalance in favour of investment in residential property over productive businesses was writ large in new zealand banks balance sheets almost 50 of bnz s lending book for example is supported by residential housing and it s pretty much a rock solid asset for us as it is for our competitors the expression safe as houses had deep resonance for bankers he added i can t speak for the other banks but it has long concerned me that overall lending is weighted towards residential lending and away from the productive sector at a very time when new zealand is slipping down the oecd ladder of gdp per capita at a time when so many young new zealanders are unemployed or think they can make a better living in australia and other places and during a period in which we ve essentially maintained our standard of living as a nation by borrowing from the savings of people in other countries long term this is unsustainable thorburn said and new zealand is one of the few developed countries in the world without a capital gains tax applying to investment in residential housing we also support negative gearing and have no stamp duty on property purchases said thorburn as a consequence we have seen in this country a massive long term bias towards investment in residential property a non productive asset in investment terms albeit a critical life requirement for people and families thorburn incidentally is now ceo of bnz s parent national australia bank a precedent in terms of the reserve bank making banks increase capital held against a specific asset class there s a recent precedent which looks a very wise move in hindsight in 2011 the reserve bank made the big four banks increase the risk weights on rural loans to up to 90 from 50 it was 100 prior to 2008 and other rural lenders including rabobank are at 100 alan bollard reserve bank governor at the time told a parliamentary select committee banks had been very lucky dairy prices had rebounded bollard said as the global financial crisis gfc kicked into gear with dairy prices going up farmers rushed out to borrow and consolidate and banks rushed out to lend it s pretty clear to us and it should be to them as well that they over stretched themselves bollard told the select committee in 2011 actually some of them have been very lucky that dairy prices have picked up again with dairy farmers now looking at three consecutive seasons of payouts below the breakeven level estimated by the reserve bank to be 5 30 per kilogramme of milk solids who would now argue the 2011 move to make banks hold more capital to cover potential losses on rural loans was not the correct one houston we have a problem widespread concerns about auckland house prices have been well documented over the past two or three years here s but a few examples reserve bank governor graeme wheeler recently noted auckland has a house price to income ratio of 8 5 times with the rest of nz at 5 1 times a median multiple of 3 0 times or less is generally regarded as a good marker for housing affordability this follows the auckland council saying last october it wants to see the city s median house price to median household income ratio halved to 5 1 by 2030 in an attempt to improve housing affordability a bloomberg report over easter shows nz house prices have risen the most across a range of countries over recent years since the global property market bottomed out at the start of 2012 house prices have risen most in new zealand australia and south africa increases of more than 30 percent in the three countries compare with an average gain of 11 percent in the sample bloomberg reports yale econometrics professor peter phillips an economist who has studied asset bubbles extensively overseas and has been tipped to win a nobel prize co authored with auckland university economics lecturer ryan greenaway mcgrevy an academic paper identifying auckland s housing market as being in bubble territory as of the end of february the median auckland house price was up 215 000 or 40 in three years to 750 000 according to the real estate institute of nz and credit ratings agencies remain wary of the threat to nz s financial stability from strong house prices here s standard poor s from last october in new zealand we believe that robust house price growth particularly in auckland is elevating risks in the financial system hence on august 14 2015 we negatively revised our bank industry country risk assessment bicra on new zealand and at the same time took various negative rating actions on financial institutions this negative bicra change followed an extended period whereby new zealand s previous economic trend was negative primarily because of property concerns says s p so we do have a problem with high house prices and housing affordability and our bank s have the lion s share of their lending in a sector that poses the biggest risk to nz s financial stability things could get particularly tricky if there was a spike in interest rates even back to something resembling historically normal levels off current lows or if unemployment surged and loan default rates started rising note the average bank two year mortgage rate is currently about 4 5 but was as high as 9 9 in march 2008 and the current 5 3 unemployment rate is way below the 11 4 recorded in 1992 reserve bank reviewing banks capital requirements but unsympathetic to higher mortgage risk weights so why not simply increase the amount of capital banks must hold against their housing lending along the lines of what the reserve bank did to rural lending in 2011 the reserve bank is currently reviewing bank capital requirements and the irb capital modelling used by the big four banks so why not simply bump up the risk weights required on mortgage lending to say 50 after all that s where they were until lowered to current levels in 2008 bizarrely this reduction was made the same year the gfc was sparked by a us housing market collapse actually rather than bump up capital requirements on home loans to 50 of risk weighted exposures why not make it 20 of total mortgage exposures the banks could have say a three year period to phase this in doubtless bank bosses their shareholders and lobbyists anticipating less profitable mortgage lending and higher costs would vigorously protest this impost they d also point to the fact that housing loans tend to sour at a lower rate than rural commercial and business loans as demonstrated by the reserve bank chart below banks will also argue stress testing including of their housing lending shows they could survive a serious economic shock including chunky rises in unemployment and home loan default rates but the problem as those working in and around the dairy sector will discover is this comes at a wider cost forced asset sales and reduced lending to those who really need it are just two likely side effects the risk weighted ratio system can make it hard for entrepreneurs to borrow especially in tough times when entrepreneurship is especially needed because they re deemed to be risky yet it supports a housing bubble because residential mortgages secured by houses are deemed safe the key point from a financial stability perspective is if things get ugly in the housing market the impact on the entire financial system and new zealanders wealth is much greater than if rural commercial property or business loans sour significantly based on previous comments from the reserve bank the regulator appears unlikely to significantly raise risk weights on housing loans here s reserve bank deputy governor grant spencer from 2013 risk weights play an important part in the reserve bank s supervision of the banking sector they help to determine the amount of capital that the banks need to set aside to cover losses on their lending to different sectors in essence the riskier the sector the more capital must be held against lending to that sector the risk weights factor in things like the borrower s capacity to repay the money the type of assets put up as security for the loan and the amount of security relative to the size of the loan history provides some insight into the importance of these various factors as a result of these risk factors risk weights vary for different types of lending with housing having a lower risk weighting than business or rural lending which typically involve more risk the risk weights are not set in order to incentivise any particular lending type over another instead they reflect the different risks inherent in different types of lending leading to capital holdings against loans that are appropriate for the risks involved this tends to result in higher lending margins on riskier loans but does not imply that banks will always lend to housing ahead of other sectors in principle banks will set loan margins such that risk adjusted returns will be similar across sectors thus the reserve bank views mortgage lending as less risky than business and rural lending and doesn t see itself having a role in promoting economic and social objectives such as increasing lending to the productive sector and away from property speculation as outlined by thorburn above lvr move derisking mortgage books to be fair to the reserve bank it did take a step towards derisking home lending in 2013 this came through limiting banks to doing no more than 10 of their new mortgage lending to borrowers without equity in their property or a deposit equivalent to at least 20 of the purchase price the so called loan to value ratio lvr restrictions in last november s financial stability report the reserve bank noted the share of bank mortgage debt with an lvr of more than 80 has fallen to 14 from 21 increasing the resilience of bank mortgage portfolios we ve now also seen the reserve bank introduce a rule that auckland residential property investors seeking a mortgage require a 30 deposit whilst outside auckland banks can now do up to 15 of their new mortgage lending to borrowers with lvrs exceeding 80 regardless of whether the borrowers are owner occupiers or residential property investors as a result house prices have started rising in regions outside auckland give us a leverage ratio the reserve bank has steadfastly refused to introduce the leverage ratio which is part of the basel committee on banking supervision s post gfc international banking reforms this ratio weighs all assets equally and serves as a backstop potentially helping prevent banks from lending too much money into safe and therefore unproductive assets such as housing the australian government s recent financial system inquiry fsi recommended the introduction of the leverage ratio which is defined as tier 1 capital as a percentage of total assets and off balance sheet exposures with an initial minimum of 3 the fsi report said the risk weighted approach to capital requirements should be supplemented with a leverage ratio that protects against potential weaknesses in the risk weighting system the major australian banks currently have a leverage ratio of around 4 4½ per cent based on the ratio of tier 1 capital to exposures including off balance sheet an overall asset value shock of this size which was within the range of shocks experienced overseas during the gfc would be sufficient to render australia s major banks insolvent in the absence of further capital raising the fsi said a highly leveraged institution has smaller buffers available to absorb loss before insolvency leverage can also amplify the effect of shocks on an institution s balance sheet this may spread shocks to other institutions and cause systemic risks a number of countries have introduced leverage ratios including the united states the united kingdom and canada australia does not currently have a minimum leverage ratio requirement although apra has indicated that it may introduce one in line with the basel framework specifically the fsi recommended the introduction of a leverage ratio that acts as a backstop to authorised deposit taking institutions risk weighted capital positions this has been endorsed by the government with the australian prudential regulation authority instructed to implement the recommendation here however the reserve bank has said it won t introduce the leverage ratio because the one size fits all aspect of it is poorly targeted and can give a misleading picture of risk in some situations the leverage ratio would undermine the value of the existing risk based approach to the calculation of required capital which if properly applied renders a leverage ratio unnecessary the reserve bank has said but david mayes professor of banking and financial institutions at the university of auckland and a former chief manager and chief economist at the reserve bank last year urged his former employer to introduce the leverage ratio saying risk weighted capital ratios tend not to be very good limiters of problems most banks which get into serious difficulties are meeting the requirements for risk weighted capital but it s much more difficult to finesse the leverage ratio requirements another tool in the toolbox there s also another tool in the reserve bank s macro prudential toolbox alongside the lvr restrictions that could be implemented to force banks to hold more capital against home loans formally this tool s called adjustments to sectoral capital requirements which is an additional capital impost that may be applied to a specific sector such as housing loans in which excessive private sector credit growth is judged to be leading to a build up of system wide risk surely there s a strong argument based on the evidence outlined above that this build up in system wide risk stemming from housing loans is as clear as day right now so what are the reserve bank and government waiting for because if things went pear shaped in banks residential mortgage

welcome to this week s market wrap podcast i m mike gleason coming up chris martenson of peakprosperity com and famous author of the crash crouse and his latest book prosper joins me to dissect what s behind the yellow vest movement in france and why the mainstream media and those in power simply don t want you to know what s really going on there chris also tells us which precious metal he most favors right now don t miss another wonderful interview with the great chris martenson coming up after this week s market update in a recent speech federal reserve chairman jerome powell told some real whoppers we ll address his misrepresentations head on in just a bit but first let s review this week s market action despite drama in washington over averting a government shutdown and prompting president donald trump to declare a national emergency on the border nothing too dramatic is happening in the gold market prices are trading in a tight range coming in essentially unchanged from last friday s close gold currently trades at 1 316 per ounce turning to the white metals silver is posting a 1 3 decline on the week to trade at 15 66 an ounce platinum is off 1 0 to check in at 797 and finally palladium pushed up to a new record high close on thursday and is continuing higher this morning posting a weekly gain so far of 1 8 to trade at 1 436 per ounce as of this friday morning recording mining industry analysts know that palladium is in a chronic supply deficit that could last for years the world s biggest supplier of palladium is south africa that country is also a major producer of platinum and gold the south african mining industry has suffered a dramatic contraction over the past year statistics south africa reported on thursday that gold produced by south african mines has declined for 15 straight months in december gold output plummeted a whopping 31 from 2017 but mining companies aren t investing in new projects in south africa in part due to increasing hostility from the government the ruling african national congress has vowed to expropriate white owned farms without compensation a move that puts all property rights there in potential jeopardy militant marxist insurgents are vowing to seize businesses and vacation homes deteriorating infrastructure rolling power blackouts and labor disputes are also contributing to the shuttering of mines unless the south african government changes course from its socialist path and restores investor confidence the mining industry there will likely continue its decline elsewhere in the world the mining industry is struggling to find and develop economical new reserves global gold production could actually go into decline on a worldwide basis this year in other words we may have seen peak gold a peak in the total number of ounces pulled out of the ground by miners over the course of a year at least for the foreseeable future it appears the mining industry lacks the capacity to ramp up production in order to meet rising global demand one of the leading proponents of the peak gold thesis is ian telfer chairman of goldcorp now part of newmont mining telfer called for peak gold in 2018 and expects global gold output to go down from here if he s right it will be hugely bullish development for prices well now as promised we re going to expose some of the lies and deceptions of jerome powell here is the fed chairman in his own words speaking last week in front of a group of educators jerome powell if i could say one overarching thing that is really my job and all of our jobs here it is to try to earn and deserve the trust of the american people for our institution that we re here working on their behalf in a non political way to support the economy and use our tools to achieve maximum employment and stable prices that s really the essence of this job and that involves transparency it involves doing our job as best we can explaining ourselves clearly it s a world where surveys show that all over the world people are losing faith in large institutions so we re paddling against the current in trying to sustain public faith in the fed no doubt powell is genuinely concerned about maintaining public faith in the fed but he doesn t want the public to know the truth about the fed first of all the fed doesn t work on behalf of the public per se it works for the member banks that formally own it and that depend directly on it next contrary to powell s claims the fed is quite political it derives its legitimacy from an original act of congress federal reserve board policymakers are appointed through a political process then subjected to political pressure over their interest rate decisions powell can claim he isn t influenced by political pressure but he certainly aims to exert the fed s influence in our political system the fed actively lobbies congress to protect its special privileges and thwart legislation it opposes such as the federal reserve transparency act it s quite something to listen to powell claim the fed practices transparency when in reality it seeks to safeguard its secrecy powell talked about using his tools to achieve maximum employment and stable prices as if american workers have the fed s magic powers to thank for their jobs rather than job creators regarding stable prices powell has a strange definition of stable the u s dollar has lost close to 98 of its purchasing power since the federal reserve was established in 1913 moreover it is official fed policy to promote annual currency depreciation and prevent the dollar from maintaining a constant stable value finally when powell said part of the fed s job was explaining ourselves clearly well that was clearly untrue former fed chairman alan greenspan has admitted that fedspeak entails deliberate obfuscation fedspeak is meant to give the public the impression that fed officials have special knowledge and wisdom in reality they are just following the same economic indicators as everyone else and don t even have the ability to anticipate major turns in the economy chairman powell doesn t want you to know that well now without further delay let s get right to this week s exclusive interview mike gleason it is my privilege now to welcome in dr chris martenson of peakprosperity com and author of the book prosper how to prepare for the future and create a world worth inheriting chris is a commentator and a range of important topics such as global economics financial markets governmental policies precious metals and the importance of preparedness among other things and it s always great to have him on with us chris welcome back and thanks for joining us again chris martenson thank you it s a real pleasure to be back with you and all your listeners mike gleason well chris when we spoke last in early november we talked about the fed printing money and expanding credit to prevent markets from correcting the central planners there are always ready to intervene at the time equity markets were correcting and stock prices fell through the end of december officials must have then decided that enough was enough with all the selling because the fed has very publicly signaled a change in course and instead of more rate hikes and more selling from the hordes of bonds accumulated during qe the fed is putting the brakes on tightening and looking to return to stimulus now the equity markets are off to their best start in something like 30 years what do you make of the most recent intervention are they likely to get away with yet another round of bubble blowing here chris chris martenson well that s the hope and all the machines out there doing this front running and buying of equities it s not just the fed though we really have to look at the global situation so what was supposed to happen here we are we re february we re closing and march is now in view the european central bank was supposed to have begun unwinding its balance sheet at the beginning of 2019 oh quelle surprise it s actually at the highest level that it s ever been which it hit just yesterday china freaked out threw a trillion yuan a few hundred billion into the market very very suddenly when you add it all up the so called financial conditions index is as loose as it s ever been on a global front and that of course drives all of these asset prices which of course is what the fed was targeting and i know you noticed but i didn t hear it or maybe i missed hearing you say it but the most important thing the fed said was not that they were going to pause on these actually immaterial interest rate hikes which are not actually hikes because they don t actually withdraw money from the market to accomplish them but they also said that they stand ready to stop their unwinding of the balance sheet they ve telegraphed that far and wide and more importantly they said if necessary we ll do more expansion of the balance sheet we ll use that as a tool they wrap it up in gobbledygook but here s what they said gosh a little bit of weakness in stocks scared us a little bit so we ll do whatever you need wall street to make sure that stocks only go up and that of course is a perversion of all things freedom all things financial and economic that we ve spent many many centuries learning about we now live in the era of centrally planned markets and luckily for you and me the central banks are staffed with a very few people who happen to know the correct prices for all assets at all times he says with his tongue in cheek so they re on that mission they think they ve got it under control they pulled that rabbit out of the hat in 2016 can they do it again here in 2019 well if they do i think they ll win the battle lose the war and what i mean is the further they drive this the more ridiculous the imbalances get the more you see things like the yellow vests beginning to pop up it s just the level of gross injustice that s sort of implied and delivered to us via these central bank actions are second to none in history mike gleason internationally we have a very interesting situation playing out right now in venezuela the u s and others are attempting a power play and keeping nicolas maduro from getting his gold out of london first off why would any country in their right mind chris have another nation store their gold for them and relinquish control of it that is truly baffling to me i mean i understand the desire to have it in a place where there s more liquidity i get that but it just seems like such a big issue when it comes to national security comment on that specifically if you would and then also what do you make of the events there chris martenson well to start with the gold storage issue if you re a foreign country and you re keeping it with london or the u s good luck that s a really stupid thing to do the idea is that the central bank has access to more liquidity meaning that they can easily push it through either the london or the new york markets into a lease arrangement and put it out on the forward gold swap market now that gives you a little tiny extra bit of liquidity the reason i say it s dumb is that we already saw that london which is really a proxy for the u s has decided not to ship gold back to a variety of countries when they wanted it and it belongs to them it belongs to their central banks all of that so you re dumb to do that if you re a country because typically gold isn t that much of a percentage of the overall reserve asset ratio so if gold is supposed to be this hedge that gives you this stability especially during turbulent times why you would want to trade that value for a little bit of extra liquidity and i m talking like tiny amounts like quarter percent per year it s like ridiculously low amounts plus coupled with the fact that london and the u s might just decide at some point you know what nah we re not going to ship it back right germany discovered that when the u s federal reserve out of new york said oh we can only get you like five tons a year of your 300 tons that you want back which is a fraction of what they are actually holding here in the u s for germany allegedly i think it s just ridiculous i think that the failure of the bank of england to return venezuela s gold when requested is a warning shot that should go across the bow of every central bank and by the way they re all participating in this if you look at the amount of gold that any european nation thinks they have a lot of that is encumbered and i m using that word carefully by the fact it s being held in london meanwhile the united states thinks it s going to do another regime change it s promising us this time it s going to be fast and easy and the people are going to love it if you look at the situation in venezuela on the ground it s very split there s a lot of people who are sick to death of maduro s leadership i understand that there s an even larger number of people according to polls i ve seen who don t want any u s or other outside meddling in their country which is wise because if you look at the regime change that the united states has pulled off the united states is very clearly interested in the regime change itself but no interest in the rebuilding afterwards libya a complete mess after we took another arguable bad guy out gaddafi in syria we re attempting stuff there it s a mess iraq still a mess so all the places the united states has sort of come in with its blunder and might it makes things worse not better so i think it s wise for people to say listen this is our issue if we re going to get rid of this guy or any leadership at all that s up to us please stay out i respect that meanwhile i do know people who are from venezuela it s really awful down there and it s important to understand that that s at least in part they are tumbling down the stairs but at least one of the feet that was on the small of their back giving them a nudge was the u s with some pretty punishing financial and import sanctions that have been helping which adds to the misery down there so i look at all of that i ve got to be honest with you i m sick to death of the united states playing regime change agent across the world i think it doesn t win us any friends i don t think it s resulted in any measurably better outcomes in some cases i think it s cost us a lot of moral authority mike gleason yeah well said i completely agree it is somewhat encouraging that precious metals prices are holding up as well as they are the u s dollar has had quite a rally over the past two weeks and equity markets are on a tear we d have thought that that would be a lethal combination for gold and silver prices but so far at least the metals have held on to most of their recent gains now in our view precious metals futures markets and any price action there has to be treated with plenty of skepticism there aren t many markets which reflect reality and fundamentals comex gold and silver certainly don t fit that description but we would have expected the bullion banks to cash in on the short position they ve been building over the past few months any thoughts as to why that hasn t happened yet chris martenson well i think they ve been adding to it not cashing it in let s just look at silver in the week before silver breached it s 200 day moving average normally a pretty big event normally an opportunity to do some short covering if you re on the wrong side of that breach and so what we saw was open interest go from a 178 000 contracts to just most recently last number i saw 215 000 contracts so the open paper silver interest rose by 20 the minute silver breached its 200 day it s been fairly successfully capped at or below that level ever since so somebody thought it was worth their while to go ahead and throw an extra 20 of total outstanding volume into that i mean can you imagine like a major corporation doing a big turnaround suddenly they re really on the up and up and somebody who could out of just thin air produce 20 more shares of that company and just introduced them into the market and say nah we re good we ll take this and of course that works because those large bullion banks are on the other side of that trade they don t lose money doing it they re very successful they are the market they own it i m not sure why anybody looks at those markets and says those represent the actual value or price of those things because the price is wholly manipulated but got to be honest we have a lot of manipulated markets now so it s really hard to know what s up what s down that s one of the greatest sins of the central banks was destroying price discovery and then of course the failure of the regulators in the cftc in the sec to police effectively any of these markets to have these price manipulating moments happen so much now that everybody just expects them and they become almost self fulfilling because of that and by the way price manipulation to me goes both ways sometimes we see people manipulate the price up really suddenly down really suddenly clearly trades are being conducted in thin market hours in swamping amounts they are not about discovering the correct price they re about moving the price that s price manipulation in the united states the regulators could not possibly be less interested in that story and i don t buy the angle that they re just outgunned and maybe they lack the talent i think they re fundamentally uninterested in that but of course who didn t know the fix was in when ben bernanke chairman of the federal reserve went and joined citadel one of the largest companies involved in these shenanigans mike gleason switching gears here a little bit we ve talked about complacency that people have in these markets and i wanted to revisit that topic with you again over the past few years things have seemingly been very strong economically and most americans apparently feel good about the state of things and aren t too interested in planning for the next collapse which we would both agree is not a matter of if but when the lack of concern that folks have for what might be coming may be the single greatest asset that these central planners have in keeping the wheels on talk about the dangers of apathy chris because people really ought to be taking the time to prepare themselves whether it s financially personally what have you i ve heard you talk about this before but share with us your thoughts on this if you would because i just feel like this is so so important chris martenson well absolutely i d love to because it is important and part of the issue that s going on right now is that the way you might get your information that it s time to not be apathetic that it s time to maybe think about things differently or to have concerns about things is through the news is through the information flow that you might get and news by the way put air quotes around that that might be something that gets re posted to your timeline by friends it might be something that you re seeing on a larger scrolling twitter feed that you have it might be what comes across either the airwaves or the newspapers traditional sources like that well what we re seeing are just absolutely fantastic sins of omission and commission by all of these social media giants and their associated corporate news masters so for instance quick example each saturday there are these yellow vest protests in france which are not about climate change or diesel taxes that may have been the last straw but honestly there was this huge bonfire tinder pile that was built looking for a spark and in that it was just the grotesquely unfair treatment that the people of france have been suffering under with the amount of taxation they ve been getting the fact that they re squeezing pensioners while giving enormous tax breaks to corporate owners the rich are getting richer and they just basically same as in the united states same as in lots of europe you find that the wealthy have coopted the system for their own benefit not a surprising story happens all the time but when the people start protesting that it s been fascinating to watch the response of that same corporate media structure and so it happens every saturday there s on the twelfth now and so sunday morning i troll all around i look at all the online news sources so le monde in france i m looking at the bbc wall street journal new york times i m checking everywhere looking at my twitter feeds i ve got to tell you you can t find stories about the yellow vest protests the next day in the mainstream media except when they really downplay it so for this last one they said oh there was a few thousand i was personally looking at live streams shot by people there where i was easily seeing 10s 20s 50 thousand in a single pop there s lots of violence being committed by the police where they are specifically aiming at the heads of people with these so called rubber bullets looking for head shots and having great success doing lots of damage to people thousands of injuries thousands of arrests and zero stories anywhere but in the uk this would be instructive i ve heard that they have a d notice placed on their media and a d notice comes out of security firms and it s a governmental regulation that passes through that says this is important to the state that this news be suppressed in some way and so they ve got a d notice on the yellow vests you can t find any yellow vest protest stories at all in the bbc press or in the uk press except when they talk about how this is great daily mail last sunday came out with a story that said six out of eight yellow vest protestors believe that princess diana was murdered so they re calling them conspiracy theorists nice touch there today there was a nice op piece in a french outlet that said that the yellow vests are tightly aligned with a rise in anti semitism in france so great now they ve tied them to the anti semitism and we re waiting for them to tie them to puppy beating and tearing the wings off of live insects you know it s hysterical how much the corporate media hates the idea of people rising up and saying hey this all feels a little unfair we would like to have a seat at the table we don t have any avenues left to us besides getting out in the street and disrupting things so that s starting to rise up and we re seeing that in italy where italy has clearly come forward with some very populous leaders who are really sticking a sharp stick in the eye of the ecb very interesting news coming out about how that movement over there wants control again of the gold of the nation for the people fascinating story there so this trend though of seeing that people are actually not apathetic but when they aren t apathetic and they turn out in the tens if not hundreds of thousands to protest the media won t tell you about it and when they do tell you about it they paint it in very dark light it s a conspiracy it s anti semitism it s whatever they need to do to sort of put a lid on that and it s pretty clear what the uk is afraid of they re afraid of that movement spreading why would it spread to the uk because they have a deeply unfair system over there that s been looting the population and giving it to a few kleptocrats and that creates a lot of fuel on those bonfires so they don t want it to be reported on so this idea of apathy is really important i would advise people listening to this to understand that if you are just getting your news or primarily getting your news off of what you see and hear that s about what s presented to you it s flawed deeply deeply flawed on a secondary front i would say that people need to be aware that these changes that i ve been talking about for a long time are really bearing down on us very very rapidly at this point in time there s going to be some extraordinary changes coming and when all of this self delusion breaks when the money printing doesn t work when simply making stocks go up and telling everybody everything s awesome when they aren t when those stores shred they tend to break very rapidly they tend to break a little bit like the yellow vest that s why i bring that movement up because it came out of nowhere but really it didn t it s like the soviet union didn t just sort of crumble out of nowhere like these things build up and if you know what to look for you can say yeah that s coming we know it s coming we know there s a recession coming we know that this credit bubble is going to burst we know it s going to be painful we know that all the insects disappearing is a very bad sign there s all these signs coming forward and my most recent piece i wrote i asked the question directly how many signs do you need for you to say oh my gosh i ve got to get off my butt and start taking care of things for myself because nobody else is going to do it and by the time it s reported on it s kind of too late you know to really do much about it at that point so think for yourself gather your own news don t even trust me or anybody else think for yourself really burrow in but don t wait for it to be presented to you it s too late then you ve got to go find it you ve got to go look for it and make up your own mind mike gleason yeah very well stated got to take advantage of the opportunity that we have right now to get prepared for what may happen a lot of things are sort of simmering beneath the surface especially here in the states well getting back to metals and as we kind of begin to wrap up here we ve certainly seen palladium perform as a total outlier and it keeps going up and up and it s reached 1 400 an ounce this week now eventually you would have to think the rally is going to come to an end meanwhile its sister metal platinum can t seem to get much going to the upside and continues to struggle around the 800 mark and then gold and silver continue to be stuck in range trades for the most part so where do you see the best value in the precious metals space here chris talk about that as we begin to wrap up chris martenson well still i love silver a lot for a pure play silver mine it s at or below the all in cost production for most producers right now as a supplementary metal that comes out of the ground as part of the base metal mining that s most of its volume in terms of brand new mine production there i m expecting to see some drop offs as we go forward in overall output meanwhile its price is just ridiculously cheap compared to its overall value so it s a commodity that i really like silver s my play of course in my belief that there will be an industrial future and things will carry on after a big hiccup gold is something that everybody has to have just because everything we ve been talking about in terms of where the economy s going money printing yada yada that s talking about monetary mayhem that may be coming forward gold is still the only monetary asset i know about that can play in the overall global sphere that s not simultaneously somebody else s liability asterisk on that meaning as long as you didn t store it at the bank of england exchanges right because there it is somebody else s liability so if you have gold in your hot little hands it s a monetary asset it s exactly the thing you want when not if but when this next financial monetary accident really begins to get rolling again so i really like the precious metals here but i m a big fan of all kinds of things that are real tangible assets that includes at this point land real estate other things like that simply because if you don t hold real assets when the wealth transfer comes you ll be holding a bunch of paper claims there ll be some chuckling from wall street they ll say sorry for your losses would you care to play again and it ll just be a wash rinse repeat sort of a thing bubbles burst people get hurt except those who are not participating in a bubble when it finally lets go mike gleason well we ll leave it there for now thanks very much for your time and your insights chris keep up the good work there and thanks for coming back on with us and finally before we sign off here please tell our

the good news at the start of 2019 is that the risk of an outright global recession is low the bad news is that we are heading into a year of synchronized global deceleration growth will fall toward and in some cases below potential in most regions since the global synchronized growth of 2017 economic conditions have been gradually weakening and will produce an across the board deceleration in the months ahead beyond that the prospect for markets and national economies will depend on a broad range of factors some of which do not bode well after the synchronized global economic expansion of 2017 came the asynchronous growth of 2018 when most countries other than the united states started to experience slowdowns worries about us inflation the us federal reserve s policy trajectory ongoing trade wars italian budget and debt woes china s slowdown and emerging market fragilities led to a sharp fall in global equity markets toward the end of the year the good news at the start of 2019 is that the risk of an outright global recession is low the bad news is that we are heading into a year of synchronized global deceleration growth will fall toward and in some cases below potential in most regions sixth equity markets in the us and elsewhere are still overvalued even after the recent correction as wage costs rise weaker us earnings and profit margins in the coming months could be an unwelcome surprise with highly indebted firms facing the possibility of rising short and long term borrowing costs and with many tech stocks in need of further corrections the danger of another risk off episode and market correction can t be ruled out seventh oil prices may be driven down by a coming supply glut owing to shale production in the us a potential regime change in venezuela leading to expectations of greater production over time and failures by opec countries to cooperate with one another to constrain output while low oil prices are good for consumers they tend to weaken us stocks and markets in oil exporting economies raising concerns about corporate defaults in the energy and related sectors as happened in early 2016 finally the outlook for many emerging market economies will depend on the aforementioned global uncertainties the chief risks include slowdowns in the us or china higher us inflation and a subsequent tightening by the fed trade wars a stronger dollar and falling oil and commodity prices though there is a cloud over the global economy the silver lining is that it has made the major central banks more dovish starting with the fed and the people s bank of china and quickly followed by the european central bank the bank of england the bank of japan and others still the fact that most central banks are in a highly accommodative position means that there is little room for additional monetary easing and even if fiscal policy wasn t constrained in most regions of the world stimulus tends to come only after a growth stall is already underway and usually with a significant lag
feb 15 2019 alasdair macleod gold and silver had another week of consolidation with gold up 3 00 at 1317 50 from last friday s close in morning european trade silver however lost 12 cents to stand at 15 70 this week s headline chart has been rebased to end june to better illustrate gold s established trend since mid november after gold had found a base following its dramatic sell off in september the trend is shown by the arrowed line which has now made five touch points more accurately shown at intraday lows than the closing values in the chart silver s disappointing performance is a reflection of the growing monetary uncertainly that benefits gold gold is the precious metal to watch given the global economic slowdown and the easier monetary policies that are emerging so far comex volumes have been subdued confirming an absence of the speculative buying that usually accompanies an overvalued market this is good news for the gold price reflected in the chart covering the last four years shown below everything appears to be in place for a tilt at the old highs above 1350 there is the bullish golden cross the holding of support at 1300 subdued comex volumes and the well defined short term uptrend shown in our headline chart the larger picture shows a bull market which commenced in december 2015 followed by a two year consolidation all that s needed is a final confirmation of a break out above 1350 there appears to be sufficient momentum for this to happen the dollar s trade weighted index is being buoyed up by the weakness of its major component the euro the twi has had a classic rally towards a test of the trendline broken on 1 january it will now need to maintain the 95 level if further falls towards 88 are to be avoided this is eminently possible given the worse than expected slump that s emerging in the eurozone in the last two months of 2018 italy s output fell by 5 5 and spain s by 6 7 ireland recorded a slump of 19 8 blamed by incredulous analysts on partly defective data germany s industrial production fell by 1 7 eurozone motor manufacturers face the added prospect of 25 tariffs exports to the usa a possibility heightened yesterday in a us commerce department report due to be released this weekend which will state that car imports threaten national security therefore the euro is in deep trouble from both prospective trade tariffs and brexit the eurozone is not alone with the world s production growth shuddering to a halt it means lower interest rates and more monetary inflation and perhaps it is this that might drive gold out of its consolidation phase in the next leg of a significant bull market priced in sterling and euros in particular gold is doing what it should by reflecting the relative weakness of these currencies this is shown in the last chart since the december 2015 low the sterling price of gold is up 45 in euros up 20 yen up 12 7 and in the dollar up 25 the views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author s and do not reflect those of goldmoney unless expressly stated the article is for general information purposes only and does not constitute either goldmoney or the author s providing you with legal financial tax investment or accounting advice you should not act or rely on any information contained in the article without first seeking independent professional advice care has been taken to ensure that the information in the article is reliable however goldmoney does not represent that it is accurate complete up to date and or to be taken as an indication of future results and it should not be relied upon as such goldmoney will not be held responsible for any claim loss damage or inconvenience caused as a result of any information or opinion contained in this article and any action taken as a result of the opinions and information contained in this article is at your own risk

call start 13 00 january 1 0000 1 26 pm et acadian timber corp otcpk acazf q4 2018 earnings conference call february 14 2019 13 00 et company participants mabel wong cfo mark bishop president ceo conference call participants paul quinn rbc capital markets hamir patel cibc capital markets operator good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to acadian timber corporations q4 2018 conference call and webcast at this time all participants are in a listen only mode later we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will follow at that time as a reminder this conference is being recorded i would like to introduce chief financial officer mabel wong you may begin mabel wong thank you operator and good afternoon everyone welcome to acadian s fourth quarter conference call before we get started i would like to remind everyone that in discussing our 2018 financial and operating performance our outlook for 2019 and responding to questions we may make forward looking statements these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and future results may differ materially for further information on unknown risk factors i encourage you to review acadian s annual information form dated march 28 2018 and other filings of acadian which are available on sedar at sedar com and on our website i ll begin with some comments on our financial results for the year ended december 31 2018 then our president and ceo mark bishop will add some further remarks on our business operations market conditions and our outlook for the new year overall acadian performed well operationally which led to solid results for the 2018 year during the period acadian generated adjusted ebitda of 22 1 million which compared to 23 3 million during 2017 the strong demand and pricing acadian experienced in the first half of 2018 reflecting the favorable dynamics of the northeast regional log markets carried through the second half of the year as a result log sales from our freehold operations were strong throughout the year with volumes and pricing up over 2017 however these benefits were offset by lower ancillary revenues from providing timber services and lower gain on land sales relative to the prior year our net income for 2018 was 26 3 million compared to 30 8 million in the prior year the variance from the prior year is largely explained by an unrealized foreign exchange loss on the u s dollar denominated long term debt in 2018 compared to the prior year which was an unrealized gain position the impact of this was partially offset by favorable fair value evaluation of timber assets at the end of the year acadian s payout ratio was 106 during the year which is above our long term target of 95 we anticipate that over the long term we will revert to a payout ratio consistent with our target level however in the near to medium term acadian strong cash position supports a payout ratio at these levels net sales for the year were 99 8 million this represents a year over year increase of 4 4 million and acadian benefited from strong demand and favorable operating conditions and these resulted in a 3 increase in log sales volumes and a 2 increase in the average log selling price for the company acadian also benefited from a meaningful improvement in biomass revenues due to strong export markets in the year meanwhile contributions from timber services decreased due to the timing of harvest activities which we expect will be made up for in the first part of 2018 additionally acadian sold fewer and lower value properties in maine in 2018 resulting in a lower level of disposition gain as a result adjusted ebitda margin for 2018 was 22 compared to 24 in the prior year moving on to the results for each of our new brunswick and maine operations net sales for our new brunswick timber lands during 2018 was 74 8 million compared to 71 7 million in 2017 the increase reflects a 4 improvement in log sale volumes due to strong demand and favorable harvest conditions as i previously mentioned the weighted average log selling price of 66 per cubic meter was in line with the prior year while pricing for all products increased compared to the prior year this benefit was largely offset by a higher relative sales volumes of lower valued softwood pulpwood contributions from timber services decreased 81 due to timing of harvest activities and as i mentioned we expect this to recover in the first part of 2019 and this was partially offset by a benefit of a 76 increase in contributions from biomass products as a result of these factors as well as higher variable log harvest cost per cubic meter new brunswick adjusted ebitda was 16 6 million in 2018 compared to 18 1 million in the prior year while adjusted ebitda margin 22 for 2018 compared 25 in 2017 moving on to our maine timber lands net sales during the year totaled 25 1 million compared to 23 7 million during the prior year the current year results reflect a 6 increase in the weighted average log selling price due to strong log demand compared to the prior year this benefit was partially offset by a 1 decrease in log sale volume as harvest activities for hardwood were adjusted to reflect our commitment to manage maine timber lands annual harvest volumes to sustainable level the weighted average log selling price during 2018 in canadian dollar terms was 81 per cubic meter and increased from 76 per cubic meter during the prior year or an improvement of 6 in u s dollar terms this improvement reflects the continued strong demand for softwood saw logs and hardwood pulpwood although net sales were higher end variable log harvest costs were down year over year this was offset by lower sales of higher and better use lands compared to the prior year as a result maine s adjusted ebitda during 2018 with 6 8 million in line with 2017 and adjusted ebitda margin was 27 marginally larger than the prior year and then lastly a few comments on our overall balance sheet and financial position acadian ended the year with a healthy cash balance of approximately 22 million acadian has ample cash resources which is further supported by funds available under our revolving credit facility and a standby equity commitment from brookfield overall making up a net liquidity position of 102 million during the quarter we declared a dividend of 0 29 per share which is 3 higher than the prior quarter and 5 higher than the prior year quarter that concludes my remarks on this year s financial results and i ll now turn the call over to mark mark bishop thanks mabel and good morning during the quarter acadian s operations had one recordable safety incident among employees and one among contractors while the incidents resulted in lost time the injuries were relatively minor in nature acadian takes safety in the workplace very seriously and we strive for continuous improvement in our employee and contractor safety performance acadian s operations benefited from strong demand and favorable operating conditions throughout the year resulting in log sales volumes of 1 07 million cubic meters representing a 3 increase from 2017 log sales volumes in new brunswick increased 4 year over year with continued strong markets for all its products notably new brunswick s fourth quarter log sales volumes increased 20 compared to the prior year period this increase was driven by timing of harvest activities as new brunswick benefited from favorable harvests and market conditions particular for softwood and hardwood pulpwood during the quarter however softwood sales were impacted by an inventory management program with one of the operations customers that has been in place from time to time historically but was not in place during the fourth quarter of 2017 in addition timber services and other sales were impacted by the timing of harvest activity which as mabel noted we expect to recover in the first part of 2019 maine s operations benefited from improved regional saw log markets which had been impacted in the prior year by high customer inventories and limited markets for some sawmill residuals as we have discussed on previous conference calls maine s prior year hardwood harvest volumes were higher than the average long run sustainable yield target as a result maine reduced its hardwood volumes during 2019 despite strong market conditions notably for the fourth quarter of 2018 log sales volumes declined 29 compared to the prior year period almost entirely driven by the reduction in hardwood sales volumes as we ve noted in past calls maine s forest management plan and sustainable forestry initiative certification provide sufficient flexibility to respond to market conditions and maximize cash flows over an economic cycle as mabel mentioned selling prices for our products continue to be solid as the weighted average log selling price per cubic meter increased 2 driven by strong softwood sawlog and pulpwood markets partially offset by changes in sales mix in new brunswick the weighted average log selling price remain in line with the prior year as a 4 increase in softwood sawlog prices and a 2 increase in hardwood pulpwood prices was offset by higher relative sales on the lower valued softwood pulpwood the weighted average log selling price at maine increased by 6 relative to the prior year benefiting from a 9 increase in softwood sawlog pricing and a 6 increase in hardwood pulpwood pricing partially offset by higher relative sales again of lower value softwood pulpwood acadian s key markets include softwood saw timber hardwood saw timber and hardwood pulpwood northeast north american softwood dimension sawmills represent over one third of acadian s end use markets that are the primary market for our softwood saw timber the case for continued recovery in the u s housing starts over the medium term remains highly compelling demographics support continued solid growth and household formation home inventories are extremely low and on average u s housing stock is beyond its prime however tight construction labor markets and restrictive building regulations have combined with near term concerns of rising interest rates and the fall off from u s international trade policy to drive what most forecasters believe will be a relatively short lived slowdown in construction activity recent consensus forecast anticipate average year over year growth in u s housing starts for 2019 and 2020 of about 1 and 3 respectively importantly though most forecasters expect the proportion of single family starts the largest lumber consuming segment of u s housing starts to improve modestly through 2019 and 2020 additionally home repair and remodeling the single largest driver of north american lumber consumption is also projected to grow modestly over the next two years therefore north american saw timber demand is expected to post modest year over year growth even under more conservative housing start forecasts average fourth quarter benchmark eastern spruce pine fir and southern yellow pine lumber prices declined 30 and 11 respectively from the prior quarter the continued slide in pricing from the prior quarter was driven by weaker than expected home sales and building activity through the quarter despite the strong u s economy buyer apprehension remains high due to do risk of federal reserve interest rate increase and potential for slowing global economic growth forecasters anticipate that extensive market downtime which has been extended into the first quarter of 2019 principally in the high cost log region of interior british columbia coupled with ongoing steady demand growth will support continued strong lumber pricing through 2019 albeit below levels achieved in 2018 the almost 30 recovery in lumber prices year to date in 2019 is encouraging but certainly not a surprise considering capacity and log supply constraints exhibited in western canada during late 2018 early 2019 we anticipate continued attractive market dynamics to support stable softwood saw timber pricing in acadian s regional markets given the current state of u s trade relations there is no expectation of any meaningful discussions toward a softwood lumber agreement with canada during 2019 further we anticipate no material change in 2019 to the current duty rates for canadian lumber producers average consensus forecast lumber prices for 2019 would still indicate that a significant proportion of those duties will continue to be passed on to u s consumers we remain steadfast in our view than an eventual negotiated settlement will include an exemption for all canadian maritime producers including those in new brunswick hardwood saw timber markets typically oriented to millwork and higher values specialty markets remain well balanced with continued positive outlook for the foreseeable future while there s been modest price erosion in the latest quarter the outlook for global pulp markets remains positive particularly in the containerboard and tissue end use segments hardwood pulpwood demand in acadian s operating region remain stable with well balanced supply conditions continuing to support historically very strong pricing softwood pulpwood market is acadian s smallest product segment by volume and margin have seen some modest recovery and the recently announced restart of a pulp mill in maine during mid 2019 is expected to be catalyst for further recovery and softwood pulpwood demand and pricing through the second half of 2019 in new brunswick biomass markets continue to be supported by export demand which is expected to remain strong throughout 2019 while the biomass market in maine remains weak efforts to tap into biomass export markets from maine continue to progress as always acadian management remains vigilant in pursuing cost efficiencies across the business during 2018 the company completed a full review and integration of several activities performed by its maine and new brunswick operating divisions resulting in ongoing administrative and operating efficiencies particularly across our accounting cash management and marketing activities marsha mccaig vice president of our maine operations since acadian s inception retired at the end of 2018 on behalf of the entire management team i d like to thank marsha for her passionate dedication and significant contributions to acadian and certainly for her support during the integration process acadian was active under our normal course issuer bid during the final quarter of 2018 repurchasing 42 800 shares at an average price of 14 86 we will continue to seek opportunities to continue our activity at the appropriate share valuation so to wrap up i ll highlight that the combination of our strong operating team and encouraging outlook for all our key markets coupled with our surplus cash balance supports our view that acadian is well positioned to meet its quarterly distributable cash commitments on behalf of the board and management of acadian i d like to thank all our shareholders for the ongoing support that concludes our formal remarks and we re available to take any questions from participants operator question and answer session operator our first question comes from paul quinn with rbc capital markets paul quinn thanks so much morning mark and mabel it seems you ve got a fair amount of confidence in raising the dividend up 3 maybe you can go through some of the factors because your results are down mark bishop thanks paul i think from our comments and the press release i think you can understand that the key factors of our performance in the year and my comments in particular for the fourth quarter we had some timing issues with the inventory management program which will carry over into 2019 additionally our hbu sales in 2017 were very very strong 2018 i would say is more of a normalized indication of what we expect to do going forward so those obviously were two of the key drivers for the difference year over year but listen as you know unlike much of the western canadian industry the eastern canadian industry saw no reason to take downtime continued very strong demand and well balanced markets right now our customerâ s log yards our sawmill log yards are very very low seasonally very very low on log inventory and we saw virtually no price erosion during that third to fourth quarter period of time where obviously we saw significant pressure on lumber prices so to us the outlook continues to be very strong and clearly unless you believe housing starts will drop significantly over the next couple of years and the fundamentals don t seem to point to that we think we continue to expect a strong market and a good support for continued modest increase in log pricing over time when you think about the dynamic that s been going on in maine looking back two years we d had several shuts and very very weak softwood pulpwood demand and questions about some of our hardwood pulpwood demand and we ve seen a significant turnaround in both those segments and we see some solid progress on softwood pulpwood demand in the second half of 2019 so when we couple what we consider to be a very strong outlook with the fact that we ve got a significant surplus cash balance that will contribute to being able to pay that to additional dividend over time while we wait and see what the market does that s really what gives us confidence and continue to support another dividend increase paul quinn great answer maybe you could help me out with just understanding because you re closer to saw timbers customers back east but what s the sense of their financial conditions right now are they making money right now did they make money through low lumber prices how competitive are they mark bishop that s a good question paul certainly they were under pressure during the fourth quarter i mean everybody in north america who produces lumber certainly had a very very tough quarter but we certainly didn t see we don t have the same log cost differential that the bc producers have nor do we have the pressure in on log supply that the bc interior has so yes it was a tough quarter but we didn t see any downtime taken and many of our customers have continued in some cases modest but capital programs to modernize their capacity so i can t suggest sort of an average conversion costs for east versus west because they re all over the map but while it was a tough quarter we saw a no downtime and continuing optimism in our customer base paul quinn great and then just lastly just on this payout ratio i guess your goal to get down to that 95 i guess there s two ways to get it one is to increase the earnings the other one is to drop the dividend i guess you don t want to do the latter so in terms of the levers on increasing the earnings i mean there s volume price and cost maybe you could give us an idea as to do you have anything on sort of a long term basis in the volume lift from current harvest levels i guess we ll just leave pricing where it is but any expectation that your costs will come down over time mark bishop as i noted we are always looking for opportunities to reduce cost and in this past year the primary focus was g a and i think we did well there and you should see somewhere in the range of 0 5 million to 0 75 million g a costs at a run rate taken out at the operating level but we should see some relief in fuel costs this year over last year as well but structurally i wouldn t say if we re going to see significant cost taken out and i think as you know our aif suggest that we ve got some changes in our wood flows coming forward and we have some mix changes as well that will be basically heavier to softwood so our perspective is that we are going to continue to see some strength in pricing and we ll see how that progresses over time and in the meantime as we ve noted we ve got the cash drawdown i mean clearly we ve been active under our normal course but given our liquidity we can t deploy an awful lot of that cash and we ve continued to look at modest tuck in opportunities in maine and new brunswick but nothing has really come to surface so that cash for the foreseeable future is going to be used to support that dividend if we need it operator and our next question comes from hamir patel with cibc capital markets please proceed hamir patel mark you referenced the inventory management program how much did that how much of that was a drag on ebitda in the quarter and do you get all of that back in q1 mark bishop we do think we ll get it all back in q1 hamir mabel i think our view is it s about 600 000 mabel wong that s right yes about 600 000 ebitda hamir patel okay great that s helpful and mark i m just wondering if you could share your thoughts on what you ve seen on the m a environment out there if there s any markets that are looking particularly attractive and anything you can disclose on how active you might ve been on opportunities that came up in the past quarter mark bishop good question hamir the 2018 and 2019 so far other than a large u s southern transaction there s been lots of very very small transactions both in the pacific northwest and u s south but there s not been very many of scale outside of one large one in the u s south and 2019 started off the year very slowly so i think many of the many of the tmos are really searching for opportunities and try to understand where that next one is going to come from and i think you re seeing a little bit of activity or interests moving back offshore from the u s as a result i can t specifically talk about what we were active in during the quarter i will mention that we were active in a small tuck in within our region but it went for obviously a value that we couldn t approach and there has not been as many opportunities across the north american timberland landscape if you will of scale or of interest at least to us over the past 12 months hamir patel mark do you have a sense as to for some of the recent transactions what discount rates were being underwritten for properties in the south and the u s pacific northwest mark bishop i don t think we ve seen much of a change in discount rates and certainly not considering interest rate hikes in the u s and we certainly haven t seen discount rates start to reflect that so we would still be somewhere in the range my view is in the 4 5 to 5 real range and that has to be coupled with or take that with a bit of a grain of salt because when we do our underwriting we obviously have our own view of productivity inventory and obviously pricing but so we worked backwards from our understanding of a transaction to sort of calculate an applied a discount rate but we re certainly still seeing transactions occur below 5 hamir patel interesting that s all i had thanks mark and mabel operator thank you at this time i m showing no questions in queue i d like to turn the call back over to mark bishop for closing remarks mark bishop well again i d just like to thank you all for participating in the call i know it s always a busy time of the year and we look forward to talking to you at the end of our next quarter have a great day operator ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation in today s conference this concludes the program you may now disconnect everyone have a great day
bettylou decroce new jersey routinely places at or near the bottom in almost every economic analysis of states in america it s one of the worst places in the country to do business it has among the highest business and personal taxes it s overregulated it s electric utility rates are high and it has one the highest debt loads in the country and its high property taxes make home ownership unaffordable for the middle class instead of addressing crucial structural issues with the state s economy like lowering corporate and property taxes the leadership in this state has determined that it s more important to boost the minimum wage to 15 raise taxes on job producing people legalize marijuana and lay down a welcome mat for illegal immigrants at taxpayers expense the murphy administration tried to lure amazon to newark with an outrageous 7 billion incentive amazon thumbed its nose at new jersey s enticement and decided to spend its money in two other places which combined offered billions less than new jersey that says a lot about the state s economic reputation our wall street governor insists he is pursuing well paying high tech jobs but he gleefully settles for low paying low skill jobs while other states are getting amazon s six figure jobs new jersey gets amazon s warehouse jobs such as the one opening in edison which is staffed by 50 robots and many disgruntled human workers currently making less than 15 an hour yet the governor applauds that as an economic success while the governor pursues his progressive fairness economy his tax policies are destroying the opportunity to unlock new jersey s potential to attract investments that create jobs that support middle class families nj property taxes will new poll finally get murphy s attention editorial nj property taxes have doubled in 20 years see how much they ve gone up in your town nj needs urge to merge to cut property taxes gopal according to a recent report the average salary in new jersey 57 000 is not enough to afford the average rent of 2 062 a 15 minimum wage will not help state property taxes now average 8 700 a year new jersey has the sixth highest personal income tax rate in the nation 8 97 percent and the third highest per capita tax 6 709 and the sixth highest debt consequently young people and retirees are fleeing the state and business owners are taking note that the state is failing to address affordability issues if the governor is seeking a fairness economy shouldn t he be focusing on creating an environment that attracts good paying jobs for millennials and older adults technology and manufacturing jobs that lift people out of poverty are going to less expensive states companies like mercedes benz and honeywell are taking their high paying jobs to georgia and north carolina and it s not hard to figure out why north carolina ranks 12th on the business climate index by the tax foundation new jersey is 50th north carolina s corporate tax rate is third lowest in the nation ours is the 47th highest at 9 percent as a percentage of home value new jersey s property taxes more than double north carolina s georgia is ranked 33rd in business climate but last year approved legislation to lower its top individual and corporate income tax rates from 6 0 to 5 5 percent amidst new jersey s economic gloom the governor has established commissions to attract good paying jobs to the state his commission on science innovation and technology is staffed with academics who never ran a business and owners of very small businesses one of which is based in manhattan and ranks 2 689 on the inc com list of top 5 000 companies in the u s the governor has set up opportunity zones in 169 of the state s poorest areas but a recent report on the zones from the tax foundation suggest that place based incentive programs redistribute rather than generate new economic activity subsidize investments that would have occurred anyway and displace low income residents in other words opportunity zones like the current economic development agency will be of little or no help to economic growth the findings and recommendations of the governor s commissions will be irrelevant if the majority party in trenton fails to address the most important actions necessary to energize the economy cut spending lower taxes and make the state affordable for the middle class if the governor s administration is serious about improving the state s economy it will have to take the painful steps necessary to get new jersey off the bottom of nearly every national measure of economic health to pretend that the governor s progressive agenda is benefiting working families is to ignore the warning signs that our state economy could implode if trenton continues on its well worn path making new jersey economically competitive will do a lot more for workers than the 15 minimum wage ever will bettylou decroce is a small business owner and a state assemblywoman whose 26th

when state budget director ben barnes told reporters connecticut had entered into a period of permanent fiscal crisis he did so just 13 days after his boss gov dannel p malloy had won the 2014 gubernatorial election with a polar opposite message while malloy dismissed a major deficit forecast and pledged not to raise taxes his republican opponent tom foley was even more upbeat about delivering tax relief and closing the deficit the challenge of wooing voters has taken on new dimensions as politicians increasingly are boxed in by connecticut s fiscal realities and the 2014 gubernatorial campaign isn t the only example in recent years democrats and republicans in the general assembly have accused each other of making unrealistic if not ridiculous promises that fly in the face of the state s mounting debts too often the focus is on scoring partisan points when we should be hammering out a plan ellen shemitz executive director of connecticut voices for children connecticut failed to tackle its retirement benefit obligations when they were manageable and until now critics say the politics of the moment the next election has trumped making tough choices that could infuriate voters too often the focus is on scoring partisan points when we should be hammering out a plan said ellen shemitz executive director of connecticut voices for children a new haven based progressive advocacy group we re on a collision course with insolvency said suzanne bates director of policy and legislative outreach for the conservative yankee institute in hartford who added that connecticut s debts are mounting its population is flat and the state capitol is not responding and so far added carol platt liebau the institute s president there s no reason to believe that pattern is going to change tom foley s big promise if there has long been a conspiracy of silence when it comes to connecticut s exploding debt some democrats charge it deepened seven years ago when greenwich businessman tom foley a republican waged his first campaign for governor foley who narrowly lost the 2010 race to malloy infuriated democrats when he said he could close a cavernous deficit in state finances without raising taxes republican candidate tom foley during the 2014 gubernatorial campaign credit ct mirror gov m jodi rell and the 2010 legislature left office with a 3 7 billion hole built into the next state budget a shortfall equal to nearly 20 percent of annual spending rising debt costs eroding tax receipts billions of dollars worth of programs propped up with expiring resources and an empty budget reserve also awaited the winner foley said he could solve all of these problems without raising taxes and without touching the state s 2 billion package of education grants to local schools when pressed to explain how foley told the mirror that he expected 40 percent of the problem about 1 5 billion to be solved by economic growth alone it s always difficult to run against someone who promises you the sun the stars and the moon even when you know it is complete fiction roy occhiogrosso top aide during malloy s campaigns it s always difficult to run against someone who promises you the sun the stars and the moon even when you know it is complete fiction said roy occhiogrosso a top aide during malloy s campaigns in 2010 and 2014 people want to believe they can get everything they want and that it s not going to cause any problems malloy who downplayed but never ruled out tax hikes won that first race by a whisker five months into office he would sign more than 1 8 billion in tax increases into law despite concessions from state employees he would be called ridiculously optimistic by critics when he assumed about half of the economic growth foley had predicted malloy kept things rosy in the rematch the malloy administration began prepping a more upbeat fiscal message even before the 2014 rematch with foley the governor and his fellow democrats in the legislature s majority began cleaning up state finances temporarily well in advance of election day almost 200 million in annual debt payments were refinanced effectively removing them from the last two years of malloy s first term and delaying them plus about 40 million in interest charges until after the election more than 235 million in tax cuts were approved for consumers businesses the working poor single income tax filers and retired teachers all of which were scheduled to begin after the election and there was even to be a 55 per person tax rebate until plunging april income tax receipts forced malloy to cancel this election year maneuver still the governor s rosy campaign message was that connecticut s growing economy was poised to take off and that nonpartisan analysts warnings of sluggish growth and a 1 3 billion deficit in the first budget after the election simply were wrong we really don t have a deficit i know that s hard to believe dannel p malloy democratic governor of connecticut during 2014 campaign we really don t have a deficit malloy told the mirror during an interview in late july 2014 i know that s hard to believe what about the forecast signed by both nonpartisan analysts and his own budget staff projecting modest revenue growth after the election malloy dismissed it as extremely conservative despite that warning the governor upped the stakes even more when he took to the campaign trail in the fall of 2014 not only would he not raise taxes while delivering all of the approved tax cuts after the election but he promised another 40 million in tax breaks 20 million each for urban businesses and for college graduates struggling with student loan debt gov dannel p malloy unveils his proposal for urban small business tax incentives outside faith congregational church in hartford during the 2014 campaign credit ct mirror not to be outdone foley said he wouldn t raise taxes and would shave at least a half point off of the sales tax saving consumers over 300 million per year and after being pegged four years earlier as likely to take a slash and burn approach to the state budget foley when pressed for details ruled out one potential spending cut after another municipal aid would not be touched state employees would not be laid off or asked to reopen contracts and provide concessions a deal s a deal foley said a period of permanent fiscal crisis malloy s success in his rematch against foley wasn t the only thing that stayed constant after the election the 1 3 billion deficit projection for the state budget hadn t shrunk let alone evaporated barnes would try to reset expectations two weeks after his boss s re election win ben barnes the governor s budget chief in june after telling agency heads the state would defer raises for non union managers credit ctmirror file photo ben barnes the governor s budget chief in june after telling agency heads the state would defer raises for non union managers credit ctmirror file photo we have entered into a period of permanent fiscal crisis in state and local government it seems he told capitol reporters some of whom would forget to note the next sentence in barnes s statement but that said i think that we ve made a lot of progress in trying to find ways to make our government more sustainable still when faced with a 7 percent deficit forecast that was bad but yet no worse than when the campaign promises were made malloy offered a new budget in february 2015 that canceled or delayed nearly all of the 235 million in previously approved tax cuts made no mention of the tax cuts promised during the campaign to urban businesses and to college graduates and proposed more than 325 million in new tax revenue largely to be paid by hospitals and other corporations the administration also unveiled new euphemisms to describe these tax revenue raising proposals as anything other than tax hikes the hospital provider tax calculation was being updated to reflect inpatient and outpatient receipts corporation payments would be increased by reining in loopholes and corporation tax credits in other words unless a percentage based tax rate increase was proposed it didn t qualify as a tax hike the final budget malloy would negotiate with his fellow democrats in the legislature s majority also would cancel all previously approved tax hikes except an 11 million income tax break for retired teachers and further elevate the tax increase beyond 675 million per year hospitals ge balk at tax reversal neither the business community nor connecticut s hospitals saw the distinctions as malloy did in his budget message the connecticut hospital association immediately called the governor s plan a tax increase it means hospitals must provide care with even fewer resources and make fewer investments in staff medical equipment and other infrastructure cha spokeswoman michele sharp said within days of malloy s budget proposal hospitals weren t the only industry that blasted the new budget as an example of pre election bait and post election switch two of connecticut s corporate giants ge and aetna led the way with harsh public statements in the waning weeks of the 2015 budget debate the prospect of nearly 700 million in new taxes makes businesses including our own and citizens seriously consider whether it makes any sense to continue to be located in this state ge warned connecticut is in danger of damaging its economic future by failing to address its budget obligation in a responsible way aetna wrote such an action will result in aetna looking to reconsider the viability of continuing major operations in the state the ge logo marks the entry to its headquarter campus in fairfield credit google street view and while ge chose to emphasize the advantages of the boston metro area when it announced plans in january 2016 to relocate its fairfield headquarters there business advocates said ge s thinking was clear ge had gone behind the rhetoric and researched how nearly eight decades worth of huge unfunded liabilities had trumped campaign promises and driven the 2015 tax increase the advocates said malloy acknowledged something very similar this past december when he announced his new plan to mitigate spiking state employee pension costs by deferring billions of dollars in contributions until after 2032 they ge officials could look at the same charts we could look at and understand that the state was not in a position and would not be in a position to meet its obligations the governor said historic and transformative budget but even as malloy and legislators were taking heat over their reversal on taxes they again promised major and costly new initiatives despite strong evidence they would quickly become unaffordable as the 2015 budget debate wound down in june democratic legislative leaders hailed the new spending plan as historic and transformative why because it contained plans to divert hundreds of millions of dollars in future sales tax receipts for two initiatives the first five years of the governor s new 30 year transportation rebuilding program and democratic legislative leaders plan to share sales tax receipts with cities and towns including a much touted freeze on car taxes in about 60 communities with high property tax rates but a nonpartisan fiscal analysis attached to the same budget bill that established these investments warned state finances faced a deficit in two years that was 50 percent larger than the cost of both programs combined and since then both initiatives have slowed considerably cities and towns were supposed to share 246 million in sales tax receipts this fiscal year but only received 185 million but to help pay for the revenue sharing state officials cut other municipal grants by about 100 million from the original 2016 17 budget and the car tax freeze was scaled back significantly plans to cap municipal taxes on vehicles at 32 mills were modified to 37 mills according to the connecticut conference of municipalities only 17 of 169 cities and towns were taxing vehicles at a rate higher than 37 mills when the state budget was adopted last spring the modification squeezed several blue collar communities out of the program including bristol meriden and windham meanwhile the initial investment in transportation was cut more than in half this fiscal year nonpartisan analysts estimate the special transportation fund will operate in the red beginning in july 2018 and the study panel report recommending tolls and fuel tax hikes to fund the final 25 years of the transportation program has not been acted upon by the governor or the legislature municipal leaders who were forced to accept a controversial local spending cap in exchange for the promised sales tax money didn t hide their frustration when they visited the capitol last march get rid of that sales tax money get rid of the cap and just leave us alone said ridgefield first selectman rudy marconi a democrat gop fights tax hikes and many program cuts democratic legislative leaders in turn charged their republican counterparts have tried to be all things to all people in recent years something impossible in tough fiscal times after malloy ordered emergency cuts in september 2015 aimed largely at hospitals and social services senate minority leader len fasano r north haven chastised the democratic governor publicly for targeting the most vulnerable people in our society we are not happy with the cuts the governor did to hospitals fasano said we re not happy with the cuts the governor did to medicaid we re not happy with the cuts the governor did to mental health we re not happy with the cuts the governor did to the department on developmental disabilities we think we need to undo all of those things republican legislators who have been in the minority in the legislature for almost all of the last 30 years also consistently have opposed tax increases and reductions to municipal aid the majority of their proposals to cut spending have been tied to state employee wages and benefits and many of those hinge on concessions unions have been reluctant to provide since 2011 senate president pro tem martin m looney credit ctmirror org file photo if you have a good faith discussion with people committed to the process that means you have to see it all the way through senate president pro tem martin m looney d new haven said in response to fasano s objections in the fall of 2015 that means being willing to compromise to be thorough and not just to make some points and walk away it means bringing some votes at the end of the process budget spin is more intense but not new some say efforts to put a pleasant spin on connecticut s grim fiscal outlook is not a new phenomenon all that s changed they say is that the situation now is even more dire former state comptroller william e curry jr a democrat who lost the 1994 and 2002 gubernatorial contests to rowland said the republican governor wasn t the only one interested in hiding red ink during their rematch 15 years ago he had been in violation of the law for the better part of a year by ignoring or understating deficits in official financial reports curry said adding that democratic legislative leaders were no more interested in acknowledging connecticut s problems bill curry credit photo courtesy of wnpr chion wolf nobody lifted a finger or said a word curry said north branford republican robert ward whose 31 year career in state government featured 22 years in the house between 1985 and 2006 including 12 as minority leader said people saw little political benefit to addressing massively under funded retirement benefit obligations those few lawmakers who did worry one or two decades ago about state government s long term outlook were told connecticut s debt problems could wait once the income tax was put in in 1991 all of the politics post that were about changes he said democrats ran to repair it to make it more palatable republicans were interested in finding ways to repeal it anything else was not a common discussion this story is one of five in a series a legacy of debt
when alexandria ocasio cortez ran in her primary against incumbent democrat joe crowley she had the green new deal on her website but her big talking points were housing costs gentrification and crowley s links to real estate now she s linked the two in this week s green new deal resolution so far so good but the resolution only makes a passing mention of a housing guarantee its main economic focus is jobs the crushing cost of housing is just as central if not more so to class struggle and workers economic pain than stagnating wages median incomes have stagnated since 2000 but in that same period a foreclosure boom has shredded millions of families savings and average urban rental costs have increased by 50 percent a green new deal can t deliver economic justice or solidify mass support without tackling housing head on the best way for a green new deal to expand decarbonize and guarantee housing is to build ten million new public no carbon homes in ten years and again and again and again and no ten million isn t a crazy number the united states is already building well over one million housing units a year and still the system is broken a housing guarantee belongs at the core of a green new deal for three simple reasons first exploding costs have made the housing crisis as big a threat to basic well being as low wages and under and unemployment second millions and millions of people will need new homes as extreme weather makes swathes of the country unlivable and third building a ton of new housing to low carbon standards can be a massive lever for decarbonizing the building sector which is responsible for 39 percent of us energy consumption housing fits awkwardly into left climate debates housing doesn t turn up in your average green new deal proposal it was absent from naomi klein s this changes everything and from the demands in the people s climate march where climate does meet housing it s usually in the form of proposals from the likes of elon musk to put a solar panel on every suburban home and a tesla in every driveway never mind that today there are as many poor people in us suburbs as in cities and rural areas combined green jobs proposals overlap with desperately needed building energy upgrade programs like a huge scale up of federally subsidized weatherization for poor and working class households municipal building upgrade mandates and deep energy retrofits of public housing it s astounding that the climate movement has failed to better connect the two existential threats of this century homelessness and climate chaos maybe it felt too daunting to tackle it all at once but we already have the tools to tackle this massive crisis european and american precedents to draw on and the fierce urgency of the moment to drive action a huge build out of high quality beautifully designed meticulously financed public housing with diversity of design and governance structure would meet millions of people s housing needs and create tens of thousands of skilled jobs in the no carbon construction sector for decades done right the new housing would yield lovely walkable mixed used diverse and democratic communities across the country in cities suburbs towns and reservations density alone isn t a low carbon solution good enough to prioritize yuppies on bike paths over ending poverty density does lower carbon emissions but study after study also finds that when residents of dense neighborhoods are wealthy the footprint of their luxury consumption from ipads to plane trips overwhelms the carbon savings that come from walking to brunch per capita carbon footprints in the west village are two to three times higher than those of many comparably dense neighborhoods in the bronx dense mixed income and working class neighborhoods near public transit anchored by public housing are good to live in and have small carbon footprints right now in hot land markets well planned public transit hubs raise housing costs and displace low income residents away public transit plus housing would be far fairer and would suck carbon out of the streets meanwhile the working class women of color who populate the housing movements that fight against gentrification and demand more affordable housing might not always talk about climate change although increasingly they do but their demands are objectively low carbon their movements and demands are essential to any coalition that would decarbonize urban life cancelling market mechanisms the need for a housing guarantee through a program of mass public homebuilding is overwhelming in city after city gentrification is unleashing cultural and economic traumas that evoke the memory of colonial displacement a national eviction epidemic is deepening poverty throwing families onto the street for making a little too much noise or simply for committing the crime of being poor eviction threatens the 17 percent of us renter households that pay over half their income in rent while another 21 percent are paying over a third in sum as david madden and peter marcuse write according to the standard measures of affordability there is no us state where a full time minimum wage worker can afford to rent or own a one bedroom dwelling meanwhile unequal home ownership makes housing the single most important factor in the appalling wealth disparity between whites and people of color a structural divide whose foundation was laid by the new deal s racist mortgage policies that divide has deepened further since the collapse of the sub prime mortgage boom and the 2008 financial crash the housing crisis also manifests in buildings damaged guts where failing boilers and busted window frames leak carbon and break budgets in the mid atlantic over half of all black households have recently suffered utility shut offs cut back on food or medicine to pay utility bills or kept homes dangerously hot or cold to stave off bankruptcy a fifth of white households are just as fuel poor in new york city after hurricane sandy 45 percent of public housing apartments in affected areas had visible mold after the storm but even before the storm that number was 34 percent the climate and housing crises are already converging and will only do so more into the future advocates have won mighty legal victories to finally enforce the 1968 fair housing act passed in the wake of martin luther king jr s assassination that should in theory ensure adequate affordable housing for people of color but the current market and affordable housing toolkits can t build the needed new homes especially as the climate and housing crises merge sea level rise alone will displace some thirteen million americans this century in a good case scenario that s more than the twentieth century s great migration which new deal redlining channeled into lasting segregation heat fire drought and other impacts will likely displace millions more those same pressures worldwide will increase rates of immigration and refugee arrival a market approach to these housing pressures would be disastrous real estate and construction companies would be the real beneficiaries of a push to build more homes with private construction a sub prime building boom turbocharged with tax credits and financing through predatory home loans we saw how that story ends in 2008 another private housing boom would repeat the pathologies of earlier ones locking in decades of segregation fuel poverty eviction and foreclosure the tangle of public private partnerships and market tweaks that currently pass for affordable housing policy is almost as bad at present the main mechanism for federally financed affordable housing construction is the low income housing tax credits lihtc program which subsidizes private developers as money for real public housing dried up decades ago lihtc funds increased a classic liberal compromise this public private partnership has become a bloated corporate giveaway that housing advocates miserably defend as the best there is the right savages its corruption and inefficiencies while research shows a long term decline in the program s bang actual low income housing for its buck other remedies are just as weak from federal to local levels section 8 housing vouchers improve individuals lives they also concentrate poverty and leave the broken housing market intact in cities zoning debates are an intellectual and political black hole in the end all but a hardcore fringe of market fetishists recognize the need for tons of non market housing alongside new private construction back to square one speaking of in california gavin newsom is proposing a marshall plan to create an astonishing 3 5 million new housing units in four years increasing the state total by a quarter finally a solution at scale with proper public leadership california could give the country a masterclass in lovingly contextual urban design and yet to make most new homes affordable newsom has suggested wait for it pouring hundreds of millions into tax credits for private builders it s time to let go of tax credits and market nudges and get real just as medicare for all and a federal jobs guarantee would attack health and job needs at their roots bypassing the money suck of corrupt public private partnerships a housing guarantee must be built by the people for the people despite the propaganda of the real estate industry and a cowering class of policy wonks european and american precedents show us exactly how the public can house millions of people affordably safely without carbon and with style toward temples of public luxury this past summer standing in a grassy garden in vienna i had what felt like a religious awakening i d come to the city s ostensible public housing temple karl marx hof a giant leafy complex of 1200 apartments with gently rounded arches and fine stonework surrounding broad lawns fountains and gardens but vienna itself is the temple the city s social democrats whose radicals in an exception for europe never defected to form a separate communist party were first elected after world war i they haven t lost a free election since they were it s true beaten by nazis in a civil war in 1919 they inaugurated what became known as red vienna most famous for its massive public homebuilding program they levied harsh real estate taxes that devastated the land market making it cheap to buy land to build on they raised a third of the needed housing funds from luxury taxes a political poster from the period shows a muscular red fist swiping a bottle of champagne from an ice bucket while horrified bourgeois in tuxedos and gowns back off taxing rich people s spending on champagne race horses and servants redirected money into bricks tile and garden for the working class and the social democrats built housing in every neighborhood no one should be able to tell a person s status from their postal code these weren t just rooms in square boxes the complexes integrated sophisticated services karl marx hof had cultural facilities and a dental clinic the social fabric woven into the housing developments connected socialist and labor movement commitments to affordable housing with the best ideas of a feminist movement that was born on the barricades of 1848 and a public health movement that quickly followed vienna held design contests for public housing and the best architects competed as i toured projects across the city i saw a wide range of gardens courtyards stairwells cornices archways laundry facilities and other common spaces almost uniformly five or six stories high walkable dense green shaded and interwoven into a pleasantly dense but not overwhelming urban fabric viennense housing is one giant joke at the housing market s expense today roughly a third of the city s housing is still public city owned another third is limited equity cooperatives the more recent trend showing even more innovative designs a final third is private with good quality and low costs even in europe s racist neoliberal rubble vienna can hold its head up its most immigrant dense working class and public housing rich neighborhoods vote in huge numbers against the arch conservatives who draw support from beyond the city s limits vienna has recently implemented free daycare for children aged zero to seven public transit costs a euro a day for a yearly pass people do get very angry if a bus takes longer than seven minutes one of my guides the historian and neighborhood councilor armin puller sighed with a grimace to show his dissatisfaction at the service s disintegrating quality and carbon vienna s summers are almost as hot as new york s but in most public and cooperative housing air conditioning is banned some buildings from the postwar period are brutally hot they could use the occasional a c but most housing benefits from the city s quality of design and are comfortable year round puller showed me one cooperative complex that surrounded flexible play spaces their grounds creatively landscaped like a star trek caricature of utopia the buildings balconies had sliding plastic doors that could instantly turn broad patios into cozy sun rooms i cried a little on the inside when he next showed me an experimental public school where each classroom had a dedicated outdoor space with wheeled chairs and tables so that groups could shuttle between micro climates at will a few tears leaked all of us could have this of course vienna is far from perfect you can t have eco socialism in one capitalist european city but guess what it really is true that when the working classes build lasting creative institutions that raise and spend money well life is a lot better and with vienna s extraordinary transit and dense housing per capita carbon emissions are miniscule 10 million no carbon homes today american housing projects are unjustly stigmatized it s also true that a lot of it was built on the cheap and badly maintained leading to countless demolitions and turning the ideal of social housing into a symbol of urban decay could the united states reverse that damage and achieve anything resembling red vienna s achievements a brilliant report by left policy think tank the people s policy project social housing in the united states shows how vienna sweden and finland managed to produce such high quality housing and how the united states could do the same two takeaways stand out first quality and financing with upfront investment and intelligent policy design you get glorious housing by pricing generous maintenance costs into tenants monthly payments then for the poorest tenants you subsidize out of a separate anti poverty fund one column for quality public housing a second column for abolishing poverty the other takeaway speed in the 1960s sweden had about three million housing units many were crumbling plus they needed more with some admittedly rough edges sweden built one million public homes in ten years they increased their housing stock by roughly a third in a decade half a century ago the ppp proposal is more modest ten million public housing units in ten years which i propose repeating decade after decade federally financed and locally implemented with financial structures similar to vienna s and sweden s the cost roughly the equivalent to the trump tax cut yes there would be obstacles the biggest is local resistance in many of the best places to build because much of this housing will help racialized people live in mostly white suburbs locals will rebel school districts will be battlegrounds indeed white suburbs and leafy urban neighborhoods have long refused public housing developments violating the fair housing act but a green new deal government would enforce that law wielding every legal and financial carrot and stick it can muster and mass mobilization could be the most powerful another obstacle is land prices in desirable areas here vienna s precedent of punishing real estate taxes is key flatten speculation build homes what s more the inevitable local battles that a huge infusion of federal money will bring are actually good the result is more likely to reflect local groups particular needs no one wants to live in a powerpoint crudely blocked together in washington dc at first local battles over implementation will be frustrating but for the most part we re talking about a political context in which millions have clogged the streets to overthrow the political establishment and it will be easier to mobilize a public housing coalition of angry rent burdened tenants racial and housing justice groups unionized construction workers and prospective workers allied white progressives and local politicians who want to get re elected around massive public investment than rather than a measly lihtc tax credit scheme there s no substitute for mass mobilization but there are many rewards funding should allow motivated groups to experiment with limited equity co operatives and community land trusts even if much of the new housing would probably be built and governed by local authorities at least early on public homes should also be built in different shapes and sizes with the program reaching beyond cities and suburban transit nodes into rural areas blighted by poor home quality from appalachian towns to indigenous reservations where local control over design and other details will be essential we will also need aggressive oversight by auditors to stamp out opportunism and corruption from red vienna to the new deal infrastructure programs keeping public projects clean was key to holding mass support as noted democratic neighborhoods anchored by dense well connected public housing are the gold standard of democratic no carbon urbanism public construction standards and smart localization will also make these bulwarks of ruggedness to withstand brutal weather their construction would also strengthen other green new deal staples a low carbon housing guarantee is a great fit for a job guarantee decarbonizing the economy requires electrifying everything replacing stoves and water heaters and mastering technologies like home heating pumps that both warm and cool the best accelerator of buildings technological improvement smart public procurement weatherizing existing homes and swapping their appliances will be a necessary but tedious slog a huge homebuilding program with a net zero carbon mandate could train and equip tens of thousands of workers in the skills needed to strip carbon from each of the country s houses apartments and offices you could have a threadbare patchwork quilt of training programs jurisdiction by jurisdiction with baby firms struggling to sell big ideas to luxury homebuilders or you could join up federal law federal money local social movements and the world s best science engineering and craft standards tough call building the dream you make buildings no carbon by slashing their energy use and powering what s left with renewables but there s more than just wire linking the public housing ideal and the project of vast public renewable power the two are linked by an irresistible dream ordinary people seizing control of their place in the world that s no empty abstraction take new york state s grassroots campaign for a just transition new york renews the coalition was started by environmental justice labor and housing organizers after the 2014 people s climate march in new york after focusing for years on environmental justice these largely housing oriented organizers knew they had to branch out connecting to the state s rural anti fracking groups labor unions and community hubs four key leaders took road trips upstate to build the coalition that s leading the charge for its green new deal style climate and community protection act and there s an obscure but surprisingly strong historical precedent linking social housing and public power one of new york s storied socialist co operative housing complexes was actually designed in homage to vienna s karl marx hof echoing its elaborate masonry and round arches the amalgamated dwellings in new york s lower east side was built for a leftist jewish textile workers union in 1931 to house 236 families the co op still stands the building s designer roland wank was inspired by red vienna remarkably for downtown manhattan now and then the building proper only covers about half of its expensive lot space devoting the rest to a large garden studded courtyard as i learned during a recent visit with william rockwell an architect resident and the building s unofficial historian even the rooftops were specially designed for dancing and parties as we discussed the intricate art deco stonework rockwell insisted this is not cost effective this is about love making a statement from the start the dwellings included a library and an open cultural space with a cozy stage for performances for making the good life together the multi functional airy design links a radical new york tradition to austria s labor socialist feminist and public health movements themselves rooted in the europe wide revolt of 1848 wank was a hungarian leftist who studied architecture in budapest and briefly in vienna then immigrated to the united states in 1924 to chase new dreams shortly after designing the amalgamated dwellings wank took a job with the new deal s tennessee valley authority which was set up by franklin delano roosevelt to break monopolistic and useless private electricity utilities wank became the authority s chief architect he built celebrated workers housing around the country led the design of several hydroelectric dams and helped steward the rural electrification administration that brought electric power to tens of millions of americans through democratic cooperatives they still operate wank s dams are known for their elegant monumental and public oriented design critics were stunned by their beauty wank also innovated by establishing visitors plazas and sculpting roads for ordinary people to absorb the infrastructure s glory as they came in to visit as one obituary put it wank saw to it that were approached as one would the acropolis the towns wank built for workers and people displaced by dams were innovative one of them norris featured the country s first green belt the town also excluded black residents and workers wank s work crystallized all that was good in the new deal and all that was rotten the new deal didn t just reproduce jim crow it hardened it yet we can reconstruct some of the new deal s and wank s best insights namely experimentation and equality had to run through infrastructure big and small abolition democracy as first articulated by w e b dubois in those years will require even more public power plentiful no carbon energy and a truly democratic government and democratic housing for working people from the lower east side to rural tennessee wank built structures that made socialism s grand promises monumental intimate and useful thinking about wank s work helps us focus on the ten million public no carbon homes core premise climate justice will be visceral it s about more than solar voltaic cells healthy rainforests and plant protein it s about how we work and live the stone glass and steel that we shape with our hands to protect us from the elements and to bind us to their beauty the politics of climate change and the transformation of the built environment are the same damn thing and they have a history there was a bright red line between the street architects who built barricades across europe in 1848 founding a continent s socialist and feminist politics and the arrival of no carbon hydro electricity built by public institutions and delivered by cooperatives in rural america s poor heartland that line curved through the greatest public homebuilding project of europe and the great socialist cooperative tradition of new york city tracing brick and mortar homes and bright green gardens that made the abstract ideals of social equality literally tangible justice you can run your fingers over it was to be sure a crooked line a line that divided it needs to be redrawn with an ambition scarcely imaginable on the left even a year ago ocasio cortez s pivot from housing to climate is coherent the two challenges are one and urgent we can think huge and act fast one herculean decade at a time in 1941 as nazis threatened to swallow europe for good and the new deal became a war economy roland wank the immigrant home and public power builder published a moving essay on architecture as politics anticipating today s mood he urged his fellow builders to embrace the era s radical uncertainty to attack inequalities mercilessly and to take pleasure in struggle when the fight is hot and passion runs high seizing the political moment wank continued is one of the vital experiences that make life worth living his essay s title is a rebuke to his failures and to the failures of the new deal which a green new deal must correct the simple title is also a slogan a fierce clap back to the critics who want to slow our pace and shrink our desires who want to nudge the markets we plan to transcend hoard the power we plan to share and who scorn the public dream homes that

foreign policy cambodia needs to maintain good relations with the west like it or not the cpp still needs the west there is an assumption by some commentators and analysts myself included on occasions that just because china is now cambodia s closest political ally the influence of western nations has become negligible as early as 2015 sebastian strangio noted in his book hun sen s cambodia that western influence in cambodia had begun to wane years on this process was complete according to many in late 2017 foreign policy magazine reported on the limits of us willingness or ability to influence cambodia become clear when compared to china s overwhelming influence there why the west was doomed to fail in cambodia reads a headline from the southeast asia globe last year the exiled political analyst kim sok more recently asserted that prime minister hun sen has no choice but to rely on the chinese as he increasingly pushes the west away china might be many things to cambodia the main provider of aid investment and goods a key geopolitical ally and something of a sagacious avuncular mentor an ironclad friend in phnom penh s argot but it isn t and most likely never will be a major importer of cambodia produced goods instead the major importers are the united states and the european union together they imported a little under two thirds of all cambodian exports in 2017 china by contrast imported just 6 of cambodian total exports that year this matters greatly as both the us and eu now threaten to impose trade sanctions on cambodia and re introduce tariffs on its exports a response to the cambodian people s party cpp s stage management of last year s general election at which it won all the seats in the national assembly and its dissolution of the main opposition party the cambodian people s rescue party cnrp the previous year on 11 february the eu formally started the 18 month process to remove cambodia from its preferential everything but arms eba scheme a process that can be stopped if the eu thinks phnom penh is making sufficient progress in political and human rights reform cambodia s economy despite years of high economic growth remains highly dependent on exports products made in its garment and footwear sector the largest employer by sector and largest contributor to gdp almost exclusively are exported to western nations so should the eu withdraw cambodia from its everything but arms eba scheme which grants cambodian exporters duty and quote free access to european markets then the imposition of tariffs and quotas will certainly see exports to europe plummet causing a considerable slump in the cambodian economy the government knows this that s why it planned for years to reduce the economy s dependence on exports chiefly low cost manufactured goods but progress has been slow if not glacial granted the tourism sector is booming thanks to increasing numbers of chinese visitors so too are the retail and property sectors but exports are still prepotent there is likely zero chance despite the opinions of some analysts that if western democracies punish phnom penh by imposing higher tariffs on its exports or switching to suppliers in other nations then china can simply jump in and bail out cambodia quite obviously china doesn t need to import low cost garments from cambodia it produces more than enough domestically china s main import to cambodia the raw materials stitched and sewed at cambodia s garment factories would also be harmed if exports to western nations slump chinese investors own many of the largest firms in cambodia s garment and footwear sector so they will be among those who will lose out if exports dry up moreover beijing would have wasted millions if not billions of dollars on funding new roads ports and special economic zones in cambodia that were aimed at improving its export capabilities a more astonishing response from beijing would be to simply hand cambodia the cash to make up for any shortfall if exports to the west decline a move some analysts think is possible but it s actually improbable would this come in the form of concessional loans or simply cash payments the latter would be raise serious opposition in beijing where some policymakers and analysts are already becoming sceptical of the amount of money wasted through xi jinping s signatory belt and road initiative bri at least for the bri however xi can point to the likelihood of future returns on investments few profits though would be reaped by simply bailing out cambodia s exporters the other option bailouts in the form of loans would be just as risky to the cambodian government which is struggling though doesn t admit it with a growing public debt especially to china how would phnom penh square the circle of attaining more loans if exports its chief means of acquiring foreign currency dwindle moreover say that new european tariffs on exports and reductions in trade see cambodia s exports figures slump just 10 or roughly us 500 million a year would china be willing to provide this much annually for few returns also what about the knock on impact to other sectors in cambodia if exports slump it would certainly see investment and profits contract in the retail construction property and many other sectors too the real costs of even a minor slump in garment exports is likely to be felt throughout the economy as well as by the millions of family members of workers who rely on remittances each month whichever way one looks at it western nations still have considerable influence in cambodia they clearly know this and that s why they are exerting pressure on phnom penh to make political reforms through threats to the country s export driven economy the cambodian government for the most part either says it isn t concerned about threatened western sanctions claims that they are an assault on cambodia s sovereignty or a move to punish only poor cambodians it hasn t yet publicly admitted that its own actions may actually be the real cause but here s the kicker trade with the us and eu might be immensely import to cambodia but it s only negligible to them indeed the eu s trade with cambodia which is overwhelmingly europe importing cambodian goods not the other way around is worth about a tenth of its trade with vietnam for example so there wouldn t be any mutual catastrophe if exports decline it would simply be felt by one side just look at how the us is currently weathering new tariffs president donald trump imposed on chinese imports which could soon be raised even higher any loss in trade with cambodia won t even be felt as a tremor in america though it would be an earthquake in cambodia remember too that it isn t as though cambodia is the world s only producer of cheap clothes and shoes bangladesh is making them for much cheaper as does vietnam whose ruling communist party is now backing down to american and european demands for some political and legal reforms in order to boost trade hanoi appears more than happy to negotiate while phnom penh stuffs its ears it would be so much easier from some european importers to simply say enough of cambodia and move operations or find new supply chains in other countries
there was a time when venezuela was one of the richest countries in the world wealthier even than canada the year was 1950 and oil rich venezuela was thriving while much of the rest of the world was struggling to recover from the ravages of the second world war only the united states switzerland and new zealand had a higher per capita gdp canada ranked sixth with its relative stability and prosperity venezuela was a magnet for immigrants today it is an economic basket case the country still has plenty of oil sitting atop the world s largest reserves but it is now a poor country and its oil production is plunging in the nearly five years since nicolas maduro became president its economy has shrunk in half and economists warn that it is on course to decline by another 25 per cent this year dragged down by recently imposed u s trade sanctions hunger power blackouts empty store shelves rampant crime and hyperinflation have become part of everyday life as many as 3 3 million venezuelans more than 10 per cent of the population have fled to neighbouring countries as well as to the u s and spain among the refugees are some of the most desperate but also many of the country s best and brightest workers venezuela s economic collapse is almost unprecedented in recent history according to a report this month by the washington based institute for international finance iif only russia s implosion after the breakup of the soviet union comes close the central question now is how to make venezuela whole again when the maduro regime inevitably cedes power presumably to opposition leader juan guaido unfortunately mr maduro s exit a change advocated by canada the u s and dozens of other countries won t miraculously fix this badly broken country it will take years and tens of billions of dollars in emergency loans and longer term financial support from the international community including the international monetary fund the depth of the recession raises the risk of an incomplete recovery in the event of policy change the iif warned the first challenge will be to get inflation under control prices are on course to rocket ahead at a staggering 1 3 million per cent pace this year according to the imf money has essentially lost its value it doesn t have to be this way experts say a large and quick infusion of foreign cash would allow the government to keep operations running and to buy more local currency the bolivar the government could then fund its deficit in local currency without resorting to printing money with reckless abandon as it does now getting the economy growing again could prove more challenging in a country that no longer has a viable private sector mr maduro and his predecessor hugo chávez expropriated vast swaths of the economy from banks and telecoms to factories and hotels and the businesses the government didn t take it killed with strict controls on prices foreign exchange and imports venezuela will also have to work hard to make the country a welcome place again for private investors and for millions of exiles that will require ending price controls relaxing import curbs enforcing property rights and reopening access to foreign currency markets another key precondition for kick starting private businesses will be to get commercial banks lending again putting the government on a sustainable financial footing will take more time a good start would be to cut military spending and phase out massive subsidies for consumers for buying gas and electricity many venezuelans may also need wage supports to adjust to higher prices for some of these necessities the oil sector must become a driver of foreign investment again that means ending the practice of forcing foreign investors to work exclusively with the country s state run oil company petroleos de venezuela or pdvsa venezuela has become increasingly oil dependent even as the price of crude has slumped and production dwindled oil exports bring in about 90 per cent of the country s hard currency beyond people oil is virtually the only thing the country still exports but it s producing less oil now than it did in the late 1990s and output has fallen by half in just the past two years from lack of investment in the short term the new u s sanctions will make the situation worse by cutting off billions of dollars in oil revenue and blocking imports of the u s made refined products it needs to dilute the heavy crude it produces another challenge for whomever succeeds mr maduro will be to keep onside china and russia two of venezuela s largest foreign creditors the sooner venezuela gets the rebuilding started the better
with the harmonisation of common external tariffs cet in 1993 the partial liberalisation of the petroleum sector was complete prices and margins beyond the refinery gate were decontrolled and opening hours for retail outlets were deregulated subsidies on kerosene were also removed the haulage contractors margins became the responsibility of the marketers following the removal of subsidies on kerosene its demand dropped significantly this proved the point that i had made for many years that subsidised kerosene sales were erroneously assumed to be mainly for household consumption kerosene s primary use had been for adulteration and illegal blending into petrol thus improving the profitability of rogue gas stations although the country s refining capacity was way below the domestic demand for economic and technical reasons that we would discuss in a forthcoming article the refinery was now protected through a fiscal regime of protective tariffs against imported refined petroleum products a 10 per cent protection for the refinery feed stock semi finished products and crude oil restricted the market in terms of free and unencumbered import of refined products from non caricom caribbean sources this also extended a protection to the trinidad and tobago refineries while the natural sources of refined products for jamaica were aruba curaçao and venezuela the tax differential also provided an advantage to the kingston refinery and ultimately became a likely source of abuse headlines delivered to your inbox sign up for the gleaner s morning and evening newsletters a major asset of value at the kingston refinery was its industry loading rack and associated terminalling storage facilities although the liberalisation allowed independent marketing companies esso shell and texaco to import refined products for distribution they lacked adequate storage and import facilities in the southern part of the island esso and shell however established small import facilities in montego bay and were able to supply to capture about 15 per cent of the market mainly aviation they did request hospitality from the kingston refinery but were refused commercial access to the kingston refinery terminal as the domestic market was small construction of new terminals in the south was considered uneconomic consequently despite liberalisation the kingston refinery remained the dominant supplier of petroleum products satisfying about 80 per cent of the country s market demand mostly through import of fully refined products in other words the refinery s major operation was storage and terminal the refining part was marginal and ran below economic efficiency we had somewhat transitioned to an oligopolistic petroleum market structure as the government lacked institutional capacity and oversight the refinery management had a free hand in running its operations it used the refinery unit as an umbrella to do what suited its immediate objectives multinationals made strategic commercial decisions and embarked on divestments of their assets today none of the original three companies have presence in jamaica privatise petroleum sector since the mid 1980s the impact of the washington consensus on the world bank lending operations and conditionality had been in full swing as part of a conditionality of the current phase of the world bank s private development adjustment loan to jamaica the government had agreed to bring the kingston refinery to the point of sale by june 30 1994 since the mid 1980s adjustment programme under the national investment bank of jamaica nibj had been coordinating jamaica s privatization programme the refinery privatisation also fell in its lap the nibj enterprise team with the help of consultants started preparing petrojam petroleum corporation of jamaica pcj and its subsidiaries for privatisation in the meanwhile the refinery management in association with the tripetrol oil trading inc s a a company with exploration and production operations in latin america principally in ecuador submitted an unsolicited bid for a management buy out mbo the government was advised not to sell the refinery to the management as it would have difficulty in raising necessary finances or pay for the required expertise the mbo proposal entailed 1 an offer of us 50 million for 80 per cent minimum of the shares of petrojam ltd and all its subsidiaries 2 payment either in cash five year bonds debt for equity swap or any combination at the government s pleasure 3 commitment to invest us 100 130 million for a hydro cracker to deal with the surplus fuel oil and 4 a broad based ownership through the involvement of the industry jamaica gasoline retailers association jgra building societies etc the government informed the management that it would be required to submit a bid just like anyone else and no special treatment could be afforded to the management however the mbo had the advantage of inside information which was not available to potential outside bidders in addition the management had a free hand in the preparation of an information memorandum and could orchestrate the information to its own advantage a clear case of conflict of interest packages for some assets arthur d little adl a consulting company considered that petrojam s terminal storage and truck loading assets were of prime importance to a potential buyer they provided the means by which a potential buyer could access reasonably priced refined products and import them in a cost effective manner based on adl s recommendations the nibj s enterprise team prepared the following packages for some of the assets that were owned by petrojam and pcj petrojam refinery this package included all storage tanks the marine terminal all buildings land comprising the refinery and related facilities the loading rack and related equipment furniture and equipment including computer facilities motor vehicles and inventories crude oil refined products and other supplies petroleum company of jamaica ltd petcom a subsidiary of pcj retailing facilities for transport fuels lpg operations bunkering and asphalt marketing petrojam ethanol ltd a dehydration facility consisting of 52 million gallons p a capacity ethanol pre treatment and distillation system tankage leased or otherwise this plant was located at the kingston oil refinery site and piggybacked on the refinery infrastructure petrojam ltd shipping division petrojam trader and petrojam barge 1 petrojam belize ltd sugar factory cane lands and associated facilities in corozal belize originally bought to meet the mandated by us congress local content requirement for exports of ethanol under the caribbean basin initiative to the us market santa cruz lodge cottages in negril most of these entities were financially non viable for the refinery and ethanol plant the government preferred a single buyer the bids were to close in september 1994 negotiations were to be held in november 1994 and privatisation completed by the first quarter of 1995 the multinationals carefully evaluated the option to buy the refinery and associated facilities however the refinery under its current configuration did not appeal as a sound investment at best its financial viability was dependent on protection or revenues it could generate from the terminalling operations they decided not to submit a bid the only bid that the government received was from the management group the management lobbied and convinced the government that the mbo had promises of adequate external financial backing and was the way to go in july 1996 the government sold 70 per cent of the shares to the management team valued at us 68 million subsequent to the signing of the sale agreement the external financial backing failed to materialise in 1998 the financing deal fell apart and the government again ended up with ownership of the refinery at the end all efforts to privatize the refinery failed as had been predicted jamaica was back to square one readers may also recall that the privatisation of the jamaica public service jps did not materialise until 2001 and even then it was a negotiated deal with mirant and not through international competitive bidding we now had a sacred cow on our hands having failed to own the refinery the management now started a campaign to the successive administrations to commission feasibility studies for an upgrade and expansion of the refinery contending that it was critical for national petroleum supply security millions were spent on engineering and feasibility studies all these against well considered professional advice the management hoped that a joint venture with venezuela might pave a way to obtain elusive finances approximately us 1 2 billion that they needed to implement an upgrade and expansion of an old dilapidated refinery if we do not learn from history we are doomed to repeat it zia mian a retired senior world bank official

i love dividend hikes i like it even better when a company promises to hike its dividend for several years into the future case in point brookfield infrastructure partners l p nyse nyse bip earlier this month the infrastructure company not only boosted its distribution seven percent â its tenth consecutive annual increase â but reiterated its mid single digit annual dividend growth guidance of course you canâ t call these dividend hikes a sure thing yet and future increases will still depend on cash flows and still require approval by the board management though probably would not have made such promises unless they felt confident they could deliver and i believe they can first off brookfield has assembled an impressive portfolio of infrastructure assets â ports pipelines railways utilities and toll roads infrastructure assets generally have long lifespans and throw off steady cash flows they re not risk free but they re on the conservative end of the spectrum i often think of these properties as the â arteriesâ of the global economy without these essential properties business would grind to a halt that puts management in a great position to raise prices year after year creating a growing stream of cash flow for shareholders moreover brookfield faces little in the way of direct competition in most of the companyâ s businesses it would not make economic sense to have two rivals operating side by side you wouldnâ t install two sets of power lines into your house would you that leaves brookfield with a portfolio of mini monopolies whose profitability is limited only by regulators you can see the power of these assets in brookfieldâ s financial results last year gross margins profit earned after deducting the costs of delivering a product or service topped 57 operating margins profit earned after deducting all the costs of doing business came in at 37 more impressively the company s return on invested capital has averaged 14 over the past decade you see firms earn profits like these from time to time but itâ s rare to see companies sustain such high returns over such a long period thatâ s the ultimate sign of a wonderful business second brookfield has a lot of opportunities to pad its portfolio further population growth and an expanding middle class continue to boost the need for infrastructure investment worldwide furthermore cash strapped governments have increasingly turned to the private sector to fund and operate these projects most of brookfieldâ s investment dollars however have flowed into the energy patch new drilling techniques have unlocked vast swaths of oil and natural gas across north america production growth however has far outpaced the available infrastructure needed to actually move and process all of this energy according to management the investment universe for energy infrastructure tops 150 0 billion in the united states alone and because the sector has fallen out of favor on wall street competition for new deals has dwindled this shortage of capital has resulted in tidy returns for investors making it a great place to put more money to work â the scale of the north american natural gas market is unparalleled given the massive transformation weâ ve seen over the last 10 years â ceo sam pollock told investors in a recent conference call â both supply and demand are at all time highs requiring substantial amounts of infrastructure to help move and store this commodity â in sum wall street projects brookfieldâ s fund flows from operations per share to grow by about 15 per year management intends to fund most of this expansion internally through a combination of retained earnings and asset sales this conservative approach though less exciting should result in better more predictable returns for unitholders for shareholders all of this should translate into a growing income stream since the partnershipâ s inception in 2008 brookfield has boosted its distribution at a 10 compounded annual clip that type of track record demonstrates managementâ s commitment to rewarding unitholders and the power of high quality infrastructure assets data by ycharts following the most recent dividend increase brookfield units now pay a forward yield of 5 3 assuming a distribution growth rate between 7 and 8 per year the middle of managementâ s guidance units should deliver a total return in the low teens annually that more than meets my hurdle rate for such a wonderful wide moat business the big risk here interest rates because brookfieldâ s cash flows resemble bond coupons units compete directly with fixed income securities for capital if rates rise traders will likely dump their units for safer returns in the bond market moreover the partnership also owns a lot of assets abroad that means the value of the profits generated from those businesses declines if the u s dollar strengthens that said i would look at any sell off from higher interest rates as a buying opportunity and while a strong greenback has certainly hurt recent results those fluctuations tend to even out over time bottom line i love dividend hikes but i love promises for future dividend hikes even better when a management team flat out says they plan to keep raising the distribution that signals an enormous amount of confidence in the future income investors should take notice

it is as if the country has been waging total war on itself vital operational centers are malfunctioning because routine maintenance has been neglected and investment discouraged mexico city the world has witnessed many sharp economic declines over the years but venezuela s is surely one of the worst to date the country has experienced a loss of real inflation adjusted gdp greater than that of most war ravaged countries during world war ii and its inflation rate is expected to reach 10 000 000 percent this year at well over 100 times the black market rate the official exchange rate depreciates so rapidly that a quote has lost its meaning by the time it is published under these conditions food 90 percent of which must be imported is so scarce that the average venezuelan is estimated to have lost 24 pounds 10 9 kilos and an estimated three million venezuelans representing around 10 percent of the population have fled power outages water and medicine shortages and near famine have been persistent features of president nicolás maduro s brutal and incompetent reign until the 1960s venezuela s per capita gdp was the highest in latin america at around 80 percent that of the united states today it is under 30 percent and also well below that of chile brazil mexico and colombia for comparison in 1990 colombia s per capita gdp was about half that of venezuela with the world s largest oil reserves venezuela counts on hydrocarbons for over 90 percent of its export earnings but its oil output has fallen from a peak of about 3 5 million barrels per day in the late 1990s to around 1 3 million in 2018 with production expected to decline to 700 000 in the next couple of years in fact even when the oil price has been rising the country s output has declined owing to a lack of maintenance and investment theft of material maduro s appointment of inexperienced military allies as managers and the outmigration of oil workers who can earn much more elsewhere an oil worker at petróleos de venezuela sa pdvsa the state owned oil company recently told the wall street journal that he earns around 8 00 per month adjusted for purchasing power parity venezuela s plight is largely self inflicted despite rising oil prices the chavist regime allowed fiscal deficits to bulge to 24 percent of gdp in 2014 and since oil prices were still near their peak that year those deficits have been financed by printing money leading to accelerating inflation making matters worse the government has imposed price controls so severe that retailers are required to sell their goods at a loss beyond these clumsy attempts to regulate economic activity the regime s increasingly brutal crackdown on dissent and erosion of the country s democratic institutions have made matters even worse under maduro s watch basic services have ceased functioning in 2016 government workers were told to show up for just two days per week in order to conserve electricity the country suffered mass power outages anyway in january maduro held his second inauguration after winning a fraudulent presidential election last may in response many latin american countries along with canada the us and some european union member states have recognized the speaker of the national assembly juan guaidó as venezuela s legitimate president in accordance with the country s constitutional line of succession in addition the us a major market for venezuelan oil exports has sanctioned the maduro regime frozen its bank accounts and directed payments by us companies for venezuelan oil into a new account that will be made available to guaidó in the face of mass protests maduro has continued to resort to the intimidation imprisonment and starvation of opposition figures while bribing military leaders for their support yet the question is not whether maduro can hang on but for how long his regime cannot last indefinitely and when it falls venezuela will have pressing needs for starters the country will require humanitarian aid on a vast scale hospitals must be resupplied schools reopened and public transportation and other vital services restored and food must be made available to a severely undernourished population at the same time venezuela will need reforms to end rampaging inflation restore macroeconomic stability and revive economic activity it will also require financial support to import supplies and repair machinery and equipment this applies not just to oil production but to all economic sectors rebuilding venezuela will be a long process in wartime production tends to fall because the enemy disables key infrastructure such as railroad junctions and power generation facilities in venezuela it is as if the country has been waging total war on itself vital operational centers are malfunctioning because routine maintenance has been neglected and investment discouraged for more than a decade the challenge then is to restore a stable macroeconomic environment and business climate while simultaneously improving the lot of venezuelan citizens so that they will continue to support political reforms this would not be easy even in a country that has been far less ravaged than venezuela one hopes that venezuela s next leaders and the international community understand the nature of the challenge and will take the steps needed to maintain social peace during the reconstruction venezuelans can finally see light at the end of the tunnel but difficult days lie ahead anne o krueger a former world bank chief economist and former first deputy managing director of

the first time i couldn t buy food at the grocery store i was 15 years old it was 2014 in caracas venezuela and i had spent more than an hour in line waiting when i got to the register i noticed i d forgotten my id that day without the id the government rationing system would let the supermarket sell my family the full quota of food we needed it was four days until the government allowed me to buy more this was fairly normal for me all my life i lived under socialism in venezuela until i left and came to the u s as a student in 2016 since the regime in charge imposed price controls and nationalized the most important private industries production plummeted no wonder i had to wait hours in lines to buy simple products such as toothpaste or flour and the shortages went far beyond the supermarket the excuses for these shortages were hollow in reality venezuela has the largest proven oil reserves in the world to use for electricity and three times more fresh water resources per person than the united states the real reason my family went without water and electricity was the socialist economy instituted by the dictators hugo chavez and nicolas maduro the welfare programs many minimum wage hikes and nationalizations implemented by their regimes resulted in a colossal government deficit that the central bank covered by simply printing more money leading to rampant inflation now prices double every few weeks and the standard of living continues to plummet i watched what was once one of the richest countries in latin america gradually fall apart under the weight of big government even though so many of us venezuelans fled to america to escape from the destructive consequences of socialism liberal politicians like sen bernie sanders i vt and rep josé serrano d n y have praised the same kind of policies that produced famine mass exodus and soaring inflation in venezuela even worse in recent weeks democratic representatives ilhan omar ro khanna and tulsi gabbard have mischaracterized the current protests against maduro and condemned president trump s widely supported moves to help end maduro s dictatorship additionally many congressional democrats support medicare for all and the green new deal proposals that would nationalize the health insurance industry guarantee everyone who wants it a job and massively raise taxes increasing government intervention in the economy like few countries except cuba and venezuela have seen before proponents think that they can give all americans quality health care housing and everything for free and that somehow politicians can do a better job at running a business than the business owners themselves these proposals would skyrocket the budget deficit and national debt which just reached a record 22 trillion if that is not enough rep alexandria ocasio cortez endorsed paying for the proposal by asking the federal reserve to print money this is exactly what produced venezuela s nightmare still the liberal economist paul krugman recently argued in a column that whenever you see someone invoking venezuela as a reason not to consider progressive policy ideas you know right away that the person in question is uninformed dishonest or both i can assure mr krugman that i m neither uninformed nor dishonest of course it s true that neither medicare for all nor a wealth tax alone would turn the united states into venezuela overnight no single radical proposal would do that however if all or most of these measures are implemented they could have the same catastrophic consequences for the american people that they had for venezuela english isn t even this kid s native language but 20 year old daniel di martino has written an article for usa today in which he talks about how socialism has destroyed his home country of venezuela di martino offers a warning to americans who are carelessly thinking of tumbling off the same cliff not that our native crop of socialists will heed this warning it s something of a sad running joke that people who defect from leftist run countries end up being ignored by the pc leftie crowds in the countries to which they emigrate di martino is impressively articulate for a young man his age especially given that he s not a native speaker of english true his words may have undergone some editing and proofreading but he s a college student who can t afford to hire professional word groomers for every single thing he writes i e he probablyas fluent as he sounds i wish peopleheed his warning but i m not hopeful an excerpt be sure to read the rest when i was 20 i was studying in europe skating by on an easy class schedule hiking local swiss mountain trails and feeling little to none of the burdens of responsibility that a kid like di martino must be feeling i wasn t particularly engaged with the world except perhaps in some distantly touristy sense living in europe wasany depth i gained from the experience of being abroad came much later and my interest in politics wasn t kindled until the misguided 2003 invasion of iraq by the us at 20 i was shallow and callow the author of this article puts me to shame and i m filled with

new york as wall street braces for the first quarterly decline in earnings in nearly three years some investors are wondering if the market is factoring in a bigger erosion in profit margins than will actually come to pass reuters reported forecasts for u s earnings after a big boost from corporate tax cuts in 2018 are falling sharply in 2019 but revenue forecasts remain relatively robust leaving an expected spike in costs as the main reason for profitability to weaken but some strategists say there is little evidence yet of such cost pressures and that margins may hold up better than expected companies since the 2008 trauma have made it a top priority to maintain and increase if possible their profit margins said ed yardeni president and chief investment strategist of yardeni research we don t expect that labor compensation and other costs will squeeze margins nor do we expect that an increase in those costs will boost prices he added rather we are betting on improving productivity besides the tightening labor market the trade war between the united states and china and the stronger u s dollar are among the biggest potential risks to corporate margins this year for the first quarter analysts are forecasting a year over year s p 500 earnings decline of 0 5 percent according to ibes data from refinitiv second quarter earnings are still expected to grow 3 5 percent though that estimate also is down sharply from the start of the year the drop in forecasts has led to talk of a profit recession defined as at least two consecutive quarters of year over year earnings declines the last u s profit recession ran from july 2015 through june of 2016 projected revenue for s p 500 companies has been more resilient with first quarter revenue growth estimated at 5 3 percent based on refinitiv s data credit suisse strategists said profit margins are holding up better than the estimates suggest at least for the majority of s p 500 companies they said profit margins are eroding sharply for several heavily weighted companies including apple exxon mobil and chipmakers like micron technology which are skewing data for the entire s p benchmark index a recent drop in oil prices has hurt margins for energy companies a slowdown in the semiconductor business cycle has hit companies in that space and other firms have boosted investment expenses said patrick palfrey senior equity strategist at credit suisse securities in new york it s not a broad based macro issue he said when you look at the median company we see margins quite stable moreover worries that a tight labor market will drive up wages have been limited in earnings calls for the fourth quarter reporting period which is nearing an end goldman sachs strategists wrote in a note on wednesday that while some companies are feeling the pressures of rising wages more consumer facing companies including discover financial services viewed the trend as a positive for consumer spending also they wrote most management teams expected growth in the u s economy to moderate but remain positive while the labor market has been tightening other measures of inflation have not moved much in the 12 months through january the u s consumer price index rose 1 6 percent the smallest gain since june 2017 according to u s data released on wednesday though slower than 2018 u s economic growth was forecast to average 2 4 percent this year according to a reuters poll of economists when the overall economy is relatively strong that typically means there s still sufficient demand for products and it helps stabilize margins in general said keith lerner chief market strategist atsuntrust advisory services in atlanta georgia

this is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated washington d c thirty years ago there were 12 european countries that had a net wealth tax a type of levy on personal net assets which can include anything from investments to cars jewelry and collectibles today only three of these countries continue to impose such a tax which has often proven to be an ineffective way to generate revenue and redistribute wealth while european countries have been doing away with this policy a number of progressive democrats in the us have begun floating this as a solution to narrowing the gap between the rich and the poor in france the solidarity tax on wealth or isf was created in 1982 under socialist president françois mitterrand targeting individuals with fortunes over 3 million francs the equivalent of some 517 000 today the law was abolished and reinstated over the years and the threshold was changed as well last year under president emmanuel macron france became the latest european country to shed a comprehensive wealth tax in an effort to halt the flight of wealthy families and attract others who may be seeking a new home in light of britain s impending departure from the european union macron followed through on his campaign promise to scrap the isf and replaced it with a tax on real estate over 800 000 euros bank accounts investments automobiles yachts even antique gun collections are now exempt for many french citizens who are asset rich but cash poor the wealth tax had become increasingly onerous as they were forced to come up with hundreds of thousands even millions of euros in liquid currency to pay the tax man each year macron has sought to ease the tax burden in france and usher in reforms from an optics point of view it didn t help that macron scrapped the wealth tax and proposed tax cuts for businesses while planning a tax hike on a gasoline in an effort to address climate change the move fueled macron s image as a president of the rich and contributed to the anger of yellow vest protestors that has spilled into the streets erupted at times in violence and shaken the foundations of his government in the us democrats like elizabeth warren have proposed their own visions of a possible wealth tax warren s proposal would levy a 2 tax on a family s net worth in excess of 50 million with an additional 1 tax on net worth that exceeds 1 billion my ultramillionairetax would make the richest tippy top 0 1 of americans start doing their part for the country that helped make them rich warren claimed in a tweet after announcing her candidacy but wealth taxes are not always effective they may impact business creation and risk taking the administrative costs of enforcing a wealth tax and the risks of driving wealthy taxpayers elsewhere also pose serious challenges according to a 2018 organisation for economic cooperation and development report more importantly the report states wealth taxes often failed to meet their redistributive goals as a result of their narrow tax bases as well as tax avoidance and evasion france is a classic case study of these problems about 42 000 millionaires left france between 2000 and 2014 according to the financial paper les echos many of them decamped to other countries like belgium or portugal which boasts a flat tax rate of just 28 on income from interest and investments for expats and no wealth tax eugenio carreira a french accountant pointed out to me that an estimated 15 000 french expatriates have taken up residence in portugal many of them eager to flee the french tax system pierre françois taittinger of the famed champagne house said the french tax system forced his family to sell a controlling stake of the taittinger brand to the american investment firm starwood capital in 2005 half of my family left france because of taxes taittinger told the washington post in 2006 they now live in england belgium and other countries where they were warmly welcomed unlike here one french tax consultant eric pinchet estimated that the wealth tax earned the government some 2 6 billion a year but cost it more than 125 billion in capital flight every year from 1998 to 2006 the main reason macron decided to do away with the wealth tax in what could turn out to be a politically catastrophic decision was to lure families like the taittingers and their fortunes back to france doing so was also part of a wider attempt to make the country more attractive to british businesses financial firms and their wealthy managers after brexit with the potential to create thousands of jobs for french workers yellow vest protesters took to the streets again on saturday and macron has sought with little success to show them that tax cuts can lead the country down a path to more investments and jobs and even without the wealth tax french citizens are still saddled with a slew of others we are champions of the tax smiled carreira who then proceeded to list a value added tax vat taxes on all earnings interest and capital gains and a fuel tax that leaves gas at the pump approaching 6 per gallon there s also an inheritance tax and certain habitation taxes which macron has endeavored to peel away this brings us back to one key warning from the oecd when it comes to levying a wealth tax it s not an efficient way to generate revenue or redistribute wealth in countries that already have robust income inheritance and gift taxes the us already imposes these and an additional wealth tax would likely backfire from both an efficiency and equity perspective there are limited arguments for having a net wealth tax on top of broad based personal capital income taxes and well designed inheritance and gift taxes the oecd concludes how badly do american voters want to take from the wealthy and live with the consequences i should point out that i myself am not even close to being subjected to any wealth tax still i ve seen a close up of the negative consequences in france and other neighboring countries considering the pitfalls of the wealth tax in european countries it seems that the us would be foolhardy to follow in their footsteps commentary from journalist david a andelman
microsoft founder bill gates waits to play table tennis during the berkshire hathaway annual meeting weekend in omaha nebraska may 7 2017 reuters rick wilking ros krasny i bloomberg bill gates is concerned about the high budget deficits being run by the u s and said if taxes are ultimately increased to make up the shortfall then it s appropriate for wealthy people to pay much higher taxes we only collect about 20 percent of gdp and we spend like 24 percent of gdp so you can t let that deficit grow faster than the economy the world s second richest man said during an interview on cnn s fareed zakaria gps broadcast on sunday the u s national debt climbed past 22 trillion in the past week proposals have circulated recently for the richest americans to again face a top marginal tax rate of 70 percent as they did during much of the 1970s before it was lowered by president ronald reagan and for other wealth focused measures to be taken to address rising income inequality in the u s freshman democratic representative alexandria ocasio cortez of new york has suggested tax rates as high as 60 or 70 percent on the tippy tops on your 10th million dollar but gates said that approach didn t work well in practice progressive taxes even when that rate was high the actual collection because of ways people could defer wasn t never got above 40 percent actually the microsoft corp co founder said if you go about doing this additional collection of course you want to be progressive you want the portion that comes from the top 1 percent or top 20 percent to be much higher he said the big fortunes if your goal is to go after those you have to take the capital gains tax which is far lower at like 20 percent and increase that taxing capital gains income and ordinary income at the same rates would get rid of a lot of complexity said the philanthropist who has a net worth of 97 2 billion according to the bloomberg billionaires index hedge funds tend to try to shift their tax liabilities over to the capital gains column and so you would simplify that gates said no free lunch other tax plans put forth recently include one by senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts a 2020 democratic presidential contender for a 2 percent levy on household wealth in excess of 50 million and 3 percent on wealth above 1 billion and senator bernie sanders of vermont has proposed raising the estate tax on wealthy americans as he considers a second run for the white house overall expanding government programs was fine but it just emphasizes there s no free lunch here you d have to collect more money the tech billionaire said gates and his wife melinda have set up a private foundation the bill and melinda gates foundation had 51 billion in endowment assets as of the end of 2017 from 1994 to 2017 the couple has given more than 35 8 billion to their foundation he said he d been the biggest proponent of having the estate tax collect more money it was at 55 percent it s now down from that with a much bigger deduction widening deficit the u s budget deficit widened to 319 billion in the first three months of the government s fiscal year as spending increased and revenue was little changed the treasury department said on feb 13 the shortfall grew by 42 percent between the october to december period compared with the same three months the previous year america s national debt is projected to keep rising surpassing an annual 1 trillion by 2022 according to the congressional budget office fueled in part by president donald trump s 1 5 trillion tax cut package and government spending increases the trump administration and republican lawmakers who passed the 2017 tax plan said the measures would boost economic growth offsetting the loss of tax revenues

society athens more than 8 ½ years long greece s economic crisis shows signs of abating but not the cost of it especially in the despair that combined with near destitution for people suffering pension cuts wage reductions and slashed benefits has perpetuated another in mental health care that was illustrated in a new york times feature showing the often irreversible and deadly effects for those who couldn t cope and became victims of depression and in too many cases suicide that was case for a woman the paper identified as anna 68 whose husband a retired bus driver killed himself in a park two years after repeated pension cuts perpetuated by the ruling radical left syriza after prime minister alexis tsipras said he would halt them he kept saying i ve worked so many years what will i have to show for it how are we going to live said anna who spent the time after her husband s death in therapy and now is volunteering to help others struggling with mental health issues the mental health crisis has slipped under the radar under the weight of the country s trying to deal with an invasion of refugees and migrants unrelenting political and financial scandals and infighting a coming election and tsipras claims he s bringing a recovery depression and suicide rates rose dramatically during the crisis that began in 2010 when greece sought what turned into three international bailouts of 326 billion euros 367 37 billion that came with brutal pay cuts tax hikes and slashed pensions austerity say health care budgets cut back too with public hospitals not even having toilet paper or paper towels patients needing to hire private nurses and psychiatric hospitals overwhelmed and understaffed mental health has deteriorated significantly in greece with depression being particularly widespread as a result of the economic crisis dunja mijatovic the council of europe s commissioner for human rights said in a november report the paper noted that has led to overcrowding at psychiatric hospitals and clinics and a 40 percent increase in suicides from 2010 to 2015 the report said with few safety nets for those who don t know how to handle what s in their heads the greek mental health research institute found links between austerity and depression the news site vice reported in july 2015 six months after tsipras took over and with his government then locked in intense negotiations with european creditors for what turned into a third bailout this one for 86 billion euros 96 95 billion and more austerity in 2008 only 3 3 percent of the population showed symptoms of clinical depression which is a state that needs to be treated with medication in 2008 that percentage was doubled by 2013 12 3 percent of the greek population had shown symptoms it was reported the mental health organization klimaka reported a 30 percent rise in calls to its suicide hotline last year and a comparable rise in visits to its day center the financial crisis has increased people s vulnerability to suicide kyriakos katsadoros klimaka s director told the times some even ask about euthanasia suicide was a rare occurrence in greece and even with the spike during the crisis it is relatively low in europe with five per 100 000 people compared with a region wide average of 15 4 according to world health organization data for 2016 but the rate of increase is high jumping from 3 3 per 100 000 to 5 between 2010 to 2016 the biggest jump came during the tumultuous 2015 when tsipras vowed to create a leftist revolution throughout europe and the country seemed headed for an exit from the eurozone which could have brought even more devastating consequences for the populace the church view many suicides in greece go unreported because of the orthodox church s reluctance to provide burial services to those who take their own lives although the church s stance is changing nongovernmental organizations said according to the paper the greek health ministry set up a committee of mental health experts in november to prepare awareness campaigns as well as plans to train general practitioners to better detect depression and other mental health issues the extent of the state s help at evangelismos one of the capital s largest state hospitals dozens of patients were being treated in the corridors of the psychiatric ward during a visit in april an unacceptable situation the council of europe s anti torture committee said in a report published in june in the summer the hospital s workers union complained to a prosecutor that the clinic was accommodating twice the maximum capacity with fold out beds set up in corridors and in doctors offices it s like a stable dr ilias sioras president of the union told the paper adding that people in all states catatonic and psychotic were being treated in the same space dromokaiteio psychiatric hospital in athens saw admissions jump 12 3 percent in 2017 with weary staff members going on fruitless strikes to protest conditions at dafni the attica psychiatric hospital which takes only serious cases the impact of the economic crisis is reflected in the admissions the director spiridoula kalantzi citing a 9 6 percent increase in 2017 told the paper the council of europe noted that unemployed persons bankrupt businessmen or parents who have no means of taking care of or feeding their children were among new admissions to psychiatric units most age 40 and older with no previous signs of mental illness the health ministry ran a pilot program at hospitals in athens last year to insure major areas of the capital had at least one psychiatric hospital or clinic operating as a walk in center at any given time helping admissions to stabilize at dafni and dromokaiteio last year three new clinics opened in greek hospitals in 2018 the ministry said and there are plans for 16 more in the meantime much of the burden falls to greece s three main psychiatric hospitals dafni dromokaiteio and the psychiatric hospital of thessaloniki which in addition to providing health care fills the void left by cuts to social services apart from the psychiatric cases we have social cases too said dr nektarios drakonakis of dafni people come they say i don t have a home i don t have papers i don t have relatives i don t have anywhere to go what the government did provide crucially was free access to health care for uninsured patients has been an invaluable safety net said ms kalantzi the dafni director when the delirium begins many lose control of their finances and then lose their insurance she said
it didn t come as a huge surprise when jeff bezo s announced that amazon would be scrapping its hq2 plans in new york city politicians had already lined up to fight against the move not to mention being horrified at what amazon wanted in return for moving to long island city amazon s breakup with new york was still fresh when other cities started sending their own valentines to the online giant officials in newark new jersey one of the 18 finalists that amazon rejected in november when it announced plans to put its new headquarters in new york and northern virginia sent a giant heart that read nj newark still love u amazon representatives of other jilted suitors such as chicago and suburban maryland tried to get amazon s attention and say they re still interested in a relationship too the love notes came even though amazon said it doesn t plan to pick a new city to replace new york where the hq2 project was supposed to produce 25 000 jobs instead the company said it will spread some of those jobs around at other amazon sites in the u s and canada and expand its existing new york offices but why woo a company that says it s not interested for one the allure of potential jobs is just too much to pass up for many politicians said nathan jensen a university of texas government professor who has criticized how economic development incentives are used and even if amazon spurns them this is a low risk way for politicians to show they are looking out for their constituents the losing cities can continue to publicly talk about everything they are doing for hq2 even if they know they don t have a shot if they know hq2 isn t coming there is no real cost to doing this jensen said more than 230 municipalities in north america competed for hq2 taking part in a months long bidding war that amazon eagerly fomented cities offered billions in inducements in new jersey state and local governments put 7 billion in incentives on the table as part of the newark bid new york ultimately won the competition by promising nearly 3 billion in tax breaks and grants in addition to access to the nation s media and financial capital and its educated workforce but on valentine s day amazon abruptly canceled the project after running into fierce opposition to those incentives from lawmakers and political activists on the left that shows that the company cared little about getting community input said richard florida an economic development expert after searching across 200 plus communities and identifying ny and greater dc as the places it needed to be it pulls out as soon as local residents and politicians question the billions in incentives it does not need and asks it do more for the community florida said in an email florida and jensen predicted some cities will now begin to push back when companies seek tax subsidies but greg leroy executive director of the nonpartisan think tank good jobs first said there is little likelihood that will happen any time soon look this is deeply learned behavior leroy said there s an 80 plus year history to this tax break industrial complex in the meantime the mayor of warren michigan posted online about his town being available upstate new york cities like rochester made it clear they too are open for business nassau county welcomes your investment and would like to discuss siting your project here state sen todd kaminsky a long island democrat told the company amazon s stormy week ends with a new york diss it s been a complicated few weeks for amazon what with its abrupt pullout from a massive new york city development extortion claims related to intimate photos taken by its founder jeff bezos and increasing antitrust scrutiny in europe for now these events seem unlikely to pose much threat to amazon s brand or business but they re indicative of the mounting challenges the e commerce giant faces as it grows ever larger and more dominant amazon s turn in the spotlight is a natural consequence of its prominence in retail entertainment and internet infrastructure wedbush securities analyst dan ives said as you get bigger and more successful you have more of a target on your back he said few analysts believe thursday s reversal in new york or the previous week s dust up with the publisher of the national enquirer will have much impact on consumer enthusiasm for amazon s broad product selection and services or its fast shipping bezos has accused the enquirer of extortion and blackmail for threatening to disclose revealing personal photos unless he ended his private investigation into how the tabloid obtained his private exchanges with his mistress investors don t appear particularly concerned that these issues will distract the hard driving bezos who is also in the midst of a divorce generally considered one of life s most stressful events even if bezos were to find his attention otherwise occupied evercore isi analyst anthony diclemente notes that the amazon chief has a trusted senior leadership team in place that gives investors comfort he said amazon shares have more than made up a brief drop after bezos made his public case against the enquirer last week public anger at tech companies has been growing for some time but much of it has been focused on facebook and other tech companies that collect vast amounts of personal user information for targeting online ads and other purposes facebook s privacy issues have been particularly acute since they involve the company s core business said paul argenti a dartmouth college professor of corporate communication amazon isn t immune to the tech backlash but argenti said the company s popularity with consumers won t likely be affected by recent headlines i m not going to stop ordering my movies and packages from them and i think that s the way most people will look at it he said longer term issues however could present a more serious threat amazon s new york investment would have put 25 000 jobs in the long island city neighborhood of queens at a cost of nearly 3 billion in tax breaks local activists called that a corporate giveaway one made even less palatable by amazon s anti union stance that grass roots rebellion suggests that people are growing more skeptical of big tech companies especially when government is cutting them special deals said blair levin a policy adviser to new street research and a former chief of staff to a federal communications commission chairman time and time again the public has seen promises made and reality is different he said so they re going to be skeptical of amazon and it s across the board not just amazon several european nations are also investigating amazon s alleged anti competitive activity on thursday austria s antitrust agency said it is reviewing complaints that the company is favoring its own products and discriminating against other sellers on its e commerce site german antitrust authorities and the european commission are investigating amazon for similar claims in the u s politicians are also speaking out against amazon s practices said barry lynn executive director of open markets an institution that studies corporate monopolies in the u s lynn argues that amazon is a monopoly that should be more heavily regulated by the government he pointed to comments sen elizabeth warren a massachusetts democrat who is running for president made last year about amazon s anti competitive practices the word is out the discussion is ongoing lynn said it s not going to go away it s only going to get louder amazon responded friday with a statement emphasizing the breadth of its business and its small market share of global retail sales for shoppers everything is business as usual and the bad news will quickly blow over dartmouth s argenti said we won t be talking about this a year from now maybe not even a month from now he said will amazon s pullout affect new york city s tech future amazon jilted new york city on valentine s day scrapping plans to build a massive headquarters campus in queens amid fierce opposition from politicians angry about nearly 3 billion in tax breaks and the company s anti union stance with millions of jobs and a bustling economy new york can withstand the blow but experts say the decision by the e commerce giant to walk away and take with it 25 000 promised jobs could scare off other companies considering moving to or expanding in the city which wants to be seen as the silicon valley of the east coast one of the real risks here is the message we send to companies that want to come to new york and expand to new york said julie samuels the executive director of industry group tech nyc we re really playing with fire right now in november amazon selected new york city and crystal city virginia as the winners of a secretive yearlong process in which more than 230 north american cities bid to become the home of the seattle based company s second headquarters new york mayor bill de blasio and gov andrew cuomo heralded the city s selection at the time as the biggest boon yet to its burgeoning tech economy and underscored that the deal would generate billions of dollars for improving transit schools and housing there s a real risk that amazon s decision does make it more difficult for big companies who want to take those really big bets on new york to take them said julie samuels the executive director of tech nyc which represents more than 650 tech companies in the area in its pitch to amazon to come to new york mayor bill de blasio cited the city s diversity of talent and connections with established industries beyond tech including finance fashion media art and real estate those attributes have been luring amazon s fellow titans for years and have helped create a sector that now counts more than 326 000 jobs according to tech nyc when you attract and grow a strong engineering and entrepreneurial base those folks would have worked at amazon and eventually they would have left amazon and started new companies samuels said people move around from job to job so i actually think this is really unfortunate for tech companies that are already here google which opened its first office outside of california in new york in 2000 last year pledged to invest more than 1 billion for a new manhattan campus the expansion will allow the alphabet inc unit to double its workforce in the city to 14 000 over the next decade twitter inc facebook inc and uber technologies inc also all have big offices in new york and apple inc has plans to expand in the city too amazon which already has 5 000 employees in town said thursday it will continue to build its presence in the city over time opposition came swiftly though as details started to emerge critics complained about public subsidies that were offered to amazon and chafed at some of the conditions of the deal such as the company s demand for access to a helipad some pleaded for the deal to be renegotiated or scrapped altogether we knew this was going south from the moment it was announced said thomas stringer a site selection adviser for big companies if this was done right all the elected officials would have been out there touting how great it was when you didn t see that happen you knew something was wrong stringer a managing director of the consulting firm bdo usa llp said city and state officials need to rethink the secrecy with which they approached the negotiations community leaders and potential critics were kept in the dark only to be blindsided when details became public it s time to hit the reset button and say what did we do wrong stringer said this is fumbling at the 1 yard line amazon said in a statement thursday that its commitment to new york city required positive collaborative relationships with state and local officials and that a number of them had made it clear that they oppose our presence and will not work with us to build the type of relationships that are required to go forward not that amazon is blameless experts say joe parilla a fellow at the brookings institution s metropolitan policy program said the company s high profile bidding process may have stoked the backlash companies usually search for new locations quietly in part to avoid the kind of opposition amazon received they had this huge competition and the media covered it really aggressively and a bunch of cities responded parilla said what did you expect it gave the opposition a much bigger platform richard florida an urban studies professor and critic of amazon s initial search process said the company should have expected to feel the heat when it selected new york a city known for its neighborhood activism at the end of the day this is going to hurt amazon said florida head of the university of toronto s martin prosperity institute this is going to embolden people who don t like corporate welfare across the country other tech companies have been keeping new york city s tech economy churning without making much of a fuss google is spending 2 4 billion to build up its manhattan campus cloud computing company salesforce has plastered its name on verizon s former headquarters in midtown and music streaming service spotify is gobbling up space at the world trade center complex despite higher costs new york city remains attractive to tech companies because of its vast diverse talent pool world class educational and cultural institutions and access to other industries such as wall street capital and madison avenue ad dollars no other metropolitan area in the u s has as many computer related jobs as new york city which has 225 600 according to the bureau of labor statistics but san francisco san jose seattle washington boston atlanta and dallas each have a greater concentration of their workers in tech in the new york area the average computer related job pays roughly 104 000 a year about 15 000 above the national average still that s about 20 000 less than in san francisco even after cancelling its headquarters project amazon still has 5 000 employees in new york city not counting whole foods new york has actually done a really great job of growing and supporting its tech ecosystem and i m confident that will continue samuels said today we took a step back but i would not put the nail in the coffin of tech in new york city
by staff feb 18 2019 8 31 am 26 comments post a comment e mail the author posted to state transportation true vote bass nhi chion wolf wnpr lamont left weicker that didn t take long gov ned lamont reversed one of his campaign pledges saturday just five weeks after taking office he announced that he is proposing to institute highway tolls for all drivers despite a campaign promise to consider tolls only for trucks lamont argued that he has discovered that there s no more fiscally responsible way to fund the billion dollar investments needed to upgrade the state s transportation system progressive democrats said the same thing during the campaign he acted on advice given by a transportation study group he set up after winning election in november he was told that 40 percent of toll revenues will come from out of staters lamont has also chosen to reduce the state s debt load which ruled out borrowing for transportation improvements he also ruled out increasing the gas tax noting that those revenues are falling lamont s plan which would need legislative approval could include ez pass discounts for in state drivers in doing the abrupt about face lamont was repeating history the last time connecticut elected a governor from greenwich lowell p weicker in 1990 weicker promised on the campaign trail that he didn t plan to institute an income tax he said it would be like pouring gasoline on a fire for the economy he then immediately proposed one after he said wrestling with a top budget aide for hours trying to discover any realistic alternatives progressive democrats said the same thing about needing a stable new revenue source in the income tax during the campaign lamont distributed an opinion article to connecticut media saturday explaining his toll decision it appears below followed by a statement from state senate minority leader len fasano fasano wasn t pleased a path forward on tolling by gov ned lamont i recently announced a reinvigorated economic development team whose mission it is to promote and champion connecticut to businesses who wish to locate or grow here on paper we have it all access to world class talent equidistant between boston and new york without the exceptionally high cost of living vibrant cultural and educational institutions but our reputation in one area in particular precedes us and not in a good way our economic development team must be prepared to answer the question that everyone who knows anything about connecticut will ask what about the congestion on your highways beyond an inconvenience the crushing congestion we experience on i 95 i 91 i 84 and the merritt parkway in particular is a real challenge we must address and overcome if we are to maximize our economic development potential our proximity in mileage to new york city means nothing if it takes 90 minutes to get there from stamford on the road and over an hour by train we need to not only maintain our aging transportation infrastructure but it s high time that we upgrade it too the gasoline tax simply does not provide the reliable revenue we need period gasoline tax revenues have been flat for 10 years and are expected to begin declining as cars become more efficient and as the sales of electric vehicles increase as such i do not support raising the gas tax as it is already high compared to our peers some people have espoused priority bonding where we further cut back on economic development and other bonding in favor of transportation as i recently announced connecticut is in dire need of a debt diet and as such i cannot support this type of borrowing to pay for ongoing and continuous repairs and upgrades it is not sustainable or wise the legislature previously established a bond cap and i know they appreciate how important keeping to our debt discipline is i understand how controversial electronic tolling is as i learned about the issue i indicated my support for tolling only tractor trailer trucks as they do in rhode island this would provide at least some revenue to maintain our system though not enough to upgrade it while we are awaiting a ruling from the courts regarding truck only tolling our attorneys are pretty certain that if permitted the tolling could only be done on specific bridges and the generated revenue would be reserved for those bridges not for congestion pricing assuming our attorneys are correct the truck only option provides too little revenue too slowly and too piecemeal to make a meaningful difference i know there are proposals in the legislature that include tolling for cars and trucks i would only consider this option if we maximized the discount for connecticut ez pass users and or offered a frequent driver discount for those who are required to travel our major roadways on a frequent basis we have been subsidizing our neighboring states road repairs by paying their tolls and it s estimated that out of state drivers would provide nearly 50 percent of our tolling revenue as well as needed we could also consider an increase in the earned income tax credit or reduction in gas tax to mitigate the costs of tolling on the everyday user we have modeled out both options in the budget i will submit to the legislature on wednesday as my co equal branch of government i am open to a real discussion with them as well as connecticut s residents about the state of our transportation system and what will be needed going forward not only to make repairs but to truly put connecticut in a position of strength when it comes to infrastructure upgrades and bold economic visioning however there is no doubt in my mind that our transportation fund will require additional strategic and recurring revenues in the very near future in my opinion there is no way around that hard fact forward thinking economic development demands that among other transportation needs we speed up our rail service from hartford to new haven new haven to stamford and stamford to new york city with more frequent service to waterbury and new london these transportation upgrades are the building blocks of our economic future and we must formulate a real sustainable plan to start now fasano statement on gov lamont s plans to propose tolls on all connecticut residents governor lamont s announcement that he will be proposing tolls on all connecticut residents is a disappointing step backward it s a false choice of tolls versus no tolls when in fact other solutions to properly fund transportation do exist in addition telling people not to worry because residents will only have to pay discounted tolls is a disingenuous attempt to curtail criticism currently residents do not pay any tolls in connecticut so you can tout a discount all you want but the truth is families are going to be paying more than they already do today if tolls are installed in addition the formula for tolls is simple the number of cars on the road times the toll rate gives you a total amount of funding that means rates will have to be set at a level that results in the desired revenue you can say you are giving someone a discount but the reality is in order to achieve the desired profits we are all going to be paying a high rate per mile to generate those funds the money has to come from somewhere and that somewhere is state taxpayers overall i am disappointed that governor lamont appears to be dismissing other proposals to boost transportation funding without even a conversation i am concerned that a public private partnership was not put on the table especially when the administration has the experience knowledge and expertise in financial and economic matters that could allow connecticut to develop a public private option at the very least to be discussed by stakeholders lawmakers and the public to ignore other options without even a conversation seems like the shadow of a prior administration we hoped was behind us

voronezh wasn t cutting it artyom had been out of college for four years and job openings in the southern russian city were sparse last fall in search of better employment opportunities he headed north to st petersburg but the journey wasn t cheap i needed money for the move an apartment and for daily expenses before i found work says artyom who asked to be identified by his first name only so artyom opened a credit card account to finance the move three months later the 26 year old is already struggling to pay off the card s 24 percent interest rate while his mechanical engineering degree helped him land part time work fixing household appliances the inconsistent gigs don t bring in enough earnings and the debts are beginning to pile up now he s looking for a new loan to pay off the card artyom s situation isn t unique last year according to the moscow based united credit bureau okb personal loans grew by 46 percent compared to 2017 amounting to 8 6 trillion rubles 130 billion many were hoping to refinance existing debts the number that approached st petersburg s credit bureau no 1 to do so doubled in 2018 a company spokesperson told the moscow times in an effort to boost a stalling economic recovery russia s central bank lowered interest rates to promote cheaper lending for the many russians whose incomes were stagnating leaving them struggling to cover their daily expenses turning to the banks proved attractive this behavior is quite rational says dmitry polevoi chief economist of the russian direct investment fund at the same time the debt burden has reached a record high totaling 26 percent of the population s annual income looking up in the wake of the 1998 financial crisis russians began signing up for credit en masse in the mid 2000s once the country s oil boom was in full swing there was a steady increase in purchasing potential combined with a sharp growth in inequality says grigory yudin an economic sociologist at the higher school of economics a big slice of the russian population was looking upward and felt that they too had a moral right to this wealth that reason was why artur fagdeyev began opening credit card accounts in 2010 i figured that i d be able to lead a better lifestyle he says and for nearly a decade the 42 year old electrician didn t mind that he had become saddled with debt then he and his wife had a baby and fagdeyev decided it was time to turn things around he took out a loan last year at a better rate to pay off his cards which carried interest rates of 29 9 percent but the interest rate on the new loan was so much lower 15 percent that the leningrad region resident figured he could use another telling himself that he would only use the funds for necessities i hadn t had the money to get a new car in a long time fagdeyev says and i need a good one because i m often driving around small villages with horrible roads because of my work but he didn t stop there he soon took out yet another loan and this time he didn t follow his new principles i used it to build myself a banya he says sheepishly referring to a russian bathhouse st petersburg s credit bureau no 1 says it has seen a spike in customers hoping to refinance previous loans denis vyshinsky tass yudin explains such spending behavior by pointing to the demonstrative spending of russia s rich they buy castles houses here and there yachts wineries expensive fur coats he says of course most russians can t afford this but they want to show off something too following western imposed sanctions resulting from russia s 2014 annexation of crimea from ukraine however russians spending decreased as the country s economy stagnated at the same time inequality kept growing yudin says according to a 2018 report by credit suisse russia is the most unequal of the world s major economies with 89 percent of the country s wealth owned by its richest 10 percent the motivation to borrow money didn t go away he says indeed in addition to refinancing previous debt last year s lowered interest rates gave consumers a window to buy what they could not afford during the previous four years economists say according to an okb spokesperson cash advances 50 percent and credit cards 63 percent saw the largest growth last year people borrow money for different reasons says roman korotayev director of the legal firm revers in the urals city of berezniki for houses for cars for their businesses but many people also use it on stupid things like iphones or fur coats or vacations or what have you last fall a bbc russian service article described the trend of russians going into debt for showy weddings and the segment of the russian population that is taking on the bulk of such loans yudin notes is by far the poorest you ll find families that are using 50 percent of their income to pay off credit he says and without stable jobs this can turn into a catastrophe for them bottoming out the bulk of korotayev s clients find themselves in such situations turning to him to declare bankruptcy often after having taken on one too many lines of credit unexpected life changes like a job loss or a spouse s death can begin a vicious cycle of debt korotayev says unsurprisingly then last year s spike in personal loans coincided with a spike in declarations of bankruptcy yulia kombarova general director of the st petersburg based legal bureau no 1 says the firm saw a 30 percent increase in bankruptcy claims in 2018
columnists michael hicks a year ago my center colleagues and i met with staff from accelerating indiana s municipalities to consider several different issues facing indiana over the coming years among the leading issues they asked us to study was housing that is the genesis of a housing study published by ball state last week the results will be surprising to many hoosiers our study examined more than 20 years of home prices construction costs and other factors that influence new home construction across all indiana counties the chief finding of the study is that the traditional economic factors of supply and demand explain nearly all new home construction in indiana s counties in short in a world where markets often do not work well housing is a place where markets set home prices and quantities very effectively the problem is that many folks don t like those market outcomes this will be especially hard for many groups who have been arguing that there is a shortage of housing in many corners of the state that view is mistaken and it doesn t take sophisticated economic models to debunk the notion of a housing shortage in indiana after all the u s census reports more than 300 000 vacant homes across our state there are enough vacant single family homes to house almost one third of all hoosiers more from michael hicks local newspapers are key in reporting corruption the truth is that indiana has the exact opposite of a housing shortage the excess supply of homes in the state is a meaningful economic drag on communities in particular the excess stock of housing suppresses the value of existing homes this has become the real housing problem both in indiana and across much of the midwest there are decades of economic research on the issue the excess in homes is largely caused by outmigration in many places the problem is actually so acute that in 62 of indiana s 92 counties the average home is worth less than it would cost to rebuild in those counties new speculative home construction has essentially stopped in fact in only 12 indiana counties is it clearly profitable to build a new speculative home that is why across the state new home construction remains around half of what it was in the two decades before the great recession now many realtors will argue that these vacant homes don t matter because they aren t really part of the real estate market no one they argue will buy them they are about half right no one is likely to buy them but they are part of the real estate market just the same the problem is that they have a zero or lower value of course if these homes were located in downtown chicago or atlanta they d be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars each and would attract an equal amount of renovation dollars that no one will buy them speaks forcefully about their value and sadly the value of other homes in those counties that offers a tough reckoning for much of our state of course not all the news is bad one factor that likely keeps housing less expensive in indiana is the absence of very restrictive land use policies like those that afflict parts of california this will continue to act as a magnet for younger households as long as the other fundamentals are strong to be clear home prices reflect fundamental factors of supply and demand our study describes how factors such as school quality low crime rates and nice neighborhoods influence home prices we also estimate how large the effects of population change the size of the county negative or positive price shocks and labor market conditions contribute to new home construction we also provide maps of other issues of importance such as vacancy rates and rental market conditions our study also makes policy recommendations we believe municipal governments should understand the fundamentals of housing before embarking on efforts to subsidize new construction we also think that stabilizing middle class communities and eliminating blight should be a growing focus of state and local government mostly we argue it is important to stick to fundamentals low housing values are likely due to underlying problems within communities fixing these problems will most likely solve most housing woes however some places may need additional resources to fix the problem we recommend a broad reform of tif that would make it less costly to communities but more available for addressing housing problems we also argue that the state s property tax rules likely contribute to rental shortages and the astonishing over supply of vacant homes this may be remedied by public policy but it ll take a summer study commission to fully evaluate alternatives housing is a tough emotional issue across much of indiana still for most places the problems have been mis diagnosed housing markets work very well and housing fundamentals determine both price and quantity of new housing stock if housing market results aren t doing what you want in your neighborhood its best to focus on the fundamentals schools amenities and community characteristics michael hicks is the george and frances ball distinguished professor of economics and the director of the center for business and economic research at ball state university

this is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated washington d c thirty years ago there were 12 european countries that had a net wealth tax a type of levy on personal net assets which can include anything from investments to cars jewelry and collectibles today only three of these countries continue to impose such a tax which has often proven to be an ineffective way to generate revenue and redistribute wealth while european countries have been doing away with this policy a number of progressive democrats in the us have begun floating this as a solution to narrowing the gap between the rich and the poor in france the solidarity tax on wealth or isf was created in 1982 under socialist president françois mitterrand targeting individuals with fortunes over 3 million francs the equivalent of some 517 000 today the law was abolished and reinstated over the years and the threshold was changed as well last year under president emmanuel macron france became the latest european country to shed a comprehensive wealth tax in an effort to halt the flight of wealthy families and attract others who may be seeking a new home in light of britain s impending departure from the european union macron followed through on his campaign promise to scrap the isf and replaced it with a tax on real estate over 800 000 euros bank accounts investments automobiles yachts even antique gun collections are now exempt for many french citizens who are asset rich but cash poor the wealth tax had become increasingly onerous as they were forced to come up with hundreds of thousands even millions of euros in liquid currency to pay the tax man each year macron has sought to ease the tax burden in france and usher in reforms from an optics point of view it didn t help that macron scrapped the wealth tax and proposed tax cuts for businesses while planning a tax hike on a gasoline in an effort to address climate change the move fueled macron s image as a president of the rich and contributed to the anger of yellow vest protestors that has spilled into the streets erupted at times in violence and shaken the foundations of his government in the us democrats like elizabeth warren have proposed their own visions of a possible wealth tax warren s proposal would levy a 2 tax on a family s net worth in excess of 50 million with an additional 1 tax on net worth that exceeds 1 billion my ultramillionairetax would make the richest tippy top 0 1 of americans start doing their part for the country that helped make them rich warren claimed in a tweet after announcing her candidacy but wealth taxes are not always effective they may impact business creation and risk taking the administrative costs of enforcing a wealth tax and the risks of driving wealthy taxpayers elsewhere also pose serious challenges according to a 2018 organisation for economic cooperation and development report more importantly the report states wealth taxes often failed to meet their redistributive goals as a result of their narrow tax bases as well as tax avoidance and evasion france is a classic case study of these problems about 42 000 millionaires left france between 2000 and 2014 according to the financial paper les echos many of them decamped to other countries like belgium or portugal which boasts a flat tax rate of just 28 on income from interest and investments for expats and no wealth tax eugenio carreira a french accountant pointed out to me that an estimated 15 000 french expatriates have taken up residence in portugal many of them eager to flee the french tax system pierre françois taittinger of the famed champagne house said the french tax system forced his family to sell a controlling stake of the taittinger brand to the american investment firm starwood capital in 2005 half of my family left france because of taxes taittinger told the washington post in 2006 they now live in england belgium and other countries where they were warmly welcomed unlike here one french tax consultant eric pinchet estimated that the wealth tax earned the government some 2 6 billion a year but cost it more than 125 billion in capital flight every year from 1998 to 2006 the main reason macron decided to do away with the wealth tax in what could turn out to be a politically catastrophic decision was to lure families like the taittingers and their fortunes back to france doing so was also part of a wider attempt to make the country more attractive to british businesses financial firms and their wealthy managers after brexit with the potential to create thousands of jobs for french workers yellow vest protesters took to the streets again on saturday and macron has sought with little success to show them that tax cuts can lead the country down a path to more investments and jobs and even without the wealth tax french citizens are still saddled with a slew of others we are champions of the tax smiled carreira who then proceeded to list a value added tax vat taxes on all earnings interest and capital gains and a fuel tax that leaves gas at the pump approaching 6 per gallon there s also an inheritance tax and certain habitation taxes which macron has endeavored to peel away this brings us back to one key warning from the oecd when it comes to levying a wealth tax it s not an efficient way to generate revenue or redistribute wealth in countries that already have robust income inheritance and gift taxes the us already imposes these and an additional wealth tax would likely backfire from both an efficiency and equity perspective there are limited arguments for having a net wealth tax on top of broad based personal capital income taxes and well designed inheritance and gift taxes the oecd concludes how badly do american voters want to take from the wealthy and live with the consequences i should point out that i myself am not even close to being subjected to any wealth tax still i ve seen a close up of the negative consequences in france and other neighboring countries considering the pitfalls of the wealth tax in european countries it seems that the us would be foolhardy to follow in their footsteps commentary from journalist david a andelman

amazon announced thursday that it is backing out of plans to open a new headquarters in new york city blaming state and local politicians who had opposed our presence and will not work with us the retail giant announced in november it would build a campus in the long island city neighborhood of queens for 25 000 employees fueled by 3 billion in state and city incentives to amazon after much thought and deliberation we ve decided not to move forward with our plans to build a headquarters for amazon in long island city queens the company statement said many activists said the project would worsen congestion in the area and lead to gentrification and higher housing prices the company put the blame for its decision squarely on the shoulders of politicians who had objected to the development and been critical of city and state leaders for offering amazon huge tax subsidies for amazon the commitment to build a new headquarters requires positive collaborative relationships with state and local elected officials who will be supportive over the long term new york gov andrew cuomo a booster of the amazon deal expressed anger that a small group of politicians put their own narrow interests above their community the amazon decision will prove costly to the state s economic future and the best interests of the people of this state the governor said in a statement but city council speaker corey johnson aimed his ire at amazon saying new york rejects vulture capitalism i look forward to working with companies that understand that if you re willing to engage with new yorkers and work through challenging issues johnson said in a statement i hope this is the start of a conversation about vulture capitalism and where our tax dollars are best spent new york mayor bill de blasio also blasted the retailer and said other businesses will fill any void from its canceled plans instead of working with the community amazon threw away that opportunity we have the best talent in the world and every day we are growing a stronger and fairer economy for everyone the mayor said state sen michael gianaris a democrat who represents the long island city neighborhood where amazon would have been said the company s action speaks for itself today s behavior by amazon shows why they would have been a bad partner for new york in any event according to gianaris rather than seriously engage with the community they proposed to profoundly change amazon continued its effort to shake down governments to get its way and u s rep alexandria ocasio cortez a democrat whose district borders long island city celebrated amazon s withdrawal i think it s incredible she told reporters in washington d c it shows that everyday americans still have the power to organize and fight for their communities she discounted the potential loss of amazon s promised 25 000 jobs saying that taxpayers would have had too subsidize those jobs the city was paying for those jobs in its announcement last year that it was coming to queens amazon said it was also building hubs in northern virginia and nashville now it will apparently focus its growth there and in its other existing locations with no plans to replace the now defunct new york project we do not intend to reopen the hq2 search at this time we will proceed as planned in northern virginia and nashville and we will continue to hire and grow across our 17 corporate offices and tech hubs in the u s and canada the company said nashville mayor david briley quickly assured his constituents thursday that amazon s plans to open an operations center with 5 000 jobs are still in place with no connection to the new york decision similarly in virginia arlington county board chairman christian dorsey said nothing has changed after speaking with an amazon representative earlier today we have confirmed that we are moving forward as planned with amazon s upcoming headquarters in arlington dorsey said earlier this week siena college released findings of a poll that showed that a clear majority of new york state residents approved of the amazon deal 56 percent to 36 percent and residents of the five boroughs were in favor 58 percent to 35 percent there was clear support for this siena college research institute director don levy told nbc news on thursday it s always tough to guess how angry people will be and how it s going to last but i think it s going to last awhile cynthia nixon who ran unsuccessfully against new york gov andrew cuomo in last year s democratic primary hailed amazon s stunning reversal amen the actress turned politician tweeted the fight against amazon laid bare their union busting corporate welfare ice abetting practices and shows why we need to break up monopolies like amazon zephyr teachout who ran unsuccessfully for state attorney general last year and nixon both accused amazon of working with law enforcement to develop facial recognition technology that could gather information from customers without them knowing it now let s get a congressional hearing on amazon labor ice monopsony how and why to break up amazon teachout tweeted just after amazon s announcement i know some people ready to testify amazon s stock price closed at 1 622 65 a share down 1 06 percent correction feb 14 2019 4 17 p m et a previous version of this article misstated the month in which amazon announced it would be building a campus in new york city it was in november not december
alexandra yoon hendricks the sacramento bee after months of planning stockton has sent debit cards loaded with 500 to a select group of residents as part of a closely watched experiment in universal basic income the first led by a u s city stockton once dubbed america s foreclosure capital was the largest city to seek bankruptcy protection before detroit s 2013 filing during the recession unemployment soared toward 20 percent and violent crime rose today one in four residents lives below the poverty line according to the u s census bureau now as the city slowly recovers from financial disarray officials and advocates look to the stockton economic empowerment demonstration or seed to provide insight on whether a long term basic income program is a viable creative approach to lifting residents out of poverty also in the news the need has only been reiterated in the last few weeks of preparation seed director sukhi samra said folks are ready to use this money to pay bills to save for the future to pay off debt and pay for medicine each month for 18 months 130 adults living in the city s lower income neighborhood will receive 500 to spend however they want researchers with seed will track study and analyze how the income boost affects residents spending and saving habits and how it influences other factors such as quality of life and financial stability the money for the program comes from a 1 million grant from the economic security project a network organization that has raised 10 million to fund and explore universal basic income programs and their viability i think the program will make people work better and smarter and harder mayor michael tubbs told npr last year we re not just designed just to work all day and run a rat race we re designed to be in community to volunteer to vote to raise our kids and i think the more inputs and investments we can give in people to do those things the better off we are as a community last year 4 200 letters were randomly sent to individuals living in areas with a median household income at or below 46 033 the city s median at the time that approach let the program target poorer communities while allowing selection of a diverse pool of participants samra said the only other eligibility requirement was that participants be at least 18 years old from the respondents seed selected a group of 130 recipients taking into account the city s gender age and racial diversity samra said researchers will regularly check in with recipients to conduct quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews how are people feeling how are people spending money are people spending more time with families how are health outcomes changing samra said the idea of universal basic income is simple giving money to everyone regardless of income level or employment status with no restrictions on the expenditures as wages particularly for low skilled workers have failed to keep up with inflation and experts warn technological developments in nearby silicon valley herald an artificial intelligence revolution that could make many low wage jobs obsolete universal basic income has gained attention as a policy idea to address wealth inequality in california u s sen kamala harris proposed a bill last year what would provide middle class and working families a tax credit of up to 6 000 a year that could be accessed as a monthly check of up to 500 gov gavin newsom has said he supports pilot universal basic income programs more former hospital worker gains 1m plus in discrimination verdict several other countries conducted similar cash transfer experiments including finland and canada tech incubator y combinator conducted a feasibility study in oakland that gave a few dozen residents between 1 500 and 2 000 beginning in 2016 and will soon conduct an expanded trial involving 1 000 people across two u s states but uc berkeley public policy and economics professor hilary hoynes said interpretations of what constitutes success for a universal basic income pilot program vary will more individuals be able to shift toward jobs pursuing their interests with fewer worries about living paycheck to paycheck or will fewer people work in the labor market all together and is that a good thing both programs in finland and canada have ended with no plans to continue or expand moreover to implement a feasible universal basic income program hoynes said policymakers and advocates would need to grapple with whether payments should be pegged to income levels whether when you earn 20 000 or 60 000 or 100 000 governments start tapering out benefits for example a universal payment of 12 000 per year to each adult u s resident over age 18 would cost roughly 3 trillion per year reads a new national bureau of economic research working paper by hoynes and uc berkeley professor jesse rothstein still hoynes said there could be benefits to a pilot program such as seed to better understand what recipients spend their money on and the long term effects of modest income increases on educational or employment decisions in spite of its sample size and short duration hoynes isn t convinced universal basic income will be the solution to mass unemployment spurred by an artificial intelligence revolution but she does believe the concepts are helpful in discussions about wage stagnation among low skilled workers for samra seed is doing just that fostering a dialogue to help reimagine social welfare and benefit programs for americans seed has already contributed to that conversation and re conceptualizing what dignity is and not tying to work she said around deservedness and the poor and the working poor seed hopes to feature the stories of some recipients beginning in march the program will run until august 2020
mexico city mexico will inject 3 9 billion into ailing state oil company pemex officials said on friday promising to strengthen its finances and prevent a further credit downgrade although investors saw the plan as only a short term fix falling oil output corruption and high labor costs have contributed to the decline of the company that was once a symbol of national pride it now holds roughly 106bn in financial debt the highest of any national oil company in latin america fitch and moody s rate its credit one notch above junk fitch said on friday that the plan which includes additional tax cuts more government spending on the company and debt refinancing would likely not be enough to prevent continued deterioration in pemex s credit quality the agency cited an ongoing significant level of underinvestment for pemex pemex will receive 1 8bn in pension liability monetisation as part of the new plan and finances will be helped by a corruption clampdown officials said in a presentation that was short on details they vowed the mexican government will not take on new debt in 2019 pemex must make more than 27bn in debt payments over the next three years investors said they had expected stronger measures and while encouraged by government vows of support they said the plan offered only short term relief the measures are not a long term fix and won t be enough to stabilise oil output said edward glossop latin america economist at capital economics if oil prices and output decline further he estimated yields on pemex bonds could rise by around 1 per cent this year the price fell after the announcement for pemex s most heavily traded bond on friday maturing in 2047 as its yield rose 14 basis points according to marketaxess data the price on a pemex bond maturing in 2024 also dropped with its yield up 32 basis points reflecting bondholder skepticism of the plan what s more the measures will do little to shore up pemex s standing with the ratings agencies said julie murphy a latin america analyst at jp morgan we are extremely disappointed with the measures she said the mexican peso weakened by more than half a percent against the dollar after the announcement before recovering later on friday do what it takes over time pemex taxes will go down and the capital injection will allow debt refinancing over the year finance minister carlos urzua told a press conference if pemex requires more help the government will do whatever it takes to keep pemex s finances healthy he added published in dawn february 17th 2019
by john rubino doug noland s weekly credit bubble bulletin is always required reading the latest befitting the amazing things that have happened lately is more necessary than usual but at 10 000 words it s also a lot longer than usual so while everyone should definitely read the whole thing here are some excerpts to get you started i wonder if the fed is comfortable seeing the markets dash skyward the small caps up 16 4 y t d the banks 15 9 the transports 15 2 biotechs 18 5 and semiconductors 17 0 or perhaps they re quickly coming to recognize that they are now fully held hostage by market bubbles similarly i ponder how beijing feels about january s booming credit data aggregate financing up 685 billion in the month of january do officials appreciate that they are completely held captive by history s greatest credit bubble bubbles have become a fundamental geopolitical device a stratagem things have regressed to a veritable global financial arms race as china u s trade negotiations seemingly head down the homestretch each side must believe that rallying domestic markets beget negotiating power meanwhile emboldened global markets behave as if they have attained power surpassing mighty militaries and even nuclear arsenals china s banks made the most new loans on record in january totaling 3 23 trillion yuan 477bn as policymakers try to jumpstart sluggish investment and prevent a sharper slowdown in the world s second largest economy january s record china new bank loans were 11 4 higher than the previous record from january 2018 and 15 above estimates total bank loans expanded 13 4 over the past year 28 in two years 45 in three years 91 in five years and an incredible 323 over the past decade the san francisco fed put out a white paper about the benefits of negative interest rates i hope that s not where we re going but we can only cut rates about 225 250 bps to be at zero kyle bass hayman capital management at 4 37 30 year conventional mortgage rates are today already below the lowest levels from 2009 and with the vast majority of borrows over recent years having refinanced at historically low mortgage rates there s limited prospects for reduced monthly payments to dampen financial burdens during the next recession worse yet student loan debt has more than doubled since the crisis and when the next recession hits there will be record amounts of auto and credit card debt auto lending in particular has gone through a protracted arguably unprecedented period of loose lending a record 7 million americans are 90 days or more behind on their auto loan payments even more than during the wake of the financial crisis era among subprime borrowers those with credit scores below 620 the delinquency rate was 16 3 in mid 2018 a car loan is typically the first payment people make because a vehicle is critical to getting to work and someone can live in a car if all else fails when car loan delinquencies rise it is a sign of significant duress among low income and working class americans when it comes to bubbles the more conspicuous they are the less likely they are to be deeply systemic the tech bubble was obvious yet the most egregious excess was contained within the technology sector the mortgage finance bubble was much more systemic with excesses spread about and not as apparent i believe today s super tech bubble is much more systemic than back in 2000 today s bubble in leveraged lending and m a is greater than 2006 2007 the bubble in corporate credit dwarfs that from the mortgage finance bubble period excesses throughout the securities markets phenomenally exceed those from the prior bubble period moreover i suspect the current level of derivatives related speculative leverage could be multiples of 2007 thinking ahead to the next recession we should de deeply concerned about our nation s tenuous fiscal position to see deficits approaching 5 of gdp with unemployment and interest rates at such historically low levels should have us all fearful of course deficits matter when it comes to a synchronized global policy response keep in mind that ecb and boj policy rates are basically at zero with little evidence of benefits from negative rates the ecb just ended qe while the boj just keeps printing with little effective ammo policymakers exploit what they can to sustain the bubble and hold fragilities at bay policymakers continue to throw enormous stimulus at global markets and economies instead of stabilization we ve witnessed ongoing bubble inflation and intensifying monetary disorder and the more bubbles inflate the greater the underlying financial and economic fragilities and the quicker the fed was to conclude normalization and china was to once again aggressively spur lending what worries me most is that underlying instability and vulnerabilities have policymakers resolved to abrogate bear markets and recessions extraordinary measures continue to be taken to nullify business and market cycles with apparently no appreciation for how vital adjustments and corrections are to sound financial and economic systems worst of all structurally maladjusted and

bill gates is concerned about the high budget deficits being run by the us and said if taxes are ultimately increased to make up the shortfall then it s appropriate for wealthy people to pay much higher taxes we only collect about 20 per cent of gdp and we spend like 24 per cent of gdp so you can t let that deficit grow faster than the economy the world s second richest man said during an interview on cnn s fareed zakaria gps broadcast on sunday the us national debt climbed past us22 trillion 30 8 trillion in the past week proposals have circulated recently for the richest americans to again face a top marginal tax rate of 70 per cent as they did during much of the 1970s before it was lowered by president ronald reagan and for other wealth focused measures to be taken to address rising income inequality in the us
the shopping center mall reit sectors has been routed over the last couple of years as worries about the brick and mortar retail space have led to massive share price declines in lower grade mall operators while higher quality landlords were punished too â just not as severely over the last three years shopping center reits have averaged a decline of 3 6 while regional malls were down 11 not all of the mall reits are created equal though there are large differences in terms of the quality of the assets that these reits own and there are large differences when it comes to balance sheet strength and liquidity taubman centers tco is one of the higher quality mall reits the company has strong fundamentals its assets are of high quality and the underlying performance of its malls is strong it looks like a relatively safe pick in this segment of the reit space shares offer a solid dividend yield and it seems likely that both its dividend as well as its share price will continue to grow in the long run company overview taubman centers is a real estate investment trust that owns leases develops and manages regional shopping centers it was founded in 1950 and is headquartered in bloomfield hills mi the company has a market capitalization of 3 0 billion right now which makes it one of the top 15 retail focused reits in terms of size and scale while it is active in several us states the company also owns assets in overseas markets such as south korea and china this is a positive differentiator as the international exposure provides some geographic diversification particularly because of the differences in characteristics of the retail landscape in the asian markets where taubman centers is active compared to the us the amount of retail square footage per capita in asia is much lower the shopping center reit industry and taubman centers peer group the united states is the nation with the largest per capita retail square footage raising the question of whether all of that retail space is really needed â and â if not â what will happen to the excess and how long before pricing becomes unattractive for a landlord source statista com other nations including large developed economies have much smaller retail space relative to their population sizes compared to the us this is due to the fact that there is a lot of geographic space in the us compared to countries such as spain italy and germany and also due to the fact that the us has always had a consumer driven economy the enormous size of the us retail space means that the us brick and mortar retail industry is somewhat vulnerable to store closures a threat that is amplified by the trend of online shopping the more consumers order from their homes or on the go the less they spend at brick and mortar stores this has led to a situation that some deem the retail apocalypse stores that are not profitable any longer are being closed which means that vacancy rates at certain malls and shopping centers are increasing this in turn puts pressure on the owners and operators of this retail space that is no longer needed not all shopping centers and malls are created equal however the trend is impacting lower grade malls and their owners operators more so than the higher quality malls with higher sales per square foot the reits that own higher grade and prime assets are less concerned about lower demand for retail space as most brands and retail companies still require and actively seek out retail space in great locations taubman centers together with peers such as macerich mac and simon property group spg belong to the group of high grade mall shopping center operators that have fared somewhat better than the sector overall while cbl associates cbl and pennsylvania real estate investment trust pei lost 34 and 26 respectively over the last three years taubman declined only 8 6 better than the 13 decline by macerich but trailing simon property s 1 5 return â the only mall reit with a positive 3 year return taubman centers high quality assets should allow for outperformance throughout the coming years taubman centers owns and operates a total of 26 malls with the majority of those being located in the us including puerto rico source taubman centers presentation the company s retail assets are located in california and on the east coast primarily with many of the shopping centers being located in attractive large cities it also owns two shopping centers in china and two shopping centers in south korea while it is not the largest retail reit its relentless focus on quality assets gives the company the premier portfolio in terms of the quality of its assets source taubman centers presentation 80 of taubman s malls are rated grade a whereas only 23 of us malls have a rating of a or better â an indication of the breadth and level of quality of its portfolio this makes taubman centers significantly less vulnerable to changes in the us brick and mortar retail industry and has allowed the company to report solid results on a consistent basis according to green street advisors it has the highest concentration of assets in the top 50 us markets while tenant sales per square foot continues to be one of the highest in the industry during the most recent quarter taubman centers delivered very strong results on several metrics its mall tenant sales per square foot rose by 5 8 comparable center net operating income rose by more than 9 during the quarter and it was able to grow its funds from operations adjusted for one time items by 22 compared to the prior year s quarter funds from operations per share rose to 1 01 which led management to increase its full year guidance to 3 76 3 84 robert s taubman the ceo of taubman centers pointed out that the company s newest assets in asia the cityon xi an china and the starfield hanam south korea continued to perform very well in terms of sales per square foot and net operating income taubman centers decision to move into the mall markets in these countries looks like a very smart move that positions the company for above average growth over the coming years taubman centers could expand its portfolio further in these countries where retail sales are growing at a higher pace compared to the us balance sheet strength as a competitive advantage during times of rising interest rates taubman centers has a very healthy balance sheet which is positive due to two reasons the company will be able to finance the acquisition and or development of new assets e g in asia easily at the same time rising interest rates and tougher debt markets will not be a major headwind for taubman centers whereas this could hurt more highly leveraged retail reits source taubman centers presentation taubman centers also has a very well laddered debt maturity schedule that will limit the impact of rising debt costs in the near future source taubman centers presentation only a small amount of debt matures during 2019 2021 and it is very likely that taubman centers will be able to refinance this debt easily 2022 will be a year of larger maturities but the majority of taubman centers debt matures beyond that the company s high quality assets and its strong balance sheet results in relatively low effective interest rate of less than 4 with attractive cost of capital taubman can readily make accretive acquisitions and or develop new assets while maintaining a relatively low bar for returns on investment â which can be a competitive advantage during the bidding process and or provide the company with a higher return than competitors burdened with higher costs of capital taubman centers stock looks attractively valued and provides a high income yield taubman centers expects to report ffo per share of 3 80 at the midpoint of management s guidance for fiscal 2018 during the upcoming earnings report with shares trading at 50 right now shares are valued at 18 to 19 times 2018 s affo which is quite undervalued in our opinion â considering the stock typically trades at a p affo of 25x investors also get a dividend yield of 5 2 which means that even in a no growth scenario â which we don t foresee â investors can potentially realize high single digit returns with slight multiple expansion plus the dividend if the company generates any growth then returns in the mid teens are very likely that is a very conservative assumption though as taubman centers should be able to grow its ffo per share consistently going forward through the opening acquisition of new assets and through ongoing growth in taubman centers net operating income at existing shopping centers q4 results the company delivered positive results across the board a clean sweep as they say comparable center net operating income noi including lease cancellation income up 4 4 percent for the year up 3 8 percent excluding lease cancellation income don t let the q4

despite the skepticism over the health of the stock market and warnings of an earnings recession stocks put in another very strong performance last week those who took short positions after the prior week s correction were sorely disappointed my advice last weekend was to not join the wall street bears and those that heeded my words last weekend should be doing well for the week the russell 2000 again led the market averages up 4 05 followed by a 3 84 gain in the dow jones transportation average the dow jones industrials were up over 3 while the s p 500 and nasdaq 100 were not quite as strong the dow jones utilities were down just slightly one development that did not get much attention last week was the new all time high in both the nyse all a d line and nyse stocks only a d line even though the nyse composite is still 5 2 below the late september high the advance decline analysis indicates that the nyse is now stronger than it was then the nyse all a d line peaked in august which i have been noting since fall 2018 and then formed a lower high when the nyse made a new high in september this bearish or negative divergence is a sign of weakness that was not reversed until the downtrend line b derived from the divergence was overcome in january this past week the nyse all stocks closed above the august high line a this action was supported by this week s new high in the weekly nyse stocks only a d line line c this is consistent with january s new high in the monthly s p 500 advance decline line which i discussed in early february see chart in a search of the weekend commentary this development was not mentioned which i find is a positive factor for the market bulls the bullish of individual investors according to the latest survey from the american association of individual investors aaii declined 4 8 points to 35 1 this is still below the long term average the bearish has risen to 25 07 from the prior week s low reading of 22 78 what about the market professionals according to the weekly investors intelligence survey just under 50 of market newsletters are bullish which is still well below the 61 8 that was reached just before the top in early october also in bank of america merrill lynch s latest survey of fund managers handling a total of 515 billion they reported that 44 of respondents said they were overweight cash a level not seen not seen since 2009 baml s data also indicated that their allocations to global equities was the lowest since september 2016 it is interesting that the weekly a d line made a new high that september it was subsequently followed by a 5 correction in october heading into the election a powerful rally got underway just after the election so while some may be nervous now based on the current low allocation to global equities a look back at september 2016 reveals that bearishness then was unfounded this low allocation may reflect traders distrust of the recent rally but as the market moves even higher there are fewer in the bearish camp the question now is how high the market must go before the remaining bears throw in the towel that is one of the many problems i have with those who favor a more fundamentals based approach to market analysis those that have been bearish throughout the rally or even just since the s p 500 overcame the 2650 level do not appear to have a price level that if reached would be evidence that they are wrong as part of any solid technical approach one should always have a price level that does just that and allows you to minimize the risk of course using technical methods one should be reducing the risk on long or short positions as the market moves in their favor therefore i was surprised at one high profile analyst who is arguing that those who bought the december lows will add to the market s pain and start selling once those lows are broken adding to the market s decline anyone who waited to sell until the lows are broken again is not demonstrating good money management and so of course those who let a 17 market gain turn into a loss will have trouble making money of course those who warn about the sky falling will be right at some point as a bear market will eventually happen there are also likely to be market corrections this year that will test the faith of the market bulls and give hope to the bears the weekly chart of the spyder trust spy shows that on a move above the widely watched resistance at 280 there is still strong resistance just a bit higher in the 281 282 area line a so if the spy does move above 280 and convinces the remaining bears that they have been wrong there is still further resistance above that level the weekly s p 500 a d line broke through resistance line c three weeks ago and continues to make new highs a similar trading range line b was completed in may which resulted in a seventeen week rally that peaked in early october there was a two week correction in june and i think a similar correction is likely this spring so traders and investors should not be complacent we may get a warning from the weekly charts before a meaningful correction so i hope you will read one chart formation you shouldn t ignore the invesco qqq trust qqq rallied in late trading friday but was weaker than the spy or ishares russell 2000 iwm throughout the day for example iwm was up 1 6 for the day while the qqq gained just 0 42 the weak action in all of the fang stocks was clearly a factor there is next resistance in the 175 area with stronger at 178 line a the a d numbers were much stronger than prices which bodes well for next week as the nasdaq 100 a d line moved sharply higher last week the a d line has first good support at its wma and then at the september high line b the energy sector select xle was the top performing major sector up over 5 for the week the april crude oil contract was up 5 4 for the week closing at its best level since mid november the weekly studies are positive so i still think a move to the 60 area is a possibility the economic numbers were mixed last week as the sharp 1 2 drop in retail sales hit the market on thursday the fact that it is not consistent with the most recent jobs report and other data suggest that this is a one month aberration it was positive that the cpi and ppi were lower last week consistent with the low inflation expectations the empire state manufacturing survey and consumer sentiment both came in better than expected there will be quite a bit on interest in tuesday s housing market index which is trying to recover after november s plunge there are fomc minutes out on wednesday with durable goods the philadelphia fed business outlook existing home sales and leading indicators on thursday the yield on the 10 year t note has been range bound lines a and b since the early january lows this looks to be a continuation or a pause in the trend of declining yields therefore another drop in yields looks likely the daily momentum based on the macd histogram is declining and only barely positive there are now fewer etf s that are coming out of bottom formations but there are a number of stocks that are just bottoming and show very positive chart formations an example last wednesday was dana corp dan which had a high in january 2018 of 34 53 and declined to a low of 12 65 in late december the stock had moved sideways after a strong four week rally the weekly relative performance and on balance volume had both completed bottom formations even though they were reporting earnings on friday i recommended dan and it closed up 10 4 on friday for those who were not in the market i recommended a four week dollar cost averaging plan just before christmas those that took my advice completed their last dollar cost average purchase on monday january 14 the other three purchases were made on 12 24 12 31 and 1 7 the average closing price of the s p 500 on these four days was 2497 i would sell 25 of the position on a move above 2805 for just slightly more than 12 profit but as long as the s p does not have a friday close below the qpivot at 2597 i would hold the remaining long positions in my viper etf report and the viper hot stocks report i provide my a d line analysis twice each week with specific buy and sell advice new subscribers receive six trading lessons for just 34 95 each per month
tsca fifra tri epa sued to issue pending methylene chloride prohibition rule on january 14 2019 in the u s district court for the district of vermont the vermont public interest group safer chemicals health families and two individuals plaintiffs followed up on their earlier notice of intent to sue and filed a complaint against andrew wheeler and epa to compel epa to perform its mandatory duty to address the serious and imminent threat to human health presented by paint removal products containing methylene chloride plaintiffs bring the action under tsca section 20 a which states that any person may commence a civil action against the administrator to compel the administrator to perform any act or duty under this act which is not discretionary plaintiffs allege that epa has not performed its mandatory duty under tsca sections 6 a and 7 tsca section 6 a gives epa the authority to regulate substances that present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment and tsca section 7 gives epa the authority to commence civil actions for seizure and or relief of imminent hazards plaintiffs argument to direct epa to ban methylene chloride is centered on the issue of risk to human health only however stating that it presents an unreasonable risk to human health as confirmed by epa under tsca section 20 b 2 plaintiffs are required to submit a notice of intent to sue 60 days prior to filing a complaint which they did on october 31 2018 on january 19 2017 epa issued a proposed rule under tsca section 6 to prohibit the manufacture including import processing and distribution in commerce of methylene chloride for consumer and most types of commercial paint and coating removal 82 fed reg 7464 epa also proposed to prohibit the use of methylene chloride in these commercial uses to require manufacturers including importers processors and distributors except for retailers of methylene chloride for any use to provide downstream notification of these prohibitions throughout the supply chain and to require recordkeeping epa relied on a risk assessment of methylene chloride published in 2014 the scope of which epa stated included consumer and commercial paint and coating removal the proposed rule stated that in the risk assessment epa identified risks from inhalation exposure including neurological effects such as cognitive impairment sensory impairment dizziness incapacitation and loss of consciousness leading to risks of falls concussion and other injuries and based on epa s analysis of worker and consumer populations exposures to methylene chloride in paint and coating removal epa proposed a determination that methylene chloride and nmp in paint and coating removal present an unreasonable risk to human health the comment period on the proposed rule was extended several times ending in may 2017 and in september 2017 epa held a workshop to help inform epa s understanding of methylene chloride use in furniture refinishing no further action was taken to issue the rule in final however until december 21 2018 when epa sent the final rule to the office of management and budget omb for review on the same day epa also sent another rule to omb for review titled methylene chloride commercial paint and coating removal training certification and limited access program which has not previously been included in epa s regulatory agenda very little is known about this rule plaintiffs do not refer to it in the complaint but there is speculation based on its title that this second rule may allow for some commercial uses of methylene chloride epa denies section 21 petition to increase reporting of asbestos on february 12 2019 epa published its december 21 2018 denial of a petition filed under tsca section 21 requesting that epa initiate rulemaking to amend the tsca chemical data reporting cdr rule to increase reporting of asbestos 84 fed reg 3396 epa denied the september 27 2018 petition on the grounds that the petitioners the asbestos disease awareness organization american public health association center for environmental health environmental working group environmental health strategy center and safer chemicals healthy families did not demonstrate that it is necessary to amend the cdr rule petitioners state that they support a robust and comprehensive risk evaluation of asbestos under tsca section 6 b followed by rulemaking to ban asbestos under tsca section 6 a petitioners requested initiation of a rulemaking under tsca section 8 a to amend the cdr rule according to the petition the requested cdr amendments would accomplish three purposes remove the exemption for cdr reporting for naturally occurring asbestos thereby requiring reporting on importation and use of asbestos and asbestos containing products in the u s lower the reporting threshold eliminate exemptions for impurities and articles and require reporting by processors to assure that epa has the information on asbestos necessary to meet its tsca responsibilities and determine that reports submitted on asbestos are not subject to protection as confidential business information cbi because disclosure is necessary to protect against an unreasonable risk of injury to health under tsca section 14 d 3 for more information see our memorandum epa publishes extension of review periods for tsca section 5 pmns snuns mcans and exemption notices on february 8 2019 epa published in the federal register its notice extending the review periods for all tsca section 5 premanufacture notices pmn significant new use notices snun microbial commercial activity notices mcan and exemption notices that were submitted to the agency under tsca section 5 before december 29 2018 and for which the review period had not expired as of december 29 2018 84 fed reg 2851 the notice states that epa requires an extension of the review periods to complete its risk assessments to examine its regulatory options and to prepare the necessary documents associated with the relevant determination under tsca section 5 a 3 the duration of the extension period is a total of 33 days but the notice states that because the extension is less than 90 days epa reserves the right under tsca section 5 c to issue for good cause future additional extensions for individual cases up to a total of 90 days more information on why epa has chosen to do this is in our blog item regarding the pre publication version of this notice epa extends review periods for tsca section 5 pmns snuns mcans and exemption notices due to lack of authorized funding and shutdown rcra cercla cwa caa sdwa phmsa epa releases three technical superfund site characterization guides epa has released three technical guides under the superfund program smart scoping for environmental investigations strategic sampling approaches technical guide and best practices for data management epa developed these documents to assist environmental professionals in scoping data management and strategic sampling activities at hazardous waste sites epa intends for the guides to strengthen superfund site characterization activities to facilitate stronger site remedy decisions and improved remedy performance among other objectives in the past six years epa s understanding of best management practices bmp for site characterization has grown through implementation of 2012 superfund national optimization strategy interaction with state and industry leaders engagement in lean processes and other relevant activities the guides highlight these bmps to help focus and streamline the site characterization process by presenting more efficient scoping investigation and data management approaches epa states the streamlining of these activities may reduce both time and costs during the remedial investigation feasibility study ri fs and throughout the superfund process the guides also address three of epa s july 2017 superfund task force recommendations recommendation 3 broaden the use of adaptive management at superfund sites recommendation 5 clarify priorities for ri fs resources and encourage performing interim early actions during the ri fs process to address immediate risks and recommendation 8 reinforce focused scoping which closely targets the specific for remediation and identify and use best management practice in the ri

guide document 11 100001799 and document 11 100001799 and strategic sampling approaches technical guide document 11 100001800 suit alleges epa has failed to update sdwa standards on january 30 2019 several environmental groups filed suit against epa alleging that it has neglected its responsibilities under the safe drinking water act sdwa waterkeeper alliance inc et al v u s environmental protection agency et al case no 1 19 cv 0089 the groups claim that epa has failed to revise national primary drinking water standards for currently regulated contaminants and to promulgate new standards for emerging ones as required by the sdwa the suit states that epa must review every national primary drinking water regulation every six years but has not done so for all contaminants the suit highlights epa s failure to not revise the standards for tetrachloroethylene or trichloroethylene even though it determined more than eight years ago that existing standards for these chemicals needed to be more protective the suit claims that epa is statutorily required to set standards for chlorite cryptosporidium haloacetic acids heterotrophic bacteria giardia lamblia legionella total trihalomethanes and viruses standards for chromium were also singled out by the environmental groups as warranting revision by epa in a sharply worded decision the u s district court for the d c circuit on february 4 2019 allotted one year for the u s chemical safety and hazard investigation board csb to promulgate final regulations requiring facilities to report accidental releases of chemicals the court took csb to task for its inaction on a statutorily required non discretionary action at issue is a requirement under the clean air act caa for csb to issue a release reporting rule specifically caa section 112 r 6 c iii requires csb to establish by regulation requirements binding on persons for reporting accidental releases into the ambient air csb issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking anprm on this requirement but never promulgated a proposed or final rule 74 fed reg 30259 june 25 2009 in air alliance houston et al v u s chemical and safety hazard board case no 17 cv 02608 apm the plaintiffs sued csb over its unreasonable delay in promulgating the final accidental release reporting rule the csb does not deny that its enabling statute requires to act the court found csb countered in two ways first it argued that the plaintiffs had no standing and second it stated that its failure to issue the rule did not constitute an unreasonable delay the court ruled neither argument has merit with respect to the unreasonable delay the court stated that 30 years have passed since congress enacted the csb s enabling statute and that it has been ten years since csb issued the anprm csb has not taken any action in the ensuing 10 years to promulgate reporting regulations the court stated emphasis in original in this case although the csb s enabling act does not require the agency to establish reporting regulations by a date certain there can be no doubt that the congressional directive to adopt such regulations is a discrete act that the csb is required to take the ruling stated in the past the csb readily conceded that a reporting regulation is clearly required by the statute the court added the court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and gave csb one year to promulgate the final rule while it is difficult to anticipate what form the release reporting regulation will take in the 2009 anprm the csb did identify four general approaches for implementing the statutory requirement a broad approach requiring the reporting of information on allaccidental releases subject to the csb s investigatory jurisdiction a narrower requirement to report basic information e g location date and time of incident chemical involved number of injuries for incidents that met significant consequence thresholds incidents that result in death serious injuries requiring in patient hospitalization large public evacuations very substantial property damage or acute environmental impact requiring owners or operators to report to the csb more extensive information on chemical incidents in their workplace when notified by the csb and basing the release reporting on the presence or release of specified chemicals and specified threshold amounts epa issues final rule adjusting civil penalty amounts epa on february 6 2019 promulgated a final rule adjusting for inflation the civil monetary penalty amounts under the statutes epa administers 84 fed reg 2056 the new maximum and minimum penalty levels vary by statute the new amounts will apply to all civil penalties assessed by epa on or after february 6 2019 for violations that occurred after november 2 2015 which is the date of enactment of the federal civil penalties inflation adjustment act improvements proposal to revise necessary and appropriate standard for mats rule published in federal register on february 7 2019 epa published in the federal register a revision to its response to the u s supreme court s decision in michigan v epa 84 fed reg 2670 the michigan v epa decision held that epa erred by not considering cost in its determination that regulation under caa section 112 of hazardous air pollutant hap emissions from coal and oil fired electric utility steam generating units egu is appropriate and necessary the rule known as the mercury and air toxics standard mats is too costly to justify epa states and thus no longer is appropriate and necessary epa stated it would count only the direct costs and benefits of reducing mercury and other toxic air pollutants under the mats in so doing it is abandoning the approach of considering the rule s co benefits such as reductions in particulate matter that are also achieved when reducing mercury emissions epa claims the direct costs to control mercury emissions at power plants greatly outweighed the benefits associated with reducing those pollutants despite this finding epa is not proposing to revise or remove the mats requirements epa s rationale for retaining the standards is that power plants have already spent money to put controls in place and are recovering those costs from their ratepayers epa is soliciting comment however on whether it has the authority or obligation to rescind the rule the proposed rule also states that epa has concluded its residual risk and technology review rtr of the mats rule and found no new developments in hap emission controls to achieve further cost effective emissions reductions therefore based on the results of these analyses and reviews epa states that no revisions to mats are warranted the comment period closes on april 8 2019 epa icr seeks comment on revising rcra hazardous waste manifest information collection requests icr issued by epa are typically pro forma notices alerting the regulated community that epa is submitting a federally required form to the government printing office gpo for renewal on february 8 2019 however epa issued an icr that more resembles a proposed rule as it would alter the information contained in the resource conservation and recovery act rcra hazardous waste manifest 84 fed reg 2854 epa is soliciting comment on three changes to the manifest 1 improving the precision of the waste quantities and units of measure reported on the manifest 2 requiring additional information for international shipments and 3 changing the manifest to make it easier to integrate data between the manifest and the biennial report required under rcra the comment period closes on april 9 2019 the proposed changes are summarized below improve precision of waste quantities and units of measure epa currently does not allow the use of decimals or fractions to denote the quantity of hazardous waste being shipped under a manifest instead generators are required to round partial units to the nearest whole unit or select smaller units of measure e g pounds instead of tons epa is proposing to allow those completing the manifest to list the quantities of wastes being shipped using decimals or fractions epa also is considering allowing the use of alternative units of measure such as ounces grams or milliliters that could more precisely report waste quantities the current set of units of measure specified in the manifest instructions are limited to gallons kilograms liters metric tons cubic meters pounds tons or cubic yards additional information for international shipments epa is soliciting comment on whether it should add a new field for consent numbers for import and export shipments current export regulations at 40 c f r section 262 83 c 3 require exporters to record the consent numbers on the manifest for each waste stream listed in item 9b of the manifest similarly import related regulations at 40 c f r section 264 71 a 3 i require u s facilities receiving hazardous waste from a foreign entity to record the relevant waste stream consent number from consent documentation supplied by epa to the facility for each waste listed on the manifest currently epa recommends listing the consent numbers in item 14 special handling instructions and additional information on the paper manifest form due to the lack of dedicated fields for listing such numbers for electronic manifests consent numbers are collected in e manifest for each waste stream as part of item 9b the u s department of transportation dot shipping description epa believes the addition of a separate data field to the paper and electronic manifest for consent numbers would facilitate the electronic upload or manual data entry of data from paper export and import manifests as the manifest would more clearly list the consent number for each waste stream epa also is considering revising the manifest to capture exporter epa identification numbers id number epa is proposing to require that it be the responsibility of the primary exporter to enter its epa id number on the manifest epa also is considering changes on how to incorporate new fields in the manifest for international shipments and how to incorporate export and import data for the movement document on the manifest for hazardous waste shipments entering the u s the regulations require that both an import manifest and a movement document accompany the shipment the movement document must accompany the shipment from the country of export to the delivery of the shipment to the receiving facility in the u s integration with electronic manifest and biennial report to comply with requirements under the electronic manifest establishment act epa is proposing to revise the paper manifest and continuation sheet to include source and form codes and density information the current manifest form already collects certain waste receipt data for biennial reporting but it does not provide biennial report data that describe how the hazardous waste originated source code nor does the paper manifest provide waste information about the physical form or chemical composition of the hazardous waste form code under epa s proposed changes certain hazardous waste generators would be required to enter source and form codes and density information on the manifest for each rcra waste listed on paper and electronic manifests epa acting administrator announces first ever comprehensive nationwide pfas action plan calling it a historic plan epa acting administrator andrew wheeler on february 14 2019 announced epa s per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas action plan the pfas action plan is intended to respond to extensive public interest and input epa has received over the past year and represents the first time epa has built a multi media multi program national communication and research plan to address an emerging environmental challenge like pfas epa s action plan identifies short term solutions for addressing these chemicals and long term strategies that it believes will help provide the tools and technologies states tribes and local communities need to provide clean and safe drinking water to their residents and to address pfas at the source the actions called for in the plan are as follows epa is moving forward with the maximum contaminant level mcl process under the sdwa for perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos by the end of this year epa will propose a regulatory determination which is the next step in the sdwa process for establishing an mcl epa will propose a regulatory determination which is the next step in the sdwa process for establishing an mcl epa has already begun the regulatory development process for listing pfoa and pfos as hazardous substances and will issue interim groundwater cleanup recommendations for sites contaminated with pfoa and pfos epa will use available enforcement tools to address pfas exposure in the environment and assist states in enforcement activities epa will propose to include pfas in nationwide drinking water monitoring under the next unregulated contaminant monitoring program the agency will also consider pfas chemicals for listing in the toxics release inventory tri epa will develop new analytical methods so that more pfas chemicals can be detected in drinking water soil and groundwater epa will develop a pfas risk communication toolbox that includes materials that states tribes and local partners can use to communicate effectively with the public epa and the corps publish revised waters of the u s definition on february 14 2019 epa and the u s army corps of engineers corps published in the federal register its highly anticipated proposed revised waters of the u s wotus definition that defines the scope of waters and wetlands that fall under federal clean water act cwa jurisdiction 84 fed reg 4154 epa corps previously released the text of the proposed rule in late december 2018 in pre publication format on epa s website along with several fact sheets and other supporting materials the proposed rule is now open for a 60 day comment period closing april 15 2019 the wotus definition has a several decade history of confounding both the regulated community and regulators tasked with implementing the rule nationwide over the years a series of u s supreme court decisions and agency guidance interpreting those decisions have fallen short of providing clarity and regulatory certainty the proposed rule if issued in final would supplant the 2015 wotus rule promulgated by the obama administration the 2015 wotus rule is the subject of ongoing litigation including three active challenges pending before u s federal district courts in north dakota georgia and texas in 2017 epa and the corps issued a proposed rescission of the 2015 wotus rule which has not been issued in final and is expected to be met immediately with legal challenges with the 2018 wotus proposed rule epa and the corps are aiming to correct purported legal deficiencies and ambiguities with the 2015 wotus definition and its predecessors some of the key elements of the 2018 proposal include but are not limited to inclusion of perennial and intermittent tributaries to traditional navigable waters retention of prior exclusions for groundwater prior converted cropland stormwater control systems groundwater recharge basins waste treatment systems and some wastewater recycling systems exclusion of ephemeral streams i e where water is present only in response to precipitation or snow melt and related features creation of a separate category of certain ditches that are jurisdictional requires adjacent wetlands to abut directly or have direct hydrologic surface connection to other jurisdictional waters to fall within the scope of wotus and eliminates subjective multi factor analyses of individual waters for jurisdictional determinations although changes to the wotus definition do not directly alter the cwa s various programs and permitting schemes including the cwa section 402 national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permitting program and the cwa section 404 wetlands dredge and fill permitting program wotus defines the scope of the waters and wetlands where compliance with npdes and 404 permits apply for this reason a broad cross section of industries from manufacturing to mining and agricultural are expected to be carefully considering the 2018 wotus proposal and filing comments likewise as in past wotus rulemakings environmental groups have already mounted extensive grassroots campaigns mostly critical of the 2018 proposal s scope as being too narrow and leaving waters unprotected earlier this week epa and the corps leadership received letters from over 160 house democrats and 36 senate democrats requesting an extension of the comment period on the 2018 proposal although in recent history epa has denied comment period extension requests the significance of the wotus definition may place added pressure on epa and the corps to provide additional time the senate letter requested a response from epa corps by february 25 2019 b c

intentionally added to mixtures used by consumers or professionals echa states due to their small size microplastics and nanoplastics even smaller particles that are created from the further degradation of microplastics may be readily ingested and thereby enter the food chain echa s proposed restriction targets intentionally added microplastics in products from which they will inevitably be released to the environment the proposed restriction would cover small typically microscopic synthetic polymer particles that resist bio degradation the scope would cover a wide range of uses in consumer and professional products in multiple sectors including cosmetic products detergents and maintenance products paints and coatings construction materials and medicinal products as well as

capture utilization and sequestration projects and carbon dioxide pipelines protecting america s workers act would amend osha on february 7 2019 representative joe courtney d ct a member of the house education and labor committee reintroduced the protecting america s workers act h r 1074 the legislation is intended to strengthen and modernize the occupational safety and health act osh act by giving the occupational safety and health administration osha tools to ensure that employers promptly correct hazardous working conditions protect whistleblowers from retaliation and hold employers accountable for violations that cause illness death or serious injury to workers congress has not meaningfully revised the osh act since lawmakers passed it in 1970 the bill would expand osha coverage to state and local government employees in 25 states it also would ensure that worker safety is protected in a timely manner by mandating that employers correct hazardous conditions while a citation for a serious willful or repeat violation is being contested currently the requirement to abate violations is stayed while a violation is litigated leaving workers in harm s way mr courtney s bill

death and serious injuries that occur within a place of employment democrats launch green new deal on february 7 2019 representative alexandria ocasio cortez d ny and senator ed markey d ma laid out the goals for their green new deal to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions in ten years the green new deal is a ten year plan to create a greenhouse gas neutral society that creates unprecedented levels of prosperity and wealth for all while ensuring economic and environmental justice and security according to a summary of the initiative the measure will take the form of a non binding resolution h res 109 that will call on lawmakers to support several goals for the u s to meet in the next decade these goals include meeting 100 percent of power demand from zero emissions energy sources it also calls for new projects to modernize u s transportation infrastructure de carbonize the manufacturing and agricultural sectors make buildings and homes more energy efficient and increase land preservation the green new deal also aims to create an economic safety net for frontline communities that will be affected by a shift away from fossil fuel use the resolution sets out a list of several major projects that need to be completed fast these projects include upgrading virtually every home and building for energy efficiency building 100 percent greenhouse gas neutral power generation systems removing greenhouse gases from industry and agriculture and more representative ocasio cortez stated that she is planning to begin work immediately on green new deal legislation to flesh out the projects involved in the green new deal the approach does not appear to include a carbon tax or cap and trade in a summary of the resolution lawmakers state that e cannot simply tax gas and expect workers to figure out another way to get to work unless we ve first created a better more affordable option similarly cap and trade programs assume that existing or new markets can solve this problem for us on their own and that s simply not true the summary states that he door is not closed for market based incentives or a diverse array of policy levers to play a role in the green new deal but it would be a small role speaker pelosi names democratic members to house climate committee house speaker nancy pelosi d ca on february 7 2019 named eight democrats to the new select committee on climate change the democratic members are ben ray luján nm suzanne bonamici or julia brownley ca sean casten il jared huffman ca mike levin ca donald mceachin va and joseph neguse co this

accord mr huffman serves on the newly reconstituted house select committee on climate change representative brian fitzpatrick of pennsylvania was the sole republican joining ranks with the more than 50 house democrats co sponsoring the resolution mr fitzpatrick is a leader of the bipartisan climate solutions caucus mr fitzpatrick is also the co sponsor of a carbon tax bill all countries of the world except the u s under the trump administration have committed to the paris agreement under which nations set their own nonbinding targets for reducing carbon emissions trump argued the u s committed too much compared with other countries and withdrew the u s plan which the obama administration submitted in 2015 set the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent by 2025 house resolution would vacate osha recordkeeping rule representative andy levin d mi on february 8 2019 introduced a resolution to vacate a recent osha final rule easing recordkeeping

notify the public no more than 30 days after it learns that the new standards have been violated the expanding transparency of information and safeguarding toxics eto is toxic act of 2019 s 458 h r 1152 would close existing loopholes that both benefit the chemical industry and allow the epa to do nothing if a risk assessment they conduct finds that a chemical is more harmful than previously thought in addition the bill increases transparency data and public health requirements for chemicals that may present a public health risk the durbin schneider bill would require epa to revise its caa eo emissions standards for commercial sterilization and miscellaneous organic manufacturing no more than 180 days after enactment base this revision off of the best available science including epa s most recent integrated risk information system iris assessment notify the public of a violation involving eo no later than 30 days after the administrator learns of a violation of the new revised standards and require an investigation by the epa inspector general if the administrator fails to notify the public of a violation within 30 days the eto is toxic act would require epa to notify congress state and local public health departments and local communities when public health risks are uncovered publish a list of sites that require additional review when an exposure risk is determined and bring direction and intention to the chemical review process between epa and the agency for toxic substances disease registry atsdr in addition the bill would improve the iris review of chemicals and ensure iris reviews and national air toxic assessments nata are expeditiously published and made accessible to state and local health agencies other federal agencies and international

as we watch a us backed coup unfold in a distant country as in venezuela today our eyes are drawn to the diplomatic military and economic elements of the us campaign the picture of a scowling john bolton with a big yellow notepad with the message 5 000 troops to colombia reveals the diplomatic and military elements the new york times headline u s sanctions are aimed at venezuela s oil its citizens may suffer first reveals the economic element but us foreign policy mobilizes every available resource for regime change and for counterinsurgency among those resources you will always find academics the pen may not always be mightier than the sword but behind every us backed war on a foreign people there will be a body of scholarly work the academic laboratory of the venezuelan coup has the highest academic pedigree of all it s housed at harvard under the auspices of the university s center for international development the venezuela project of the harvard growth lab there are growth labs for other countries as well including india and sri lanka is full of academic heavyweights including lawrence summers who once famously argued that africa was underpolluted among the leaders of the growth lab is ricardo hausmann now an adviser to juan guaido who has already drafted a plan to rebuild the nation from economy to energy in an interview with bloomberg surveillance hausmann was asked who would be there to rebuild venezuela after the coup the imf the world bank hausmann replied around minute 20 we have been in touch with all of them i have been working for three years on a morning after plan for venezuela the hosts interrupted him before he could get into detail but the interview concluded that bringing back the wonderful venezuela of old for investors would necessitate international financial support never mind that the wonderful venezuela of old was maintained through a corrupt compact between two ruling parties called punto fijo and the imprisonment and torture of political opponents amply documented but forgotten by those who accuse maduro of the same crimes the growth lab website provides some other ideas of what hausmann s plan likely includes chavez s literacy health care and food subsidy missions a growth lab paper argues have not reduced poverty and implicitly should go another paper argues that the underperformance of the venezuelan oil industry was due to the country s lack of appeal to foreign investors hence venezuela should implicitly be made more appealing to this all important group a third paper argues that weak property rights and the flawed functioning of markets are harming the business environment no doubt strengthening property rights and getting those markets functioning again will be in the plan if this sounds like the same kind of neoliberal prescription that devastated latin american countries for generations and was imposed and maintained through torture and dictatorship from chile and brazil to venezuela itself that is because the motivation is to bring back the wonderful venezuela of old a wall street journal article by bob davis from 2005 credits hausmann with being part of the original washington consensus in 1989 the economic manifesto identified government as a roadblock to prosperity and called for dismantling trade barriers eliminating budget deficits selling off state owned industries and opening latin nations to foreign investment but before returning to the neoliberal prescription hausmann experimented with different economic ideas including some heresies if the wsj article is to be believed hausmann looked at the data on latin american economic growth decades later and found deep reforms lousy growth and concluded that there must be something wrong with the theories of growth hausmann s academic work is highly technical macroeconomic modeling the models reveal the consequences of the assumptions used to construct them at times there is some data fit to them others are applied mathematics exercises a paper on 2005 growth accelerations looks for periods when countries economies grew quickly an earlier paper from 2002 presents a roundabout argument on the so called resource curse in which oil dependent economies like venezuela suffer poor developmental performance arguing at that time that more interventionist policies to subsidize investment in the non tradable sector may also have a role to play but whether it was written by hausmann or not the economic plan of guaido s post coup government has no such heterodox ideas in it however it is difficult to imagine hausmann or guaido going against bolton who told fox news that it will make a big difference to the united states economically if we could have american oil companies invest in and produce the oil capabilities in venezuela the post coup venezuelan economy will not be all about mathematically rigorous experiments in economic growth like hausmann s academic work it will be about the privatization of venezuela s assets hausmann might have a long and ideologically winding record of publishing models of economic growth but he has maintained a passion for regime change in venezuela for more than a decade even at the expense of academic integrity after the venezuelan opposition failed to oust chavez in a coup in 2002 and failed again to oust him using a strike of the venezuelan oil company in 2003 they resorted to constitutional means a recall referendum in 2004 voters overwhelmingly rejected the recall in the referendum which featured then new electoral machines that did an electronic tally verified by printed ballots still the system used in venezuela and praised by former us president jimmy carter in 2012 as the best in the world and was overseen by numerous international observers including the carter center but hausmann prepared a highly dubious statistical analysis to cast doubt on the outcome hausmann s dubious statistics were cited numerous times more may have been made of them had they not been thoroughly discredited by the us based center for economic and policy research cepr mark weisbrot of cepr summarized the episode in a 2008 report the political impact of economic and econometric research on venezuela can be very significant for example in 2004 economists ricardo hausmann of harvard s kennedy school a former minister of planning of venezuela and roberto rigobon of mit published a paper purporting to show econometric evidence of electronic fraud in the 2004 presidential recall referendum the theory of the fraud was implausible in the extreme the statistical analysis was seriously flawed and the election was observed and certified by the carter center and the organization of american states nonetheless this paper had a substantial impact together with faked exit polls by mark penn s polling firm of penn schoen and berland which purported to show the recall succeeding by a 60 40 margin the mirror image of the vote count it became one of the main pieces of evidence that convinced the venezuelan opposition that the elections were fraudulent on this basis they went on to boycott the 2005 congressional elections and consequently are without representation in the national assembly the influence of this hausmann and rigobon study would probably have been much greater but cepr refuted it and then the carter center followed with an independent panel of statisticians that also examined these allegations and found them to be without evidence nonetheless the wall street journal and other mostly latin american publications used the study to claim that the elections were stolen conspiracy theories about venezuelan elections continue to be widely held in venezuela and are still promoted by prominent people in major media sources such as newsweek even with regard to the recent constitutional referendum of december 2 2007 hausmann s 2004 statistical gambit is actually an established part of the us coup playbook the academic analysis of an election and the finding of flaws real or imagined in an electoral process are the beginning of an ongoing claim against the target s democratic legitimacy the created flaw is then repeated and emphasized even if it was spurious and debunked as was hausmann s 2004 analysis it can continue to perform in media campaigns against the target after years of such repetition the target can safely be called a dictator in western media even if the dictator has more electoral legitimacy than most western politicians the elected president of haiti jean bertrand aristide was overthrown in a us backed coup in 2004 haiti s hausmann was an academic named james morrell after aristide won reelection in 2001 in a landslide he stood poised to make major legislative moves on behalf of the country s poor majority morrell published an article about how aristide had snatched defeat from the jaws of victory because of irregularities in the election of eight senators out of 19 18 of which were won by candidates from aristide s party only the votes of the top four candidates in the senatorial elections were counted for these senate seats these senators would have won regardless of the methodology used but these supposed irregularities were enough to initiate the financial punishment of aristide s government the suspension of inter american development bank iadb financing to the tune of 150 million all eight senators were made to vacate their seats but the iadb never provided the loan morrell s article played a key role as the intellectual backing for the attack on the aristide government s legitimacy despite aristide s overwhelming victory in the 2001 election and the contrived nature of the irregularities in the senate seats the coup against aristide unfolded over a period of years economic warfare paramilitary violence and the eventual kidnapping of aristide from the palace were the tactics of choice in that regime change but the academics preceded the coup and followed it providing justifications and obfuscations of what was happening in the post coup counterinsurgency violence latin american social violence has even longer running academic underpinnings today colombia s president iván duque the protégé of the previous warlord president álvaro uribe vélez leads the call for regime change in venezuela duque s country was reshaped by a multigenerational civil war during which the countryside was depopulated through paramilitary violence of millions of peasants many of them afro colombian or indigenous the academic theorist behind this was the canadian born us new dealer lauchlin currie whose theory summarized by academic james brittain in a 2005 article called accelerated development was that the displacement of rural populations from the countryside and their relocation to the urban industrial centers would generate agricultural growth and technological improvements for colombia s economy currie implemented these ideas as the director of the foreign mission of the world bank from 1950 and as adviser to successive colombian presidents today colombia continues to suffer from currie s academic theories despite the peace deal of 2016 it has the largest internally displaced population in the hemisphere john maynard keynes wrote that practical men who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influence are usually the slaves of some defunct economist madmen in authority who hear voices in the air are distilling their frenzy from some academic scribbler of a few years back as max blumenthal and ben norton show in their article about him guaido is just such a practical man a us foundation funded street fighter for the rich neighborhoods of caracas but he certainly has use of the academic scribblers gathered at harvard when it comes to suppressing the people of latin america in their hopes to control their own fortunes and their own resources the scribblers have a key role to play as much as their diplomatic and military counterparts justin podur is a toronto based writer you can find him on his website at podur org and on twitter justinpodur he teaches at york university in the faculty of environmental studies this article was produced by globetrotter a project of the independent media institute

on jan 10 2019 the team behind a national cryptocurrency for the republic of the marshall islands rmi dubbed the sovereign sov revealed that the coin is still being actively developed despite previous disagreements among government officials as well as reservations expressed by the international monetary fund imf and the united states treasury department on the subject the idea behind the sov project lies in the rmi government s pursuance of manifesting our national liberty as well as the creation of an alternative state currency to the u s dollar which the small island nation has been using for decades behind the scenes of the decision to issue a national crypto the republic of the marshall islands is an island country located near the equator in the pacific ocean and consists of 29 atolls and five individual islands amounting to about 1 225 islands for a period of 40 years the country had been administered by the u s as part of the trust territory of the pacific islands attaining independence in 1986 under the compact of free association currently the marshall islands uses the u s dollar as its official currency and is highly dependent on receiving and spending u s grants totalling around 70 million each year in assistance in accordance with the compact once issued the sov will circulate alongside the dollar thus the marshall islands will have two coexisting legal tenders for all debts public charges taxes and dues the sovereign was first introduced in february 2018 when the parliament of the marshall islands passed a law declaring its new national digital currency set to be released through an initial coin offering ico with an initial total amount of 24 million units in order to avoid inflation some cash raised from the ico will purportedly go toward health care for the country s roughly 53 000 citizens who fell victim to the consequences of nuclear testing by the u s in the past the president of the rmi hilda c heine said then that this is a historic moment for our people finally issuing and using our own currency alongside the usd it is another step of manifesting our national liberty to implement the sov initiative the rmi government partnered with israeli fintech startup neema neema ceo barak ben ezer told the press that this cryptocurrency the sovereign is completely decentralized and the government cannot control the money supply after the they don t have any control over the currency peter dittus chief economist and co founder of sov global and former secretary general of the bank for international settlements told cointelegraph that the decision to develop a national digital currency and not a fiat one is backed by several reasons according to dittus developing countries such as the rmi struggle with the high costs of remittances and having a crypto legal tender creates a situation where the solution to costly remittance is baked into the monetary system itself additionally a central bank managed fiat currency is costly to implement and to run wherein for a small country the costs clearly outweigh the benefits sov s further development is challenged by the imf and the u s treasury department however later in september the international monetary fund imf raised doubts about the issuance of sov claiming that the potential benefits from revenue gains appear considerably smaller than the potential costs arising from economic reputational aml cft and governance risks the imf further warned the marshallese authorities against adopting of cryptocurrency stating that it will pose risks to the country s financial integrity as well as relationships with foreign banks the regulator urged the rmi to reconsider issuing a cryptocurrency until the government is able to provide and implement strong policy frameworks dittus revealed that sov will differ from most digital currencies as it will have measures built in to discourage misuse outlining the need to closely cooperate with regulators financial institutions and exchanges to ensure that know your customer rules are well implemented and that aml features cannot be circumvented this will purportedly allow the rmi to develop new capacities in governance and facilitate a wider adoption of the technology within the country speaking about possible instability in the country s financial system caused by cryptocurrency s volatile nature dittus said that it is planned to establish a bank of sov in the rmi which will help provide sov related services to the other banks hedging the exposure and facilitating transactions dittus however added on a fundamental level there is no guarantee of banks or the government to provide conversion between sov and the usd at a fixed rate thereby limiting financial instability heine administration s plan to issue a state cryptocurrency sparks political instability despite perceived advantages of the concept behind a national digital currency rmi president heine faced a vote of no confidence in november in connection to her administration s plans to implement sov the vote was introduced by a group of eight senators and former president casten nemra stated that the plans of establishing a digital currency as legal tender had a negative impact on the reputation of the country also endorsing the arguments put forward by the imf and the u s treasury department six days later it was reported that heine survived the no confidence vote with the marshallese parliament reportedly splitting 16 16 just one vote short of the number needed to prompt heine to resign the office of president rmi finance minister brenson wase declared the government would move forward with sov and is waiting to fulfill requirements from the imf the u s and europe commenting on the situation dittus stressed the imf has endorsed cdbcs and its managing director christine lagarde has highlighted the potential benefits in particular for smaller economies but so far there have not been implementations of sovereign cryptocurrencies the marshall islands has been the first state to declare one as legal tender the challenge is now to make it a reality and that is highly motivating the sov team further revealed that it had made significant progress in finding partners investors and developers to realize the project and aims to launch sov in 2019 the project also announced a new partnership with smart banknotes firm tangem a startup operating from switzerland and singapore while the initiative has been receiving criticism from major financial organizations and government officials the sov team seems to be confident with the viability of the idea behind national digital currency and its impact on the country s further development dittus also unveiled the possibility of introducing a stablecoin variant at a later stage and added

satisfy your debt the education department can also withhold federal benefits like tax returns and social security payments garnishment is an effective tool to recoup unpaid loans private collection agencies enlisted by the education department took in over 841 6 million via wage garnishment in the 2018 fiscal year but it inflicts serious financial strain on borrowers who are already struggling ap photo elise amendola file american education policy is guided by two disparate forces expanding access to higher education and privatizing the costs of that access the policy platform of president trump and education secretary betsy devos has given for profit higher education institutions new hope by reversing protections implemented by the obama administration changes that would enable many for profit colleges to again profit at the expense of students and taxpayers broadening access helps historically under served students the poor minorities single women veterans etc privatizing access has exploded the growth of government provided loans now totaling 1 5 trillion with a disproportionate amount going to for profit institutions as the principal source of their revenue there are 45 million student loan borrowers with an average debt of 27 975 making this the second leading category of private debt in the u s also troubling 16 9 percent of these borrowers are either delinquent or in default for profit institutions have significantly higher default rates than students from public or nonprofit colleges this debt crosses all socioeconomic racial gender and age demographics leaving many in financial ruin student loan debt inhibits economic growth by reducing aggregate expenditures leaving many millennials unable to purchase homes fortunately utah has the lowest debt per graduate in the nation at 7 545 compared to the highest at 27 167 for new hampshire the 2012 senate harkin report on for profit colleges documented exorbitant tuition and predatory recruiting practices regulatory evasion and manipulation and abysmal outcomes in students attaining gainful employment for profits spend on average 23 percent of revenues on marketing exceeding the amounts spent on instruction the harkin report further noted that 54 percent of students dropped out without a degree or certificate those who graduated left with higher student loan debt higher loan defaults failed licensing exams and no job in their area of study more recently a 2016 report by treasury department economist nicholas turner and george washington university economist stephanie cellini concluded that overall for profit colleges leave students worse off the 2017 student loan report noted an average default rate for for profit colleges of 15 percent public colleges 11 percent and private non profit colleges 7 percent of the 43 colleges in utah five are non profit eight are public and 30 are for profit utah for profits default on average 11 28 percent public 8 39 percent and

interests of students and taxpayers requires regulatory reform stringently enforce the 90 10 rule and consider returning to the 85 15 rule the 90 10 rule limits an institution s revenue from federal aid to 90 percent 99 7 percent of four year public colleges 95 5 percent four year nonprofits and 84 7 percent of for profits are compliant with this rule also include veterans benefits that support education in the 90 10 calculation require the collection of comprehensive student outcome information as the centers for medicare and medicaid does with hospitals establish uniform and accurate methods for tracking job placement rates prohibit institutions from using federal aid dollars to advertise develop a more rigorous accreditation system as a gatekeeper for determining institutional eligibility to federal financial aid variance in quality and outcomes in the health care sector is much smaller than in higher ed why because the oversight and regulatory structure for health care is significantly more consistent and rigorous than higher ed the department of education recognizes more than 60 institutional and programmatic accrediting commissions covering all types of institutions health care has three institutional accreditors with one primary accreditor the joint commission which accredits nearly 21 000 health care organizations and programs as susan dynarski a professor at the university of michigan notes in the hospital industry there are at least clear standards that all institutions including for profits must follow regulation and oversight of colleges is far weaker than this in an environment where students increasingly assume responsibility for funding their education and where the federal government often pays for substandard education protecting both students and taxpayers requires a less opaque and more consistent system of regulatory oversight reducing the number of authorized accreditors is key to ensuring more consistent measurements of quality and student learning all institutions should be accountable to the students they serve the point of government funded student loans should not be to enrich a few but to provide students well paying jobs

this is the second article in an occasional series exploring wealth and income inequality in connecticut and its impact on a state struggling to cope with massive debt read the first article here when hartford mayor luke bronin appealed for help to save his municipality from bankruptcy one response he faced was that the capital city s big spending ways had come home to roost the perception that connecticut s cities facing struggling schools poverty crime and heavily traveled roads easily outspend their suburban and rural neighbors can be found both around the capital city and elsewhere in the state but when municipal spending is examined on a per capita basis it s connecticut s suburbs and particularly those in fairfield county that lead the way in spending rather than a greater need for government services it is the availability of wealth tax reform advocates say that determines which communities will spend the most more importantly shrinking state aid a lack of revenue diversity and an over reliance on a regressive property tax system threaten to widen tremendous disparities that already exist between connecticut s poorest and richest communities we re creating social pathologies in connecticut said university of connecticut economist fred carstensen by spending so little in the cities it forces you to reallocate toward police and social services rather than investing in your future that means less effectiveness in education how do we attract job growth into the city when you re already fighting with a hand behind your back because you have a higher mill rate than your surrounding towns you have less services than your surrounding towns you have a higher crime rate than your surrounding towns asked rep steven j stafstrom d bridgeport suburbs lead the

than in many other fairfield county towns marpe said these are sophisticated people he added many come from private school backgrounds and they consider our public schools here equal or better the

with remedial needs but also for those who need to reach beyond the rest of the class just to be challenged marpe said a 2015 analysis of municipal spending by the yankee institute a hartford based conservative policy group concluded many fairfield county towns budgets devote above average resources to retirement benefits this is not surprising since marpe said the town pays good salaries to ensure not only high quality teachers but also police firefighters recreation and other municipal staff the town also began in recent years to save more for retirement health care benefits and its pension fund holds enough assets to cover 90 percent of its liabilities but westport doesn t get much help from the state despite the fact that it pays more connecticut income taxes per capita than just about any other community according to the department of revenue services westport paid 17 516 per capita in 2016 fourth out of 169 cities and towns while bridgeport ranked last at 1 029 rep jonathan steinberg d westport who has been outspoken about connecticut s needs to invest in its cities said legislators also need to realize most of fairfield county has a one way relationship with state government state rep jonathan steinberg the suburbs are unfairly looked at as hard hearted fairfield county pays a majority of state taxes and receives the smallest share of government assistance back we do it every year willingly he said the suburbs are unfairly looked at as hard hearted only about 1 percent of westport s annual budget is supported by state aid with the rest coming from local taxes and fees and marpe said the latter plays a key role the town relies on user fees to fund key amenities like the longshore club park golf course and compo beach it also uses those fees to shield the popular beach from out of towners the summer beach season parking pass costs 50 for westport residents 375 for residents of neighboring weston and 775 for anyone else frank accardi a

new jersey 2 1 2 years ago after her husband died she had always visited an aunt and cousins in town as a child and remembers it fondly i love it here she said as i walk by people say hi i ve met so many wonderful friends here we say this place is magical tammy roseboro moved to bridgeport from west queens seven years ago with four of her six children and a similar goal finding happiness but unlike dombrowski roseboro doesn t see bridgeport s p t barnum apartments a public housing project that lies alongside a sewage treatment facility and an asphalt plant as a long term stop i know i m not going to stay in the projects that s for sure roseboro said i don t want to stay this setting it takes a lot out of you it makes you fight because you feel like you have to fight because you re not getting what you re supposed to be getting roseboro who works as a school bus driver said battling for her children also means fighting for their education in a district with limited resources and no academic support what can you do to make sure they complete high school for one to graduate on time and can they read on a good level roseboro asked the school system is horrible differences in services and not just those in connecticut s schools are tied in large part to wealth wealth not need drives local spending the new england public policy center the research arm of the federal reserve bank of boston issued a may 2015 report that attempted to calculate the municipal gap the difference between the public services a city or town absolutely must provide and the resources available to pay for them our results show large non school fiscal disparities across cities and towns in connecticut the report states these disparities are driven primarily by differences in revenue raising capacity not surprisingly the largest spending towns in 2016 also were those that had the largest equalized net grand list per capita according to opm data in other words those that had the most taxable wealth spent the most the top four communities in per capita grand list rankings greenwich darien new canaan and westport also were among the top six in spending their per capita grand lists topped the statewide average of 165 582 by anywhere from 260 percent westport to 385 percent greenwich of the 25 distressed communities none were in the top half of grand list wealth and only north canaan 89 was within the top 130 hartford waterbury windham and new britain ranked 166th through 169th respectively the per capita grand lists for all distressed communities were anywhere from 20 percent below the statewide average north canaan to 70 percent new britain is the pilot program breaking down when bronin began visiting hartford suburbs in the winter of 2016 17 his appeal for help went beyond citing the city s high poverty rate and the huge bonded debt amassed by past administrations while bronin conceded past administrations erred by postponing debt payments he said hartford s main problem lies not with poor management but rather with simple math hartford already saddled with a 74 29 mill commercial tax rate cannot tax 51 percent of its property value hospitals universities an airport a trash to energy plant the capitol and numerous other state offices and facilities all serve the region yet make no local tax payments and while connecticut s other major cities lack the state office buildings hartford has they also are home to more hospitals universities colleges and other exempt properties that provide regional benefits sometimes this argument fell on deaf ears why should we support a city who s spending money like drunken sailors andrew pulvermacher a small business owner asked bronin when he visited rocky hill in december 2016 but hartford not only failed to lead the state in per capita spending it didn t even top the region in 2016 slightly trailing local suburbs like glastonbury and avon despite having significantly higher demand for many services part of the problem is that connecticut s method for compensating cities that are home to tax exempt regional assets is slipping connecticut has had some form of pilot payment in lieu of taxes grant since 1935 and the current system of reimbursement largely was developed in 1969 and 1978 with some revisions afterward but since the last recession ended in 2009 legislatures and governors have carved out exceptions and paid less as they grappled with skyrocketing pension and other debt costs run up over decades by the state in statute pilot grants are supposed to replace about 45 percent of the funds communities lose because they can t tax state property in 2010 communities got 74 million or just 28 percent of the 264 million they lost on state property according to the connecticut conference of municipalities that ratio steadily has been reduced and this fiscal year cities and towns received just 50 3 million or 14 percent of the 356 2 million they couldn t collect similarly the grants designed to replace 77 percent of taxes lost on colleges and hospitals also have been whittled down municipalities received 115 million or 43 percent of the 271 million they couldn t collect from colleges and hospitals in 2010 by this fiscal year communities got 98 million or 23 percent of 432 million in lost tax revenue many hartford officials and its legislators say this erosion was the single biggest factor that pushed the city to the brink of insolvency averted only this past winter with a state bailout we have to take a deeper dive into how we finance and support our cities rep brandon mcgee d hartford said adding that absent a re evaluation of pilot the capital likely won t be the last city to seek assistance over the past year legislators have said bridgeport west haven and scotland a small rural town in windham county were slipping closer to trouble though not insolvent if you look at the existing grants that we have for cities we don t even maintain the formula any more said rep toni e walker d new haven longtime house chairwoman of the appropriations committee we ve got to keep in mind who has the capacity to raise revenue and who doesn t malloy tried to redistribute education aid gov dannel p malloy challenged legislators for much of 2017 to redistribute education aid further to favor poorer school districts but ran into heavy opposition for multiple reasons some liberals in the legislature didn t like the governor s plans because they didn t go far enough but to dedicate extra resources to poorer communities while minimizing or avoiding cuts to the wealthy probably would have required another state tax increase after major tax hikes in 2011 and 2015 malloy wasn t interested in a third and a majority of the legislature agreed since there wouldn t be significantly more money to spend the governor wanted to apportion the 2 billion education cost sharing grant differently instead of dedicating two thirds of the funds to the 30 lowest performing school districts which also happen to be some of the poorest malloy wanted to up the ratio to 78 percent and the 31 wealthiest districts would get nothing the state s education cost sharing formula for years has been the target of critics who argue it has not moved school districts sufficiently close to equality in spending for example most fairfield county suburbs spend more per pupil than do connecticut s four largest cities bridgeport new haven hartford and waterbury according to the nonprofit connecticut school finance project darien greenwich new canaan weston westport and wilton each spend at least 40 percent more than bridgeport s per pupil expenditure of 14 164 but many rural and suburban lawmakers particularly from more affluent communities balked at malloy s plan in his annual budget address in february 2017 the governor described connecticut s method of funding education as a broken disparate system where towns are pitted against one another and where their state government has yet to build the kind of world class education system necessary for growing a new generation of workers two days before that speech malloy had put things in blunter terms during a press event at a new britain elementary school we are failing children because their parents are poor he said after a historic nine month budget debate and a veto by malloy legislators enacted a plan that moved the needle only slightly in terms of education aid and wealth they adopted roughly the same 30 million cut to education funding that malloy had proposed a total of 33 poor cities and towns were held harmless while the other 136 municipalities shared a 31 million reduction a cut senate republican leader len fasano of north haven called absorbable and no community lost its education grant entirely this is not going to pull the rug out from these smaller districts said senate majority leader bob duff d norwalk in an interview last october shortly after the budget had been adopted the governor also tried to shift one third of the state s required contributions to the teachers pension fund onto cities and towns this is projected to be one of the fastest rising major expenses in the state budget for another 10 to 15 years as connecticut makes up for more than seven decades of inadequate contributions municipal leaders quickly realized they would be on the hook for 400 million in the first year and based on some projections more than 2 billion per year by the early 2030s how would this many local leaders asked help to equalize education funding jessica otero teaches english language learners at diloreto elementary middle school in new britain credit jacqueline rabe thomas www ctmirror org to make his point the governor contrasted one of the state s most affluent communities greenwich with one of its poorest new britain both have similar populations and school enrollment totals but connecticut spent 24 million more last year to cover pension costs for retired greenwich teachers than for those from new britain in simple terms greenwich can afford to pay much higher salaries than new britain can leading to much larger pensions for greenwich s retired teachers so under the governor s plan greenwich would have to pick up more of the state s pension burdens on a per teacher basis than new britain would but while the governor saw it as a move toward equality it drew opposition from across the spectrum legislators from wealthy communities said teacher pension costs always had been a state responsibility and should remain so those from middle income and poor municipalities said getting a new bill albeit at proportionately lower rates than wealthy communities were facing was not the step toward equality they were looking for property tax reform is key still the stakes are huge because there are plenty of signs indicating connecticut s method of funding services at the local level particularly within cities is failing state government s first tax incidence report released in december 2014 helped to confirm what numerous legislators governors and local officials long have asserted that the property tax is connecticut s most regressive levy and one that hits hardest in urban centers a tax incidence report studies which groups effectively pay taxes and how those burdens are shifted for example families and individuals that rent their housing effectively pay property taxes that their landlords built into the monthly rent among the key findings of the report were property taxes represent almost 45 percent of the total state and municipal tax burden households pay the poorest working households effectively pay a far greater share of their earnings to cover taxes than any other group for example the poorest 10 percent in connecticut households earning less than 48 000 per year effectively spend 23 6 percent of their income on state and local taxes the next decile those earning 47 949 to 74 427 paid 13 9 percent of their income effectively to cover state and local taxes the 287 630 to 612 040 bracket was down to single digits paying 9 percent and those in next bracket 612 041 to 2 019 383 effectively pay 7 7 percent in state and local taxes a state commission empowered to study tax burdens fractured over the issue of property taxes during the final months of 2015 nearly half of the state tax panel argued it could not complete its charge to assess tax burdens in connecticut without analyzing property taxes especially in light of the tax incidence analysis but others responded that the panel s charge was limited to studying taxes imposed directly by the state the panel was established through a bipartisan compromise among legislators who stipulated all panel recommendations had to be revenue neutral in other words if the group suggested increasing one state tax it had to recommend an offsetting tax cut of equal value so how could any proposals involving municipal property taxes work within that system leaders of the panel asked anita singh lemar a clinical associate professor at yale law school was among the panel members who protested loudly about that exclusion the property tax has gotten short shrift lemar said during the panel s final meeting in december 2015 we ve ignored an enormous problem of inequity and inefficiency she teaches at the community and economic development clinic which provides legal services for affordable housing developers community development financial institutions and neighborhood associations two legislators from different ends of the wealth spectrum agreed connecticut must solve its urban crisis if the overall state economy is going to thrive there s no logic in the state s approach right now new haven s walker said the cities really are the engines of the economy they have the jobs connecticut lacks the organic relationship between city and suburb that exists in other parts of the country steinberg said there is not that sense of shared responsibility which is too bad we have the data we know what the problem is i think we all recognize that one of the greatest challenges that connecticut has is we have a broken taxing policy at the local level said joe delong executive director of the connecticut conference of municipalities a one size fits all approach does not work the general assembly should be representing the entire state but it operates in a far more parochial manner than our municipal ceos do studies like the new england public policy center report analyses by ccm and other groups all have stressed the need to give cities and towns new sources of revenue besides the property tax connecticut has tried twice in the past seven years to dedicate a significant portion of sales tax receipts to municipalities but both initiatives largely were repealed within a few years of enactment as pressures on the state budget increases the challenge steinberg said is for the legislature and governor to commit to property tax reform at the same time they try to catch up on decades of unmade pension contributions we have to get rid of this attitude that i m an individual not part of a community walker added we all thrive together or we all fail together future elements of this issue we plan to explore how wealth and income inequality galvanize the racial divide in connecticut the struggles of connecticut s poor and middle income families to preserve access to quality education health care and social services the debate over raising tax rates on rich households and major corporations amid fears of an accelerating wealth exodus from connecticut the competing theories of how the state should resolve massive public sector pension obligations and other debts
another government shutdown would be bad and not just for the havoc it could wreak on air travel tax refunds and the finances of hundreds of thousands of federal workers and contractors when the unprecedented 35 day long partial government shutdown ended on jan 25 with a three week reprieve political and economic analysts were optimistic that history would not repeat itself with a second shutdown the assumption was that the costs both political and economic would be too great it is difficult to imagine that lawmakers would allow another government shutdown given the political damage the last one did but if they do then this time there will also be serious economic damage said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics but with negotiations seemingly stalled as of monday investors once again were forced to contemplate the prospect of a shutdown that could leave the american economy in uncharted territory despite the fact that the shutdowns are indicative of a broken process the impacts on the broader economy are fairly small said mark hamrick senior economic analyst at bankrate com elected officials in washington haven t given constituents much reason or evidence to inspire confidence but investors have tended to look past the shutdown episodes as essentially temporary this could change though if history repeats itself shutting down the government again would undermine the already fragile collective psyche zandi warned it is difficult to imagine that lawmakers would allow another government shutdown given the political damage the last one did but if they do then this time there will also be serious economic damage a new cnbc surveymonkey small business survey found that the number of small business owners who characterize current conditions as good fell by 3 percentage points as did the overall index respondents who support president donald trump though exhibited a greater drop in optimism confidence levels are off their peak from 2018 and recent market volatility and political uncertainty may have made them more fragile laura wronski senior research scientist at surveymonkey told cnbc wall street already has to worry about lower global growth and trade tensions with china and a shutdown would magnify its concerns about these other factors investors are clearly nervous and most business and consumer sentiment surveys show that confidence is flagging zandi said a renewed shutdown that continued into march might threaten programs such as food stamps which would have a more material effect on personal consumption said dominic white chief economist at absolute strategy in london a second shutdown also might mean that people will have to wait longer for their tax refunds which would not bode well for consumer confidence and spending ability no doubt the irs was dealt a setback by the first shutdown getting prepared for tax filing season hamrick said it isn t clear how a second shutdown would affect income tax filing but it certainly won t help with congressional leaders at loggerheads and no easy way out of the impasse in sight the bigger fear is that this brinkmanship could foreshadow far more serious dysfunction that lawmakers can t seem to keep the government open for very long doesn t augur well for the upcoming battle over raising the treasury debt limit zandi said each time we have approached the debt limit in recent years the closer lawmakers have gotten to breaching it in a jan 29 interview with cnn sen lindsey graham r s c a staunch trump supporter suggested that the white house s insistence on funding for a southern border wall could spill over into the already fraught issue of raising the debt ceiling my thought is while we re talking about all these things that are coming due pretty soon let s think bigger rather than smaller graham said conflating the two actually would be an extraordinarily risky move economists say this would be a catastrophic error as it would roil global financial markets resulting in meaningfully higher interest rates on treasury bonds and cost taxpayers for years if not decades to come zandi said the bigger risk really concerns the debt ceiling negotiations and the possibility of a technical default on treasury bills white said a sense that the government is lurching from one crisis to the next could undermine already shaky investor confidence he added financial markets still haven t fully gotten over december s volatility white said the current debt ceiling suspension expires march 1 after that the treasury department will need to undertake so called extraordinary measures to keep the country s bills paid it isn t clear for how long this strategy would work house ways and means committee chairman richard neal d mass sent treasury secretary steven mnuchin a letter last month requesting an update pointing out that corporate tax cuts and shutdown related delays at the irs could result in the treasury collecting less revenue than expected a smaller influx of funds would give the government a shorter window of time before it runs out of money if the president chooses to engage in brinkmanship on the debt limit as he did on the shutdown the market reaction and the cost to our economy would likely be far larger than the 0 02 reduction in gdp that attributed to the shutdown neal warned in his letter hamrick warned failing to raise the debt ceiling is a red line that they cannot cross or else risk a large threat to financial markets

help enlighten your fellows be sure to pass this on survival depends on it if voting made any difference they wouldn t let us do it mark twain what is the use of voting we know that the machines of both parties are subsidized by the same persons and therefore it is useless to turn in either direction woodrow wilson history reinforces the view that nothing can be expected from electoral politics in america and in most other countries of the world if change ever comes to our shores it cannot possibly be brought about by politics as usual many of my acquaintances and many writers in the alternative media put their faith in electoral politics they feel despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary that it makes a difference whether a republican or a democrat is elected that it makes sense to sue the government for one or another gross violation of the public interest or common decency they fail to notice that most of our presidents governors and mayors most of our elected representatives at the local state and federal levels most of our judges are puppets of the men in the shadows a few international banking families and their lieutenants in huge corporations governments armed forces and intelligence services others acquaintances a bit more sophisticated but still profoundly misinformed about the nature of american politics reject the corrupt two headed party system out of hand yet put their trust in the electoral process itself and in the ability of friends of the american people as opposed to the traitors swindlers sycophants and psychopaths who now infest most public offices of this land to gain political or judicial office and bring about meaningful change that trust is touching but it fails to acknowledge incontestable political realities to campaign for a ron paul or a bernie sanders or a donald trump or a eugene debs or jesus of nazareth himself in this system is counterproductive a few crystalline raindrops cannot disinfect a cesspool the reasons for this futility the reasons it is misguided in principle and perhaps even immoral to take part in electoral politics are many for the moment i can only offer a summary statement and some supporting documentation for the seven interacting factors there could be more but at this writing i can only think of seven that render electoral politics in america a sad joke for a more detailed review of the first three factors please consult this 1 information i am sure that i never read any memorable news in the newspaper henry david thoreau walden 1854 american journalism is a class institution serving the rich and spurning the poor upton sinclair the brass check 1919 almost all conventional sources of information schools universities think tanks books movies newspapers tv radio are under the thumb of the men in the shadows most of us therefore end up voting against our own convictions and interests for example in 1919 upton sinclair the brass check p 9 already sizzled the social body to which we belong is at this moment passing through one of the greatest crises of its history what if the nerves upon which we depend for knowledge of this social body should give us false reports of its condition many people put their trust in experts not realizing the centuries long dependence of academics and intellectuals on the bankers and their lieutenants arthur schopenhauer party interests are vehemently agitating the pens of so many pure lovers of wisdom truth is certainly the last thing they have in mind philosophy is misused from the side of the state as a tool from the other side as a means of gain who can really believe that truth also will thereby come to light just as a by product governments make of philosophy a means of serving their state interests and scholars make of it a trade this is even truer today and especially so when it comes to disciplines that directly affect the bankers as just one example an article in the mainstream press explains how the federal reserve bought the economics profession the federal reserve through its extensive network of consultants visiting scholars alumni and staff economists so thoroughly dominates the field of economics that real criticism of the central bank has become a career liability for members of the profession this dominance helps explain how even after the fed failed to foresee the greatest economic collapse since the great depression the central bank has largely escaped criticism from academic economists prof anatal fekete provides a less polite characterization the light has gone out at the great american universities as far as monetary science is concerned through bribe blackmail and attrition all upright and serious monetary economists were bumped from their academic chairs the great chinese cultural revolution was a picnic in comparison to the great american cultural revolution eliminating monetary economics from the curriculum i wish to make the point clear information nowadays is controlled everywhere and always for instance the bankers reserve to themselves the right of censoring all academic publishing not only in economics history or political science but also in the natural sciences under the guise of the referee system and here is another typical example this time from the strait jacketed world of children book publishing madeleine l engle looks back a wrinkle in time was almost never published you can t name a major publisher who didn t reject it and there were many reasons one was that it was supposedly too hard for children well my children were 7 10 and 12 while i was writing it i d read to them at night what i d written during the day and they d say ooh mother go back to the typewriter a wrinkle in time had a female protagonist in a science fiction book and that wasn t done and it dealt with evil and things that you don t find or didn t at that time in children s books when we d run through forty odd publishers my agent sent it back we gave up then my mother was visiting for christmas and i gave her a tea party for some of her old friends one of them happened to belong to a small writing group run by john farrar of farrar straus giroux which at that time did not have a juvenile list she insisted that i meet john any how and i went down with my battered manuscript john had read my first novel and liked

used to occasional outbursts on this issue please consult this source for countless quotations for instance in 1987 robert byrd then senate majority leader appealed to his colleagues it is my strong belief that the great majority of senators of both parties know that the current system of campaign financing is damaging the senate hurts their ability to be the best senator for this nation and for citizens of their respective states that they could be strains their family life by consuming even more time than their official responsibilities demand and destroys the democracy we all cherish by eroding public confidence in its integrity if we do not face a problem of this magnitude and fix it we have no one but ourselves to blame for the tragic results political scientists adamany and agree share that view political finance system undermines the ideals and hampers the performance of american democracy officials are captives of the present system their integrity and judgment are menaced and too often compromised by the need to raise money and the means now available for doing it the pattern of giving distorts american elections candidates win access to the electorate only if they can mobilize money from the upper classes established interest groups big givers or ideological zealots other alternatives have difficulty getting heard and the voters choice is thereby limited the pattern of giving also threatens the governmental process the contributions of big givers and interest groups award them access to officeholders so they can better plead their causes the private financing system distort both elections and decision making the equality of citizens on election day is diluted by their inequality in campaign financing the electorate shares its control of officials with the financial constituency a 2013 update pretty much every politician in the western world is basically an employee of the ruling class which is made up of a handful of traditionally powerful families including the rothschilds and rockefellers recommended starting reference pillars of american democracy sunshine bribery __________ 3 contemporary human failings we are not only indoctrinable but seem to enjoy being brainwashed how many of us abstain from commercials and tv we are not as open minded as we need to be nor do we readily surrender convictions in the face of overwhelming evidence against them more often than not we prefer obedience and conformity to individualism and critical thinking most of us lack the self confidence and perhaps the inborn taste to detect quality on our own in food architecture music drama paintings literature or politics the vast majority of the still reading public which is itself a small minority depends on the bankers for their choice of books instead of trusting their own tastes and proclivities many of us have accepted the bankers absurd self serving notion that crass materialism endless accumulation of money and power consumerism specialization and selfishness hold the keys to personal fulfillment these failings are magnified by the diminution probably deliberate of our very humanity our bodies nowadays are loaded with synthetic chemicals heavy metals e g mercury lead and radioactive substances our brains are loaded with thousands of commercials infomercials trivialities and lies it is no accident that the bankers facilitate prescription and illegal drug use in the usa for such use clearly serves their interests the bankers and their allies discourage us from ever getting even close to dissident literature classical music folk music critical or holistic thinking compassion and non conformity by getting us addicted to tv and artless movies through their control of the educational system and by doing everything they can to suppress the love of reading they even managed to diminish our vocabulary and thus our capacity to detect nuances of speech and thought consider thomas paine s 1776 pamphlet common sense according to wikipedia in relation to the population of the colonies at that time it had the largest sale and circulation of any book in american history could 1 of today s americans understand and be moved by such a pamphlet in just 239 years then there occurred a remarkable decline in the intellectual and spiritual caliber of the american people in short we are not as rational altruistic and compassionate as we should be on top of that the bankers have deliberately diminished our positive qualities and amplified our failings thus putting another nail in the coffin of our

countrymen once upon a time oligarchs kept such calumnies and strangulations below the surface following their masters niccolò machiavelli s and amschel rothschild s sage advice but now as befits the emerging in your face style oligarchy some of these atrocities are carried out in the open there is a common misconception in progressive circles that america had once been the land of the free and the home of the brave and that its decline only commenced with president reagan in reality what is happening in 2016 is merely a culmination of a centuries long gradual march towards fascism i have provided numerous examples of this here so for now let me give a couple of quotations from the past upton sinclair s self published the brass check 1919 there was a certain labor leader in america who was winning a great strike it was sought to bribe him in vain and filially a woman was sent after him a woman experienced in seduction and she lured this man into a hotel room and at one o clock in the morning the door was broken down and the labor leader was confronted with a newspaper story ready to be put on the press in a few minutes this man had a wife and children and had to choose between them and the strike he called off the strike and the union went to pieces this anecdote was told to me not by a socialist not by a labor agitator but by a well known united states official a prominent catholic i cite this to show the lengths to which big business will go in order to have its way in san francisco they raised a million dollar fund and with the help of their newspapers set to work deliberately to railroad five perfectly innocent labor men to the gallows in lawrence massachusetts the great woolen trust planted dynamite in the homes of strikebreakers and with the help of their newspapers sought to fasten this crime upon the union only by an accident were these conspirators exposed and all but the rich one brought to justice do you think that interests which would undertake such elaborate plots would stop at inventing and circulating scandal about their enemies most certainly they did this in denver i was assured by judge lindsey and by james randolph walker at that time chairman of denver s reform organization that the corporations of that city had a regular bureau for such work the head of it was a woman doctor provided with a large subsidy numerous agents and a regular card catalogue of her victims when someone was to be ruined she would invent a story which fitted as far as possible with the victim s character and habits and then some scheme would be devised to enable the newspapers to print the story without danger of libel suits in extreme cases they will go as far as they did with judge lindsey hiring perjured affidavits and getting up a fake reform organization to give them authority lindsey you understand has made his life work the founding of a children s court which shall work by love and not by terror love of children ah yes all scandal bureaus know what that means so they had a collection of affidavits accusing lindsey of sodomy they brought the charges while he was in the east a reporter went to the denver hotel where his young bride was staying and when she refused to see the reporter or to hear the charges against her husband the reporter stood in the hallway and shouted the charges to her through the transom and

was an election the people who cast the votes decide nothing the people who count the votes decide everything now that the bankers everywhere in the western world are ingeniously re introducing their version of stalinism following the same script in each and every country just to dispel any doubt about this being a coordinated attack the trojan horse in modern western elections is the counters themselves such outrageous rigging provides the bankers another safety valve and again makes a mockery of those who believe in electoral politics recommended starting reference palast greg election rigged for bush _________ 6 broken promises there is a vast gap between what a politician or a party promise before the elections and what they deliver after the elections woodrow wilson and franklin roosevelt for instance promised peace but once elected served the bankers and through guile false flag operations and propaganda led their country to catastrophic wars politicians lie and get away with it again making a mockery of the people s will and of ballot box reformers woodrow wilson s betrayal was perhaps the most disastrous of them all he not only dragged the american people to war against their will and on behalf of the bankers but also broke his campaign promises not to sell his country to the bankers during the democratic presidential campaign wilson and the rulers of the democratic party pretended to oppose the aldrich bill as representative louis t mcfadden explained twenty years later when he was chairman of the house banking and currency committee and before the bankers silenced him forever the aldrich bill was condemned in the platform when woodrow wilson was nominated the men who ruled the democratic party promised the people that if they were returned to power there would be no central bank established here while they held the reins of government thirteen months later that promise was broken and the wilson administration under the tutelage of those sinister wall street figures who stood behind colonel house established here in our free country the worm eaten monarchical institution of the king s bank to control us from the top downward and to shackle us from the cradle to the grave we may note in passing that to his credit wilson would later rue his betrayal i m a most unhappy man i have ruined my country a great industrial nation is now controlled by its system of credit we re no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men one additional supporting example obama s promise to end the neo colonization of iraq in another example john perkins documents the assassination threats blackmail and bribes used to turn decent elected officials into renegades _________ 7 co option the best way to control the opposition is to lead it lenin the men in the shadows often support phony dissident organizations e g the so called tea party in the usa or with their limitless supply of money they might infiltrate and achieve partial control of a formerly genuine reform organization e g the sierra club they are thus able to control their own opposition also an individual who discovers for the first time the sorrows of the biosphere might join say the wilderness society and might never realize that this suit and tie organization had sold out decades ago if s he uncovers the deception she might give up in disgust mistakenly believing that it is just human nature to deceive look out for number one and ignore long term perils and even if she manages to find her way to a grassroots environmental organization she might have only few years left to put her wisdom to good use this applies in particular to alternative media many of these accept commercials and thus are to a certain extent at someone else s beck and call other media have been created funded and sustained in order to throw confusion into the dissident camp they magnify certain issues which pose no threat to the bankers thus deflecting attention from more pressing issues e g who is behind the ongoing destruction of the middle class the ongoing syrian and palestinian genocides the uss liberty massacre and cover up pearl harbor uss maine 9 11 or the boston marathon explosions how in heaven s name did the rockefellers and rothschilds manage to exclude themselves from the list of the richest people in the world what is money is the rothschild rockefeller cartel doing god s work as it claims or satan s did this cartel accumulate its wealth and power honorably or by sleight of hand who really owns british petroleum monsanto and just about any giant western corporation these phony media and websites often accept the absurd contention that our rulers never ever engage in conspiracies relying on that standard absurd dismissal she is just a conspiracy theorist for them there is no point in investigating 9 11 for the simple reason that our rulers never plot in secret well yes the russians or the chinese or the romans might have but our lily white bankers conspiring are you out of your mind such sites often refer to bankers propaganda organs e g cnn msnbc fox wapo new york times and to government sources as legitimate interpreters of reality and again seekers of truth must laboriously sift through their contrivances before beginning to see the world as it is similarly one of the most spectacular achievements of the men in the shadows is their success in defining our leading dissidents even though these leading dissidents and intellectuals receive financial support from the deep state and are actively undermining the prospects of a revolution the only path that can save us now even though such dissidents are conspiracy scoffers even though such dissidents are not interested in meaningful change e g public central and state banks even though they have never risked anything for the cause of a better world they are still regarded as our best and brightest i m writing these words scarcely believing them myself my heart tells me that this is preposterous that there cannot possibly be people out there so vicious as to corrupt everything they touch and to deliberately diminish goodness health decency and kindness in this world but then my cortex takes over providing me with multiple proofs both personal and research based that these people do exist the existence and ascendancy of pure evil is no conjecture but fact there are people in this world who have enough ill gotten money to last them one thousand and one reincarnations of obscene physical comfort but yet give nothing absolutely nothing to help the thousands of children who will go blind this year because they can t afford 1 worth of vitamin a as if this is not enough these villains steal from these children the few centavos they do have and torture or kill them outright if they refuse to surrender these centavos a key step in planetary recovery is acknowledging the existence of evil its pervasiveness and its capacity to control human destinies mike krieger we must admit to ourselves that there are truly evil geniuses out there and in most cases these characters have taken control of the power structure corporations politics and factions of the military in most of the nations we reside in recommended starting reference 1 helvarg david 2004 the war against the greens 2 the co option pillar of american democracy part i why subvert the opposition _________ closing remarks electoral participation in any way shape or form is counter productive because it helps foster the facade of participatory democracy and the belief that piecemeal reform is possible also as long as we accept the bankers myth that the system can be changed peacefully from within the bankers and the system are safe some of our best people take part in this charade either as candidates or supporters deluding themselves that anything at all can come from their electoral toil imagine all that energy and good will channeled into a strategy that could possibly work electoral politics cannot work for many reasons to begin with how can we tell whether our champion is indeed our champion how do we know that she would prefer probable death by saying no to the bankers to joining the fairly exclusive multimillionaire club by saying yes what guarantees do the people have that she will not break every single promise the vast majority of gullible voters would believe that she is their enemy and that the bankers and weaponeers marionette is their friend she cannot effect change because bankers can steal and print as much money as they want which they can give to her opponents in the very unlikely event that she survives all this and becomes a threat to the bankers they will crucify her in their media threaten her offer her bribes slander her arrest her on false charges and keep her naked and humiliated without trial in solitary confinement in a freezing cold filthy noisy cubicle in the still more unlikely event that she actually receives a majority of the votes they will doctor the results if she miraculously manages to overcome all this and if nothing else works she will be impeached on false grounds suicided incinerated in the skies or roadways or poisoned she will waste time and money and never change anything even if she is sincere and courageous since the american people are too drugged and televised they will not be outraged by yet one more assassination and will accept the bankers version of events in cases that cannot be readily forgotten the bankers will establish a commission appoint its members and then proceed to ignore subsequent reports of even these carefully screened commissioners that the investigation was a cover up a hoax the vast majority would still do nothing when the bankers derisively reproduce the image of the people s murdered champion on their fiat money or highways in more general terms putting our hopes for freedom and for a better world in the process of electoral politics is fundamentally ill advised if not immoral we must grow up as the ancient athenians did or as the american revolutionaries did and provide for our own freedom and security our system is irreparably broken and must be overthrown one way or the other the contemporary ballot box is a bewitching siren a mirage a shibboleth a bankers trap
